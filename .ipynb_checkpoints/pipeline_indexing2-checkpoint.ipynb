       "   'document': 'Home » Indian » The difference between Rape, Sex and Love\\nSaturday, May 14, 2011\\nThe difference between Rape, Sex and Love\\nI was just rummaging through TV channels looking for some entertainment (obviously, I had not known the horrors of Indian television and obviously, now that I know, I won’t repeat it again) when I landed on a channel which showed some bizarre Bollywood movie (don’t ask me which, I am not yet subjected to such Bizarreness, crap, I don’t even know how to know which movie it was) which was portraying a court case of a rape victim.\\nThe verdict went on something like this, from the bits that I picked up, the man that had raped her stood shamelessly in front of the girl, while the girl hung her head low in shame opposite to him. Apart from bad acting, one other thing I noticed was grossly mis-interpreted version of a court case of a rape victim.\\nI am not familiar with the legal proceedings, but my question is, rape is the fundamental aggregation on the soul of the woman. Can you penalize the guilty? Can the person who committed the horrible crime be punished enough for the trauma the woman has to undergo in case of rape? Obviously you can’t.\\nAnother gross concept in the movie, which can be true, was the social pressure on the girl for not getting proper groom. Is our society so jobless that getting a groom for marriage is ultimate nirvana in life? Is there no other option available for you to do, like maybe get a life, get out of house, confident and brave and face the world out there and maybe fall in love again? Does the life ends with marriage? And yes does life ends with marriage before 25 years?\\nWhen a girl faces trauma like rape, abuse etc the first basic instinct is to shut up about it, else she won’t get a good groom or maybe she will be shamed in the society. This suppresses the feelings emerging out of the horror act and all the guilt, shame and anger get mixed up inside her and create her a hollow active volcano, ready for violent outburst. What is more important?\\nSaving the girl or punishing the guilty, we have to choose.\\nAgain who is guilty? The person who raped her? The person who condemned her in shame for getting raped (usually mothers)? The person who deemed marked her as rape victim (the court, the society)? Who are we to judge what is right and what is wrong? The person who raped the girl is just the tip of ice berg for the trauma the poor soul has to face daily in and out. The prying eyes, the judging societies and unjust humans.\\nA few days ago, I was glancing at a news in news paper. The woman alleged she was ‘raped’ by her boyfriend in pretext of marriage. As ridiculous as this news sound, I realized that not only are we subjecting to rape trial cases in mockery, we have created mockery of the complete term of ‘rape’.\\nHaving ’sex’ and a ‘rape’ are two completely different ideas. While the former is enjoying the feeling between two individual species, the later is aggression of the will power of one over another. The boyfriend in question can be charged under section 420 and 419, fooling people and definitely not under section 375 and Section 376(Rape).\\nNot only are we humiliating the victims of rape, we are also not worried about creating a mockery of the concept all together.\\nOne of my noble friend one day spend an hour convincing that couples sitting on the rocks of the band-stand are shame to the country and culture. I reminded him, that they actually are safeguarding the ancient culture of our country, which is now engraved into stone at the temples of khajurao and many other temples in south and north India, at which he flinched his mouth.\\nMany scholars will argue that the engravings on the templates filled with lust and ecstasy should be buried down, but do they see that the couples sitting on band-stand or maybe the statues on the walls of Khajurao are busy in their own world and are not looking at you?\\nA levitated state separating them from the bounds of society, culture and worldly pleasures, deep in a trance, in peace, a state which many Sadhus and monks spend years attaining. By looking at them, we are the intruders.\\nWe are the judges and the jury. These two sets of lovers are thus manifestations of nature, in all her myriad glory. The ancient people believe in submitting to those instincts which were natural, modern religious revolution suggest to go against the nature, thus creating the concept of lust, instead of love and giving birth to another rapist.\\nNature does not judge, we humans do, a curse upon the entire humanity is that we have the brains to judge each other. A rape victim is subjected to humiliation at every step, every second, not understanding her plight and trauma sometimes by her own family. A confused soul self labels herself as rape victim and mocks the very concept of ‘rape’ while we all with our eyes judge the two people, celebrating the instinct of nature.\\nWe live in funny times indeed.\\nP.s. The torture of watching television has its own merits. If we suffer in this life, we get a better one in next. One prime time watch of a television channel, can make me the president of united states in next life. Just telling.\\nP.p.s Hope you understand the different in the three terms before your son in 7th standard does in Sex-ed classroom.\\nShare if you care\\n'},\n",

Apart from bad acting, one other thing I noticed was grossly mis-interpreted version of a court case of a rape victim.\\nI am not familiar with the legal proceedings, but my question is, rape is the fundamental aggregation on the soul of the woman. Can you penalize the guilty? Can the person who committed the horrible crime be punished enough for the trauma the woman has to undergo in case of rape? Obviously you can’t.\\nAnother gross concept in the movie, which can be true, was the social pressure on the girl for not getting proper groom. Is our society so jobless that getting a groom for marriage is ultimate nirvana in life? Is there no other option available for you to do, like maybe get a life, get out of house, confident and brave and face the world out there and maybe fall in love again? Does the life ends with marriage? And yes does life ends with marriage before 25 years?\\nWhen a girl faces trauma like rape, abuse etc the first basic instinct is to shut up about it, else she won’t get a good groom or maybe she will be shamed in the society.

Apart from bad acting, one other thing I noticed was grossly mis-interpreted version of a court case of a rape victim.\\nI am not familiar with the legal proceedings, but my question is, rape is the fundamental aggregation on the soul of the woman. Can you penalize the guilty? Can the person who committed the horrible crime be punished enough for the trauma the woman has to undergo in case of rape? Obviously you can’t.\\nAnother gross concept in the movie, which can be true, was the social pressure on the girl for not getting proper groom. Is our society so jobless that getting a groom for marriage is ultimate nirvana in life? Is there no other option available for you to do, like maybe get a life, get out of house, confident and brave and face the world out there and maybe fall in love again? Does the life ends with marriage? And yes does life ends with marriage before 25 years?\\nWhen a girl faces trauma like rape, abuse etc the first basic instinct is to shut up about it, else she won’t get a good groom or maybe she will be shamed in the society.

The person who condemned her in shame for getting raped (usually mothers)? The person who deemed marked her as rape victim (the court, the society)?

       "   'document': 'The Differences Between Love & Sex.\\nWritten by Dolly\\nTaken from: http://www.iwannaknow.org/brain2/index.html\\nLove and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration.\\nDifferences Between Love and Sex\\nLove\\nLove is a feeling (emotional).\\nThere is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody.\\nLove involves feelings of romance and/or attraction.\\nSex:\\nSex is an event or act (physical).\\nThere are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common.\\nCan happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation)\\nAbstinence\\nThe word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you.\\nAbstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin-to-skin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way).\\nYou also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests; even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\"\\nWays to Express Love Without Sex\\nThere are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them, going to the movies, holding hands, or just hanging out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'The Differences Between Love & Sex.\\nWritten by Dolly\\nTaken from: http://www.iwannaknow.org/brain2/index.html\\nLove and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration.\\nDifferences Between Love and Sex\\nLove\\nLove is a feeling (emotional).\\nThere is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody.\\nLove involves feelings of romance and/or attraction.\\nSex:\\nSex is an event or act (physical).\\nThere are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common.\\nCan happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation)\\nAbstinence\\nThe word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you.\\nAbstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin-to-skin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way).\\nYou also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests; even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\"\\nWays to Express Love Without Sex\\nThere are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them, going to the movies, holding hands, or just hanging out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'Sunday, 11 December 2011 10:08 Jose Bosque\\nUser Rating:\\nPoor\\nBest\\nRecently I was asked by a young Twitter friend to develop a Dating Blog. Obviously, he must have like our JC On Point Youth and Singles magazine inside of www.JaxChristian.com and wanted more.\\nMy first reaction was when will I find the time? With 4 websites, 5 blogs and 35 Social Media networks plus all the other work I do for others, my greatest need is time. I also thought to myself, what do I have to say to this generation concerning dating? Things have changed so much and it has been years since I lived in that world. Well, like a true romantic and with my love for young people it wasn’t long before the Holy Spirit gave me this word.\\nFirst, I would like to say that there is a vast difference between Love and Lust.\\xa0 If you hang with me I want to take a few minutes to describe some of the differences.\\nWhat is the basis behind this article?\\nI believe in real love. *-I believe it is much greater than a 21 gun salutes, seeing stars, hearing bells and having a squadron of jets flying overhead as Hollywood portrays it in movies. Real love is all of that and much more. Real love is MAGNETIC!\\nI believe this generation has settled for less. It’s all about me, my needs and my comfort. Driven by selfish desires people are shacking up for convenience but there is no spark between them. (For you newbies “shacking up” is the 20th century term for living together without marriage or your “try before you buy” philosophy.)\\nHow do you know when you are driven by Lust?\\nLust is comfortable, it’s calculated and convenient. It gratifies our flesh and lust is not complicated. Relationships on this level are somewhat easier to jump in and out of and except for the usual division of personal effects it (feels) relatively harmless. While at first there might be some amount of regret the more you do it the harder your heart gets and the easier it is to do.\\nLet me describe the calculated side of lust. You never give more than you get. Extra giving is only the result of extra getting. Both sides keep the ruler out and no one is willing to invest an ounce of extra effort in the relationship. Yes, they are in a relationship but it’s measured and unless you are drunk or high it’s really boring (and they are really boring together.)\\nLust is driven by the flesh and the flesh is all about externals so when body parts head south because of age so does desire to stay together. (Lust cannot weather sickness, loss of a job, distance or anything which demands a withdrawal since lust makes no deposits.)\\nLust is a decision of the mind and sex is its finish line. (self-gratification) Next time you \"make love\" time how long the \"afterglow\" lasts. It speaks volumes!\\nIn a Lust relationship the two never become one. They may learn to co-exist for appearances sake, for the childrens sake,or even for their respect for the institution of marriage but they will never be one.\\nHow do you know it’s Real Love.\\nReal love is based in the heart. The Bible says the eyes are the window to your soul or heart. That is why when people are in love you can see it in their eyes.\\nReal love is not rational or logical. Real love is chemistry. It is unexplainable it just is! It’s exciting to the heart and its overwhelming to the mind.\\nReal love has no expectations because it too busy giving. It would rather give than receive. It doesn’t have time to measure because it cherishes the relationship.\\nReal love costs because it requires deposits and withdrawals. That is why Real love needs so much communication because it cares so much.\\nSeparation, time and distance cannot quench real love because it doesn’t live just in the present but lives in the heart internally and eternally.\\nAge cannot affect real love. In fact the longer the give and take the stronger the bonds of love become.\\nReal love is spontaneous it doesn’t matter where we are going as long as we are going together. It doesn’t need Las Vegas because there is already enough music and bright lights in the hearts of those who are truly in love.\\nSex in real love is the culmination but never the destination. Real love doesn’t need sex. It gives because it loves not because it should, it owes or it’s expected of me.\\nReal Love begins with a 0% expectancy rate- Real love is not thinking about ROI (Return on Investment)\\nReal Love is a dying process-(there is an old cuban proverb that says\"To Him that loves what he is doing even though it kill him, His death will taste like Glory!\"\\nI pray that you will wait for love. It would be sad to find yourself getting old after hundreds of mates or getting to a place where you are having to be told you need to sit together because you are married.\\n1 Cor 13:4-8\\n(from THE MESSAGE: The Bible in Contemporary Language © 2002 by Eugene H. Peterson. All rights reserved.)\\n4 Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn\\'t want what it doesn\\'t have. Love doesn\\'t strut, Doesn\\'t have a swelled head,\\xa05 Doesn\\'t force itself on others, Isn\\'t always \"me first, \"Doesn\\'t fly off the handle, Doesn\\'t keep score of the sins of others,\\xa06 Doesn\\'t revel when others grovel, Takes pleasure in the flowering of truth,\\xa07 Puts up with anything, Trusts God always, Always looks for the best, Never looks back, But keeps going to the end. 8 Love never dies. (from THE MESSAGE Bible)\\nFor the record, only Christ can heal the wounds and scars (they are there whether you see them or not) that this generation is inflicting on each other.\\nI know there so much more to say but maybe some of you reading this can take a few minutes and share your comments below so that this generation can get some help. God knows they need it!\\nFor Love’s sake,\\n'},\n",

Bookmark the permalink . Leave a comment\\nIn the past, I’ve had sex, I’ve been laid, or whatever way you prefer to say it, but it is nothing compared to when you make love. I know people who will argue you down to the ground about sex and lovemaking having no difference. If we were to say physically, of course there is no difference, but if we are talking about passion, emotion and mental, the two are VERY different!\\n1. The First Time.\\nWhen you first make love with your significant other, it’s most of the time a very special moment. Sometimes it planned in advance, especially if it is the beginning of a relationship. There normally is some sensual foreplay and it seems as though your bodies fit perfect with one another.\\nWhen it’s the first time with a new significant other it can just be a spontaneous thing which could be the result of “just having sex”. In this case, not to say it’s a random person, but it may not be someone you are dating at the time or that person you have a huge crush on. This could just be a choice made strictly on inpulse or hormonal, (thanks ciroc!). Most cases, this first time with this person can get very sloppy and unorganized which makes things awkward when looking for a good position. Afterwards, either both of you or one of you will feel like there is definitely something missing!\\n2. Drunk Lovemaking?\\nNow I know that drunk sex exists but drunk lovemaking; you all are taking it too far. I would love to hear that story about someone completed wasted experiencing lovemaking.\\n3. Turn off the lights………\\nSo picture this, a lightly dimmed room, candles lite all around, bed just overwelmed with rose petals, this is the love making tone. Now the backseat of your car, in your pantry, coat closet, or any other space big enough to house storage items that can cause legal repercussions, it’s sex.\\nWho doesn’t want to imagine places like sex in wooded quiet areas on laid out on the beach? Well in a fairy tale, that sounds all nice and dandy, but sand finding it’s way into places can ruin a little bit of the mood.\\n4. Turn on some of that Teddy……\\nLovemaking songs can include music from Barry White or Teddy Pendergrass, even newer music like Keith Sweat or Brian McKnight. Now those sex songs range around Trey Songz, Lil Wayne, or mostly any song containing more profanity and fantasies than realities and sensuality. Even Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex” is a little far off the deep end of just sex.\\nOf course every time you have sex or make love music doesn’t have to be playing. Just think about the times music was playing, and think about what WAS playing!\\n5. The morning after…..\\nThe majority of the time, making love is followed by the spooning and the cuddling but comes after multiple mutual orgasms (if you’re lucky). A “post sex” type approach would be followed by him plowing over and going straight to sleep. Then there is that phrase, “that was great” but he didn’t notice that you didn’t even orgasm! So in this case, if you were single, this is where the walk of shame happens. Now there are the times that are very rare. You can make love to a person with no commitment whatsoever, but in the morning, you get waffles and a few more gos at last night’s events. Maybe a relationship can start out from this one.\\nFrom my own opinion (and experience), it is very likely that people have sex more times than they make love. Even though this is going to happen often, when that one person surfaces, and you care for them as much as they care for you, you will appreciate all the lovemaking. When this happens, you won’t even remember those one nights stands with whatshisname.\\nDo you think sex and lovemaking are different or the same? Share your thoughts below!\\nShare this:\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'August 10, 2011 at 5:11 pm\\nI think I get both hypomania and mania. My mind tends to go pretty quick anyway so I don’t notice thoughts “racing” until they’re really going so fast I’m losing track then my thoughts are like fireworks, exploding all over the place. I can tell I’m in full mania when I close my eyes and see vivid imagery (making it impossible to sleep).\\nI have gone manic enough for my thoughts to become totally garbled and to break up into noise, which I was yelling out at the top of my voice, unalbe to think in English any more. That wasn’t particularly nice.\\nI found I actually felt better as the mania became less intense. In the big episode I had this year I went from depressed to full-blown manic with visions and voices in 3 days. On day 1 I was probably hypomanic, on day 2 irritable and paranoid; on day 3 I was already grandiose. It peaked about 4 days later when I was higher than I’ve gone on any drug and I’ve tried them all.\\nThe whole thing took about 10 weeks to wear off and as I say I felt better in the long hypomanic stage at the end than during most of the mania. When I was manic I could lose my temper just from thinking about something (and I did a LOT of thinking). If only I could harness the best of it and get rid of the worst…. and if only I could live without depression.\\nI’m only glad I’ve gone higher on mania than low on depression ~ even though I’ve spent far longer depressed than manic. It also, incidentally, took me 20 years to get diagnosed and I’m labelled schizoaffective not bipolar. My dr says I was too floridly psychotic to be just manic (I hallucinate very vividly), and this is using ICD10 criteria. In America I might be bipolar, as I’m not sure I’ve had hallucinations and/or delusions in the absence of marked mood symptoms for 2 weeks or more. Basically because I’ve never gone 2 weeks without marked mood symptoms and because the antipsychotics break up the psychosis better than they dispel the mood swings and I’m not prescribed a mood stabilizer.\\nThose oppressive thoughts you describe sound nasty. My problem tends to be the “flight of ideas” ~ I jump from topic to topic, totally forgetting where I’ve been and why I’m there. I can do this in writing almost as badly as in speech. I’m prone to tangentiality even in a normal mood, so when the mood is “elevated” it really becomes marked sometimes. I’ve also found not all the symptoms peak at the same time, so I might feel higher one week but far speedier the next. The only really good book I’ve read on mood disorders is Emil Kraepelin’s Manic-Depressive Insanity and Paranoia. It blows all recent efforts out of the water!\\nAlex W\\nFebruary 24, 2012 at 3:21 pm\\nI am a teenager and I was diagnosed with BP when I was 12 following a move from the city with my family. I have been on meds since about then. Last October, I did something I would never suggest to anyone. I went of my meds without my doctor’s permission. It was a VERY bad idea. I went through a depression so bad that I tried to/thought about committing suicide several times. I have been a cutter for several years.\\nHowever, recently some of my friends and my new therapist have been a wonderful help. My three closest friends, Ben, Madison, and Steph, have pulled be back and helped me through so much these past few years! They have been there for me no matter what mood I have been in. I am posting here to remind everyone that even when everything is at its worst there are ALWAYS people who care. Even when you feel that it would be better to die there are ALWAYS people who will miss you and wish that you had told them what was going on. NEVER EVER EVER forget that! It may be so difficult to remember that when you are depressed or in a mixed state, but try to remember that you are worth more than any object in the entire world.\\nYou are a human, made in God’s image. He loves you and will always love you! It took me so long to realize that, but now that I know I understand so much more. Jeremiah 29:11-14 says “11 ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.’”\\nI have been working on improving my control over my moods for several years now. I am a little better off now, but it is mostly because of my friends, my therapist and God. I have been safely back on my meds for the past year and a half and I am so grateful that my attempts did not work! God has given me this life back for a reason and I am thankful that I have friends who can help me figure out that reason. God loves you, never forget that!\\nLeave a Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

The most commonly referenced form of ritual sex is the Great Rite , which is the ritualized connection of the god and goddess. Author Vivianne Crowley says, \"The outer rite involves a linking of the male and the femaleâ€¦ the sacred marriage is outwardly a marriage of two people, but inwardly it is a marriage of the two within one person.\" The Great Rite is more than just sexual union; it is the enactment of the creation of the universe itself in Wiccan tradition.\\nAlthough the Great Rite is certainly the best known form of ritual sex, not all ritual sex is the Great Rite. Ritual sex has a number of different purposes besides the Great Rite -- it can be used to raise energy, create magical power, or find a sense of spiritual communion with a partner. If \"all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals,\" then certainly sex in ritual can be seen as a sacramental act of love.\\nIt should also be noted that in some magical traditions, masturbation and sexual release is a perfectly valid way of raising magical energy.\\nIn Her Hidden Children, author Chas Clifton writes, \"Many Pagan religions include invocation and possession by their gods. Wicca, in particular, extends that possession to sexual acts, whether literal or metaphorical.\" He goes on to say that by making sex sacred, \"Wiccans in all countries set their own stamp on nature religion, uniting in their bodies the cosmic and the most personal energies of planetary life.\"\\nBecause ritual sex is a sacred act, any form of it should be consensual. In most traditions, it is also performed in private, and in all traditions, performed only by adults. Some traditions of Wicca require actual intercourse as part of a Third Degree elevation, or in rituals performed by a High Priest and High Priestess. However, most Pagans today would say that it is never required by any legitimate coven for initiation as a neophyte. In other traditions, the act is symbolic but not actualized.\\nMore often than not, if ritual sex is performed, it is between two individuals who are part of an existing relationship already, and who are of equal levels of power within the dynamic of the coven. Ritual sex between two Third Degree people has a good polarity to itâ€¦ but ritual sex between a Third Degree and a Neophyte is stretching that balance of power a bit. Think of it as the difference between two teachers who date one another, and a teacher who dates his students.\\nAgain, no reputable coven will demand sexual initiation of its members. Ritual sex -- the Great Rite or otherwise -- is a specific, sacred act that is performed only by those who have studied and learned enough to feel comfortable performing it with a trusted partner.\\nFertility and Sex\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'Photo credit: Flickr user soelin\\nConcentration or focused attention is very much respected by society. Parents want to teach children how to concentrate and memorize. And many people complain that they can not remain focused on one subject. Well, this is a misconception. Anger is concentration, hurt is concentration. All suffering is nothing but focused attention . All of us are having good concentration skills. The problem comes when you want to focus on something in which you are NOT interested. For example a student is not interested in maths but he \\xa0want to focus on maths only to pass the exams.\\nYou are already master in concentration. If you don’t believe me then watch yourself when you are angry. You are so focused in anger that you forget everything. People can not stop smoking or drinking because of strong concentration. All suffering which comes after breakup is nothing but concentrated focus on a single person. If you can not forgive someone for years means you are totally focused on that person. This shows that you can remain focused\\xa0on something for years.\\nMind automatically get focused on the topic in which it is interested. Whether it is good or bad it doesn’t matter. You feel angry or hurt because it gives your ego good feeling. You feel like you are important.\\nYou don’t need to develop the skills of concentration, instead find the area in which you are most interested and you will get easily successful.\\nThe students which are always on the top in school exams may considered as intelligent just because they are on the top. But in latter years other boys, who are having more social skills, confidence, and common sense, who are more focused on money and power may get more successful. This so called intelligence (which is the outcome of concentration) is relative and only time being. The object of concentration will change according to your change in interest.\\nYou will be considered as a genius as long as you are focused on something in which you are interested and easily getting success . But you can be also considered as a fool if people could not understand your genius. The view of society about a successful man is very narrow. Basically it is based on money or social states. Money can easily hide your stupidity.\\nMeditation is NOT concentration; a meditative person is not focused on anything. He is just present. That’s why concentration on breathing is not meditation . Suppose you are totally focused on breathing and forget everything, then it is not meditation . Every year thousands of people travel all around the world and waste money to learn such kind of stupid things. What they teach in meditation camps is nothing but concentration. Meditation camps are concentration camps because along with stupid techniques they also brainwash you. Meditation can not be taught in camps. You have to learn it yourself in daily activities.\\nEarning money, balancing relationships , enjoying life, learning new skills, making new friends and achieving goals everything is part of meditation . It is not running away from life. Meditation is very balancing act. A meditative person is not introvert or extrovert. He is just balanced.\\nA person trying to concentrate can easily get disturbed, because he is fighting, resisting and trying his best to remain focused on ‘one thing’. A meditative person can not be disturbed because he is not forcing himself to remain focused. He is simply present. Forced alertness or awareness is not meditation , it is concentration.\\nMeditation is to simply being with yourself in the moment . And concentration is to leave yourself and focus on some point in time and space.\\nPosts Related to Meditation and concentration\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'Abuse and Addiction – What Is the Difference Between Sexual, Substance and Partner Abusers?\\nIn working with people worldwide, I’m aware that there are as many varieties of sex addictions as there are sex addicts… (as the saying goes). And just because someone has a this addiction, doesn’t mean they are a spousal abuser.\\nWhile it’s true that their sexual habits go hand-in-hand with sexual control, their addiction is about the sexual arousal, not the partner control. This is the primary distinction.\\nSex Addicts, Drug Addicts and Domestic Abuse\\nI liken it to the relationship between drug addictions and domestic abuse. While it is true that abusers can get more aggressive in their verbal and physical altercations with the use of alcohol, it is important to member that alcohol addiction and domestic abuse are two separate syndromes.\\nIn the case of alcohol and drug abuse, be mindful that the addiction is toward the substance. Whereas, domestic abuse has more to do with an addiction to controlling one’s partner in and of itself.\\nThe same is true for sex addictions. Those who have addictions to sex may seek to control the sex in their intimate relationships. However, they do not do this as a means to another end…such as, controlling their intimate partners. Rather, the control is about the sexual experience.\\nViolence as a Manifestation of Another Addiction\\nThere may be violence associated with both the sex and drug addiction that is displayed in the addicts efforts to control their substance for the drug addict and their sexual arousal for the sex addict. But this manifestation of violence is merely that. It’s a by-product of seeking the focus of their addiction, which is not the same as the violence of domestic abuse.\\nIn the case of domestic abuse, violence is a manifestation of domestic abuse, but the “domestic abuse” is fundamentally about “the control”… specifically, controlling the intimate partner. The battering (verbal, emotional and physical) is used to establish and maintain an unequal distribution of power and control in the relationship.\\nImplications for Treating Couples in Abusive Relationships\\nIf you are in an abusive relationship, in which intimate partner violence has been identified in combination with either an alcohol, drug or sex addiction, then be mindful of the implications for treatment. Make sure that your couples or partner’s therapist is addressing the addictions separately.\\nRealize that drug and sex addictions are both syndromes separate from intimate partner abuse. And moreover, they must be treated independently with an appropriate addiction specific intervention.\\nConcurrent Treatment for Abusers and Addicts\\nI find the greatest success when substance and sex addicts are in a twelve-step program for their addiction while they are going through a domestic abuse intervention. Treatment goals remain separate and are accomplished independently from the domestic violence treatment.\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'WHAT IS SEX?\\nby Ray C. Stedman\\nWould it be an exaggeration to say that this is undoubtedly the most popular theme in the world? Sex is used today to sell everything from prunes to motor cars, from aardvarks to zwieback. Recently I saw an advertisement for overshoes (and what could be more prosaic than overshoes?) which displayed great letters an inch or so high spread across the top, spelling S-E-X. Underneath, in fine print, it said, \"Now that we have your attention we would like to tell you about the overshoes we sell.\" If any further proof were needed of the popularity of this subject, this week someone saw the subject advertised on the bulletin board outside the church and said, \"Wow! You are going to have a full church next Sunday!\" And they were right!\\nAlready there have been, I must report, some raised eyebrows at the idea that a subject like this would serve as a basis for a sermon from a Christian pulpit. But we are now in a series on \"The Christian and Moral Conditions,\" and how can one preach a series on moral conditions without coming to grips with the subject of sex? And why should we avoid this subject? I make no apology for this message. It is only one of several I intend to preach on this general subject. I do want, however, to make one thing crystal clear. None of the messages on this subject will be approached from a negative point of view.\\nNo one is more aware than I of the lopsided sensuality of our day, the grotesque over-emphasis on sex that exists. But this does not call for more scathing denunciation, for fire-and-brimstone from the pulpit. We have had plenty of that. I read recently a very insightful thing. One writer said, \"The hunger of the world\\'s people today is for affirmations. Everywhere people are asking, \\'Can\\'t you do something more intelligent than make loud noises against something? We know what you are against, please tell us what you are for.\\'\" One of the reasons for the terrible ignorance about sex today is that the church, by and large, has not taken the time to declare what the Scripture has to say about this, but has contented itself with denunciations against the abuses of sex. Negativism never helps very much. There is a place for it, but nothing much is accomplished until a positive declaration has been made, and this is what I intend to do on this subject of sex.\\nThe Bible is full of sexual themes. Anyone who has read it through knows this. This is perfectly understandable, for the Bible is the book about life. It is the book that goes with human beings, and since sex is very much a part of our lives, the Bible understandably would have a great deal to say about it. In the very first passage in the Bible on this subject (Genesis\\xa02), you find a wholly positive approach to sex. This passage suggests all the elements which are later developed in full throughout the rest of Scripture. I propose that we thoughtfully review this passage and discover for ourselves the four great facts about sex which every human being should know.\\nThe first great fact is that sex is God-given.\\nThen the Lord God said, \"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\" {Gen 2:18 RSV}\\nIt may come as a surprise to some to learn that sex was not originated by Playboy magazine, and that Henry Miller and Tennessee Williams are not the ultimate authorities in this line. As a matter of fact, Satan can offer absolutely nothing in the realm of sexuality -- not a thing, except distortion and hollowness. It is God who created sex, and this verse clearly indicates that God had the distinctions of sex in mind when he made the male. The pronouncement, \"It is not good that man should be alone,\" indicates that woman was no mere afterthought with God. Man was not yet complete when only the male existed. For the full thought of God about humanity, two sexes are necessary, and God makes this clear. About everything else in his creation he said \"It is good,\" but when only the man stood there, God said, \"It is not good,\" indicating there is more to come. He moved on, then, to the creation of woman, thus revealing that all that is possible in sex in terms of ecstasy and fulfillment was planned and provided for by God. He likes sex, and he intends his creatures to like it as well. He made man and woman to be different, and it is not ribald to say with the French, vive la difference!\\nThere is no question but that the present \"sexplosion\" so widespread today is a reaction to Victorian prudishness. But libertinism and Victorianism represent extremes, and both are extremely wrong. Victorianism is as anti-Christian as wife-swapping, and equally destructive to what God had in mind for human beings in the making of sex. I know it is popular today to paint evangelical Christians and the Bible as essentially antisexual and priggish, treating sex as a kind of necessary evil, but you find no such picture like that in the Bible. The Bible handles the subject of sex forthrightly and frankly. Here is an excellent summary of what it has to say about sex, taken from Dr. William Coles\\' book, Sex and Love in the Bible\":\\n\"Sex is good. It is the creation of God and all men are expected to enjoy it. No prudishness or squeamishness is appropriate. Sex is not an occasion for shame or embarrassment. All members of a family must learn to use their sexual drives responsibly, but they do so by facing the facts openly, not by hiding behind blinders, pretending that life is asexual, that such matters are never discussed in polite society.\\n\"One thing conservatives need to learn: it is not the open treatment of sex in our society that is wrong, it is the context of that treatment. Nothing is to be gained by a conspiracy of silence. Our so-called sex-saturated society needs as its antidote not a return to repression and ignorance, but a discussion of sex in its proper context.\"\\nThe Hebrews saw all of life as one, as related to and governed by the Lord of the Covenant. There were no watertight compartments sealed off from his sovereign rule. There was, in short, nothing secular anywhere in existence. All of life was hallowed by his presence and his will. What our times require is what the Old Testament possessed -- a full, frank and open facing of the facts of sexuality in human life, but in the context of divine sovereignty. Sex is sacred, as all human existence is sacred. It cannot be used selfishly or irresponsibly without serious damage to the very structure of one\\'s being, to the whole network of one\\'s interpersonal relationships.\\nThe Bible begins on that theme and declares that the first and important thing to know about sex is: God made it! This is the starting point in any adequate study of sex in the Bible.\\nIf we attach any importance to the order in which this subject is presented in this passage, we shall find the second declaration to be a very interesting one. Verse nineteen declares that sex in humans is different than sex in animals.\\n\"So out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a helper fit for him.\" {Gen 2:19-20 RSV}\\nIt is most significant that God did not immediately create woman after creating man. This is quite different than the process he followed with regard to the animal world. There is no such delay indicated in the creation of the two sexes in the animal world, but when it comes to man there is a deliberate delay. (Incidentally, it might relieve a problem in some minds to read verse nineteen, \"So out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field,\" because, of course, the creation of the animals preceded that of man, as recorded in chapter one, and this reading is quite consistent with the Hebrew text.)\\nWhy did God parade these animals before Adam? It is obvious from the passage -- that Adam might give them names. This certainly suggests a good deal more than merely the inventing of labels for a long stream of animal life passing before him. The names that Adam gave to the animals were names that grew out of some basic characteristic of each animal.\\nFor instance, the Hebrew word for lion is the word \"violence.\" What could be more appropriate for the animal that is called \"the king of beasts?\"\\nAdam, in naming the animals, had to observe them and study them carefully. Therefore, this evidently did not take place in an afternoon while all the animals walked by, but probably occurred over a long period of time. But when he had finished he had learned a great deal about the nature of the animals -- he had to in order to name them.\\nOne thing was very pronounceably noticeable to him: There was nothing in animal life that corresponded to himself. There was nothing physically in the animals that corresponded with his physical being. Not in temperament or soul-quality did he find a counterpart in the animals. That he was looking for something like this is clearly indicated by the exclamation he gives when woman is brought to him. He says \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,\" {Gen 2:23 RSV}. This is not the last time that a man has said \"At last!\" when a woman arrives! But this does indicate that Adam had been looking for something specific in animal life and now he says, \"At last I have found it.\"\\nHere lies the essential difference between the Catholic and Protestant views of sex. The Catholic view sees little more in sex than the word found in Chapter\\xa01, Verses\\xa027-28:\\nSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and said to them, \"Be fruitful multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it;\" {Gen 1:27-28a RSV}\\nThis view recognizes in this passage one of the great purposes of sex, the propagation of life. Man shares this capacity for fruitful increase with animal life, and Catholic thought sees birth control as a denial of the divine purpose in sex. But Chapter\\xa02 reveals considerably more. It makes clear that sex in man is different than in animals and has a specialized purpose beyond procreation. That specialized purpose is brought out in the third great declaration about sex in this passage.\\nThis deeper fact is found in Verses\\xa021-23: Sex is a total, psycho-physical whole, and, therefore, both powerful and mysterious:\\nSo the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept he took one of this ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said,\\n\"This at last is bone of my bones\\nand flesh of my flesh;\\nshe shall be called Woman,\\nbecause she was taken out of man.\" {Gen 2:21-23 RSV}\\nNotice, again, no animal was made in this manner. God did not make two human beings and bring them together with the admonition, \"get acquainted and discover one another.\" Instead, he takes one human life and splits it in half, thereby making two, and the two are never complete until they are reunited. This is what lies behind the mystery of sex.\\nNow what are we meant to understand by this strange story of Eve being made from Adam\\'s rib? I do not intend to discuss this from a scientific aspect. I am quite prepared to take the account literally. I do not think there is any conflict with science in this area, since neither science nor Scripture speaks in enough detail on this subject to create conflict. But I am quite sure there is more to this than simply a report of the first surgical operation, complete with anesthesia. Surely this is intended to teach that sex is deeper than the merely physical; it touches the whole physical and soulish makeup of man; it is psycho-physical. It is involved in every part of our life, not only physically, but emotionally, mentally, and volitionally as well. It is this fact that makes the sex drive so powerful. Sex is a powerful desire to enter into a total union with another personality, to discover the \"secret\" of another, to possess him or her in the total framework of human experience. In a phrase -- the urge to merge!\\nSex is such a powerful instinctive drive in human life that we can never ignore it or take it lightly. It is as irresistible as spring.\\nMy home is situated between two schools, a high school in one direction and a grade school in the other. I often see the children coming home from each, some from one direction, and some from the other. It is very interesting to notice how they travel. The children from the grade school come in bunches, but they are always bunches of the same sex -- groups of boys or groups of girls, but never boys and girls. But the young people coming from high school act quite differently. They are the same children who, a year or two before, were in the grade school, but now they no longer walk in bunches of boys and girls; they now come in pairs, in various degrees of entwinement. Now I am neither accusing or condoning the entwinement. I am simply pointing out that there is a psycho-physical force here which cannot be countermanded; it must be reckoned with. It is a perfectly natural thing.\\nThe deep sleep into which God caused Adam to fall when Eve was made suggests something of the eternal fascination of sex. We can never fully understand this strange and powerful drive, and nothing quite so much tortures us and yet delights us as the mystery of our sexuality. One thing therefore is clear: It is so deeply rooted in our natures that we can never treat it adequately on the physical level. Thus all books and pamphlets which treat sex on the physical level are superficial, and therefore inadequate. Sex is much deeper than that. It touches the whole of human makeup in its total experience.\\nThat brings us, then, to the last declaration of this passage on sex, in many ways the most important. The fourth thing the Bible has to say, in much fuller detail later but exemplified here clearly in principle, is that sex is regulated and purposeful.\\nTherefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed. {Gen 2:24-25 RSV}\\nHere we come to the divinely intended boundaries of sex. Simply because sex is so total it must be fulfilled only under conditions which make a total union possible -- in a word, marriage! In marriage, as all of us know, it is intended that a woman give her husband all that she is and has, and the husband likewise. The woman gives up her old life with her parents, her home. She renounces her father\\'s name and takes her husband\\'s name. She leaves behind her past; in a very real sense she begins life totally anew in a wholly different environment, with a completely different base of reference. Likewise, the husband. He gives his wife everything -- his name (which stands for all that he possesses), his life, his interests, his body -- all. Their lives are intended to merge and blend until they become indistinguishable. That is what is meant here, \"and they become one flesh.\"\\nThe Lord Jesus confirmed the importance of this when, asked to pronounce upon marriage and divorce, he said, \"Remember, in the beginning, God made them male and female that they might become one flesh,\" {cf, Matt 19:4-5}. That is the great purpose of marriage. Anything short of this is partial, abortive, frustrating. and, therefore, destructive. This is the whole point about sex outside of marriage. Therefore, it is not mere whim that causes God to forbid extra-marital sex, as the critics of Christian views of sex maintain, it is God\\'s love and concern for humanity that leads him to make this prohibition.\\nPremarital and extra-marital sex is a way of cheating yourself of the full glory that is intended for man in sex. As in all the rest of life, you simply cannot have your cake and eat it too. One destroys the opportunity for the other. Every experience of sex outside of marriage destroys something of the totality possible within marriage: That is an inviolable law of life. This is why Paul writes to the Ephesians, and says, \"Stay completely clear of immorality and fornication. Do not let someone deceive you by plausible words about these matters for they will do so if they can. They will tell you that this business of restricting sex to marriage is prudery and poppycock and humbug; that life can never be complete unless you give full rein to your sexual impulses and you might as well do it with the first willing person of the opposite sex you can find,\" {cf, Eph 5:3-11}. Paul says. \"do not let them kid you that way, with plausible words. For, for this cause comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.\"\\nNow the wrath of God, in this context, is not a lightning bolt from heaven. It is not some fearsome catastrophe, some judgment that falls suddenly without warning -- an auto accident or some terrible sickness -- it is not that. The wrath of God is the invisible, almost imperceptible, but irresistible deterioration of life, the brutalizing of humanity, the vulgarizing of life. The reason we are suffering from this terrible tempest of neurosis and psychosis and mental anguish today is because we have disregarded these restrictions. But God has not placed them there to torment us, but to protect us. This is what this passage declares to us. We cannot give ourselves in totality to another person except as we give everything -- our name, our position, our place, our home, our heart, our life, everything! Because we cannot do that in sex outside of marriage, we, therefore, treat our partners in that kind of sex as though they were simply objects for our own satisfaction. We do not see them any longer as human beings, whole persons, but we treat them as things designed to give satisfaction to us. They become objects of pleasure, only. Thus we become something less than human.\\nIn confirmation of that, let me quote a very forthright but revealing statement from a defender of free sex. This is, he says, the proper attitude toward sex.\\nA girl is like a sports car or a bottle of Scotch or an Ivy League suit that is meant to be used and enjoyed by man. But always with flair, with polish. There need be no entangling, no stifling alliances or obligations. Girls are playthings, and once enjoyed will have to be set aside and replaced with others new and fresh.\\nThat is the dehumanizing that results from a violation of the principles of sex.\\nFurthermore, this means that every change of mates means we have less and less of our real selves to give. We can only give ourselves in totality to one person. If we are constantly changing mates, as is the practice of so many these days, we will find that we have less and less of our real selves to give, and, therefore, our relationship tends to become merely physical rather than whole-souled. There is a continuing experience of superficiality in marriage. This is why Hollywood stars, with their penchant toward many marriages, find that each one is less satisfying than the others. The unrestrained use of sex changes it from a wild rushing torrent, making possible high excitement and delight, into stagnant flood waters that inundate the whole countryside in which we find ourselves wading continually. Therefore, it loses its ecstatic seductiveness, and mystery, and becomes bland, insipid, and, eventually, tasteless.\\nBut within marriage, within the limits of God\\'s provision, sex provides a unique and distinctive ecstasy that is impossible to find elsewhere, simply because elsewhere it can never be total. Besides the full, unrestrained joy of physical union in marriage, there can be achieved that total knowing of another in his or her total, psycho-physical makeup that is fully satisfying to the deep-seated drive within every human being to know and possess another human being. There is nothing like it outside of heaven! This is why the Apostle Paul, in Ephesians, says that the union of a man and a woman in marriage is like unto that union of Christ and his church. There is simply nothing like it except spiritual union.\\nThis is what is meant by Verse\\xa025, \"the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.\" We are never ashamed, of course, of that in which we find full and total satisfaction. Their nakedness was more than merely physical -- there is no argument for nudity here. Their nakedness meant a total knowing of one another, an unrestrained enjoyment of one another, body and soul. That is what marriage is meant to be. That is why the writer of Hebrews says, \"Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled,\" {Heb 13:14 KJV}.\\nPerhaps the most descriptive words of what real marriage is intended to be, especially from its sexual point of view, is found in the Song of Solomon. Here is a frankly sensual love poem, and yet it is chaste and reverent all the way through. It is a beautiful description of what God intends the psycho-physical makeup of marriage to be.\\nI am my beloved\\'s,\\nand his desire is for me. {Song 7:10 RSV}\\nSet me as a seal upon your heart,\\nas a seal upon your arm;\\nfor love is strong as death,\\njealousy is cruel as the grave.\\nIts flashes are flashes of fire,\\na most vehement flame.\\nMany waters cannot quench love,\\nneither can floods drown it.\\nIf a man offered for love\\nall the wealth of his house,\\nit would be utterly scorned. {Song 8:6-7 RSV}\\nNotice, in Genesis\\xa02, that the very next word in Scripture after this suggestive description of God\\'s intention in sex is the story of the Fall; the introduction of the principle of evil into human life, that spirit of independence from God which has spoiled and marred all the glory that God intended in sex. But note also, as you read through the Scriptures, that this is restored and made possible again to redeemed lives.\\nNow, I am suggesting by this that in Christian homes, where the man and wife are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, it is possible to learn again, and to achieve again, all that God had in mind for this union of the sexes in its total psycho-physical makeup. Therefore, Christians must lead out here, as elsewhere, to display to the world in visible terms exactly what the divine intention was in making two sexes -- that eternal seeking to merge again in mystery. And, when our Christian homes display this, the world will stop much of its bewildered, aimless, blinded search for meaning in sex, and stop, look, and listen to the beauty and the glory and radiance of what God intended marriage to be.\\nThis is why the Scriptures speak so frankly and forthrightly about these matters, and why every Christian heart should give careful attention to what they have to say.\\nPrayer\\nOur Father, we confess, with shame, we have long neglected a subject that is of great concern to thee, that we have not taken the time to think thoughtfully and intelligently about this, the most powerful and most beautiful of forces in human life. May we bring our sexual lives to thee, Lord Jesus, and place them under thy control, that in the glory of thy Lordship they may take on that beauty and radiance that is thy intention for them. In Christ\\'s name, Amen.\\nTitle: What is Sex?\\nSeries: The Christian and Moral Conditions\\nScripture: Gen 2:18-25\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'A blog about cognitive and behavioural economics. Building mathematical models of how psychology influences economic systems.\\nWednesday, 15 September 2010\\nWhat is the difference between cognitive economics and behavioural finance?\\nThis question was posed in an interesting LinkedIn discussion group (Behavioural Finance: Theory and Practice) by Kerry Pechter.\\nI dashed off a quick answer which ended up being 500 words long. So I thought it might be useful to post on here.\\nCan anyone tell me the difference between cognitive economics and behavioral finance?\\nCognitive economics is not yet a widely used phrase, though Marco Novarese and I have been using it as a name for a more microfounded version of what\\'s typically called behavioural economics.\\nSo I\\'ll answer the question based on how I use the term.\\nThe first difference is between \"economics\" and \"finance\". Economics is a broader field, including the trading of any kind of goods or services, whereas finance specifically focuses on investment and the value of financial instruments. Indeed I consider economics very broadly to be the study of how resources are allocated (by individuals, and across society).\\nThe more fundamental distinction is between \"cognitive\" and \"behavioural\". In short, cognitive is about how we think, while behavioural is about what we do. Behavioural finance and economics focus on the phenomena of how people behave - for example what will they do (on average) when faced with a given choice between two ways of paying for something?\\nCognitive economics (or finance), on the other hand, looks at what is actually going on within the individual\\'s mind when they make that choice. What is the internal structure of their decision-making, what are the influences on it, how does information enter the mind and how is it processed, what form do preferences take internally, and then ultimately how are all those processes expressed in our behaviour?\\nI would also distinguish between the way that behavioural economics and finance are practised, and what cognitive economists do. Behavioural economics is quite an experiment-driven field. BE (and BF) people mostly start from the framework of classical economics and do experiments to find out where real behaviour differs from the classical assumptions of rationality. BE is quite practical in one sense - it gives us a way to imagine the ways that people might behave when confronted with a given situation. However it does not make good predictions about how they will behave - generally it will rely on experiments to distinguish among the different possible behaviour modes.\\nCognitive economists start at a lower level, from a microfounded model of how people make decisions, and work upwards theoretically, to develop a self-consistent model of large-scale economic behaviour. Cognitive economics therefore should ultimately be able to explain or predict behaviour from a minimal set of base data. In some ways this is the same goal as classical economics, but with a richer and more accurate microfoundation leading to more powerful and better micro and macroeconomic predictions.\\nA simpler way to explain it is by analogy with the difference between engineering and physics. Behavioural finance is like engineering - engineers know some rules about how objects behave, and they can use those rules to design and test new implementations of existing inventions, and fix things that have already been built. Cognitive economics is like physics - physicists know the underlying theory of how things work, and they can use that to explain how existing inventions operate, and to work out how to create wholly new ones.\\n'},\n",

And now let us pay attention to the fact that people of different gunas behave differently not only in religious practice or toward Messengers of God, but also in relationships with each other, in particular, in sexual relationships. For people of different gunas and for those who are above the gunas sex is quite different.\\nIn case of people of the tamas guna, sex is egoistic and coarse as these people themselves. They are inclined to the emotions of condemnation and hatred, thus they may hate sex and their sexual partners. However, when they are driven by passions, they may continue to \\x93use\\x94 others for satisfying themselves.\\nThis attitude to sex is manifested in the obscene language — the language of tamas guna — where sex appears as something dirty and even more — as a means for defiling other people.\\nThose are people of this guna who condemn and hate sex in oth-ers, they are ready even to stone them because of their sex. But they permit it for themselves.\\nIn the earthly Christianity, we can see one of the manifestations of the tamas guna in the form of the Orthodox dogma of \\x93immaculate\\x94 conception * of Jesus by His mother Mary. From this turn of speech it follows that all other conceptions are maculated! Can all parents agree that their children are a product of something maculated?\\nPeople of tamas guna are not able to understand that sex of other people may be very different from theirs: it can be not the means of satisfying one\\x92s primitive animal passion (called sexual attraction in scientific language), but the means of expressing love, giving oneself to another, searching and finding mutual harmony — the harmony of merged consciousnesses loving each other. Through sattvic sexual love, people can really learn merging consciousnesses in love, so that having learned it they can merge themselves as consciousnesses with the Consciousness of the beloved Heavenly Father.\\nBut who is capable of such love? Only sattvic people. And who are sattvic people? What is the criterion here? They are people who have mastered the cordial love — i.e. the emotions of the \\x93opened\\x94 spiritual heart. Such people are quite few, though.\\nFrom the above said, one may see that for some people sex is a way to go deeper into tamas, and every new sexual act for them is really another step on the way to hell. Yet, for others sex is the means of establishing oneself in harmony, subtlety, purity, emotional love, developing the ability of caring for others, training oneself in merging the consciousnesses in the embrace of love, studying in the school of God on the Path to Mergence with Him.\\nThis is why Jesus gave directly opposite recommendations regarding sex to different people: to some He recommended to restrict their sexuality, while to others He preached the opposite.\\nLet us see it in examples:\\n\\x93You have heard that it was said to the ancients, \\x91You shall not commit adultery.\\x92 But I say to you that whoever looks on a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\\x94 (Matt 5:27-28)\\n\\x93\\x85 Whoever shall marry her who is put away commits adultery!\\x94 (Matt 5:32).\\nNow, let us follow the episode with Mary Magdalene (narrated by her) when she was blamed for adultery and brought for judging to Jesus:\\n\\x93They caught me and wanted to stone me. I, sinful, loved one man who was married and had three children. Relatives of his wife brought me to the square and began to shout in a loud voice, \\x91Let us kill the adulteress! She desecrated the law!\\x92\\n\\x93Then\\x85 Christ told them, \\x91Let him, who is without a sin, throw the first stone!\\x92 And (He)\\x85 made the crowd disperse.\\n\\x93Then He approached me and kneeled before me.\\n\\x93\\x85 I was burning with shame and fear. The sublime was taking place in me, in the soul. I fell on the ground and cried. He stroked my hair and said:\\n\\x91My dear sister, find strength to listen to Me! Much evil exists on this Earth; many lies have been said by the evil one! Forget that you are a sinner and tell Me whether your heart lives when you love?\\x92.\\n\\x91It does, Lord! When I do not love, it is dead!\\x92\\n\\x91Then love, heavenly sister, and do not sin anymore, thinking that you are a sinner.\\x92\\x94 (Questions of Mary, 20-27).\\nJesus told her also the following:\\n\\x93What is sinful in this world is righteous in My Father\\x92s Kingdom! The (True) Life is the life of love, not the life of hatred!\\n\\x93Many of the \\x91righteous\\x92 hate and condemn. But I say to you, an adulteress who does not hate will be better in the Judgement Day than the \\x91righteous\\x92 who condemn!\\x94 (Questions of Mary, 13-15)\\nJesus told Mary an important rule of sexual relationships between spiritually advanced people: their relationships have to be a secret between them and God. In other words, only God has to be the Witness and Guide of their love. Apostle Philip wrote the same: \\x93If a marriage is open to the public, it becomes prostitution\\x85\\x94 (The Gospel of Philip, 122).\\nMary Magdalene became a disciple of Jesus and joined His group. There is an important description of her relationship with Jesus:\\n\\x93\\x85 The companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene. He loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples saw it and asked Him, \\x91Why do you love her more than all of us?\\x92 The Savior answered to them, \\x91Why do I not love you like her?\\x92\\x94 (The Gospel of Philip, 55).\\nVladimir Antonov\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'Part\\xa0I\\xa0|\\xa0Shifting the health research landscape\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0Sex and gender differences in mental health research\\nAdrianna Mendrek, Université de Montréal\\nSignificant epidemiological and clinical data has amassed over the years indicating important differences between women and men in the prevalence, course and expression of various mental health problems. Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies.

For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

In communitas the individual willing surrenders his or her will to a group of individuals. A recent clear example is the video and television series, A Band Of Brothers. In that series Easy Company moves into that magic space called communitas. The individual members of Easy Company willingly surrendered their will to a group called Easy Company. They were bound together by the knowledge they were prepared to die for each other. Whatever it took to keep their buddies alive was their commitment.\\nIt is unfortumate in some way to look at a war situation as an example. That is perhaps only because our understanding of the magic that occurs in communitas can be comprehended by 20th century people in a war situation. Our industrialised society - based as it is on individualism - has no understanding of this magic.\\nGo back to Chaucer and Canterbury Tales - somewhere around 1370 - and the pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This group did not know each other before they started the pilgrimage and were not dragging their personal history with them. As they talked to each other they revealed themselves and slowly developed a deep connection. In addition they were talking in old English which is almost like a musical hum or mutterings in a cantilena. The sound itself is hypnotic. I invite you to imagine a hot summer day, the plodding of the horses, the bucolic Kent countryside, the cadences of the speaker casting a spell over the pilgrims, the shared commitment to a pilgrimage, the understanding and acceptance of everyone as they are, no pretense, heart meeting heart.\\nCommunitas then, is something of much greater impact than community. It is as Victor Turner describes -\\na place and moment “in and out of time,” and such an actor - as the evidence of many pilgrims of many religions attests - hopes to have there direct experience of the sacred, invisible or supernatural order, either in the material aspect of miraculous healing or in the immaterial aspect of inward transformation of spirit or personality.\\nWe all, perhaps, have touched upon communitas when we meet a stranger in unusual circumstances and are suddenly bonded as though we have known them for eternity. Walking along a road in California, hitching a ride, a car stops, we get in and are plunged into a 'knowing' of each other that is indeed, 'in and out of time'.\\nWhat we are doing here, on this very web site, is nurturing that lost soul connection - seeking to create our version, and re-emerge in a world of caring and conscious connection.\\nLogin or register to post comments\\nRecent blog posts\\n\"},\n",

But the friendships between the protagonists felt universal. And as cartoonish as the individual characters could be, I saw pieces of them in the women around me, if not in myself .\\nThen I got older. So have the characters in SATC , but the franchise’s male creators aren’t quite sure what to do with women over forty. And so they have taken four flawed but generally likable women and made them repugnant.\\nCharlotte’s chirpy childishness—always a little icky—seems gross coming from a twice-married woman with two children. Carrie’s self-centered flakiness and drama-whoring is exhausting. Samantha and Miranda are unrecognizable—Sam having gone from an independent woman in charge of her sexuality to a desperate caricature fighting to hold on to her youth (Note: Chris Noth, who plays Mr. Big, is two years older than Kim Cattrall, who plays Samantha. Interesting that Samantha is portrayed as fading, while Big still gets to be…well…Mr. Big) while Miranda quits her job because the new partner at the firm is a sexist jerk. No fight. She simply gives up, which seems completely out of character.\\nSATC was never as feminist as it was made out to be, but now it seems as un-empowering and pandering as a those pink “girl” computers by Dell . And when the fearsome foursome arrive in the Middle East, privilege, racism, and ignorance meet in an unholy trifecta. Here is what we learn:\\nAll you need to know about Arab countries, you have already learned in Aladdin . If you have a Jewish married name, do not use it on a trip to Abu Dhabi. In an Arab country, be sure to wear expensive clothing reminiscent of the aforementioned cartoon. (Two words: gold harem pants.) Arab men are either frightening crazy-eyed religious fundamentalists or hot menservants. (By the way, it is not at all creepy to accept the services of said hot, brown menservants, and if one such manservant is gay... jackpot! Two new accessories for the price of one! Refer to him as Paula Abdul.)\\nNo woman ever follows the tenets of Islam by choice; all women who wear abaya or niqab are oppressed and secretly want to be white, wealthy, American women who wear revealing couture. Arab women who are not oppressed may be bellydancers in Western-style nightclubs. It is feminist to travel to Muslim countries and expose yourself, simulate fellatio on a hookah, grab a man’s penis in a restaurant, and possibly have sex on a public beach. If you are trying to communicate in an Arab country and cannot find the right words, saying “lalalalalala” will get your point across.\\nNow, I am sure there are those who will say that I am thinking too deeply about a movie that is meant to be a bit of fluff. For you, I will share that SATC 2 ’s problems are not all about the portrayal of women, privilege, race or religion. Before any of those things pricked my nerves, I was already sighing at the films stilted dialogue, awkward group dynamic, hackneyed situations, and corny jokes that beg for a sitcom laugh track. And then there was the spectacle of seeing Liza Minelli performing “Single Ladies.” Yes, Liza with a “z” sings Beyonce with a “B.”\\n'},\n",

The final sections contain TIPS FOR KEEPING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC OUT OF THE CHURCHES and SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR SACRED MUSIC. 190 pages. $8.95\\n_________________________\\nQUESTION\\nA pastor asked the following question:\\n“What is the difference from using songs that every denomination using across the board from the past (‘Just as I Am,’ ‘Amazing Grace,’ etc.) to using songs that everyone uses across the board in the present (‘How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,’ ‘Holy Ground,’ ‘Majesty,’ etc.)\\xa0if they follow Biblical principles and if we do not promote a particular artist whose lifestyle we don’t support?”\\nAnother pastor who wrote to criticize me for my warning about Independent Baptist churches that are adapting CCM said that if my position is true I should stop using the King James Bible, because it was written by Anglicans.\\nANSWER\\nThis is a very typical argument used by CCM defenders, and it is amazing to hear it on the lips of an Independent Baptist preacher who would doubtless think of himself as a real defender of the faith. If we buy into this argument, we will not be able to resist the onslaught of CCM in any effective manner except perhaps to stand against hard rock, and that stand won’t last very long. Those who accept soft rock will eventually accept “hard” rock. It’s the same fleshly beast.\\nIn a nutshell, I would offer three rejoinders:\\nFirst, the old Protestant denominations were fundamentally different than their modern counterparts.\\nThe old Lutherans and Methodists were militant for the Christian faith and were not infiltrated by theological modernism and other new thinking. They hated Popery! The old Protestants were much closer, doctrinally and spiritually, to the position of today’s old-fashioned Baptist church than to that of the contemporary movement.\\nSecond, CCM represents a philosophy of end-times Christianity that is diametrically opposed to and an avowed enemy of every “old-fashioned” Bible church .\\nThe use of an old doctrinally sound hymn by a Lutheran like Luther or a Methodist like Wesley does not put our people in danger of becoming Lutherans or Methodists. I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming a Lutheran by singing “A Mighty Fortress.” Likewise, I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming an Anglican simply because the KJV translators were Anglicans.\\nBut the use of CCM is turning IB churches into emerging everywhere. That is because CCM is not just music written by people of questionable doctrine; it represents a philosophy and a movement of end-time apostasy that is diametrically opposed to an “old-fashioned” Bible stand, that is an absolutely enemy of what an “old-fashioned” Baptist church stands for. Large numbers of formerly fundamental Baptist churches have gone down the emerging path through the influence of CCM. (see “Contemporary Music Brings Great Changes to IB Churches”).\\nIf you think it is a mere coincidence that CCM is at the very heart of every change of this nature, you are welcome to your opinion, but I do not share it, and I would far rather err on the side of being too “strict” about music than too “tolerant.”\\nDan Lucarini, author of Why I Left the Contemporary Christian Music Movement: Confessions of a Former Worship Leader (which I highly recommend), says:\\n“No one should deny the power of music to proselytize! Pastors in particular must defend their flocks from false teaching, heresies and ‘ear ticklers’ who bring worldly sensuality into the congregation; you are right to point out how easily this comes into a church through worship music. It seems wiser to decline the use of what seems to be a perfectly good song, rather than to give any honor and hint of endorsement to the composer and his/her mission” (e-mail, May 24, 2009).\\nThird, the Contemporary Christian Music field is permeated with false christs and false gods.\\nWhatever doctrinal differences a Baptist would have with Martin Luther or John Wesley or Fanny Crosby, we share the same God, but that is often not true for Contemporary Christian Worship.\\nMany of the influential CCW artists worship a non-Trinitarian God. For example, Geron Davis and Joel Hemphill are “Jesus Only” Pentecostals who deny the Trinity. To deny the Trinity is to worship a false God.\\nOther CCW artists worship a non-vengeful God. Stuart Townend, for example, denies that God is vengeful, which is a brazen rejection of the very God of the Bible (Stuart Townend, “Mission: Worship, The Story Behind the Song”).\\nA great many of the CCM artists worship a God who is non-judgmental, universalistic, does not send people to an eternal hell, and puts no obligations on them. Consider the popularity of The Shack among CCM artists. It has been directly endorsed by Michael W. Smith and has been well received in prominent CCM circles such as Calvary Chapels, Vineyard churches, and Hillsong. It was promoted at the 2009 National Pastor’s Convention in San Diego, which was sponsored by Zondervan and InterVarsity Fellowship. Young was one of the speakers and a survey found that 57% had read the novel. Young was enthusiastically received, and in an interview with Andy Crouch, a senior editor of Christianity Today, there was not a hint of condemnation for his false god. Crouch is a CCM musician in his own right and led one of the praise and worship sessions in San Diego.\\nThe Shack is all about redefining God. It is about a man whose becomes bitter at God after his daughter is murdered and has a life-changing experience with God in the very shack where the murder occurred; but the God he encounters is most definitely not the God of the Bible.\\nYoung says the book is for those with “a longing that God is as kind and loving as we wish he was” (interview with Sherman Hu, Dec. 4, 2007). What he is referring to is the desire on the part of the natural man for a God who loves “unconditionally” and does not require obedience, does not require repentance, does not judge sin, and does not make men feel guilty for what they do.\\nIn that same interview, Young said that a woman wrote to him and said that her 22-year-old daughter came to her after reading the book and asked, “IS IT ALRIGHT IF I DIVORCE THE OLD GOD AND MARRY THE NEW ONE?”\\nThis is precisely what a large portion of the Contemporary Christian Music generation is doing.\\nYoung admits that the God of “The Shack” is different from the traditional God of Bible-believing Christianity and blasphemously says that the God who “watches from a distance and judges sin” is “a Christianized version of Zeus.”\\nThis reminds me of the modernist G. Bromley Oxnam, who called the God of the Old Testament “a dirty bully” in his 1944 book “Preaching in a Revolutionary Age.”\\nYoung depicts the triune God as a young Asian woman named “Sarayu” * (supposedly the Holy Spirit), an oriental carpenter who loves to have a good time (supposedly Jesus), and an older black woman named “Elousia” (supposedly God the Father). God the Father is also depicted as a guy with a ponytail and a goatee. (* The name “Sarayu” is from the Hindu scriptures and represents a mythical river in India on the shores of which the Hindu god Rama was born.)\\nYoung’s god is the god of the emerging church. He is cool, loves rock & roll, is non-judgmental, does not exercise wrath toward sin, does not send unbelievers to an eternal fiery hell, does not require repentance and the new birth, puts no obligations on people, doesn’t like traditional Bible churches, does not accept the Bible as the infallible Word of God, and does not mind if the early chapters of the Bible are interpreted as “myth.” (See “The Shack’s Cool God” at the Way of Life web site, www.wayoflife.org.)\\nThe false CCM non-judgmental, universalistic god is represented by emerging church leaders Brian McLaren and Rob Bell, both of whom are very popular with CCM artists.\\nMcLaren calls the God who punished Jesus on the cross for man’s sin “a God who is incapable of forgiving, unless he kicks somebody else” (McLaren, http://www.understandthetimes.org/mclarentrans.shtml and http://str.typepad.com/weblog/2006/01/brian_mclaren_p.html). He presents the traditional God of the Bible as a tyrant who “gets his way through coercion and violence and intimidation and domination. McLaren says that the “power of the blood” gospel “raises some questions about the goodness of God.”\\nRob Bell, author of the extremely popular and influential book Velvet Elvis, claims that the God who would allow multitudes to go to eternal hell is not great or mighty (Love Wins, location 1189-1229). He says that such God is not loving and calls the preaching of eternal hell “misguided and toxic.” says there is something wrong with this God and calls Him “terrifying and traumatizing and unbearable” (Love Wins, location 47-60, 1273-1287, 2098-2113). He even says that if an earthly father acted like the God who sends people to hell “we could contact child protection services immediately” (Love Wins, location 2085-2098).\\nIt is obvious that Bell worships a different God than the One we worship in “traditional” Baptist churches.\\nBell’s God is more akin to New Age panentheism than the God of the Bible. He describes God as “a force, an energy, a being calling out to us in many languages, using a variety of methods and events” (Love Wins, location 1710-1724).\\n“There is an energy in the world, a spark, an electricity that everything is plugged into. The Greeks called it zoe, the mystics call it ‘Spirit,’ and Obi-Wan called it ‘the Force’” (Love Wins, location 1749-1762).\\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that Bell recommends the writings of New Age pantheists. ----\\nBell worships a false christ. His Jesus is “supracultural ... present within all cultures ... refuses to be co-opted or owned by any one culture ... He doesn’t even state that those coming to the Father through him will even now that they are coming exclusively through him ... there is only mountain, but many paths. ... People come to Jesus in all sorts of ways ... Sometimes people use his name; other times they don’t” (Love Wins, location 1827-1840, 1865-1878, 1918-1933).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rebel Christ, which is certainly a false christ. Mark Stuart of Audio Adrenaline says, “Jesus Christ is the biggest rebel to ever walk the face of the earth” (Pensacola News Journal, Pensacola, Fla., March 1, 1998, pp. 1, 6E). Sonny of P.O.D. says, “We believe that Jesus was the first rebel; the first punk rocker” (http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/pod0700.phtml). This is absolute blasphemy. The Bible says rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft (1 Sam. 15:23). A rebel is a lawbreaker, but Christ was the lawgiver who He came to earth to fulfill the requirements of His own law (Matt. 5:17-19). Christ was not crucified for rebellion; He was crucified for testifying that He is God (John 10:33).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rock & roll party Christ. In his Live ... Radically Saved video Carman says, “Jesus is always cool; He’s got his thing together.” In Resurrection Rap Carman portrays Jesus as a street hippie; in The Standard he calls Jesus “J.C.”; and in Addicted to Jesus he speaks of “Jammin’ with the Lamb.” Robert Sweet of the Christian rock band Stryper had “Jesus Christ Rocks” painted on the back of his drummer chair. Petra claims that “God gave rock and roll to you/ Put it in the soul of every one.” In “Party in Heaven” the Daniel Band sing, “The Lamb and I are drinkin’ new wine.” Phil Driscoll says, “God is the King of Soul; He’s the King of all rhythm” (quoted by Tim Fisher, Battle for Christian Music, p. 82). Messiah Prophet Band says, “Jesus is the Master of Metal,” and Barren Cross says, “Better than pot, Jesus rocks.” John Fischer described God as puffing on a cigar and swaying to rock music (CCM Magazine, July 1984, p. 20), while J. Lee Grady says Jesus enjoys dancing with the angels and “grooving to the sound of Christian R&B pumped out of a boom box” (Charisma, July 2000).\\nThe fact that the CCM crowd typically worships a different kind of God than the “old-fashioned” Biblicist, is why they are perfectly comfortable using music that has been identified as sexy by the secular world.\\n“... that is what rock is all about--sex with a 100-megaton bomb, the beat” (Gene Simmons of KISS, Entertainment Tonight, ABC, Dec. 10, 1987).\\nNote that Simmons was not referring to the words of rock music; he was referring only to its backbeat rhythm.\\nMusic researchers Daniel and Bernadette Skubik, in their study on the neurophysiology of rock music, warned:\\n“Whether the words are evil, innocuous, or based in Holy Scripture, the overall neurophysiological effects generated by rock music remain the same. There is simply no such thing as Christian rock that is substantively different in its impact” (“The Neurophysiology of Rock,” an Appendix to Ken Blanchard, Pop Goes the Gospel. pp. 187ff).\\nThat statement doesn’t bother a CCM defender, because he sees Jesus as a rock & roll party Dude who loves a good time.\\n“Those who envision God as a special friend, a kind of lover, with whom they can have fun, see no problem in worshipping him by means of physically stimulating music. On the other hand, those who perceive God as a majestic, holy, and almighty Being to be approached with awe and reverence will only use the music that elevates them spiritually” (Samuele Bacchiocchi, The Christian and Rock Music).\\nBy the way, we urge churches to be careful even with older hymns. We have never said that if a hymn is old it is good or if it is new it is bad. We must examine all hymns as to musical character and doctrinal purity. In my estimation, there are hymns in the standard hymnals used by Independent Baptist churches that shouldn’t be used (e.g., “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “We’ve a Story to Tell to the Nations”).\\n____________________________\\nDistributed by Way of Life Literature\\'s Fundamental Baptist Information Service, an e-mail listing for Fundamental Baptists and other fundamentalist, Bible-believing Christians.

McLaren says that the “power of the blood” gospel “raises some questions about the goodness of God.”\\nRob Bell, author of the extremely popular and influential book Velvet Elvis, claims that the God who would allow multitudes to go to eternal hell is not great or mighty (Love Wins, location 1189-1229). He says that such God is not loving and calls the preaching of eternal hell “misguided and toxic.” says there is something wrong with this God and calls Him “terrifying and traumatizing and unbearable” (Love Wins, location 47-60, 1273-1287, 2098-2113). He even says that if an earthly father acted like the God who sends people to hell “we could contact child protection services immediately” (Love Wins, location 2085-2098).\\nIt is obvious that Bell worships a different God than the One we worship in “traditional” Baptist churches.\\nBell’s God is more akin to New Age panentheism than the God of the Bible. He describes God as “a force, an energy, a being calling out to us in many languages, using a variety of methods and events” (Love Wins, location 1710-1724).\\n“There is an energy in the world, a spark, an electricity that everything is plugged into. The Greeks called it zoe, the mystics call it ‘Spirit,’ and Obi-Wan called it ‘the Force’” (Love Wins, location 1749-1762).\\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that Bell recommends the writings of New Age pantheists. ----\\nBell worships a false christ. His Jesus is “supracultural ... present within all cultures ... refuses to be co-opted or owned by any one culture ... He doesn’t even state that those coming to the Father through him will even now that they are coming exclusively through him ... there is only mountain, but many paths. ... People come to Jesus in all sorts of ways ... Sometimes people use his name; other times they don’t” (Love Wins, location 1827-1840, 1865-1878, 1918-1933).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rebel Christ, which is certainly a false christ. Mark Stuart of Audio Adrenaline says, “Jesus Christ is the biggest rebel to ever walk the face of the earth” (Pensacola News Journal, Pensacola, Fla., March 1, 1998, pp. 1, 6E). Sonny of P.O.D. says, “We believe that Jesus was the first rebel; the first punk rocker” (http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/pod0700.phtml). This is absolute blasphemy. The Bible says rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft (1 Sam. 15:23). A rebel is a lawbreaker, but Christ was the lawgiver who He came to earth to fulfill the requirements of His own law (Matt. 5:17-19). Christ was not crucified for rebellion; He was crucified for testifying that He is God (John 10:33).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rock & roll party Christ. In his Live ... Radically Saved video Carman says, “Jesus is always cool; He’s got his thing together.” In Resurrection Rap Carman portrays Jesus as a street hippie; in The Standard he calls Jesus “J.C.”; and in Addicted to Jesus he speaks of “Jammin’ with the Lamb.” Robert Sweet of the Christian rock band Stryper had “Jesus Christ Rocks” painted on the back of his drummer chair. Petra claims that “God gave rock and roll to you/ Put it in the soul of every one.” In “Party in Heaven” the Daniel Band sing, “The Lamb and I are drinkin’ new wine.” Phil Driscoll says, “God is the King of Soul; He’s the King of all rhythm” (quoted by Tim Fisher, Battle for Christian Music, p. 82). Messiah Prophet Band says, “Jesus is the Master of Metal,” and Barren Cross says, “Better than pot, Jesus rocks.” John Fischer described God as puffing on a cigar and swaying to rock music (CCM Magazine, July 1984, p. 20), while J. Lee Grady says Jesus enjoys dancing with the angels and “grooving to the sound of Christian R&B pumped out of a boom box” (Charisma, July 2000).\\nThe fact that the CCM crowd typically worships a different kind of God than the “old-fashioned” Biblicist, is why they are perfectly comfortable using music that has been identified as sexy by the secular world.\\n“... that is what rock is all about--sex with a 100-megaton bomb, the beat” (Gene Simmons of KISS, Entertainment Tonight, ABC, Dec. 10, 1987).\\nNote that Simmons was not referring to the words of rock music; he was referring only to its backbeat rhythm.\\nMusic researchers Daniel and Bernadette Skubik, in their study on the neurophysiology of rock music, warned:\\n“Whether the words are evil, innocuous, or based in Holy Scripture, the overall neurophysiological effects generated by rock music remain the same. There is simply no such thing as Christian rock that is substantively different in its impact” (“The Neurophysiology of Rock,” an Appendix to Ken Blanchard, Pop Goes the Gospel. pp. 187ff).\\nThat statement doesn’t bother a CCM defender, because he sees Jesus as a rock & roll party Dude who loves a good time.\\n“Those who envision God as a special friend, a kind of lover, with whom they can have fun, see no problem in worshipping him by means of physically stimulating music. On the other hand, those who perceive God as a majestic, holy, and almighty Being to be approached with awe and reverence will only use the music that elevates them spiritually” (Samuele Bacchiocchi, The Christian and Rock Music).\\nBy the way, we urge churches to be careful even with older hymns. We have never said that if a hymn is old it is good or if it is new it is bad. We must examine all hymns as to musical character and doctrinal purity. In my estimation, there are hymns in the standard hymnals used by Independent Baptist churches that shouldn’t be used (e.g., “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “We’ve a Story to Tell to the Nations”).\\n____________________________\\nDistributed by Way of Life Literature\\'s Fundamental Baptist Information Service, an e-mail listing for Fundamental Baptists and other fundamentalist, Bible-believing Christians.

       "   'document': 'Category: Bigotry & Prejudice , Discussions , Race , Sex & Gender , Society & Culture\\nJuly 30th, 2009\\nAs is often the case during major online blowups of one kind or another, I have lately found myself having to explain more often than I would care to the difference between “You said something racist” and “You are a racist.” Granted, a lot of people, including anti-racist activists, make a step from the first statement to the next with no problem. But it isn’t always the case that someone who says racist or sexist or other oppressive/prejudiced things is themselves a prejudiced, racist, or sexist person. They can be, certainly. And if you give certain people enough time and space to talk, they’ll prove themselves so.\\nBut not always.\\nI want to try and unpack this in a way that will benefit future discourse because I think this is a very important point. I’m not the only person to point this out, of course. But it helps me to be a better debater in the future if I make posts and put my thoughts in order.\\nThe truth is, everyone can make prejudiced, offensive or oppressive statements. Many people have prejudiced thoughts. And I mean people as in humans as in everyone, not just those whose groups have historical power.\\nIn the case of those who do not belong to the dominant group, those statements can be hurtful, but often do not have the same impact. This is due to power imbalance. 1 When someone in the dominant group says something prejudiced or offensive, many people will (perhaps correctly) assume that they said such a thing because they really think and believe it. And if a person really believes that prejudiced thing, they must be prejudiced themselves. This is not illogical.\\nHowever, humans often are.\\nBias, prejudice, wrong thinking can be the product of conscious thought or unconscious/unexamined thought. It seems to me that a large percentage of people who bust out with really ignorant statements often do so because they have not ever, ever truly thought them through to their logical conclusions. If they did, or if someone challenged them to, their thinking could change.\\nMost activists realized this about people long ago. And thus many attempt to make a distinction between “You said something X-ist” and “You are a X-ist.”\\nDoing this is hard. Especially when the words that come out of people’s mouths are so very, very hurtful or very, very ignorant. It also doesn’t help when the person is acting like a jerk, all prejudicial talk aside. That is usually when people make the leap from “you said” to “you are” — I include myself in this.\\nSo, two thoughts. One for those who say things that get them in trouble, one for those who hear/read these things.\\nFirst, the guide to How Not To Be Insane When Accused of Racism is very, very useful and I suggest you read it. Also, I urge you to read or listen carefully when someone takes exception to something you said/wrote. Are they saying that you’re an X-ist? Or are they saying that what you said is X-ist? If they say the latter they’re trying to make the distinction I’ve been talking about here, and you will not help the conversation by assuming they’re accusing you of the former.\\nIf you are being accused of X-ism, then it would behoove you to examine what about your statement made people say that about you. Do not attempt to destroy, suppress or otherwise derail the discussion of racism (it’s not helpful either to you or to other arguing against you). And remember that admitting that you were wrong to say that X-ist thing is not the same as admitting you are an X-ist yourself.\\nSecond, for those who see or read offensive, X-ist, prejudicial, or stereotypical things, I suggest attempting to make a distinction between what folks say and what they are. It’s not an easy path to take, and it involves a lot of giving the benefit of the doubt, patience, and tolerance. But I think it does help to start by saying “you said something x-ist/offensive” instead of “you are an x-ist because you said that” unless this person has proven, through past or further statements and actions that they are indeed x-ist.\\nThen you can have at.\\nThat’s my advice, take it or leave it as you will. I do admit that for the activist, this can be hard. Especially when you run up against the thousandth instance of a particular prejudicial or offensive mindset. I make no claim on being perfect or even halfway decent in this regard at all times. I’m just trying.\\nI’m hoping for better discourse, but I have little hope of getting it from certain quarters of the population.\\nFootnotes\\nA black person calls a white person a cracker: that’s not cool. But it does not have the same impact, or have the same level of wrongness, as a white person calling a black person a nigger. Still, doing both things is wrong, period. [ ↩ ]\\n'},\n",

There is a wide range of variations that people may experience. For some, the ideal frequency of sexual behavior would include be at least 2 times a day, and for others maybe once a week. Sexual behaviors may range from kissing hello, holding hands, to oral sex, anal sex and intercourse. In the ideal, even with the huge differences between the natural level of desire, each partner will experience sexual desire for the other person and enjoy their own sexuality with themselves. A balanced couple will find a ways to make the needed compromises. Compromises may include the person with the higher sex drive finding ways to satisfy themselves, such as masturbation. Sometimes the partner with the lower sex drive, while not deriving any sexual pleasure (but emotional happiness) could offer to give their partner oral sex, or manual stimulation as a way to help her/him relieve her/his sexual tension. This usually works well, as long as the person receiving the sexual stimulation does not expect the person who is giving to be sexually excited. And of course, to show some appreciation that each partner has gone out of her/his way to accommodate to the other person\\'s need. A little bit of respect often goes a long ways.\\nNow that you have successfully administered the test to determine if you have ever experienced sexual aversions (see below), have you ever experienced sexual desire? I will assume yes. Most people at some point in their life have. If you closed your eyes and imagined yourself marooned on a desert island with the most perfect partner(s) how frequently would you engage in sexual behavior? Which sexual behaviors would you enjoy the most? Which ones would you avoid? When is the last time that you felt hungry for sex? When are you sexually excitable? To help you answer some of these questions, have you ever . . . (again please write in if you can think of other things that were not included in this group).\\nFelt like your partner knew your body better than you do\\x85 to the point that you can\\'t wait to be touched by him/her again.\\nHad a wet dream.\\nSexual Desire - Anticipated how you were going to touch each other, to the point where you could almost feel her/his breath on your skin.\\n\\'Accidently\\', left something at her/his house so that you could see this person again.\\nSexual Arousal - Do you find yourself getting \\'hard\\' for no reason (both men and women get \\'hard\\' when they are sexually excited).\\nTaken an extra shower, put on your favorite clothes, best smelling perfume/cologne so that you will look and smell more appealing to your partner.\\nSexual Fantasy - Fantasized about what will happen in the evening, or tried to orchestrate a particular situation to occur where the two of you (or even three of you) could get super close.\\nMasturbation - Masturbated while imagining it was someone else touching you?\\nFelt so in love with a person, that you just wanted them in every way possible.\\nUsed sex as a form of exercise so that you could strengthen your abs and/or arm muscles in a more fun way than going to the gym for a traditional workout with weights.\\nUsed sex to express an emotion?\\nFelt alive while having sex?\\nWanted to act on a sexual tingling right away without regards to anything else?\\nHow does this category fit you? What is your level of sexual desire? In my experience, most people fluctuate between the two groups. There may be periods of ones life where your sexual desire will be extremely high or extremely low. Maybe sex is a stress release, or sex is stressful. Maybe you are feeling really in love with your partner, or are in the midst of fighting. Whatever the causes, having a different sexual libido in a relationship than your partner, can be problematic. Especially, if it used to match well. This difference can cause the person who is not in the mood for sex to feel guilty about their lack of desire, or the person with a high sex drive may feel rejected.\\nIf you are in a sexual relationship with someone at the moment, compare your answers against each other? Did you learn anything new? What was difficult for you to share? What was hard for you to hear? If you are single what would be hard to share? What would be easy? Do you imagine that it would be easier to share you responses with a close friend or a lover? Why?\\nIn my experience as a therapist, what I have found to be most useful in a discussion between couples with different levels of sex drives is to focus on the following:\\nDetermine if and when a change in desire occurred\\nDefine what is wanted\\nDefine what can be done to make a change\\nNegotiate for a change\\nNote that most of the focus is on communication. It is mostly on your ability to communicate your needs to one another. Remember, sexual problems do not usually disappear over night, change takes time. Often in the beginning, you may not trust the changes to be real, therefore, relax, and do not work too hard to find a \\'solution\\'. Rather, simply take the time now to understand what caused the changes in sexual desire to have occurred, or when did the different levels of sexual desire to become problematic in the relationship.\\n(Please note: in some relationships men want more sex, while in others women want more sex. This is not an issue of man versus woman, rather it is an issue of two (or even three) individuals negotiating their needs).\\nIn the past, the sex life with your partner has never been particularly stimulating for you, therefore you may not look forward to your next experience.\\nYour partner is not a particularly talented lover, and thus does not touch you well. He/she does not know your body well enough to know how to physically stimulate you so that you could have an orgasm.\\nYour partner\\'s desires and your desires clash. For example when you want more genital play he wants to feel more emotionally connected.\\nMaybe one person feels used and abused, not valued and therefore not sexual.\\nThe two of you no longer plan in advance to have sex. Often couples who have been together for a while stop planning on having evenings that are set aside for sex. Suddenly, they find themselves getting caught up in the day to day pressures of life and no longer prioritize simply spending quality time together.\\nThe two of you are in the midst of a big argument, therefore the last thing you want is to be sexual.\\nSex feels empty and disconnected. Therefore, it does not feel like a pleasurable experience.\\nYour partner is not physically attractive to you. Maybe he gained weight. Maybe she lost too much weight. Maybe he got a haircut. Maybe her breath stinks.\\nMaybe you are having difficulty having an orgasm, experiencing premature ejaculations, having difficulty maintaining an erection, or feel ugly; therefore averting sex is a way to avoid your embarrassment caused by your discomfort.\\nIt might be that the side effect of one of the medications that you are on, reduces sexual drive. This is a pretty common side effect for some forms of prescription medication.\\nOld sexual tapes from the past, the ones that say sex is dirty or wrong (etc).\\nAcute and chronic illness or pain decreases sexual desire. For example, a woman who has had chronic back pain, may have a harder time focusing on the parts of her body which are being stimulated because the physical chronic pain that she feels every waking minute is too overwhelming. Or maybe the man who has survived a heart attack is now afraid that any extreme feeling may aggravate his condition, thus he avoids all situations where he could make himself in a vulnerable situation.\\nThen there is always good old depression. Depression simply slows down the whole body, so therefore everything might feel less enjoyable.\\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, than your sex drive may be lower than it naturally is. In fact, I would be surprised if this category does not fit you at all. Almost everyone at some point or another has experienced sexual aversions. The question is what to do about it. As you have heard me say a million times already, the best way to deal with this situation is to be open and honest about it\\x85 both with yourself, and with your partner. A little bit of communication can go a long way. You are not doing yourself or your partner any favors by hiding this information. You do have a sex drive and it is best to start tapping into it - so that you can better enjoy your sexuality.\\nSex Drive Topics\\n'},\n",

       "   'document': 'Resources\\nIntroduction\\nI did the following channeling at the request of a man who was in jail for having sexually violated a young boy. While words cannot express how strongly I feel that the way pedophiles violate and abuse trusting and innocent children is one of the most heinous crimes in the world, I was given encouragement by my spirit guides to go ahead and do the channeling. To my own surprise, I found that I was able to bring through material that was much less judgmental than I expected of myself.\\nWhen I reviewed the material after the channeling, I realized that the information was non-specific enough that it could be shared with others without violating client confidentiality, and I hoped that it might be of some help to others. (I received permission to share this material from the man for whom I did the channeling. Otherwise, private psychic sessions are not only entirely private, but I destroy all copies of the session afterward except for the copy the client receives.)\\nAlthough I did this channeling in 1993, and although I had permission from the person I did the reading for, I hesitated about sharing it—especially about putting it on the Web—for quite a time because of the subject matter. However, this reading is quite gentle and not at all graphic. Though I wouldn\\'t recommend it, a child could read this without being exposed to anything \"nasty.\"\\nHaving said that, I will also add that I found this information to be of a great help in understanding, not just pedophilia, but the nature of abused children and how it can come about that someone who was once a child himself, perhaps a child violated, could grow up into someone who violates children in turn. I still think it is horrible, and I would not willingly or knowingly associate with a pedophile, but it is helpful and potentially even healing to have a different perspective on the subject.\\nWarning! If you are involved in any way with someone who is a child molester, do not—I repeat, absolutely do NOT ever, EVER trust that person with a child. It doesn\\'t matter how much they claim to be different or how earnestly they promise that they won\\'t do it again. In any given lifetime, once a child molester, always a child molester. Although the entity I was channeling says otherwise, I believe that it is only possible for a pedophile to heal from this kind of horrific illness through a miracle. I am not saying miracles don\\'t happen, because they do. What I am saying is that such a miracle would have to be wanted by the person, and I believe that people make the choice to experience what they experience for spiritual reasons that require the illness.\\nOn the other hand, if you have suffered from this kind of abuse (that is, if you are a child sexual abuse survivor), I think it is entirely possible for you to heal. I hope this channeling can be one small part of that healing. I have provided some links below the channeled materials for further information.\\nEverything from below this point until the ending copyright statement, with the exception of material in [brackets], is channeled material. Anything in [brackets] is an editorial enhancement from me. Parenthetical comments are also channeled material.\\nThe Transcript of the Channeling\\nFirst, we would like to let you know that you are not alone in your struggles to understand where you have landed in time and space. There are many such just like you, many whom you are helping simply by working through your own puzzle. You needn\\'t understand the mechanism of how you are helping; however, we will say a little on it, as you are curious.\\nWhenever anyone works in time and space on solving difficulties, the energies they create, of willingness, determination, doggedness, and openness to the new, spread out around them like the overlapping circles from rocks dropped into a still pond. Your efforts to solve your puzzle (note we are not calling it a problem) are like so many rocks dropped into the still pond of existence. In this case, however, existence is not a still pond either, no more than you are. There are many other people dropping their own stones into the same pond. Therefore, what you do immediately moves out and interacts with what others are doing. Though a very tiny ship sailing upon these ripples would feel tossed and turned about with no harmony or rhyme, the interference patterns thus created create a new and lovely image if seen from above.\\nYou have chosen a difficulty that many in your time are working on. You are correct in this. How each person manifests the difficulty differs, yet the underlying core thought or belief (or cultural issue, if you will) is the same. It centers around why we are here, and what we are here to do.\\nPeople in your time are now working on changing the entire structure of their culture. They are stepping up, you might say, into a newer and higher and finer vibration. It is much like the interface between two rivers; there is much turbulence and uncertainty at first, and then the flow deepens and strengthens and steadies into its new course, with certainty and joy.\\nFor joy is what it is all about. You are here to love and be loved; to experience joy and relief from all those old thoughts and habits of behaving. Yet your parents, and the parents of many many people in this culture, believed that joy had to be earned, and then, even if earned, that it had to be measured out in tiny quantities. YOU ARE MADE TO BE TOTALLY JOYFUL. Life is meant to be a blast, to use a colloquialism. Yet joy is denied.\\nEach child starts [life] knowing joy. Yet very early on, the child is confused by the parent\\'s messages: \"We love you,\" they say, and then they do unloving things. THEY DO NOT DO THESE UNLOVING THINGS TO \"GET YOU.\" They do them because they BELIEVE that what they are doing is the only way. Remember, they had parents who in their day had beliefs about the world; many of those beliefs were that life is harsh, and should be harsh, and so they make it harsh.

There is ALWAYS another way.

And at the same time, that child is exposed to many many images, words, thoughts (for children read thoughts), and stories that equate love with sex. No, they are not the same, not in the way your society uses the terms, yet a young child is quite literal.\\nImagine now we have a young child who is starved for love and is not getting it. And then they are told that love is sex, and sex is love. THAT YOUNG CHILD CONTINUES TO EXIST WITHIN THE ADULT in a very real way. And it continues to seek the love it never got when younger. Only now it is seeking the love from the adult it has become, rather than from the outside, since, TO THAT CHILD, there is little or no difference between one adult and another. The adult represents the provider of love. So when that child asks the adult it has become to behave in a way that makes the child feel loved, the child is also asking, in a very powerful way that can feel like a compulsion to the adult, for WHAT IT PERCEIVES the adult to be capable of giving. In this case, sex. Remembering now that sex = love in that child\\'s mind, ALTHOUGH THAT CHILD STILL KNOWS THE TRUTH OF WHAT REAL LOVE IS ALL ABOUT. The child, you might say, has resigned itself to \"playing by the grownups\\' rules,\" and it perceives that its particular grownup (that is, the person you have become; remember we are still speaking of the same person here as both a child and an adult), as an expression of the child\\'s parents, only knows how to give love in certain ways.\\nWhen we say that the grownup you have become is perceived as an expression of the child\\'s parents (again, you are also that child), we mean that children form their ideas of what grownups are based on their own experience. What else can they base it on? So when you grow up, no matter what you might like to think about yourself or of how you might have changed old patterns (and indeed, you may well have), THE CHILD THAT YOU STILL ARE perceives you as being little or no different from the parents (or parent substitutes) you once had.\\nHow, you might ask, can you heal such a thing? It might sound hopeless—if that child inside you already has such fixed images of what grownups are like, is healing possible? The answer is a resounding YES. COMPLETE HEALING IS POSSIBLE.\\nIn fact, complete healing is far more possible in this new way of looking at yourself than it is in the old way that says that the child you once were is dead and gone. Indeed it is not dead and gone, but is instead a living entity, though now sharing your body, with thoughts and rights of its own.\\nBearing in mind, then, that that child exists now, you might then see how it is possible to contact that child; to open a dialog with it; to speak with it, listen to its hurts and dreams and fears and yes, wisdom—a deep wisdom that may astound you. Become aware that that child can change its ideas and beliefs about the world and life and love and sex; can change its ideas, in fact, far more readily because it is still a child and still believes in magic. Not the magic of presto-chango, but a real and deep magic of life itself becoming more than you think possible.\\nWe hope this discussion has been helpful; we now return you to Marina\\'s \"normal\" entities so they can address your specific questions.\\nA Short Discussion\\n[A clarification here, in case the channeling itself isn\\'t clear: The dynamic is that the child molester recreates his relationship with his parents by molesting a child.

So he, as a representative of his parents, gives \"love\" to the child he is molesting, who represents himself as a child.

       "   'document': 'Resources\\nIntroduction\\nI did the following channeling at the request of a man who was in jail for having sexually violated a young boy. While words cannot express how strongly I feel that the way pedophiles violate and abuse trusting and innocent children is one of the most heinous crimes in the world, I was given encouragement by my spirit guides to go ahead and do the channeling. To my own surprise, I found that I was able to bring through material that was much less judgmental than I expected of myself.\\nWhen I reviewed the material after the channeling, I realized that the information was non-specific enough that it could be shared with others without violating client confidentiality, and I hoped that it might be of some help to others. (I received permission to share this material from the man for whom I did the channeling. Otherwise, private psychic sessions are not only entirely private, but I destroy all copies of the session afterward except for the copy the client receives.)\\nAlthough I did this channeling in 1993, and although I had permission from the person I did the reading for, I hesitated about sharing it—especially about putting it on the Web—for quite a time because of the subject matter. However, this reading is quite gentle and not at all graphic. Though I wouldn\\'t recommend it, a child could read this without being exposed to anything \"nasty.\"\\nHaving said that, I will also add that I found this information to be of a great help in understanding, not just pedophilia, but the nature of abused children and how it can come about that someone who was once a child himself, perhaps a child violated, could grow up into someone who violates children in turn. I still think it is horrible, and I would not willingly or knowingly associate with a pedophile, but it is helpful and potentially even healing to have a different perspective on the subject.\\nWarning! If you are involved in any way with someone who is a child molester, do not—I repeat, absolutely do NOT ever, EVER trust that person with a child. It doesn\\'t matter how much they claim to be different or how earnestly they promise that they won\\'t do it again. In any given lifetime, once a child molester, always a child molester. Although the entity I was channeling says otherwise, I believe that it is only possible for a pedophile to heal from this kind of horrific illness through a miracle. I am not saying miracles don\\'t happen, because they do. What I am saying is that such a miracle would have to be wanted by the person, and I believe that people make the choice to experience what they experience for spiritual reasons that require the illness.\\nOn the other hand, if you have suffered from this kind of abuse (that is, if you are a child sexual abuse survivor), I think it is entirely possible for you to heal. I hope this channeling can be one small part of that healing. I have provided some links below the channeled materials for further information.\\nEverything from below this point until the ending copyright statement, with the exception of material in [brackets], is channeled material. Anything in [brackets] is an editorial enhancement from me. Parenthetical comments are also channeled material.\\nThe Transcript of the Channeling\\nFirst, we would like to let you know that you are not alone in your struggles to understand where you have landed in time and space. There are many such just like you, many whom you are helping simply by working through your own puzzle. You needn\\'t understand the mechanism of how you are helping; however, we will say a little on it, as you are curious.\\nWhenever anyone works in time and space on solving difficulties, the energies they create, of willingness, determination, doggedness, and openness to the new, spread out around them like the overlapping circles from rocks dropped into a still pond. Your efforts to solve your puzzle (note we are not calling it a problem) are like so many rocks dropped into the still pond of existence. In this case, however, existence is not a still pond either, no more than you are. There are many other people dropping their own stones into the same pond. Therefore, what you do immediately moves out and interacts with what others are doing. Though a very tiny ship sailing upon these ripples would feel tossed and turned about with no harmony or rhyme, the interference patterns thus created create a new and lovely image if seen from above.\\nYou have chosen a difficulty that many in your time are working on. You are correct in this. How each person manifests the difficulty differs, yet the underlying core thought or belief (or cultural issue, if you will) is the same. It centers around why we are here, and what we are here to do.\\nPeople in your time are now working on changing the entire structure of their culture. They are stepping up, you might say, into a newer and higher and finer vibration. It is much like the interface between two rivers; there is much turbulence and uncertainty at first, and then the flow deepens and strengthens and steadies into its new course, with certainty and joy.\\nFor joy is what it is all about. You are here to love and be loved; to experience joy and relief from all those old thoughts and habits of behaving. Yet your parents, and the parents of many many people in this culture, believed that joy had to be earned, and then, even if earned, that it had to be measured out in tiny quantities. YOU ARE MADE TO BE TOTALLY JOYFUL. Life is meant to be a blast, to use a colloquialism. Yet joy is denied.\\nEach child starts [life] knowing joy. Yet very early on, the child is confused by the parent\\'s messages: \"We love you,\" they say, and then they do unloving things. THEY DO NOT DO THESE UNLOVING THINGS TO \"GET YOU.\" They do them because they BELIEVE that what they are doing is the only way. Remember, they had parents who in their day had beliefs about the world; many of those beliefs were that life is harsh, and should be harsh, and so they make it harsh. Inside, they are bitterly creating this harsh reality because they don\\'t believe there is any other way. Yet there is. There is. We would have you know that THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. There is ALWAYS another way. Remember that when you are feeling stuck in that dark cave of your thoughts and despair.\\nSo here we have a sensitive and loving child whose attempts at expressing love naturally are rebuffed. (That is, the child is attempting to express love in what is a natural fashion; unfortunately, the adults are not able to see how natural and healthy that child\\'s gestures and words are, and so they punish the child.) And at the same time, that child is exposed to many many images, words, thoughts (for children read thoughts), and stories that equate love with sex.

Being a member of one doesn\\'t determine whether a person is a Christian.\\nThe real issue is whether the person individually has Jesus Christ living inside of him or her...if they actually have a personal relationship with God.\\nIn the Gospel of John, we are told, \"to all who received him [referring to Jesus], to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.\"1 Why do we have to become children of God? Because until then, God is distant. We may know he\\'s there. We may know we are supposed to worship him. We may even know that in times of need, he\\'s the one to pray to. But there is a distance we are aware of, and it is because of our sin.\\nNow, as long as we live and breathe, guess what, we\\'re going to sin. We\\'re going to do things our way instead of God\\'s way. But our sin need not remain a barrier between us and God. Here\\'s how.\\nThe Bible says that there is a penalty for sin, and it might be greater than you\\'d expect. The penalty for sin is death. It\\'s not just the penalty for sins like murder. It\\'s God\\'s judgment against any and all sins. The Bible says, \"For the wages of sin is death...\"2 So that we would not have to die eternally separated from God because of our sin, Jesus died in our place. He fully paid for our sin. And offers us complete forgiveness. Not temporary forgiveness. Even for the sins we will commit in the future, we can have his forgiveness now, because Jesus died for all of our sin. We can immediately begin a close, personal relationship with him, that barrier of sin being gone. It isn\\'t that we become perfect and no longer sin. But we become forgiven when we see that Jesus died for our sin, in our place.\\n\"Yet now God in his gracious kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins. For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God\\'s anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood, sacrificing his life for us.\"3\\nWhen we receive Jesus Christ into our lives, God declares us \"not guilty\" and he says that we are now \"made right with God.\" Our relationship with God has begun in a real way, where we no longer know God is \"out there,\" but instead we know that he lives inside of us. We have God\\'s forgiveness, a relationship with him. \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"4\\nIf you would like to be certain that you have a personal relationship with God, your sins forgiven, and no longer any barrier between you and God, the following explain how to have this now: Knowing God Personally .\\n'}]}"

Love Love and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration. Differences Between Love and Sex Love Love is a feeling (emotional). There is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody. Love involves feelings of romance and/or attraction. Sex: Sex is an event or act (physical). There are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common. Can happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation) Abstinence The word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you. Abstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin toskin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way). You also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\" Ways to Express Love Without Sex There are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them. Go to the movies. Or just hang out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n',\n",

Love Love and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration. Differences Between Love and Sex Love Love is a feeling (emotional). There is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody. Love involves feelings of romance and/or attraction. Sex: Sex is an event or act (physical). There are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common. Can happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation) Abstinence The word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you. Abstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin toskin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way). You also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\" Ways to Express Love Without Sex There are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them. Go to the movies. Or just hang out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n', 'page_rank': 1.1797776e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1217wb-96-18723', '_score': 29.766691, '_source': {'title': '<em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> <em>Love</em> <em>And</em> <em>Sex</em> - Student.com Articles', 'uuid': 'aa6f3db7-cc36-5621-aea8-278287f6cc37', 'score': 2396.9736, 'document': 'Difference Between Love And Sex\\nYou are here:\\nFind a School Near You\\nYour Zip Code:\\nPaying For College\\nSex VS.

And now let us pay attention to the fact that people of different gunas behave differently not only in religious practice or toward Messengers of God, but also in relationships with each other, in particular, in sexual relationships. For people of different gunas and for those who are above the gunas sex is quite different.\\nIn case of people of the tamas guna, sex is egoistic and coarse as these people themselves. They are inclined to the emotions of condemnation and hatred, thus they may hate sex and their sexual partners. However, when they are driven by passions, they may continue to \\x93use\\x94 others for satisfying themselves.\\nThis attitude to sex is manifested in the obscene language — the language of tamas guna — where sex appears as something dirty and even more — as a means for defiling other people.\\nThose are people of this guna who condemn and hate sex in oth-ers, they are ready even to stone them because of their sex. But they permit it for themselves.\\nIn the earthly Christianity, we can see one of the manifestations of the tamas guna in the form of the Orthodox dogma of \\x93immaculate\\x94 conception * of Jesus by His mother Mary. From this turn of speech it follows that all other conceptions are maculated! Can all parents agree that their children are a product of something maculated?\\nPeople of tamas guna are not able to understand that sex of other people may be very different from theirs: it can be not the means of satisfying one\\x92s primitive animal passion (called sexual attraction in scientific language), but the means of expressing love, giving oneself to another, searching and finding mutual harmony — the harmony of merged consciousnesses loving each other. Through sattvic sexual love, people can really learn merging consciousnesses in love, so that having learned it they can merge themselves as consciousnesses with the Consciousness of the beloved Heavenly Father.\\nBut who is capable of such love? Only sattvic people. And who are sattvic people? What is the criterion here? They are people who have mastered the cordial love — i.e. the emotions of the \\x93opened\\x94 spiritual heart. Such people are quite few, though.\\nFrom the above said, one may see that for some people sex is a way to go deeper into tamas, and every new sexual act for them is really another step on the way to hell. Yet, for others sex is the means of establishing oneself in harmony, subtlety, purity, emotional love, developing the ability of caring for others, training oneself in merging the consciousnesses in the embrace of love, studying in the school of God on the Path to Mergence with Him.\\nThis is why Jesus gave directly opposite recommendations regarding sex to different people: to some He recommended to restrict their sexuality, while to others He preached the opposite.\\nLet us see it in examples:\\n\\x93You have heard that it was said to the ancients, \\x91You shall not commit adultery.\\x92 But I say to you that whoever looks on a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\\x94 (Matt 5:27-28)\\n\\x93\\x85 Whoever shall marry her who is put away commits adultery!\\x94 (Matt 5:32).\\nNow, let us follow the episode with Mary Magdalene (narrated by her) when she was blamed for adultery and brought for judging to Jesus:\\n\\x93They caught me and wanted to stone me. I, sinful, loved one man who was married and had three children. Relatives of his wife brought me to the square and began to shout in a loud voice, \\x91Let us kill the adulteress! She desecrated the law!\\x92\\n\\x93Then\\x85 Christ told them, \\x91Let him, who is without a sin, throw the first stone!\\x92 And (He)\\x85 made the crowd disperse.\\n\\x93Then He approached me and kneeled before me.\\n\\x93\\x85 I was burning with shame and fear. The sublime was taking place in me, in the soul. I fell on the ground and cried. He stroked my hair and said:\\n\\x91My dear sister, find strength to listen to Me! Much evil exists on this Earth; many lies have been said by the evil one! Forget that you are a sinner and tell Me whether your heart lives when you love?\\x92.\\n\\x91It does, Lord! When I do not love, it is dead!\\x92\\n\\x91Then love, heavenly sister, and do not sin anymore, thinking that you are a sinner.\\x92\\x94 (Questions of Mary, 20-27).\\nJesus told her also the following:\\n\\x93What is sinful in this world is righteous in My Father\\x92s Kingdom! The (True) Life is the life of love, not the life of hatred!\\n\\x93Many of the \\x91righteous\\x92 hate and condemn. But I say to you, an adulteress who does not hate will be better in the Judgement Day than the \\x91righteous\\x92 who condemn!\\x94 (Questions of Mary, 13-15)\\nJesus told Mary an important rule of sexual relationships between spiritually advanced people: their relationships have to be a secret between them and God. In other words, only God has to be the Witness and Guide of their love. Apostle Philip wrote the same: \\x93If a marriage is open to the public, it becomes prostitution\\x85\\x94 (The Gospel of Philip, 122).\\nMary Magdalene became a disciple of Jesus and joined His group. There is an important description of her relationship with Jesus:\\n\\x93\\x85 The companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene. He loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples saw it and asked Him, \\x91Why do you love her more than all of us?\\x92 The Savior answered to them, \\x91Why do I not love you like her?\\x92\\x94 (The Gospel of Philip, 55).\\nVladimir Antonov\\n', 'page_rank': 1.2749265e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0200tw-85-01106', '_score': 28.232037, '_source': {'title': '<em>The</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>Love</em> <em>and</em> Lust', 'uuid': 'd98c50fd-d45e-54c8-b53c-ce7e0634944c', 'score': 2010.6464, 'document': 'Sunday, 11 December 2011 10:08 Jose Bosque\\nUser Rating:\\nPoor\\nBest\\nRecently I was asked by a young Twitter friend to develop a Dating Blog. Obviously, he must have like our JC On Point Youth and Singles magazine inside of www.JaxChristian.com and wanted more.\\nMy first reaction was when will I find the time? With 4 websites, 5 blogs and 35 Social Media networks plus all the other work I do for others, my greatest need is time. I also thought to myself, what do I have to say to this generation concerning dating? Things have changed so much and it has been years since I lived in that world. Well, like a true romantic and with my love for young people it wasn’t long before the Holy Spirit gave me this word.\\nFirst, I would like to say that there is a vast difference between Love and Lust.\\xa0 If you hang with me I want to take a few minutes to describe some of the differences.\\nWhat is the basis behind this article?\\nI believe in real love. *-I believe it is much greater than a 21 gun salutes, seeing stars, hearing bells and having a squadron of jets flying overhead as Hollywood portrays it in movies. Real love is all of that and much more. Real love is MAGNETIC!\\nI believe this generation has settled for less. It’s all about me, my needs and my comfort. Driven by selfish desires people are shacking up for convenience but there is no spark between them. (For you newbies “shacking up” is the 20th century term for living together without marriage or your “try before you buy” philosophy.)\\nHow do you know when you are driven by Lust?\\nLust is comfortable, it’s calculated and convenient. It gratifies our flesh and lust is not complicated. Relationships on this level are somewhat easier to jump in and out of and except for the usual division of personal effects it (feels) relatively harmless. While at first there might be some amount of regret the more you do it the harder your heart gets and the easier it is to do.\\nLet me describe the calculated side of lust. You never give more than you get. Extra giving is only the result of extra getting. Both sides keep the ruler out and no one is willing to invest an ounce of extra effort in the relationship. Yes, they are in a relationship but it’s measured and unless you are drunk or high it’s really boring (and they are really boring together.)\\nLust is driven by the flesh and the flesh is all about externals so when body parts head south because of age so does desire to stay together. (Lust cannot weather sickness, loss of a job, distance or anything which demands a withdrawal since lust makes no deposits.)\\nLust is a decision of the mind and sex is its finish line. (self-gratification) Next time you \"make love\" time how long the \"afterglow\" lasts. It speaks volumes!\\nIn a Lust relationship the two never become one. They may learn to co-exist for appearances sake, for the childrens sake,or even for their respect for the institution of marriage but they will never be one.\\nHow do you know it’s Real Love.\\nReal love is based in the heart. The Bible says the eyes are the window to your soul or heart. That is why when people are in love you can see it in their eyes.\\nReal love is not rational or logical. Real love is chemistry. It is unexplainable it just is! It’s exciting to the heart and its overwhelming to the mind.\\nReal love has no expectations because it too busy giving. It would rather give than receive. It doesn’t have time to measure because it cherishes the relationship.\\nReal love costs because it requires deposits and withdrawals. That is why Real love needs so much communication because it cares so much.\\nSeparation, time and distance cannot quench real love because it doesn’t live just in the present but lives in the heart internally and eternally.\\nAge cannot affect real love. In fact the longer the give and take the stronger the bonds of love become.\\nReal love is spontaneous it doesn’t matter where we are going as long as we are going together. It doesn’t need Las Vegas because there is already enough music and bright lights in the hearts of those who are truly in love.\\nSex in real love is the culmination but never the destination. Real love doesn’t need sex. It gives because it loves not because it should, it owes or it’s expected of me.\\nReal Love begins with a 0% expectancy rate- Real love is not thinking about ROI (Return on Investment)\\nReal Love is a dying process-(there is an old cuban proverb that says\"To Him that loves what he is doing even though it kill him, His death will taste like Glory!\"\\nI pray that you will wait for love. It would be sad to find yourself getting old after hundreds of mates or getting to a place where you are having to be told you need to sit together because you are married.\\n1 Cor 13:4-8\\n(from THE MESSAGE: The Bible in Contemporary Language © 2002 by Eugene H. Peterson. All rights reserved.)\\n4 Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn\\'t want what it doesn\\'t have. Love doesn\\'t strut, Doesn\\'t have a swelled head,\\xa05 Doesn\\'t force itself on others, Isn\\'t always \"me first, \"Doesn\\'t fly off the handle, Doesn\\'t keep score of the sins of others,\\xa06 Doesn\\'t revel when others grovel, Takes pleasure in the flowering of truth,\\xa07 Puts up with anything, Trusts God always, Always looks for the best, Never looks back, But keeps going to the end. 8 Love never dies. (from THE MESSAGE Bible)\\nFor the record, only Christ can heal the wounds and scars (they are there whether you see them or not) that this generation is inflicting on each other.\\nI know there so much more to say but maybe some of you reading this can take a few minutes and share your comments below so that this generation can get some help.

While words cannot express how strongly I feel that the way pedophiles violate and abuse trusting and innocent children is one of the most heinous crimes in the world, I was given encouragement by my spirit guides to go ahead and do the channeling. To my own surprise, I found that I was able to bring through material that was much less judgmental than I expected of myself.\\nWhen I reviewed the material after the channeling, I realized that the information was non-specific enough that it could be shared with others without violating client confidentiality, and I hoped that it might be of some help to others. (I received permission to share this material from the man for whom I did the channeling. Otherwise, private psychic sessions are not only entirely private, but I destroy all copies of the session afterward except for the copy the client receives.)\\nAlthough I did this channeling in 1993, and although I had permission from the person I did the reading for, I hesitated about sharing it—especially about putting it on the Web—for quite a time because of the subject matter. However, this reading is quite gentle and not at all graphic. Though I wouldn\\'t recommend it, a child could read this without being exposed to anything \"nasty.\"\\nHaving said that, I will also add that I found this information to be of a great help in understanding, not just pedophilia, but the nature of abused children and how it can come about that someone who was once a child himself, perhaps a child violated, could grow up into someone who violates children in turn. I still think it is horrible, and I would not willingly or knowingly associate with a pedophile, but it is helpful and potentially even healing to have a different perspective on the subject.\\nWarning! If you are involved in any way with someone who is a child molester, do not—I repeat, absolutely do NOT ever, EVER trust that person with a child. It doesn\\'t matter how much they claim to be different or how earnestly they promise that they won\\'t do it again. In any given lifetime, once a child molester, always a child molester. Although the entity I was channeling says otherwise, I believe that it is only possible for a pedophile to heal from this kind of horrific illness through a miracle. I am not saying miracles don\\'t happen, because they do. What I am saying is that such a miracle would have to be wanted by the person, and I believe that people make the choice to experience what they experience for spiritual reasons that require the illness.\\nOn the other hand, if you have suffered from this kind of abuse (that is, if you are a child sexual abuse survivor), I think it is entirely possible for you to heal. I hope this channeling can be one small part of that healing. I have provided some links below the channeled materials for further information.\\nEverything from below this point until the ending copyright statement, with the exception of material in [brackets], is channeled material. Anything in [brackets] is an editorial enhancement from me. Parenthetical comments are also channeled material.\\nThe Transcript of the Channeling\\nFirst, we would like to let you know that you are not alone in your struggles to understand where you have landed in time and space. There are many such just like you, many whom you are helping simply by working through your own puzzle. You needn\\'t understand the mechanism of how you are helping; however, we will say a little on it, as you are curious.\\nWhenever anyone works in time and space on solving difficulties, the energies they create, of willingness, determination, doggedness, and openness to the new, spread out around them like the overlapping circles from rocks dropped into a still pond. Your efforts to solve your puzzle (note we are not calling it a problem) are like so many rocks dropped into the still pond of existence. In this case, however, existence is not a still pond either, no more than you are. There are many other people dropping their own stones into the same pond. Therefore, what you do immediately moves out and interacts with what others are doing. Though a very tiny ship sailing upon these ripples would feel tossed and turned about with no harmony or rhyme, the interference patterns thus created create a new and lovely image if seen from above.\\nYou have chosen a difficulty that many in your time are working on. You are correct in this. How each person manifests the difficulty differs, yet the underlying core thought or belief (or cultural issue, if you will) is the same. It centers around why we are here, and what we are here to do.\\nPeople in your time are now working on changing the entire structure of their culture. They are stepping up, you might say, into a newer and higher and finer vibration. It is much like the interface between two rivers; there is much turbulence and uncertainty at first, and then the flow deepens and strengthens and steadies into its new course, with certainty and joy.\\nFor joy is what it is all about. You are here to love and be loved; to experience joy and relief from all those old thoughts and habits of behaving. Yet your parents, and the parents of many many people in this culture, believed that joy had to be earned, and then, even if earned, that it had to be measured out in tiny quantities. YOU ARE MADE TO BE TOTALLY JOYFUL. Life is meant to be a blast, to use a colloquialism. Yet joy is denied.\\nEach child starts [life] knowing joy. Yet very early on, the child is confused by the parent\\'s messages: \"We love you,\" they say, and then they do unloving things. THEY DO NOT DO THESE UNLOVING THINGS TO \"GET YOU.\" They do them because they BELIEVE that what they are doing is the only way. Remember, they had parents who in their day had beliefs about the world; many of those beliefs were that life is harsh, and should be harsh, and so they make it harsh. Inside, they are bitterly creating this harsh reality because they don\\'t believe there is any other way. Yet there is. There is. We would have you know that THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. There is ALWAYS another way. Remember that when you are feeling stuck in that dark cave of your thoughts and despair.\\nSo here we have a sensitive and loving child whose attempts at expressing love naturally are rebuffed. (That is, the child is attempting to express love in what is a natural fashion; unfortunately, the adults are not able to see how natural and healthy that child\\'s gestures and words are, and so they punish the child.) And at the same time, that child is exposed to many many images, words, thoughts (for children read thoughts), and stories that equate love with sex. No, they are not the same, not in the way your society uses the terms, yet a young child is quite literal.\\nImagine now we have a young child who is starved for love and is not getting it. And then they are told that love is sex, and sex is love. THAT YOUNG CHILD CONTINUES TO EXIST WITHIN THE ADULT in a very real way. And it continues to seek the love it never got when younger. Only now it is seeking the love from the adult it has become, rather than from the outside, since, TO THAT CHILD, there is little or no difference between one adult and another. The adult represents the provider of love. So when that child asks the adult it has become to behave in a way that makes the child feel loved, the child is also asking, in a very powerful way that can feel like a compulsion to the adult, for WHAT IT PERCEIVES the adult to be capable of giving. In this case, sex. Remembering now that sex = love in that child\\'s mind, ALTHOUGH THAT CHILD STILL KNOWS THE TRUTH OF WHAT REAL LOVE IS ALL ABOUT. The child, you might say, has resigned itself to \"playing by the grownups\\' rules,\" and it perceives that its particular grownup (that is, the person you have become; remember we are still speaking of the same person here as both a child and an adult), as an expression of the child\\'s parents, only knows how to give love in certain ways.\\nWhen we say that the grownup you have become is perceived as an expression of the child\\'s parents (again, you are also that child), we mean that children form their ideas of what grownups are based on their own experience. What else can they base it on? So when you grow up, no matter what you might like to think about yourself or of how you might have changed old patterns (and indeed, you may well have), THE CHILD THAT YOU STILL ARE perceives you as being little or no different from the parents (or parent substitutes) you once had.\\nHow, you might ask, can you heal such a thing? It might sound hopeless—if that child inside you already has such fixed images of what grownups are like, is healing possible? The answer is a resounding YES. COMPLETE HEALING IS POSSIBLE.\\nIn fact, complete healing is far more possible in this new way of looking at yourself than it is in the old way that says that the child you once were is dead and gone. Indeed it is not dead and gone, but is instead a living entity, though now sharing your body, with thoughts and rights of its own.\\nBearing in mind, then, that that child exists now, you might then see how it is possible to contact that child; to open a dialog with it; to speak with it, listen to its hurts and dreams and fears and yes, wisdom—a deep wisdom that may astound you. Become aware that that child can change its ideas and beliefs about the world and life and love and sex; can change its ideas, in fact, far more readily because it is still a child and still believes in magic. Not the magic of presto-chango, but a real and deep magic of life itself becoming more than you think possible.\\nWe hope this discussion has been helpful; we now return you to Marina\\'s \"normal\" entities so they can address your specific questions.\\nA Short Discussion\\n[A clarification here, in case the channeling itself isn\\'t clear: The dynamic is that the child molester recreates his relationship with his parents by molesting a child. The child he molests represents himself—that inner child who is still asking for love. He, the molester, represents his parents who didn\\'t give him the love he wanted. So he, as a representative of his parents, gives \"love\" to the child he is molesting, who represents himself as a child. This is probably one reason why molesters often say that the molested child \"wanted it\" or \"asked for it,\" which is false; it is the molester\\'s inner child self who wanted it, not the child who was abused.]\\nResources\\nImportant!

Bookmark the permalink . Leave a comment\\nIn the past, I’ve had sex, I’ve been laid, or whatever way you prefer to say it, but it is nothing compared to when you make love. I know people who will argue you down to the ground about sex and lovemaking having no difference. If we were to say physically, of course there is no difference, but if we are talking about passion, emotion and mental, the two are VERY different!\\n1. The First Time.\\nWhen you first make love with your significant other, it’s most of the time a very special moment. Sometimes it planned in advance, especially if it is the beginning of a relationship. There normally is some sensual foreplay and it seems as though your bodies fit perfect with one another.\\nWhen it’s the first time with a new significant other it can just be a spontaneous thing which could be the result of “just having sex”. In this case, not to say it’s a random person, but it may not be someone you are dating at the time or that person you have a huge crush on. This could just be a choice made strictly on inpulse or hormonal, (thanks ciroc!). Most cases, this first time with this person can get very sloppy and unorganized which makes things awkward when looking for a good position. Afterwards, either both of you or one of you will feel like there is definitely something missing!\\n2. Drunk Lovemaking?\\nNow I know that drunk sex exists but drunk lovemaking; you all are taking it too far. I would love to hear that story about someone completed wasted experiencing lovemaking.\\n3. Turn off the lights………\\nSo picture this, a lightly dimmed room, candles lite all around, bed just overwelmed with rose petals, this is the love making tone. Now the backseat of your car, in your pantry, coat closet, or any other space big enough to house storage items that can cause legal repercussions, it’s sex.\\nWho doesn’t want to imagine places like sex in wooded quiet areas on laid out on the beach? Well in a fairy tale, that sounds all nice and dandy, but sand finding it’s way into places can ruin a little bit of the mood.\\n4. Turn on some of that Teddy……\\nLovemaking songs can include music from Barry White or Teddy Pendergrass, even newer music like Keith Sweat or Brian McKnight. Now those sex songs range around Trey Songz, Lil Wayne, or mostly any song containing more profanity and fantasies than realities and sensuality. Even Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex” is a little far off the deep end of just sex.\\nOf course every time you have sex or make love music doesn’t have to be playing. Just think about the times music was playing, and think about what WAS playing!\\n5. The morning after…..\\nThe majority of the time, making love is followed by the spooning and the cuddling but comes after multiple mutual orgasms (if you’re lucky). A “post sex” type approach would be followed by him plowing over and going straight to sleep. Then there is that phrase, “that was great” but he didn’t notice that you didn’t even orgasm! So in this case, if you were single, this is where the walk of shame happens. Now there are the times that are very rare. You can make love to a person with no commitment whatsoever, but in the morning, you get waffles and a few more gos at last night’s events. Maybe a relationship can start out from this one.\\nFrom my own opinion (and experience), it is very likely that people have sex more times than they make love. Even though this is going to happen often, when that one person surfaces, and you care for them as much as they care for you, you will appreciate all the lovemaking. When this happens, you won’t even remember those one nights stands with whatshisname.\\nDo you think sex and lovemaking are different or the same?

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis.

Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1. Integrating sex and gender in systematic reviews: a planning tool. Adapted from “Sex and gender in systematic reviews: A planning tool,” M. Doull, V. E. Runnels, S. Tudiver, and M. Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1.

Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Yet, considering gender and sex in psychiatric research and clinical practice is still quite rare and most theories (especially neurobiological models), as well as available treatments (particularly pharmacotherapy), are based almost exclusively on findings in male subjects (animal and/or human).\\nAs an undergraduate student in the Psychology Honours Program at Concordia University I became interested in gender research. The first major project that I designed assessed the relationship between masculinity and femininity (as measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory) and self-esteem. Consistent with existing reports in this area, I found positive correlations between masculinity and self-esteem measures, and negative correlations between femininity and self-esteem. The following year, for my honours thesis project, I asked my potential supervisor, an expert in the behavioural neurobiology of drug addiction, if I could investigate sex differences in the rewarding properties of amphetamine in rats. Amazingly he said “yes,” and I found that female rats liked amphetamine more than males. Still, during my graduate and postdoctoral training, while continuing research on the neurobiology of motivated behaviour, and later while studying brain function in schizophrenia patients, it was difficult to convince my supervisors to invest in examining sex and gender differences by testing sufficient numbers of males and females.\\nThere are important sex and gender differences in the prevalence and expression of numerous psychiatric disorders that are often overlooked in research and clinical practice.\\nThere were numerous practical obstacles to doing this type of research—above all the fact that including both female and male rats in studies is more expensive and produces more variable results. Female rats have an estrous cycle—the equivalent of human menstrual cycle—that contributes to this variability. I began to understand these challenges as “facts of life” that unnecessarily complicated science and were best avoided. I stopped insisting on studying both male and female subjects. I was not certain anymore if studying sex and gender differences was a worthwhile endeavour. I convinced myself (partly because of my socio-cultural background and bias, and partly because of the lack of evidence to convince me otherwise) that the neurobiological sex differences were so negligible that they could be ignored in neuroanatomical and neurofunctional research.\\nHowever, with time, science proved me wrong: new evidence started emerging that pointed to undeniable differences between male and female organisms that were no longer restricted to reproductive organs and behaviour, but encompassed cognitive strategies, emotion processing, responses to stressful situations, and so on. Thus, when I finally established myself as an independent researcher, I decided to re-visit my initial research passion and examine potential sex and gender differences in severe psychiatric disorders.\\nI ventured into the literature and was surprised by what I discovered: Despite a wealth of research that established that some of the most prevalent psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety disorders, are diagnosed more frequently and often have a more serious clinical course in women than in men, considering gender and sex in mental health research and clinical practice was still quite rare.\\nFor example, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in women is approximately twice that of men. Estrogen has been proposed to be an important player in this sex difference because: (1)\\xa0the rates of MDD are similar in girls and boys before puberty and among elderly people; and (2)\\xa0mood often appears to fluctuate with changes in hormones, such as the low-estrogen premenstrual and postpartum periods when women are at increased risk for mood disorders (Freeman et al.,\\xa02004). Gender-related psychosocial factors have been identified as potential contributors to the differential prevalence of MDD in men and women. For example, experience of negative life events often gives rise to pessimistic attributional styles (how people attribute the causes of their life events) in girls but not in boys, making them more vulnerable to future depressive episodes in stressful situations (Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992). The picture is further complicated by a clinical bias to diagnose depression in women more readily than in men.\\nWhen it comes to addictive, compulsive and obsessive behaviours, large discrepancies between the sexes have also been observed. For example, while eating disorders are more common among women than men (Steiger & Bruce,\\xa02007), substance use disorders are more common in men (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). It is important however to point out that despite lower rates of drug abuse in women than in men, the number of women using and abusing prescription and illegal drugs is increasing. Following initiation, women tend to increase their rate of consumption and become addicted to alcohol, marijuana, opiates and cocaine more rapidly than do men. Furthermore, once addicted to a drug, women can find it more difficult to quit than men do (Becker & Hu,\\xa02008). The underlying mechanisms of these sex differences remain unclear, but a few factors have been studied including the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\\nWhen I revisited the field I was primarily interested in schizophrenia and related psychoses and realized that very little research had focused on sex and gender differences in this complex and devastating condition. The risk of developing schizophrenia over one’s lifetime is approximately 1%. It typically begins during late adolescence or early adulthood, often leads to a social and economic impoverishment and to great distress for patients and their families. Schizophrenia ends in suicide in\\xa010-12% of cases (50%\\xa0of patients will attempt suicide at some point in their illness). It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation with symptoms ranging from hallucinations and delusions (so-called positive symptoms), through to disorganized behaviour, to social withdrawal, poverty of speech and lack of motivation (referred to as negative symptoms). Despite decades of scientific investigation we still do not know its causes—although we have some vague ideas about various contributing factors—or how to adequately treat schizophrenia (about\\xa030% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological treatments).\\nThere is still controversy as to whether there are sex differences in the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia, but researchers and clinicians agree that in the younger population the risk is higher in men, while over the age of\\xa040 the risk is higher in women. Other important sex differences in schizophrenia encompass premorbid function (poorer academic, occupational and interpersonal functioning in males than in females before the diagnosis), clinical expression (males tend to present with more negative symptoms, while females have more affective symptoms such as irritability, aggression and mood deregulation) and response to treatment (better in females than in males, but with more side effects in females) (Leung & Chue,\\xa02000). Although these differences have been well documented, we still know very little about their underlying mechanisms. Consequently men and women with schizophrenia tend to receive similar psychopharmacological (drugs) and psychosocial interventions (group homes, occupational therapy), sometimes with suboptimal results. An example is the prescription of similar antipsychotic dosages resulting in more serious side effects in women who typically require smaller doses (Seeman,\\xa02009).\\nIncluding both men and women in mental health research can make a significant difference in obtained results. Focusing on a single sex (where not scientifically warranted) can lead to erroneous generalizations and limit potential pathways to treatment.\\nAll of this has motivated me to establish a research program devoted to examining neurofunctional, hormonal and psychosocial factors implicated in sex and gender differences in psychoses. The work in my laboratory to date has revealed an intriguing reversal of typical sex differences in performance and brain function during the performance of a visuo-spatial test (mental rotation of three-dimensional figures) (Jiménez, Mancini-Marie, Lakis, & Mendrek,\\xa02010), as well as during exposure to emotionally negative pictures (e.g.,\\xa0scenes depicting violence, war, sad faces), in schizophrenia patients (Mendrek, Mancini-Marie, Fahim, & Stip,\\xa02007). Specifically, in one study we asked participants to perform a classic mental rotation task where participants are presented with pairs of rotated or unrotated figures and have to determine if the figures are identical or if they are mirror images. During this task, participants are scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (imaging that shows how the brain works). This task normally elicits better performance and greater brain activations in men than in women in the general population. In our study we have replicated the finding of superior performance and brain activations in control males relative to females, but the opposite pattern was present in patients with schizophrenia (Jiménez et al.,\\xa02010): females with schizophrenia exhibited a pattern of brain activation similar to non-schizophrenic males, and males with schizophrenia were more like non-schizophrenic females, as depicted in Figure\\xa01-1 . What is critical to note is that we would not have been able to detect this effect if we had included only one sex in our study.\\nFigure 1-1. Brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients and in healthy comparison patients.\\nFigure 1-1: long description\\nUnfortunately, an overwhelming majority of functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia consist of exclusively or predominantly male samples. Even if the samples are mixed, there is usually an insufficient number of women to allow for comparison between the sexes. In fact, had we only included men in our study, our conclusions would be only partly true. A male-only sample would have led us to argue that patients with schizophrenia were characterized by deficits in visuo-spatial processing at the behavioural and neurofunctional level when, in fact, it was only male patients who presented with a dramatic deficit; this deficit was not presented by female patients.\\nOur results suggest that women and men with schizophrenia may be characterized by different cognitive and neural anomalies. This is important because neurocognitive deficits represent a hallmark problem in schizophrenia and some cognitive remediation techniques have been developed recently to help patients in their daily activities. Characterization of differences in cognitive function and underlying brain circuitry could help in applying unique approaches appropriate for each sex. More generally, this research may contribute to developing better models and theories of schizophrenia, which would take sex and gender into consideration. It is possible that the factors contributing to the development of psychoses are different in men and women.\\nLarry Cahill has been exploring sex and gender differences in emotional memory over the past 10\\xa0years with some striking results. In closing, the following by Cahill is an important methodological point:\\nThe striking quantity and diversity of sex-related influences on nervous system function argue that the burden of proof regarding the issue has shifted from those examining the issue in their investigations generally having to justify why, to those not doing so having to justify why not. (Cahill, 2010, p.\\xa029)\\nQuestions to consider\\nGiven that there are significant differences between women and men in the brain, behaviour and mental health, how can you design studies to account for these differences and apply this knowledge in clinical practice?\\nAre there any gender biases that could influence the way you view and interpret scientific results and transmit them?\\nReferences\\nBecker, J.

Our basic science research takes place in a clinical setting dealing with pulmonary diseases associated with premature birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In cases of extreme prematurity, boys are at greater risk of developing these diseases than girls of comparable gestational age. However, the impact of sex on lung development must be placed in context. Although many sex differences, such as the higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in boys, are well established, others, such as time lags in the expression of certain genes, are not well understood. Sex differences are not limited to direct or indirect effects of the steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (testes, ovaries); they can also appear as temporal and spatial differences in the pulmonary inactivation or activation of those same hormones and their precursors.\\nIn this chapter, we raise three relevant questions based on our experience of including sex as a biological variable in biomedical studies, addressed in turn below. We provide some possible answers that demonstrate why sex is a critical component in the development of solutions to improve the health of premature babies. For definitions of terms we use throughout this chapter, please consult Table\\xa02-1.\\nTable 2-1: Glossary of Terms\\nAndrogen\\nFamily of steroid hormones responsible for male sex characteristics, normally produced by the gonads (e.g.,\\xa0testosterone).\\nGlucocorticoid\\nFamily of steroid hormones known for their role in immunity, glucose metabolism and stress response, normally produced by the adrenals (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol).\\nLocal androgen metabolism\\nLocal inactivation and/or activation of androgens outside of the gonads.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\nFunctional and structural pulmonary anomalies frequently observed among children born prematurely.\\nPulmonary surfactant\\nA complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is necessary for normal pulmonary function and prevents the lungs from collapsing.\\nMeta-analysis\\nStatistical method combining the results of several studies to more adequately address one or more research hypotheses raised individually in each of the studies.\\nStatistical variance\\nMeasure used to evaluate the dispersion of samples or measures as compared to their average value.\\nConfounding factor\\nFactor that can introduce a bias because it is simultaneously linked to what is being measured and to another factor.\\nWhy consider sex in basic biomedical research on lung development?\\nSex is a crucially important factor in research on lung development because males and females show hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities both in normal lung development and in the cause of certain pulmonary diseases. For example, male lungs are exposed to higher levels of androgens than female lungs at several stages of lung development as a result of their production in the testes. Because the ovaries are not producing equivalent levels of androgens at that same developmental stage, exposure to androgens in females and males during development is asymmetrical. This asymmetrical exposure to androgens has many consequences; in particular it creates a normal delay in the onset of the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that prevents pulmonary collapse) for male fetuses. This delay—and hence, lower levels of surfactant until later in development—makes males born prematurely more susceptible than females to respiratory distress syndrome. However, hormonal differences between males and females precede observed sex differences in lung development by several weeks in terms of the onset of pulmonary surfactant synthesis and other pulmonary dimorphisms. The influence of sex on lung development is therefore not limited to a difference in hormone levels at a given point in time, but continues and is manifested in many or even all of the events governing lung development and diseases.\\nThe study of the hormonal, physiological, genetic and morphological specificities of males and females in lung development and certain pulmonary diseases is necessary to highlight the full complexity of the influence of sex as a factor in lung development.\\nMany mechanisms necessary for lung development have been identified, such as the delaying and accelerating effects of androgens and glucocorticoids (another family of steroid hormones), respectively, on the production of pulmonary surfactant. In the case of pregnancies at risk of premature delivery, antenatal administration of glucocorticoids reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences.\\nWhile we observe a link between the actions and regulatory mechanisms of androgens and glucocorticoids and sex differences in the process of lung maturation, cause and effect relationships are still poorly understood, especially in relation to later stages of development. For example, a meta-analysis recently published by our research team that addressed the influence of sex on the effectiveness of antenatal glucocorticoid administration confirmed that this treatment is effective in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately in the reduction of mortality among extremely premature male and female newborns (Roberge et al.,\\xa02011). The same analysis, however, also pointed to differences in the effectiveness of different types of glucocorticoids by sex, suggesting that future studies should investigate what type of glucocorticoid is most effective based on the infant’s sex. Many other questions persist about the use of glucocorticoids. In particular, why do many fetuses, regardless of sex, not respond to antenatal treatments (Jobe & Ikegami,\\xa02000)? In addition, unlike the case of respiratory distress syndrome, a connection between androgens and the higher incidence in male neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia has yet to be demonstrated.\\nFor these reasons as well as those suggested by our work, studies on lung development cannot ignore the influence of sex and should consider all of the common and distinguishing factors characterizing lung development in both sexes. In this context, our team has decided not to limit its studies to the influence of sex and sex hormones in processes and pathologies for which a sex difference has previously been identified, but to consider the influence of sex as a factor, in all its complexity, in all aspects of lung development.\\nHow can sex be incorporated in basic biomedical research?\\nObviously, our team is not the only group to point out the importance of considering sex when analyzing data on lung development. This point was raised in a recent letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Kauffmann,\\xa02010). Still, incorporating sex into our research efforts was no easy feat. It required extensive changes to our approach. We had to focus more on sex in our literature reviews; formulate hypotheses that let us include sex as a factor; plan our experiments and collect our samples accordingly; and pay special attention to sex in our data analysis, including our statistical analyses. To investigate the influence of sex on lung development, one must therefore not only include samples from females and males, but also design a methodological framework by which this influence can be analyzed. To ensure the greater statistical rigour that including sex as a factor implies, it is necessary to gather a larger number of samples, and these samples must be of superior quality. For example, to avoid having either sex be overrepresented and introducing a bias in the analysis of results, similar numbers of male and female subjects must be included for every condition and developmental stage to be studied.\\nIncorporating sex as a factor in our research required extensive changes to our approach to all of the stages of our research and enabled us to identify mechanisms specific to one sex and others common to both sexes.\\nStudies on lung development often attempt to compare samples from several different developmental stages. The addition of sex as a factor contributes additional statistical variance and demands that the variability due to the other factors be minimized. For example, in our mouse model, we now use mating protocols that minimize uncertainty regarding gestational age. Even in the absence of identifiable sex differences, this approach is still desirable, because it ensures more representative results for a population that is heterogeneous with regard not only to sex, but to numerous other factors as well.\\nThe integration of sex in our biomedical studies enabled us to push the envelope within the paradigm of extreme prematurity by requiring us to also consider complementary insights from other disciplines, including social sciences.\\nIncorporating the influence of sex into all aspects of our research has enabled us to discover a local androgen metabolism (local inactivation and/or activation of androgen) that is common to both sexes. This suggests that there is also a beneficial role for androgens in normal lung development in both sexes. Likewise, we have also identified several genes that are expressed differentially or not according to sex or as a function of lung development. Because we have made sex such a central consideration in our research, sex has become far more than simply a confounding factor. On the contrary, it has enabled us to describe important developmental differences between females and males linked to gene expression and hormone levels. Understanding these differences has, in turn, led us to more effectively analyze their impacts and to integrate them into a lung development model that includes both sexes.\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nOur research experience has taught us that both research questions and research findings can involve aspects that go far beyond the physiological differences between sexes. Because of the particular clinical setting in which we do our research, issues of critical concern in other fields such as epidemiology, psychology, ethics and law have arisen. As well, it is clear that there is an increased need for effective knowledge translation. These have all emerged from our initial biomedical concerns.\\nCharacterizing the risk factors associated with prematurity and the influence of sex on various conditions that can affect premature newborns are important foci for biomedical research. At the same time, it is also very important to investigate the impact of sex and its physiological effects on the long-term prospects for children born prematurely, in terms of their integration into society, their academic and professional performance and their social skills. The ethical and legal implications are also quite significant, because situations where children are born at the threshold of viability raise issues of ethics and values—and the legal framework, in Canada at least, leaves much room for interpretation. Males born at the threshold of viability have higher mortality rates, exhibit a higher incidence of neonatal pulmonary pathologies and are thought to also have higher rates of psychosocial developmental problems. This raises many ethical questions for parents and the caregiving team concerning how this knowledge should be integrated in the decision process related to neonatal care and guidelines. Should this information be given to the premature boys’ parents and, if so, how? Should those epidemiological facts be reflected in medical decisions or guidelines on resuscitation of extremely premature neonates?\\nTo that end, we ran an online multidisciplinary discussion forum that addressed various questions linking sex and extreme prematurity. Participants from several different disciplines combined their knowledge and together developed a transdisciplinary synthesis of the key issues. This transdisciplinary groundwork became the basis of a book on sex, extreme prematurity and the improvement of practices, policies and decision-making processes linked to the male disadvantage from birth at the threshold of viability and for babies born at the threshold of viability in general (Simard & Gagné,\\xa02010).\\nConclusion\\nThe integration of sex has not only added value to our work, but it has also taught us a great number of things. One of the lessons we learned is that to be successful, the integration of sex as a factor and the evaluation of its impact on various biological processes must be carried out at all stages of basic biomedical research. We also discovered that studies including sex as a factor are not limited to the obvious differences and that the results obtained from these approaches may be unexpected; nevertheless these differences are crucial and may point in new directions that would otherwise have remained unexplored. The integration of sex in the questions, experimental approaches and directions of biomedical research constitutes a new paradigm for biomedical research requiring multidisciplinary exchanges and transdisciplinary thinking.\\nQuestions to consider\\nWhy should sex be considered a factor in biomedical research on lung development?\\nHow can the concept of sex be successfully incorporated into biomedical research, and what are its benefits?\\nHow can biomedical research extend beyond the physiological aspects of sex?\\nReferences\\nJobe, A.

Lupien, Université de Montréal\\nEvery cell is sexed, every person is gendered and every organism is stressed. Stress is, for good or for ill, a natural part of life until death (Lupien,\\xa02010). Over the last decades, stress researchers have begun incorporating sex and gender into ever evolving perspectives that have crystallized into better understanding of stress and coping. This chapter will document this metamorphosis to guide future research. First, we define stress. Second, we describe paradigm shifts that brought sex differences to the fore in theoretical and empirical stress literature. Third, we explore how sex and gender perspectives of workplace stress interact to enhance understanding of chronic stress.\\nDefining stressors, distress and stress responses\\nAt the Centre for Studies on Human Stress , we surveyed the general public and found that popular definitions of stress do not match scientific ones. For the public stress is synonymous with time pressure, whereas scholarly definitions divide stress among constructs like stressor inputs, distressing processes and stress response outputs. According to Dr. Sheldon Cohen, three broad interconnected traditions exist for measuring stress: (1) environmental perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0objective stressor frequencies and exposures to aversive circumstances); (2) psychological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0subjective distress of stressors quantified using questionnaires, interviews); and (3) biological perspectives (e.g.,\\xa0physiological markers like stress hormones or cardiovascular functioning). Each of these traditions is complementary and in our esteem best understood in combination.\\nDecades of research have shown us that the psychological ingredients involved in stressful recipes of life include Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to the ego/self and/or diminished Sense of control (just remember the acronym NUTS). These ingredients are additive and uniquely salient: we all have differential sensitivities to NUTS (Lupien,\\xa02010). Indeed, psychological stress research started with Dr.\\xa0John Mason’s work in the\\xa01960s using parachutists and other groups of people voluntarily undergoing stressful situations. A comprehensive definition of stress, which takes these inherent individual differences into account, was formulated by Dr.\\xa0Bruce McEwen: stress is any real or interpreted threat to an individual’s well-being that results in biological and behavioural responses.\\nOur understanding of the stress-disease link was until recently limited to males.\\nWhen facing stressful situations involving NUTS elements, we activate stress responses. Suffice it to say that this involves two complex biological systems that ultimately call into action our elite stress hormones (see Figure\\xa03-1 ). The first wave involves the swift release of monamine known as adrenalin within seconds, followed by the production of the steroid cortisol within minutes. Surges in these stress hormones mobilize energy stores by turning fat into sugar and allocating it throughout our bodies. This maximally facilitates the notorious “fight-or-flight” response first described by Dr. Walter Cannon. The most important point to remember is that without stress responses, our ancestors would not have been able to fight, flee or freeze when facing mammoths and other predators eons ago.\\nFigure 3-1. Schematic of stress responses. Stressors (absolute or relative) in the environment must first be detected to trigger two systems. Within seconds, catecholamines like adrenalin are released into circulation as part of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis. Followed next within minutes is the production of glucocorticoids like cortisol as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Reproduced with permission.\\nFigure 3-1: long description\\nStress is therefore an inherently adaptive phenomenon that keeps us breathing and breeding. Nevertheless, while acute stress responses are healthy, chronic stress can lead to potential malfunctions in essentially every biological system. This is because every cell can receive biochemical messages from stress hormones that will consequently alter their functions. When stress hormone concentrations fall into ranges that are too high or too low, normal adaptation transforms into maladaptation. This biological deterioration was first investigated by Dr. Hans Selye in Montreal during the\\xa01930s, so it is with pride and penance that we can say that the idea that chronic stress can “get under our skin” is a Canadian concept.\\nSo far, we have given a brief history of the stress field and its definitions with one major caveat: the stress response has primarily been tested in males. Up until as recently as 1995, females represented a mere\\xa017% of human participants or animal subjects in biological stress studies (Taylor et al.,\\xa02000). Females were excluded because reproductive events like menstruation, menopause and pregnancy lead to fluctuations in sex hormones (e.g.,\\xa0estrogens) that modulate stress hormone levels and potentially confound data. When the senior author of this chapter started in this field, it was taken for granted that you recruited males, stressed them, made them spit (we measure cortisol easily in saliva) and wrote up findings that were supposedly generalizable across sexes. Today, it is much harder to publish in strong journals if females and males are not included, representing an important paradigm shift that we now address.\\nAdam without Eve: the genesis of stress research using both sexes\\nIn the beginning, the brains of living creatures and eventual cave(wo)men slowly developed ever better mechanisms for detecting threats, mobilizing stress responses and surviving. Here we need to make the distinction between absolute stressors (e.g.,\\xa0predators, natural disasters) that threaten our survival and invariably lead to stress responses in comparison to relative stressors (e.g.,\\xa0traffic, public speaking) that threaten well-being only if the person deems them stressful based on NUTS elements (Lupien et al.,\\xa02006). Throughout evolution, we have faced ancient stressors that have disappeared (e.g.,\\xa0mammoths) and modern stressors (e.g.,\\xa0bosses), but our brain still reacts as though we were hunter-gatherers.\\nIn part, because of morphological differences, cavemen were more likely to be the hunters than cavewomen, which might explain why modern men consistently mobilize more intense stress responses. This makes sense, since evolutionary pressures will be appropriated by one sex that then selectively contributes, over countless generations, to physiological sex differences and gender-related behaviours. For cavewomen, this perhaps meant more gathering and nurturing behaviours. Now let’s fast-forward to 2000\\xa0AD when Dr.\\xa0Shelly Taylor postulated that females might have evolved a unique stress response unaddressed in hitherto male dominated studies.\\nDue to evolutionary and socio-cultural pressures, sex and gender differences exist in sensitivities to environmental stressors, psychological distress and biological stress responses.\\nDr. Taylor and other eminent stress researchers proposed the female-typical “tend-and-befriend” response as an alternative to the male-typical fight-or-flight response. The central tenet here is that instead of utilizing physical retaliation when faced with threats, women focus on behaviours that protect vulnerable offspring and maintain social bonds (Taylor et al., 2000). This theory has received compelling support; still, it is unclear whether these responses are due to sex, gender or both—or whether these are observed because of how our own gendered assumptions factor into our research designs.\\nWhen facing acute stressors men tend to benefit from their female partner’s social support by secreting less stress hormones, whereas women produce more stress hormones in the presence of their male partner than in the presence of a stranger (Kirschbaum, Klauer, Filipp, & Hellhammer,\\xa01995). Interestingly, research subsequent to this pioneering study found that women benefited from same-sex friends’ presence when distressed. Many studies like these conducted by our German colleagues have been instrumental in bringing considerations of sex differences into stress laboratories. Since then, other investigations have turned their attention to how sex and gender interact. In our next section, we examine how these interactions can help explain differences in stress-related diseases vis-à-vis workplace distress and beyond.\\nSex and gender interactions in workplace stress research\\nPerceiving stressors, interpreting threats and generating stress responses fundamentally differ between sexes and as a function of gender. Women self-report more stressors and distress than men and consistently report more physical health symptoms, but men are more stress responsive and die younger. These types of sex differences are central to studying stress, but can be limited by focusing solely on dichotomous sex differences in the absence of gender perspectives. Indeed, women display increased stress hormone levels when confronted by social rejection challenges (Stroud, Salovey, & Epel,\\xa02002), whereas men tend to be more reactive to achievement-based stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny,\\xa02004). This suggests that differential gender-based attributions might be involved. An important challenge has been to understand how to study the dynamic nature of sex and gender throughout lifespan development in relation to stress-related disease trajectories that actually change throughout history.\\nAs a point in case, consider cardiovascular disease: once a predominantly male pathology, it now claims at least\\xa041% of all deaths of Canadian women in comparison to\\xa037% for men. This reversal might be better explained by gender roles than by sex if we consider socio-cultural changes over the last decades. For instance, the World Bank, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization report that women have increased their participation in the workforce by\\xa0126% over the last 30\\xa0years and now represent\\xa042% of the entire global labour force. Regrettably, higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work-family roles and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. Groundbreaking work by Dr.\\xa0Marianne Frankenhaeuser and colleagues from Scandinavia has consistently shown that women in non-traditional occupations (e.g.,\\xa0managers, engineers) self-report more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk of stress-related diseases. The gender influence represents an important form of strain that can adversely trickle into other life domains.\\nThe interaction between sex and gender best explains how chronic stress leads to wear and tear that ultimately contributes to stress-related diseases.\\nIndeed, workplace overload and social injustices can lead to spill-over effects (work stress to home distress) and over-spill effects (home stress to work distress). Here too the sexes differ: Female managers do not disengage as much after work as male managers (Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\\xa01999; Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen,\\xa02000). This has consequences for everyone, as elevated levels of stress hormones after work mediate the effect of job demands and job control elements in predicting health care costs. Note that one third of Canadians report chronic stress at work that puts them at increased risk of depression, burnout and anxiety disorders, to name a few. These statistics are distributed differently among men and women and as a function of masculine or feminine gender-roles. Taken together, sex and gender interact to exacerbate our vulnerabilities to chronic stress that can have dire consequences on health and well-being.\\nAfter decades of advances nationally and internationally, stress researchers now can objectively measure chronic stress by assessing biological recalibrations of what we call allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar,\\xa01993). This “wear and tear” is believed to occur when stress hormones go off-kilter and topple over onto other biological systems like a “domino effect” trailing toward disease (for a review, see Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). For example, neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular malfunctioning will occur when stress hormone functioning collapses. Our own research has focused on the biopsychosocial signatures associated with allostatic load and diverse stress-related conditions (e.g.,\\xa0burnout, geriatric depression) that distinctly affect vulnerable populations (e.g.,\\xa0elders, workers, sexual minorities). We have observed that this approach to quantifying chronic stress is linked to one’s sex, gender, sexual orientation, age and occupational characteristics. Indeed, different biomarker clusters (e.g.,\\xa0cortisol, blood pressure, cholesterol) are often more likely to be exacerbated in one sex or another throughout the life cycle, but in ways that depend on constitutional (genetics, development, experience), behavioural (coping and health habits) and historical (trauma/abuse, major life events, stressful environments) factors that are often gender specific (Juster, McEwen, & Lupien,\\xa02010). As demonstrated by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women, this array of factors is dynamic.\\nTo conclude, it is now becoming clear that the biopsychosocial antecedents and functional consequences of high allostatic load are best understood by taking into account sex and gender together. The paradigm shifts that have fostered inclusion of sex and gender have served as the impetus for accelerated advances in our understanding of who develops which stress-related diseases. As we move toward person-centred paradigms, we acknowledge that progress in stress research has benefited most by investigating sex and gender in synergy and not separately.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow might risk or protective factors affect the impact of sex on what you are studying?\\nEven if the body of evidence related to what you are studying is based on single-sex data, how can you probe further for the possible influences of sex and gender?\\nReferences\\nDickerson, S., & Kemeny, M.

Runnels, University of Ottawa\\nMarion Doull, University of British Columbia\\nSystematic reviews in health provide evidence to guide clinical decisions, technology assessments, health policies and further research. Since 2005, our Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews has been engaged in a project to ensure that systematic reviews in health are attentive to sex and gender differences and similarities, with the goal of improving health outcomes for women and men. This initiative arose from a long-standing sense of “dis-ease” about what we know and do not know about health evidence, tempered with some optimism for change.\\nBack to the future\\nFor two of us (Madeline, Sari) this dis-ease began with work in the women’s health movement in the\\xa01970s. We developed consumer health information, wrote policy briefs and were part of coalitions promoting quality care, including safe, effective and rational use of pharmaceuticals for women. Collaborating with other researchers, health practitioners and consumers, we reviewed the scientific evidence for contraceptives (e.g.,\\xa0Dalkon Shield IUD, Depo-Provera), interventions in childbirth (e.g.,\\xa0fetal monitoring), menopause (e.g.,\\xa0hormone therapy) and medical devices (e.g.,\\xa0breast implants) and gained insights into the medicalization of women’s lives.\\nIdentify who may or may not benefit from particular interventions by knowing to whom the evidence does or does not apply.\\nWe learned from two cases in particular that clinical decisions not rooted in sound evidence could lead to serious harm. First, despite evidence in the\\xa01950s about lack of efficacy of diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriage (Dieckmann, Davis, Rynkiewicz, & Pottinger,\\xa01953), the drug was promoted in advertisements in major medical journals and prescribed until the\\xa01970s, with subsequent dire consequences for the offspring of women to whom it was given. Second, hormone therapy (HT) was prescribed as a standard of care to healthy post-menopausal women based on limited results from observational studies and assumptions about the benefits of estrogen replacement. In 2002, results from randomized controlled trials demonstrated more harm than benefit from HT but by that time thousands of women prescribed HT had experienced breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and dementia (National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute, n.d.). Documents now reveal the many ways manufacturers promoted the benefits and downplayed harmful effects of HT to doctors and women (Fugh-Berman,\\xa02010).\\nWe were also concerned about women’s exclusion from clinical trials. It was widely assumed that most conclusions derived from research on male subjects—animal and human—could be extrapolated to females. These cases and others made us cautious about health evidence.\\nWe learned to carefully review the design and quality of studies in order to evaluate the reliability, validity and applicability of the results. We asked: Who was included and excluded in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, socio-economic background and other characteristics? While policies supported greater inclusion of women in clinical trials since the early 1990s, gaps remained. Women continued to be under-represented in particular study areas (e.g., cardiovascular trials), while men were under-represented in others (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Children and the elderly were commonly excluded. We sought to understand the implications of these research practices for health equity.\\nWe tried to “disentangle” and weigh different forms of potential bias in published studies, such as pharmaceutical industry funding of authors and research; reporting short-term (usually positive) results from a study; citing relative versus absolute risks; failing to report or adequately assess adverse events; and extrapolating from limited observational studies or small trials to broad clinical use among diverse populations.\\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, progress had occurred in understanding the complex dynamics of sex and gender as social constructs and determinants of health. There was strong evidence about sex and gender differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, genetic expression, prevalence, onset and severity of diseases, subjective experiences of conditions such as depression and chronic pain, responses to health interventions, the utilization of health care systems and many other processes that influence health. We hoped newly published research would clearly identify to whom the results applied, including whether sex and/or gender differences were relevant or not to the findings.\\nHowever, despite Canadian and international policies supporting and even mandating sex and gender analysis (Health Canada, 2009), primary studies and systematic reviews did not consistently report sex-disaggregated data nor analyze the implications of sex and/or gender for the findings (Blauwet, Hayes, McManus, Redberg, & Walsh, 2007). Our dis-ease about the quality of health evidence and potential for harm remained.\\nThe Sex and Gender Working Group on Systematic Reviews: what we’ve done\\nEarly in\\xa02005, Madeline suggested we engage the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers who carry out systematic reviews in health, in a dialogue to encourage sex/gender analysis in Cochrane reviews. (Note that we use the term sex/gender in relation to analysis to acknowledge the interrelationships among these concepts.) We were familiar with Cochrane’s origins identifying sound practices in maternity care and its reputation as the “gold standard” of reviews. We saw an opportunity to apply the analytic tools of sex/gender analysis to “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review” (Cochrane Collaboration,\\xa02005). The review process encouraged presentation of demographic data and subgroup analyses to help answer the question: To whom does the evidence apply? As well, some Cochrane researchers were beginning to address equity-related issues, including gender, in reviews.\\nResearchers and systematic reviewers need practical tools to operationalize and measure sex/gender in relation to other health determinants and to elucidate the contexts within which health interventions occur.\\nOur first presentation was at the 4th Canadian Cochrane Symposium, December\\xa02005 (Boscoe & Tudiver,\\xa02005). With trepidation we stood before a sizable audience to present key concepts of sex/gender analysis, the mandate for this work in Canada and internationally and some challenges to implementation. Drawing examples from cardiovascular diseases and total joint arthroplasty, we made the case that rigorous sex/gender analysis contributes to better science. Noting that recent reviews revealed almost no analysis of sex or gender, we proposed systematically including sex/gender analysis in systematic reviews. We found enthusiasm for this initiative and agreed to collaborate with members of the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group.\\nBy 2007 our duo had seamlessly expanded to include Marion and Vivien, doctoral students in Population Health at the University of Ottawa. We designed a research project to determine whether and how a sample of Cochrane systematic reviews on cardiovascular diseases addressed sex and/or gender (they did not!), then sampled the primary studies on which the reviews were based to see if the systematic reviews replicated gaps in the primary studies (they did!). We developed and tested a sex/gender appraisal tool for systematic reviews and adapted it to appraise primary studies and protocols for new research (Boscoe, Doull, Runnels, & Tudiver,\\xa02009; Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, & Boscoe, 2010) and for planning systematic reviews (see Figure\\xa04-1 ).\\nFigure\\xa04-1. Integrating sex and gender in systematic reviews: a planning tool. Adapted from “Sex and gender in systematic reviews: A planning tool,” M. Doull, V. E. Runnels, S. Tudiver, and M. Boscoe,\\xa02011, May, Presentation at Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias. Ottawa, Ontario. Adapted by original authors.\\nFigure 4-1: long description\\nWe have benefited from numerous collaborations and discussions with researchers, policy analysts, health practitioners, reviewers, librarians, students and women’s groups in Canada and internationally. To facilitate dialogue among systematic reviewers and users of health evidence, in May 2011 we hosted a two-day meeting, Combining forces to improve systematic reviews: Gender, equity and bias (Ottawa, Ontario). Thirty participants shared approaches and methodological challenges in identifying: To whom does the evidence apply? All agreed to combine forces and developed an action plan to improve the applicability of systematic reviews. Our Working Group serves as a hub for this emerging community of practice and plans to provide methodological and conceptual guidance for systematic reviews relating to sex/gender analysis.\\nWhat we’ve learned\\nOur work has provided us with insights into how knowledge is constructed, organized and translated. As our collaboration progressed, these insights emerged as moments of realization about sex, gender and evidence (see “Aha!” moments). The questions that need to be asked before embarking on a journey through the knowledge system are: Who decides what will be studied and, how will it be studied?\\n“Aha!” moments\\nI was surprised when I had an “aha” moment—an authentic intellectual realization that the majority of studies (evidence) on which we base all aspects of medical and clinical practice, diagnosis and prognosis, choice of treatments, prescriptions and care, understanding of adverse events, etc. were deeply if not primarily influenced by sex and gender, and that such influences were rarely considered. This realization was not only shocking but it shook me up. It seemed particularly unfair and unscientific, not just to women and girls but also to boys and men. This “aha” moment eventually was converted from a single event into an ongoing, different and critical approach that has forced me to ask questions not just directed towards women’s health, but to the framing of many issues. ~Vivien\\nPrior to this project, I was working on a systematic review about HIV-positive women. Finding studies that included only women or reported outcomes for women was challenging. This frustrated and surprised me. The questions posed by researchers often reflected assumptions about sex and gender; young men are mostly asked about violence and aggression but rarely about love and young women about their powerlessness but not about their power. Through our collaboration, I see more clearly how understanding the effectiveness of interventions for men, women and children remains elusive when differences are not parsed out and assumptions are unchallenged. ~Marion\\nAs summaries of evidence distilled from primary studies, systematic reviews are an end point of knowledge production. Even in the area of cardiovascular diseases where sex and gender differences are known and ignoring them may result in harm, our research determined that reviews replicate omissions from primary studies. These results helped us recognize the added value if sex/gender analysis had been applied throughout the knowledge production process from primary studies to systematic reviews—in formulating the research question, developing a protocol, choosing methods, collecting data, reporting, analyzing and discussing results and their implications, including who benefits and who does not from an intervention. Asking about sex and gender at each stage to identify or rule out potentially significant differences contributes to quality assurance of evidence.\\nDespite many policy statements and robust research about sex and/or gender differences, little progress has been made in addressing the applicability of research findings. Incentives and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure positive change.\\nWe have also gained insights into how sex and gender are complex constructs revealing the interrelationships among biological and social processes across the life course. While there is a rich transdisciplinary literature addressing these dynamics, we are still in the early stages of developing conceptual approaches and methodological tools to explain and measure these processes and interactions with other health determinants and identities. Few primary studies or systematic reviews in our research included even basic contextual information about sex and gender differences in prevalence and severity of a condition or addressed the different challenges which men and women of different ages and backgrounds might face experiencing disease and accessing care.\\nWe see a need for practical tools that researchers and systematic reviewers can use to operationalize and measure sex and gender in relation to other health determinants and the contexts within which health interventions occur. The challenge is to find effective, systematic ways appropriate to a particular research question that can effectively combine conceptual approaches and methods, including ethnographic and other qualitative methods in order to strengthen the evidence for improved health outcomes.\\nQuestions to consider\\nHow will you identify to whom the evidence applies or does not apply?\\nHow will you identify who may or may not benefit from an intervention?\\nReferences\\nBlauwet, L.

Parents want to teach children how to concentrate and memorize. And many people complain that they can not remain focused on one subject. Well, this is a misconception. Anger is concentration, hurt is concentration. All suffering is nothing but focused attention . All of us are having good concentration skills. The problem comes when you want to focus on something in which you are NOT interested. For example a student is not interested in maths but he \\xa0want to focus on maths only to pass the exams.\\nYou are already master in concentration. If you don’t believe me then watch yourself when you are angry. You are so focused in anger that you forget everything. People can not stop smoking or drinking because of strong concentration. All suffering which comes after breakup is nothing but concentrated focus on a single person. If you can not forgive someone for years means you are totally focused on that person. This shows that you can remain focused\\xa0on something for years.\\nMind automatically get focused on the topic in which it is interested. Whether it is good or bad it doesn’t matter. You feel angry or hurt because it gives your ego good feeling. You feel like you are important.\\nYou don’t need to develop the skills of concentration, instead find the area in which you are most interested and you will get easily successful.\\nThe students which are always on the top in school exams may considered as intelligent just because they are on the top. But in latter years other boys, who are having more social skills, confidence, and common sense, who are more focused on money and power may get more successful. This so called intelligence (which is the outcome of concentration) is relative and only time being. The object of concentration will change according to your change in interest.\\nYou will be considered as a genius as long as you are focused on something in which you are interested and easily getting success . But you can be also considered as a fool if people could not understand your genius. The view of society about a successful man is very narrow. Basically it is based on money or social states. Money can easily hide your stupidity.\\nMeditation is NOT concentration; a meditative person is not focused on anything. He is just present. That’s why concentration on breathing is not meditation . Suppose you are totally focused on breathing and forget everything, then it is not meditation . Every year thousands of people travel all around the world and waste money to learn such kind of stupid things. What they teach in meditation camps is nothing but concentration. Meditation camps are concentration camps because along with stupid techniques they also brainwash you. Meditation can not be taught in camps. You have to learn it yourself in daily activities.\\nEarning money, balancing relationships , enjoying life, learning new skills, making new friends and achieving goals everything is part of meditation . It is not running away from life. Meditation is very balancing act. A meditative person is not introvert or extrovert. He is just balanced.\\nA person trying to concentrate can easily get disturbed, because he is fighting, resisting and trying his best to remain focused on ‘one thing’. A meditative person can not be disturbed because he is not forcing himself to remain focused. He is simply present. Forced alertness or awareness is not meditation , it is concentration.\\nMeditation is to simply being with yourself in the moment . And concentration is to leave yourself and focus on some point in time and space.\\nPosts Related to Meditation and concentration\\n', 'page_rank': 1.6037334e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0100tw-24-18083', '_score': 25.867983, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> lesbian <em>and</em> bisexual?', 'uuid': '11a5b166-daa5-527b-9af8-597a5c759303', 'score': 1589.2927, 'document': 'The more Gay exposure the better please help by sharing this...\\n13 Responses to What is the difference between lesbian and bisexual?\\nbienrad\\n02/11/2012 at 12:51\\nlesbian means you like women\\nbi means you’re pretending to like both men and women at a spring break party to get attention\\nYou Ask Too Many Questions!\\nsays:\\nlesbian means a woman having sexual preference for other women.\\nbi means having sexual preference for both men and women\\n', 'page_rank': 1.4253523e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0705wb-08-12231', '_score': 25.227032, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Kiswahili <em>and</em> Swahili? - K.I.K', 'uuid': '15907118-d76c-5bb4-814e-948acee352bc', 'score': 1818.5201, 'document': '', 'page_rank': 1.1871347e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1714wb-46-28287', '_score': 25.227032, '_source': {'title': 'Hetzner Help Centre | <em>What</em> is <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> software <em>and</em> hardware', 'uuid': '46e6391e-40c4-5239-96b9-badc400dd352', 'score': 1434.5162, 'document': \"You are here: Home > Products and Services > TruServ\\x99 Dedicated Hosting\\nThe difference between software and hardware RAID is the location from where processing is performed.

Here is the plot of Sex and the City 2 : Four privileged white women take a break from relentlessly moaning about their privileged lives to go on an Orientalist fantasy excursion to Abu Dhabi, where they are each assigned a brown servant to wait on them as they maraud through the country, dressed like assholes, exoticizing people, mocking culture, flouting religious custom, and on occasion, “saving” the natives with their American liberation and largess.\\nSATC was always only about a certain type of woman, despite attempts to make Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte into everywoman. But the friendships between the protagonists felt universal. And as cartoonish as the individual characters could be, I saw pieces of them in the women around me, if not in myself .\\nThen I got older. So have the characters in SATC , but the franchise’s male creators aren’t quite sure what to do with women over forty. And so they have taken four flawed but generally likable women and made them repugnant.\\nCharlotte’s chirpy childishness—always a little icky—seems gross coming from a twice-married woman with two children. Carrie’s self-centered flakiness and drama-whoring is exhausting. Samantha and Miranda are unrecognizable—Sam having gone from an independent woman in charge of her sexuality to a desperate caricature fighting to hold on to her youth (Note: Chris Noth, who plays Mr. Big, is two years older than Kim Cattrall, who plays Samantha. Interesting that Samantha is portrayed as fading, while Big still gets to be…well…Mr. Big) while Miranda quits her job because the new partner at the firm is a sexist jerk. No fight. She simply gives up, which seems completely out of character.\\nSATC was never as feminist as it was made out to be, but now it seems as un-empowering and pandering as a those pink “girl” computers by Dell . And when the fearsome foursome arrive in the Middle East, privilege, racism, and ignorance meet in an unholy trifecta. Here is what we learn:\\nAll you need to know about Arab countries, you have already learned in Aladdin . If you have a Jewish married name, do not use it on a trip to Abu Dhabi. In an Arab country, be sure to wear expensive clothing reminiscent of the aforementioned cartoon. (Two words: gold harem pants.) Arab men are either frightening crazy-eyed religious fundamentalists or hot menservants. (By the way, it is not at all creepy to accept the services of said hot, brown menservants, and if one such manservant is gay... jackpot! Two new accessories for the price of one! Refer to him as Paula Abdul.)\\nNo woman ever follows the tenets of Islam by choice; all women who wear abaya or niqab are oppressed and secretly want to be white, wealthy, American women who wear revealing couture. Arab women who are not oppressed may be bellydancers in Western-style nightclubs. It is feminist to travel to Muslim countries and expose yourself, simulate fellatio on a hookah, grab a man’s penis in a restaurant, and possibly have sex on a public beach. If you are trying to communicate in an Arab country and cannot find the right words, saying “lalalalalala” will get your point across.\\nNow, I am sure there are those who will say that I am thinking too deeply about a movie that is meant to be a bit of fluff. For you, I will share that SATC 2 ’s problems are not all about the portrayal of women, privilege, race or religion. Before any of those things pricked my nerves, I was already sighing at the films stilted dialogue, awkward group dynamic, hackneyed situations, and corny jokes that beg for a sitcom laugh track. And then there was the spectacle of seeing Liza Minelli performing “Single Ladies.” Yes, Liza with a “z” sings Beyonce with a “B.”\\n', 'page_rank': 1.2058071e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1407wb-59-02722', '_score': 24.641909, '_source': {'title': 'What&#x27;s <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Cloud Computing <em>and</em> SaaS? | Ulitzer', 'uuid': 'a7b0c943-c322-58c1-a88f-a4c0ab6d2d19', 'score': 1375.3154, 'document': \"Cloud Computing: Article\\nWhat's the Difference Between Cloud Computing and SaaS?\\nEvery time I log into Facebook, or search for flights online, I am taking advantage of cloud computing\\nJuly 25, 2008 11:15 AM EDT\\nReads:\\nPraising Gaw's Blog\\nEvery time I log into Facebook, or search for flights online, I am taking advantage of cloud computing. However, neither of these examples would be considered SaaS. According to Gartner, cloud computing is not just a buzzword; it does have a distinct meaning separate from SaaS.\\nRecently, I’ve noticed that a lot of vendors have started talking about “cloud computing” in their marketing materials. In many cases they’re referring to solutions that were previously called Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), which begs the question – what is the difference between these two terms, anyway? Is “cloud computing” simply a new industry buzzword with no real meaning? Or is there actually a difference between the two?\\nFortunately, the analysts at Gartner helped to answer my question with a recent report that clearly addressed just this issue. According to them, cloud computing is not just a buzzword; it does have a distinct meaning separate from SaaS.\\nThe way I understand it, “cloud computing” refers to the bigger picture…basically the broad concept of using the internet to allow people to access technology-enabled services. According to Gartner, those services must be “massively scalable” to qualify as true “cloud computing”. So according to that definition, every time I log into Facebook, or search for flights online, I am taking advantage of cloud computing. However, neither of these examples would be considered SaaS.\\nWhile most (but not all) Software-as-a-Service solutions fall under the larger cloud computing definition as “massively scalable”, they also have a number of other defining factors. First, SaaS is software that’s “owned, delivered, and managed remotely by one or more providers.” It also “allows a sharing of application processing and storage resources in a one-to-many environment…on a pay-for-use basis, or as a subscription.”\\nSo, with all that said, I can clearly state that Fortiva is a SaaS solution using cloud computing…but does it really matter? At the end of the day it comes down to how well the solution meets the needs of the user, both from a feature-functionality, as well as from a total cost of ownership perspective. Whatever you want to call it, the benefits of SaaS solutions go well beyond the buzzwords that may be used to describe them. Understanding that is much more important than getting caught up in the terms marketers use to try to get customers’ attention.\\n[This post appeared originally here and is republished in full with the kind permission of the author.]\\nPublished July 25, 2008 \\x96 Reads 62,458\\nCopyright © 2008 Ulitzer, Inc. — All Rights Reserved.\\nSyndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author.\\n\", 'page_rank': 1.1967386e-09, 'qid': 38}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0600tw-20-09237', '_score': 24.617075, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Mania <em>and</em> Hypomania? | Breaking Bipolar', 'uuid': '92fc46d4-bc50-54bc-8c85-566d6befe61b', 'score': 1854.9258, 'document': 'August 10, 2011 at 5:11 pm\\nI think I get both hypomania and mania. My mind tends to go pretty quick anyway so I don’t notice thoughts “racing” until they’re really going so fast I’m losing track then my thoughts are like fireworks, exploding all over the place. I can tell I’m in full mania when I close my eyes and see vivid imagery (making it impossible to sleep).\\nI have gone manic enough for my thoughts to become totally garbled and to break up into noise, which I was yelling out at the top of my voice, unalbe to think in English any more. That wasn’t particularly nice.\\nI found I actually felt better as the mania became less intense. In the big episode I had this year I went from depressed to full-blown manic with visions and voices in 3 days. On day 1 I was probably hypomanic, on day 2 irritable and paranoid; on day 3 I was already grandiose. It peaked about 4 days later when I was higher than I’ve gone on any drug and I’ve tried them all.\\nThe whole thing took about 10 weeks to wear off and as I say I felt better in the long hypomanic stage at the end than during most of the mania. When I was manic I could lose my temper just from thinking about something (and I did a LOT of thinking). If only I could harness the best of it and get rid of the worst…. and if only I could live without depression.\\nI’m only glad I’ve gone higher on mania than low on depression ~ even though I’ve spent far longer depressed than manic. It also, incidentally, took me 20 years to get diagnosed and I’m labelled schizoaffective not bipolar. My dr says I was too floridly psychotic to be just manic (I hallucinate very vividly), and this is using ICD10 criteria. In America I might be bipolar, as I’m not sure I’ve had hallucinations and/or delusions in the absence of marked mood symptoms for 2 weeks or more. Basically because I’ve never gone 2 weeks without marked mood symptoms and because the antipsychotics break up the psychosis better than they dispel the mood swings and I’m not prescribed a mood stabilizer.\\nThose oppressive thoughts you describe sound nasty. My problem tends to be the “flight of ideas” ~ I jump from topic to topic, totally forgetting where I’ve been and why I’m there. I can do this in writing almost as badly as in speech. I’m prone to tangentiality even in a normal mood, so when the mood is “elevated” it really becomes marked sometimes. I’ve also found not all the symptoms peak at the same time, so I might feel higher one week but far speedier the next. The only really good book I’ve read on mood disorders is Emil Kraepelin’s Manic-Depressive Insanity and Paranoia. It blows all recent efforts out of the water!\\nAlex W\\nFebruary 24, 2012 at 3:21 pm\\nI am a teenager and I was diagnosed with BP when I was 12 following a move from the city with my family. I have been on meds since about then. Last October, I did something I would never suggest to anyone. I went of my meds without my doctor’s permission. It was a VERY bad idea. I went through a depression so bad that I tried to/thought about committing suicide several times. I have been a cutter for several years.\\nHowever, recently some of my friends and my new therapist have been a wonderful help. My three closest friends, Ben, Madison, and Steph, have pulled be back and helped me through so much these past few years! They have been there for me no matter what mood I have been in. I am posting here to remind everyone that even when everything is at its worst there are ALWAYS people who care. Even when you feel that it would be better to die there are ALWAYS people who will miss you and wish that you had told them what was going on. NEVER EVER EVER forget that! It may be so difficult to remember that when you are depressed or in a mixed state, but try to remember that you are worth more than any object in the entire world.\\nYou are a human, made in God’s image. He loves you and will always love you! It took me so long to realize that, but now that I know I understand so much more. Jeremiah 29:11-14 says “11 ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.’”\\nI have been working on improving my control over my moods for several years now. I am a little better off now, but it is mostly because of my friends, my therapist and God. I have been safely back on my meds for the past year and a half and I am so grateful that my attempts did not work! God has given me this life back for a reason and I am thankful that I have friends who can help me figure out that reason. God loves you, never forget that!\\nLeave a Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

And just because someone has a this addiction, doesn’t mean they are a spousal abuser.\\nWhile it’s true that their sexual habits go hand-in-hand with sexual control, their addiction is about the sexual arousal, not the partner control. This is the primary distinction.\\nSex Addicts, Drug Addicts and Domestic Abuse\\nI liken it to the relationship between drug addictions and domestic abuse. While it is true that abusers can get more aggressive in their verbal and physical altercations with the use of alcohol, it is important to member that alcohol addiction and domestic abuse are two separate syndromes.\\nIn the case of alcohol and drug abuse, be mindful that the addiction is toward the substance. Whereas, domestic abuse has more to do with an addiction to controlling one’s partner in and of itself.\\nThe same is true for sex addictions. Those who have addictions to sex may seek to control the sex in their intimate relationships. However, they do not do this as a means to another end…such as, controlling their intimate partners. Rather, the control is about the sexual experience.\\nViolence as a Manifestation of Another Addiction\\nThere may be violence associated with both the sex and drug addiction that is displayed in the addicts efforts to control their substance for the drug addict and their sexual arousal for the sex addict. But this manifestation of violence is merely that. It’s a by-product of seeking the focus of their addiction, which is not the same as the violence of domestic abuse.\\nIn the case of domestic abuse, violence is a manifestation of domestic abuse, but the “domestic abuse” is fundamentally about “the control”… specifically, controlling the intimate partner. The battering (verbal, emotional and physical) is used to establish and maintain an unequal distribution of power and control in the relationship.\\nImplications for Treating Couples in Abusive Relationships\\nIf you are in an abusive relationship, in which intimate partner violence has been identified in combination with either an alcohol, drug or sex addiction, then be mindful of the implications for treatment. Make sure that your couples or partner’s therapist is addressing the addictions separately.\\nRealize that drug and sex addictions are both syndromes separate from intimate partner abuse. And moreover, they must be treated independently with an appropriate addiction specific intervention.\\nConcurrent Treatment for Abusers and Addicts\\nI find the greatest success when substance and sex addicts are in a twelve-step program for their addiction while they are going through a domestic abuse intervention. Treatment goals remain separate and are accomplished independently from the domestic violence treatment.\\n', 'page_rank': 1.2060299e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1510wb-28-16186', '_score': 24.617075, '_source': {'title': 'Knowing <em>and</em> Making: <em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> cognitive economics', 'uuid': '008f2f4d-0d17-5b3b-9fec-bf041d67a672', 'score': 1565.9775, 'document': 'A blog about cognitive and behavioural economics. Building mathematical models of how psychology influences economic systems.\\nWednesday, 15 September 2010\\nWhat is the difference between cognitive economics and behavioural finance?\\nThis question was posed in an interesting LinkedIn discussion group (Behavioural Finance: Theory and Practice) by Kerry Pechter.\\nI dashed off a quick answer which ended up being 500 words long. So I thought it might be useful to post on here.\\nCan anyone tell me the difference between cognitive economics and behavioral finance?\\nCognitive economics is not yet a widely used phrase, though Marco Novarese and I have been using it as a name for a more microfounded version of what\\'s typically called behavioural economics.\\nSo I\\'ll answer the question based on how I use the term.\\nThe first difference is between \"economics\" and \"finance\". Economics is a broader field, including the trading of any kind of goods or services, whereas finance specifically focuses on investment and the value of financial instruments. Indeed I consider economics very broadly to be the study of how resources are allocated (by individuals, and across society).\\nThe more fundamental distinction is between \"cognitive\" and \"behavioural\". In short, cognitive is about how we think, while behavioural is about what we do. Behavioural finance and economics focus on the phenomena of how people behave - for example what will they do (on average) when faced with a given choice between two ways of paying for something?\\nCognitive economics (or finance), on the other hand, looks at what is actually going on within the individual\\'s mind when they make that choice. What is the internal structure of their decision-making, what are the influences on it, how does information enter the mind and how is it processed, what form do preferences take internally, and then ultimately how are all those processes expressed in our behaviour?\\nI would also distinguish between the way that behavioural economics and finance are practised, and what cognitive economists do. Behavioural economics is quite an experiment-driven field. BE (and BF) people mostly start from the framework of classical economics and do experiments to find out where real behaviour differs from the classical assumptions of rationality. BE is quite practical in one sense - it gives us a way to imagine the ways that people might behave when confronted with a given situation. However it does not make good predictions about how they will behave - generally it will rely on experiments to distinguish among the different possible behaviour modes.\\nCognitive economists start at a lower level, from a microfounded model of how people make decisions, and work upwards theoretically, to develop a self-consistent model of large-scale economic behaviour. Cognitive economics therefore should ultimately be able to explain or predict behaviour from a minimal set of base data. In some ways this is the same goal as classical economics, but with a richer and more accurate microfoundation leading to more powerful and better micro and macroeconomic predictions.\\nA simpler way to explain it is by analogy with the difference between engineering and physics. Behavioural finance is like engineering - engineers know some rules about how objects behave, and they can use those rules to design and test new implementations of existing inventions, and fix things that have already been built. Cognitive economics is like physics - physicists know the underlying theory of how things work, and they can use that to explain how existing inventions operate, and to work out how to create wholly new ones.\\n', 'page_rank': 1.1859862e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1605wb-76-09417', '_score': 24.617075, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> a community <em>and</em> Communitas? | www.', 'uuid': '3aa3ebd1-bbe1-5ec0-968a-d226d74268dc', 'score': 1526.2968, 'document': \"There is a need to state the difference between a community and communitas.\\nA community is a broad classification and includes almost any gathering of people for whatever purpose.\\nCommunitas is a restricted grouping and only applies where there is a felt sense of close connection. In communitas the individual willing surrenders his or her will to a group of individuals. A recent clear example is the video and television series, A Band Of Brothers. In that series Easy Company moves into that magic space called communitas. The individual members of Easy Company willingly surrendered their will to a group called Easy Company. They were bound together by the knowledge they were prepared to die for each other. Whatever it took to keep their buddies alive was their commitment.\\nIt is unfortumate in some way to look at a war situation as an example. That is perhaps only because our understanding of the magic that occurs in communitas can be comprehended by 20th century people in a war situation. Our industrialised society - based as it is on individualism - has no understanding of this magic.\\nGo back to Chaucer and Canterbury Tales - somewhere around 1370 - and the pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This group did not know each other before they started the pilgrimage and were not dragging their personal history with them. As they talked to each other they revealed themselves and slowly developed a deep connection. In addition they were talking in old English which is almost like a musical hum or mutterings in a cantilena. The sound itself is hypnotic. I invite you to imagine a hot summer day, the plodding of the horses, the bucolic Kent countryside, the cadences of the speaker casting a spell over the pilgrims, the shared commitment to a pilgrimage, the understanding and acceptance of everyone as they are, no pretense, heart meeting heart.\\nCommunitas then, is something of much greater impact than community. It is as Victor Turner describes -\\na place and moment “in and out of time,” and such an actor - as the evidence of many pilgrims of many religions attests - hopes to have there direct experience of the sacred, invisible or supernatural order, either in the material aspect of miraculous healing or in the immaterial aspect of inward transformation of spirit or personality.\\nWe all, perhaps, have touched upon communitas when we meet a stranger in unusual circumstances and are suddenly bonded as though we have known them for eternity. Walking along a road in California, hitching a ride, a car stops, we get in and are plunged into a 'knowing' of each other that is indeed, 'in and out of time'.\\nWhat we are doing here, on this very web site, is nurturing that lost soul connection - seeking to create our version, and re-emerge in a world of caring and conscious connection.\\nLogin or register to post comments\\nRecent blog posts\\n\", 'page_rank': 1.1974525e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0013wb-07-11266', '_score': 24.617075, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Contemporary Christian Worship Music <em>and</em>', 'uuid': '34867a26-9eef-56a9-9298-b64da9e9335d', 'score': 1522.3751, 'document': 'What is the Difference Between Contemporary Christian Worship Music and Old Interdenominational Hymns?\\nJan/07/10 07:33 Filed in: Music\\nMUSICAL ASSOCIATIONS -- WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING CONTEMPORARY WORSHIP MUSIC AND USING OLD HYMNS THAT WERE INTERDENOMINATIONAL?\\nUpdated March 20, 2011 (first published January 7, 2010) (David Cloud, Fundamental Baptist Information Service, P.O. Box 610368, Port Huron, MI 48061, 866-295-4143, fbns@wayoflife.org; for instructions about subscribing and unsubscribing or changing addresses, see the information paragraph at the end of the article) -\\nThe following is from the 2011 edition of CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC: SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND SOME WARNINGS GIVEN . This book begins with the author’s experience of living the rock & roll lifestyle before he was saved and of how the Lord dealt with him about music in the early months of my Christian life. The next section of the book expounds on FIVE REASONS WHY WE ARE OPPOSED TO CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC AND THE CONTEMPORARY PRAISE MUSIC: It is worldly; it is ecumenical; it is charismatic; it is experience-oriented; and it weakens the fundamentalist stance of churches. We give examples of how changes are occurring in formerly staunchly fundamentalist churches through the instrumentality of contemporary music. The next section of the book answers 29 QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASKED ON THIS SUBJECT. These are as follows: Should Christians only use old music? Isn\\'t music neutral? Does a b flat note have a moral quality? Isn\\'t the sincerity of the musicians the important thing? Isn\\'t some of the contemporary Christian music acceptable? What is the difference between using contemporary worship music and using old hymns that were interdenominational? What about the miracles that some CCM artists witness? Why does traditional church music seem dull? Didn\\'t Luther use tavern music? Didn’t the Wesleys use tavern music? Isn\\'t the issue of music just a matter of taste? Doesn\\'t the Bible encourage us to use cymbals and stringed and loud sounding instruments? Why are you opposed to drums? What is wrong with soft rock? If we assume that Christian music is demonic, why would the devil sing about Jesus Christ and the things of God? Didn\\'t God create all music? Christians are not supposed to judge, are they? Love is more important than doctrine and standards of living, isn\\'t it? Since God looks on the heart, why are you concerned about appearance? Isn\\'t Christianity all about grace? Shouldn\\'t we use rock music to reach the youth? Making rules and standards about music and clothing and such is pharisaical legalism, isn\\'t it? Don\\'t 1 Corinthians 6:12 and 10:23 teach that the Christian has liberty? Didn\\'t Paul say that he was made all things to all men? David danced before the Lord, so why are you against dancing in the churches? Why do you say that the Pentecostal-Charismatic movement is unscriptural? By preaching against Christian rock aren\\'t you hurting people and hindering their ministries? What about all of the young people who are being saved through CCM? The final sections contain TIPS FOR KEEPING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC OUT OF THE CHURCHES and SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR SACRED MUSIC. 190 pages. $8.95\\n_________________________\\nQUESTION\\nA pastor asked the following question:\\n“What is the difference from using songs that every denomination using across the board from the past (‘Just as I Am,’ ‘Amazing Grace,’ etc.) to using songs that everyone uses across the board in the present (‘How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,’ ‘Holy Ground,’ ‘Majesty,’ etc.)\\xa0if they follow Biblical principles and if we do not promote a particular artist whose lifestyle we don’t support?”\\nAnother pastor who wrote to criticize me for my warning about Independent Baptist churches that are adapting CCM said that if my position is true I should stop using the King James Bible, because it was written by Anglicans.\\nANSWER\\nThis is a very typical argument used by CCM defenders, and it is amazing to hear it on the lips of an Independent Baptist preacher who would doubtless think of himself as a real defender of the faith. If we buy into this argument, we will not be able to resist the onslaught of CCM in any effective manner except perhaps to stand against hard rock, and that stand won’t last very long. Those who accept soft rock will eventually accept “hard” rock. It’s the same fleshly beast.\\nIn a nutshell, I would offer three rejoinders:\\nFirst, the old Protestant denominations were fundamentally different than their modern counterparts.\\nThe old Lutherans and Methodists were militant for the Christian faith and were not infiltrated by theological modernism and other new thinking. They hated Popery! The old Protestants were much closer, doctrinally and spiritually, to the position of today’s old-fashioned Baptist church than to that of the contemporary movement.\\nSecond, CCM represents a philosophy of end-times Christianity that is diametrically opposed to and an avowed enemy of every “old-fashioned” Bible church .\\nThe use of an old doctrinally sound hymn by a Lutheran like Luther or a Methodist like Wesley does not put our people in danger of becoming Lutherans or Methodists. I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming a Lutheran by singing “A Mighty Fortress.” Likewise, I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming an Anglican simply because the KJV translators were Anglicans.\\nBut the use of CCM is turning IB churches into emerging everywhere. That is because CCM is not just music written by people of questionable doctrine; it represents a philosophy and a movement of end-time apostasy that is diametrically opposed to an “old-fashioned” Bible stand, that is an absolutely enemy of what an “old-fashioned” Baptist church stands for. Large numbers of formerly fundamental Baptist churches have gone down the emerging path through the influence of CCM. (see “Contemporary Music Brings Great Changes to IB Churches”).\\nIf you think it is a mere coincidence that CCM is at the very heart of every change of this nature, you are welcome to your opinion, but I do not share it, and I would far rather err on the side of being too “strict” about music than too “tolerant.”\\nDan Lucarini, author of Why I Left the Contemporary Christian Music Movement: Confessions of a Former Worship Leader (which I highly recommend), says:\\n“No one should deny the power of music to proselytize! Pastors in particular must defend their flocks from false teaching, heresies and ‘ear ticklers’ who bring worldly sensuality into the congregation; you are right to point out how easily this comes into a church through worship music. It seems wiser to decline the use of what seems to be a perfectly good song, rather than to give any honor and hint of endorsement to the composer and his/her mission” (e-mail, May 24, 2009).\\nThird, the Contemporary Christian Music field is permeated with false christs and false gods.\\nWhatever doctrinal differences a Baptist would have with Martin Luther or John Wesley or Fanny Crosby, we share the same God, but that is often not true for Contemporary Christian Worship.\\nMany of the influential CCW artists worship a non-Trinitarian God. For example, Geron Davis and Joel Hemphill are “Jesus Only” Pentecostals who deny the Trinity. To deny the Trinity is to worship a false God.\\nOther CCW artists worship a non-vengeful God. Stuart Townend, for example, denies that God is vengeful, which is a brazen rejection of the very God of the Bible (Stuart Townend, “Mission: Worship, The Story Behind the Song”).\\nA great many of the CCM artists worship a God who is non-judgmental, universalistic, does not send people to an eternal hell, and puts no obligations on them. Consider the popularity of The Shack among CCM artists. It has been directly endorsed by Michael W. Smith and has been well received in prominent CCM circles such as Calvary Chapels, Vineyard churches, and Hillsong. It was promoted at the 2009 National Pastor’s Convention in San Diego, which was sponsored by Zondervan and InterVarsity Fellowship. Young was one of the speakers and a survey found that 57% had read the novel. Young was enthusiastically received, and in an interview with Andy Crouch, a senior editor of Christianity Today, there was not a hint of condemnation for his false god. Crouch is a CCM musician in his own right and led one of the praise and worship sessions in San Diego.\\nThe Shack is all about redefining God. It is about a man whose becomes bitter at God after his daughter is murdered and has a life-changing experience with God in the very shack where the murder occurred; but the God he encounters is most definitely not the God of the Bible.\\nYoung says the book is for those with “a longing that God is as kind and loving as we wish he was” (interview with Sherman Hu, Dec. 4, 2007). What he is referring to is the desire on the part of the natural man for a God who loves “unconditionally” and does not require obedience, does not require repentance, does not judge sin, and does not make men feel guilty for what they do.\\nIn that same interview, Young said that a woman wrote to him and said that her 22-year-old daughter came to her after reading the book and asked, “IS IT ALRIGHT IF I DIVORCE THE OLD GOD AND MARRY THE NEW ONE?”\\nThis is precisely what a large portion of the Contemporary Christian Music generation is doing.\\nYoung admits that the God of “The Shack” is different from the traditional God of Bible-believing Christianity and blasphemously says that the God who “watches from a distance and judges sin” is “a Christianized version of Zeus.”\\nThis reminds me of the modernist G. Bromley Oxnam, who called the God of the Old Testament “a dirty bully” in his 1944 book “Preaching in a Revolutionary Age.”\\nYoung depicts the triune God as a young Asian woman named “Sarayu” * (supposedly the Holy Spirit), an oriental carpenter who loves to have a good time (supposedly Jesus), and an older black woman named “Elousia” (supposedly God the Father). God the Father is also depicted as a guy with a ponytail and a goatee. (* The name “Sarayu” is from the Hindu scriptures and represents a mythical river in India on the shores of which the Hindu god Rama was born.)\\nYoung’s god is the god of the emerging church. He is cool, loves rock & roll, is non-judgmental, does not exercise wrath toward sin, does not send unbelievers to an eternal fiery hell, does not require repentance and the new birth, puts no obligations on people, doesn’t like traditional Bible churches, does not accept the Bible as the infallible Word of God, and does not mind if the early chapters of the Bible are interpreted as “myth.” (See “The Shack’s Cool God” at the Way of Life web site, www.wayoflife.org.)\\nThe false CCM non-judgmental, universalistic god is represented by emerging church leaders Brian McLaren and Rob Bell, both of whom are very popular with CCM artists.\\nMcLaren calls the God who punished Jesus on the cross for man’s sin “a God who is incapable of forgiving, unless he kicks somebody else” (McLaren, http://www.understandthetimes.org/mclarentrans.shtml and http://str.typepad.com/weblog/2006/01/brian_mclaren_p.html). He presents the traditional God of the Bible as a tyrant who “gets his way through coercion and violence and intimidation and domination. McLaren says that the “power of the blood” gospel “raises some questions about the goodness of God.”\\nRob Bell, author of the extremely popular and influential book Velvet Elvis, claims that the God who would allow multitudes to go to eternal hell is not great or mighty (Love Wins, location 1189-1229). He says that such God is not loving and calls the preaching of eternal hell “misguided and toxic.” says there is something wrong with this God and calls Him “terrifying and traumatizing and unbearable” (Love Wins, location 47-60, 1273-1287, 2098-2113). He even says that if an earthly father acted like the God who sends people to hell “we could contact child protection services immediately” (Love Wins, location 2085-2098).\\nIt is obvious that Bell worships a different God than the One we worship in “traditional” Baptist churches.\\nBell’s God is more akin to New Age panentheism than the God of the Bible. He describes God as “a force, an energy, a being calling out to us in many languages, using a variety of methods and events” (Love Wins, location 1710-1724).\\n“There is an energy in the world, a spark, an electricity that everything is plugged into. The Greeks called it zoe, the mystics call it ‘Spirit,’ and Obi-Wan called it ‘the Force’” (Love Wins, location 1749-1762).\\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that Bell recommends the writings of New Age pantheists. ----\\nBell worships a false christ. His Jesus is “supracultural ... present within all cultures ... refuses to be co-opted or owned by any one culture ... He doesn’t even state that those coming to the Father through him will even now that they are coming exclusively through him ... there is only mountain, but many paths. ... People come to Jesus in all sorts of ways ... Sometimes people use his name; other times they don’t” (Love Wins, location 1827-1840, 1865-1878, 1918-1933).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rebel Christ, which is certainly a false christ. Mark Stuart of Audio Adrenaline says, “Jesus Christ is the biggest rebel to ever walk the face of the earth” (Pensacola News Journal, Pensacola, Fla., March 1, 1998, pp. 1, 6E). Sonny of P.O.D. says, “We believe that Jesus was the first rebel; the first punk rocker” (http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/pod0700.phtml). This is absolute blasphemy. The Bible says rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft (1 Sam. 15:23). A rebel is a lawbreaker, but Christ was the lawgiver who He came to earth to fulfill the requirements of His own law (Matt. 5:17-19). Christ was not crucified for rebellion; He was crucified for testifying that He is God (John 10:33).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rock & roll party Christ. In his Live ... Radically Saved video Carman says, “Jesus is always cool; He’s got his thing together.” In Resurrection Rap Carman portrays Jesus as a street hippie; in The Standard he calls Jesus “J.C.”; and in Addicted to Jesus he speaks of “Jammin’ with the Lamb.” Robert Sweet of the Christian rock band Stryper had “Jesus Christ Rocks” painted on the back of his drummer chair. Petra claims that “God gave rock and roll to you/ Put it in the soul of every one.” In “Party in Heaven” the Daniel Band sing, “The Lamb and I are drinkin’ new wine.” Phil Driscoll says, “God is the King of Soul; He’s the King of all rhythm” (quoted by Tim Fisher, Battle for Christian Music, p. 82). Messiah Prophet Band says, “Jesus is the Master of Metal,” and Barren Cross says, “Better than pot, Jesus rocks.” John Fischer described God as puffing on a cigar and swaying to rock music (CCM Magazine, July 1984, p. 20), while J. Lee Grady says Jesus enjoys dancing with the angels and “grooving to the sound of Christian R&B pumped out of a boom box” (Charisma, July 2000).\\nThe fact that the CCM crowd typically worships a different kind of God than the “old-fashioned” Biblicist, is why they are perfectly comfortable using music that has been identified as sexy by the secular world.\\n“... that is what rock is all about--sex with a 100-megaton bomb, the beat” (Gene Simmons of KISS, Entertainment Tonight, ABC, Dec. 10, 1987).\\nNote that Simmons was not referring to the words of rock music; he was referring only to its backbeat rhythm.\\nMusic researchers Daniel and Bernadette Skubik, in their study on the neurophysiology of rock music, warned:\\n“Whether the words are evil, innocuous, or based in Holy Scripture, the overall neurophysiological effects generated by rock music remain the same. There is simply no such thing as Christian rock that is substantively different in its impact” (“The Neurophysiology of Rock,” an Appendix to Ken Blanchard, Pop Goes the Gospel. pp. 187ff).\\nThat statement doesn’t bother a CCM defender, because he sees Jesus as a rock & roll party Dude who loves a good time.\\n“Those who envision God as a special friend, a kind of lover, with whom they can have fun, see no problem in worshipping him by means of physically stimulating music. On the other hand, those who perceive God as a majestic, holy, and almighty Being to be approached with awe and reverence will only use the music that elevates them spiritually” (Samuele Bacchiocchi, The Christian and Rock Music).\\nBy the way, we urge churches to be careful even with older hymns. We have never said that if a hymn is old it is good or if it is new it is bad. We must examine all hymns as to musical character and doctrinal purity. In my estimation, there are hymns in the standard hymnals used by Independent Baptist churches that shouldn’t be used (e.g., “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “We’ve a Story to Tell to the Nations”).\\n____________________________\\nDistributed by Way of Life Literature\\'s Fundamental Baptist Information Service, an e-mail listing for Fundamental Baptists and other fundamentalist, Bible-believing Christians.

Box 610368, Port Huron, MI 48061, 866-295-4143, fbns@wayoflife.org; for instructions about subscribing and unsubscribing or changing addresses, see the information paragraph at the end of the article) -\\nThe following is from the 2011 edition of CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC: SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND SOME WARNINGS GIVEN . This book begins with the author’s experience of living the rock & roll lifestyle before he was saved and of how the Lord dealt with him about music in the early months of my Christian life. The next section of the book expounds on FIVE REASONS WHY WE ARE OPPOSED TO CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC AND THE CONTEMPORARY PRAISE MUSIC: It is worldly; it is ecumenical; it is charismatic; it is experience-oriented; and it weakens the fundamentalist stance of churches. We give examples of how changes are occurring in formerly staunchly fundamentalist churches through the instrumentality of contemporary music. The next section of the book answers 29 QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASKED ON THIS SUBJECT. These are as follows: Should Christians only use old music? Isn\\'t music neutral? Does a b flat note have a moral quality? Isn\\'t the sincerity of the musicians the important thing? Isn\\'t some of the contemporary Christian music acceptable? What is the difference between using contemporary worship music and using old hymns that were interdenominational? What about the miracles that some CCM artists witness? Why does traditional church music seem dull? Didn\\'t Luther use tavern music? Didn’t the Wesleys use tavern music? Isn\\'t the issue of music just a matter of taste? Doesn\\'t the Bible encourage us to use cymbals and stringed and loud sounding instruments? Why are you opposed to drums? What is wrong with soft rock? If we assume that Christian music is demonic, why would the devil sing about Jesus Christ and the things of God? Didn\\'t God create all music? Christians are not supposed to judge, are they? Love is more important than doctrine and standards of living, isn\\'t it? Since God looks on the heart, why are you concerned about appearance? Isn\\'t Christianity all about grace? Shouldn\\'t we use rock music to reach the youth? Making rules and standards about music and clothing and such is pharisaical legalism, isn\\'t it? Don\\'t 1 Corinthians 6:12 and 10:23 teach that the Christian has liberty? Didn\\'t Paul say that he was made all things to all men? David danced before the Lord, so why are you against dancing in the churches? Why do you say that the Pentecostal-Charismatic movement is unscriptural? By preaching against Christian rock aren\\'t you hurting people and hindering their ministries? What about all of the young people who are being saved through CCM? The final sections contain TIPS FOR KEEPING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC OUT OF THE CHURCHES and SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR SACRED MUSIC. 190 pages. $8.95\\n_________________________\\nQUESTION\\nA pastor asked the following question:\\n“What is the difference from using songs that every denomination using across the board from the past (‘Just as I Am,’ ‘Amazing Grace,’ etc.) to using songs that everyone uses across the board in the present (‘How Deep the Father’s Love for Us,’ ‘Holy Ground,’ ‘Majesty,’ etc.)\\xa0if they follow Biblical principles and if we do not promote a particular artist whose lifestyle we don’t support?”\\nAnother pastor who wrote to criticize me for my warning about Independent Baptist churches that are adapting CCM said that if my position is true I should stop using the King James Bible, because it was written by Anglicans.\\nANSWER\\nThis is a very typical argument used by CCM defenders, and it is amazing to hear it on the lips of an Independent Baptist preacher who would doubtless think of himself as a real defender of the faith. If we buy into this argument, we will not be able to resist the onslaught of CCM in any effective manner except perhaps to stand against hard rock, and that stand won’t last very long. Those who accept soft rock will eventually accept “hard” rock. It’s the same fleshly beast.\\nIn a nutshell, I would offer three rejoinders:\\nFirst, the old Protestant denominations were fundamentally different than their modern counterparts.\\nThe old Lutherans and Methodists were militant for the Christian faith and were not infiltrated by theological modernism and other new thinking. They hated Popery! The old Protestants were much closer, doctrinally and spiritually, to the position of today’s old-fashioned Baptist church than to that of the contemporary movement.\\nSecond, CCM represents a philosophy of end-times Christianity that is diametrically opposed to and an avowed enemy of every “old-fashioned” Bible church .\\nThe use of an old doctrinally sound hymn by a Lutheran like Luther or a Methodist like Wesley does not put our people in danger of becoming Lutherans or Methodists. I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming a Lutheran by singing “A Mighty Fortress.” Likewise, I have never heard of an Independent Baptist becoming an Anglican simply because the KJV translators were Anglicans.\\nBut the use of CCM is turning IB churches into emerging everywhere. That is because CCM is not just music written by people of questionable doctrine; it represents a philosophy and a movement of end-time apostasy that is diametrically opposed to an “old-fashioned” Bible stand, that is an absolutely enemy of what an “old-fashioned” Baptist church stands for. Large numbers of formerly fundamental Baptist churches have gone down the emerging path through the influence of CCM. (see “Contemporary Music Brings Great Changes to IB Churches”).\\nIf you think it is a mere coincidence that CCM is at the very heart of every change of this nature, you are welcome to your opinion, but I do not share it, and I would far rather err on the side of being too “strict” about music than too “tolerant.”\\nDan Lucarini, author of Why I Left the Contemporary Christian Music Movement: Confessions of a Former Worship Leader (which I highly recommend), says:\\n“No one should deny the power of music to proselytize! Pastors in particular must defend their flocks from false teaching, heresies and ‘ear ticklers’ who bring worldly sensuality into the congregation; you are right to point out how easily this comes into a church through worship music. It seems wiser to decline the use of what seems to be a perfectly good song, rather than to give any honor and hint of endorsement to the composer and his/her mission” (e-mail, May 24, 2009).\\nThird, the Contemporary Christian Music field is permeated with false christs and false gods.\\nWhatever doctrinal differences a Baptist would have with Martin Luther or John Wesley or Fanny Crosby, we share the same God, but that is often not true for Contemporary Christian Worship.\\nMany of the influential CCW artists worship a non-Trinitarian God. For example, Geron Davis and Joel Hemphill are “Jesus Only” Pentecostals who deny the Trinity. To deny the Trinity is to worship a false God.\\nOther CCW artists worship a non-vengeful God. Stuart Townend, for example, denies that God is vengeful, which is a brazen rejection of the very God of the Bible (Stuart Townend, “Mission: Worship, The Story Behind the Song”).\\nA great many of the CCM artists worship a God who is non-judgmental, universalistic, does not send people to an eternal hell, and puts no obligations on them. Consider the popularity of The Shack among CCM artists. It has been directly endorsed by Michael W. Smith and has been well received in prominent CCM circles such as Calvary Chapels, Vineyard churches, and Hillsong. It was promoted at the 2009 National Pastor’s Convention in San Diego, which was sponsored by Zondervan and InterVarsity Fellowship. Young was one of the speakers and a survey found that 57% had read the novel. Young was enthusiastically received, and in an interview with Andy Crouch, a senior editor of Christianity Today, there was not a hint of condemnation for his false god. Crouch is a CCM musician in his own right and led one of the praise and worship sessions in San Diego.\\nThe Shack is all about redefining God. It is about a man whose becomes bitter at God after his daughter is murdered and has a life-changing experience with God in the very shack where the murder occurred; but the God he encounters is most definitely not the God of the Bible.\\nYoung says the book is for those with “a longing that God is as kind and loving as we wish he was” (interview with Sherman Hu, Dec. 4, 2007). What he is referring to is the desire on the part of the natural man for a God who loves “unconditionally” and does not require obedience, does not require repentance, does not judge sin, and does not make men feel guilty for what they do.\\nIn that same interview, Young said that a woman wrote to him and said that her 22-year-old daughter came to her after reading the book and asked, “IS IT ALRIGHT IF I DIVORCE THE OLD GOD AND MARRY THE NEW ONE?”\\nThis is precisely what a large portion of the Contemporary Christian Music generation is doing.\\nYoung admits that the God of “The Shack” is different from the traditional God of Bible-believing Christianity and blasphemously says that the God who “watches from a distance and judges sin” is “a Christianized version of Zeus.”\\nThis reminds me of the modernist G. Bromley Oxnam, who called the God of the Old Testament “a dirty bully” in his 1944 book “Preaching in a Revolutionary Age.”\\nYoung depicts the triune God as a young Asian woman named “Sarayu” * (supposedly the Holy Spirit), an oriental carpenter who loves to have a good time (supposedly Jesus), and an older black woman named “Elousia” (supposedly God the Father). God the Father is also depicted as a guy with a ponytail and a goatee. (* The name “Sarayu” is from the Hindu scriptures and represents a mythical river in India on the shores of which the Hindu god Rama was born.)\\nYoung’s god is the god of the emerging church. He is cool, loves rock & roll, is non-judgmental, does not exercise wrath toward sin, does not send unbelievers to an eternal fiery hell, does not require repentance and the new birth, puts no obligations on people, doesn’t like traditional Bible churches, does not accept the Bible as the infallible Word of God, and does not mind if the early chapters of the Bible are interpreted as “myth.” (See “The Shack’s Cool God” at the Way of Life web site, www.wayoflife.org.)\\nThe false CCM non-judgmental, universalistic god is represented by emerging church leaders Brian McLaren and Rob Bell, both of whom are very popular with CCM artists.\\nMcLaren calls the God who punished Jesus on the cross for man’s sin “a God who is incapable of forgiving, unless he kicks somebody else” (McLaren, http://www.understandthetimes.org/mclarentrans.shtml and http://str.typepad.com/weblog/2006/01/brian_mclaren_p.html). He presents the traditional God of the Bible as a tyrant who “gets his way through coercion and violence and intimidation and domination. McLaren says that the “power of the blood” gospel “raises some questions about the goodness of God.”\\nRob Bell, author of the extremely popular and influential book Velvet Elvis, claims that the God who would allow multitudes to go to eternal hell is not great or mighty (Love Wins, location 1189-1229). He says that such God is not loving and calls the preaching of eternal hell “misguided and toxic.” says there is something wrong with this God and calls Him “terrifying and traumatizing and unbearable” (Love Wins, location 47-60, 1273-1287, 2098-2113). He even says that if an earthly father acted like the God who sends people to hell “we could contact child protection services immediately” (Love Wins, location 2085-2098).\\nIt is obvious that Bell worships a different God than the One we worship in “traditional” Baptist churches.\\nBell’s God is more akin to New Age panentheism than the God of the Bible. He describes God as “a force, an energy, a being calling out to us in many languages, using a variety of methods and events” (Love Wins, location 1710-1724).\\n“There is an energy in the world, a spark, an electricity that everything is plugged into. The Greeks called it zoe, the mystics call it ‘Spirit,’ and Obi-Wan called it ‘the Force’” (Love Wins, location 1749-1762).\\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that Bell recommends the writings of New Age pantheists. ----\\nBell worships a false christ. His Jesus is “supracultural ... present within all cultures ... refuses to be co-opted or owned by any one culture ... He doesn’t even state that those coming to the Father through him will even now that they are coming exclusively through him ... there is only mountain, but many paths. ... People come to Jesus in all sorts of ways ... Sometimes people use his name; other times they don’t” (Love Wins, location 1827-1840, 1865-1878, 1918-1933).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rebel Christ, which is certainly a false christ. Mark Stuart of Audio Adrenaline says, “Jesus Christ is the biggest rebel to ever walk the face of the earth” (Pensacola News Journal, Pensacola, Fla., March 1, 1998, pp. 1, 6E). Sonny of P.O.D. says, “We believe that Jesus was the first rebel; the first punk rocker” (http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/pod0700.phtml). This is absolute blasphemy. The Bible says rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft (1 Sam. 15:23). A rebel is a lawbreaker, but Christ was the lawgiver who He came to earth to fulfill the requirements of His own law (Matt. 5:17-19). Christ was not crucified for rebellion; He was crucified for testifying that He is God (John 10:33).\\nMany of the CCM artists worship a rock & roll party Christ. In his Live ... Radically Saved video Carman says, “Jesus is always cool; He’s got his thing together.” In Resurrection Rap Carman portrays Jesus as a street hippie; in The Standard he calls Jesus “J.C.”; and in Addicted to Jesus he speaks of “Jammin’ with the Lamb.” Robert Sweet of the Christian rock band Stryper had “Jesus Christ Rocks” painted on the back of his drummer chair. Petra claims that “God gave rock and roll to you/ Put it in the soul of every one.” In “Party in Heaven” the Daniel Band sing, “The Lamb and I are drinkin’ new wine.” Phil Driscoll says, “God is the King of Soul; He’s the King of all rhythm” (quoted by Tim Fisher, Battle for Christian Music, p. 82). Messiah Prophet Band says, “Jesus is the Master of Metal,” and Barren Cross says, “Better than pot, Jesus rocks.” John Fischer described God as puffing on a cigar and swaying to rock music (CCM Magazine, July 1984, p. 20), while J. Lee Grady says Jesus enjoys dancing with the angels and “grooving to the sound of Christian R&B pumped out of a boom box” (Charisma, July 2000).\\nThe fact that the CCM crowd typically worships a different kind of God than the “old-fashioned” Biblicist, is why they are perfectly comfortable using music that has been identified as sexy by the secular world.\\n“... that is what rock is all about--sex with a 100-megaton bomb, the beat” (Gene Simmons of KISS, Entertainment Tonight, ABC, Dec. 10, 1987).\\nNote that Simmons was not referring to the words of rock music; he was referring only to its backbeat rhythm.\\nMusic researchers Daniel and Bernadette Skubik, in their study on the neurophysiology of rock music, warned:\\n“Whether the words are evil, innocuous, or based in Holy Scripture, the overall neurophysiological effects generated by rock music remain the same. There is simply no such thing as Christian rock that is substantively different in its impact” (“The Neurophysiology of Rock,” an Appendix to Ken Blanchard, Pop Goes the Gospel. pp. 187ff).\\nThat statement doesn’t bother a CCM defender, because he sees Jesus as a rock & roll party Dude who loves a good time.\\n“Those who envision God as a special friend, a kind of lover, with whom they can have fun, see no problem in worshipping him by means of physically stimulating music. On the other hand, those who perceive God as a majestic, holy, and almighty Being to be approached with awe and reverence will only use the music that elevates them spiritually” (Samuele Bacchiocchi, The Christian and Rock Music).\\nBy the way, we urge churches to be careful even with older hymns. We have never said that if a hymn is old it is good or if it is new it is bad. We must examine all hymns as to musical character and doctrinal purity. In my estimation, there are hymns in the standard hymnals used by Independent Baptist churches that shouldn’t be used (e.g., “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “We’ve a Story to Tell to the Nations”).\\n____________________________\\nDistributed by Way of Life Literature\\'s Fundamental Baptist Information Service, an e-mail listing for Fundamental Baptists and other fundamentalist, Bible-believing Christians.

Being a member of one doesn\\'t determine whether a person is a Christian.\\nThe real issue is whether the person individually has Jesus Christ living inside of him or her...if they actually have a personal relationship with God.\\nIn the Gospel of John, we are told, \"to all who received him [referring to Jesus], to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.\"1 Why do we have to become children of God? Because until then, God is distant. We may know he\\'s there. We may know we are supposed to worship him. We may even know that in times of need, he\\'s the one to pray to. But there is a distance we are aware of, and it is because of our sin.\\nNow, as long as we live and breathe, guess what, we\\'re going to sin. We\\'re going to do things our way instead of God\\'s way. But our sin need not remain a barrier between us and God. Here\\'s how.\\nThe Bible says that there is a penalty for sin, and it might be greater than you\\'d expect. The penalty for sin is death. It\\'s not just the penalty for sins like murder. It\\'s God\\'s judgment against any and all sins. The Bible says, \"For the wages of sin is death...\"2 So that we would not have to die eternally separated from God because of our sin, Jesus died in our place. He fully paid for our sin. And offers us complete forgiveness. Not temporary forgiveness. Even for the sins we will commit in the future, we can have his forgiveness now, because Jesus died for all of our sin. We can immediately begin a close, personal relationship with him, that barrier of sin being gone. It isn\\'t that we become perfect and no longer sin. But we become forgiven when we see that Jesus died for our sin, in our place.\\n\"Yet now God in his gracious kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins. For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God\\'s anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood, sacrificing his life for us.\"3\\nWhen we receive Jesus Christ into our lives, God declares us \"not guilty\" and he says that we are now \"made right with God.\" Our relationship with God has begun in a real way, where we no longer know God is \"out there,\" but instead we know that he lives inside of us. We have God\\'s forgiveness, a relationship with him. \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"4\\nIf you would like to be certain that you have a personal relationship with God, your sins forgiven, and no longer any barrier between you and God, the following explain how to have this now: Knowing God Personally .\\n', 'page_rank': 1.1754501e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1911wb-42-25912', '_score': 24.03592, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Ascended Being <em>and</em> an Awakened Being?', 'uuid': '6dc79878-5b7a-519c-a584-22cd036620c9', 'score': 1585.07, 'document': 'What is the difference between Ascended Being and an Awakened Being?\\nAn Awakened being is the person who has realized there is more to life than just the material world, has the capacity to see beyond the veil of forgetfulness and is in the process of ascension.\\nAn Ascended being is living in a state of Oneness .

Although both types of televisions are flat and thin, they employ different technology in an attempt to deliver similar results.\\nPlasma TV Overview\\nPlasma television technology is based loosely on the fluorescent light bulb. The display itself consists of cells. Within each cell two glass panels are separated by a narrow gap in which neon-xenon gas is injected and sealed in plasma form during the manufacturing process. The gas is electrically charged at specific intervals when the Plasma set is in use. The charged gas then strikes red, green, and blue phosphors, thus creating a television image. Each group of red, green, and blue phosphors is called a pixel (picture element).\\nAlthough Plasma television technology eliminate the need for the bulky picture tube and electron beam scanning of traditional televisions, because it still employs the burning of phosphors to generate an image, Plasma televisions still suffer from some of the drawbacks of traditional televisions, such as heat generation and screen-burn of static images.\\nLCD TV Overview\\nLCD TVs, on the other hand, use a different technology (see also question #1 for this same explanation).\\nBasically, LCD panels are made of two layers of transparent material, which are polarized, and are \"glued\" together. One of the layers is coated with a special polymer that holds the individual liquid crystals. Current is then passed through individual crystals, which allow the crystals to pass or block light to create images. LCD crystals do not produce their own light, so an external light source, such as florescent bulb is needed for the image created by the LCD to become visible to the viewer.\\nUnlike standard CRT and Plasma televisions, since there are no phosphors that light up, less power is needed for operation and the light source in an LCD TV generates less heat than a Plasma or traditional television. Also, because of the nature of LCD technology, there is no radiation emitted from the screen itself.\\nPlasma vs LCD\\nThe ADVANTAGES of Plasma over LCD are:\\n1. Larger screen size availability.\\n2. Better contrast ratio and ability to render deeper blacks.\\n3. Better color accuracy and saturation.\\n4. Better motion tracking (little or no motion lag in fast moving images).\\nThe DISADVANTAGES of Plasma vs LCD include:\\n1. Plasma TVs are more susceptible to burn-in of static images. However, this problem has diminished greatly in recent years as a result of the incorporation \"pixel orbiting\" and related technologies.\\n2. Plasma TVs generate more heat than LCDs, due to the need to light of phosphors to create the images.\\n3. Does not perform as well at higher altitudes.\\n4. Potentially shorter display life span - this used to be the case. Early Plasmas had 30,000 hours or 8 hrs of viewing a day for 9 years, which was less than LCD. However, screen life span has now improved and 60,000 hour life span rating are now common, with some sets rated as high as 100,000 hours, due to technology improvements.\\nLCD television ADVANTAGES over Plasma include:\\n1. No burn-in of static images.\\n2. Cooler running temperature.\\n3. No high altitude use issues.\\n4. Increased image brightness over Plasma, which makes LCD TVs better for viewing in brightly lit rooms.\\n5. Lighter weight (when comparing same screen sizes) than Plasma counterparts.\\n6. Longer display life used to be a factor, but now LCD and Plasma sets both have at least 60,000 hour or higher lifespans.\\n7. For 3D, with LCD you have a choice between units that use Active Shutter and Passive Glasses , whereas 3D Plasma TVs only utilize the Active Shutter Glasses system.\\nDISADVANTAGES of LCD vs Plasma televisions include:\\n1. Lower contrast ratio, not as good rendering deep blacks, although the increasing incorporation of LED backlighting has narrowed this gap.\\n2. Not as good at tracking motion (fast moving objects may exhibit lag artifacts) - However, this is improving with the recent implementation of 120Hz screen refresh rates and 240Hz processing in higher-end LCD sets.\\n3. Not as common in large screen sizes above 42-inches as Plasma. However, the number is growing fast, with 46 and 47-inch screen sizes becoming more common, and some LCD sets having a screen size as large as 70-inches also available to the general public.\\n4. Although LCD televisions do not suffer from burn-in susceptibility, it is possible that individual pixels on an LCD televisions can burn out, causing small, visible, black or white dots to appear on the screen. Individual pixels cannot be repaired, the whole screen would need to be replaced at that point, if the individual pixel burnout becomes annoying to you.\\n5. LCD televisions are typically more expensive than equivalent-sized Plasma televisions (although this is changing).\\n', 'page_rank': 6.881554e-09, 'qid': 11}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0010wb-73-33601', '_score': 22.684137, '_source': {'title': '<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> Great Rite? <em>And</em> <em>What</em> <em>is</em> Ritual <em>Sex</em>?', 'uuid': '1c2c0c90-b4b8-5fef-9dae-77bdc85d0545', 'score': 1786.3755, 'document': 'Ritual sex is usually performed in private.\\nImage © Getty Images\\nQuestion: What is the Great Rite? And What is Ritual Sex?\\nI keep seeing references to the Great Rite and \"ritual sex.\" I was sure I read somewhere that Wiccans didn\\'t have sex in rituals. What\\'s the deal?\\nAnswer:\\nIn some (although not all) traditions of Wicca and Paganism, sacred sex is part of spiritual practice. Wicca in its original form is a fertility religion, first and foremost, so it\\'s understandable that at some point you may encounter some references to sexual acts, whether they be actual or implied. By implied, we mean the symbolic -- the joining of an athame with a chalice, for example. The most commonly referenced form of ritual sex is the Great Rite , which is the ritualized connection of the god and goddess. Author Vivianne Crowley says, \"The outer rite involves a linking of the male and the femaleâ€¦ the sacred marriage is outwardly a marriage of two people, but inwardly it is a marriage of the two within one person.\" The Great Rite is more than just sexual union; it is the enactment of the creation of the universe itself in Wiccan tradition.\\nAlthough the Great Rite is certainly the best known form of ritual sex, not all ritual sex is the Great Rite. Ritual sex has a number of different purposes besides the Great Rite -- it can be used to raise energy, create magical power, or find a sense of spiritual communion with a partner. If \"all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals,\" then certainly sex in ritual can be seen as a sacramental act of love.\\nIt should also be noted that in some magical traditions, masturbation and sexual release is a perfectly valid way of raising magical energy.\\nIn Her Hidden Children, author Chas Clifton writes, \"Many Pagan religions include invocation and possession by their gods. Wicca, in particular, extends that possession to sexual acts, whether literal or metaphorical.\" He goes on to say that by making sex sacred, \"Wiccans in all countries set their own stamp on nature religion, uniting in their bodies the cosmic and the most personal energies of planetary life.\"\\nBecause ritual sex is a sacred act, any form of it should be consensual. In most traditions, it is also performed in private, and in all traditions, performed only by adults. Some traditions of Wicca require actual intercourse as part of a Third Degree elevation, or in rituals performed by a High Priest and High Priestess. However, most Pagans today would say that it is never required by any legitimate coven for initiation as a neophyte. In other traditions, the act is symbolic but not actualized.\\nMore often than not, if ritual sex is performed, it is between two individuals who are part of an existing relationship already, and who are of equal levels of power within the dynamic of the coven. Ritual sex between two Third Degree people has a good polarity to itâ€¦ but ritual sex between a Third Degree and a Neophyte is stretching that balance of power a bit. Think of it as the difference between two teachers who date one another, and a teacher who dates his students.\\nAgain, no reputable coven will demand sexual initiation of its members. Ritual sex -- the Great Rite or otherwise -- is a specific, sacred act that is performed only by those who have studied and learned enough to feel comfortable performing it with a trusted partner.\\nFertility and Sex\\n', 'page_rank': 2.8478548e-09, 'qid': 1}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-1000tw-79-06437', '_score': 22.563694, '_source': {'title': 'EXCLUSIVE: <em>PLANES</em>, <em>TRAINS</em> AND AUTOMOBILES—AND OTHER THINGS <em>THE</em> GOVERNMENT', 'uuid': '6f093726-10f4-579e-8d68-db9bd74cf759', 'score': 1012.8308, 'document': '–, Friday, March, 16, 2012, (1:05pm)\\nAbove: A typical Sydneysider’s reaction upon seeing a piece of transport\\n.\\nThe other day (okay, it was in 2008) a friend told me his theory why Sydney had so many shock jocks.\\nThe reason was, he explained, that unlike in most other cities—which have what transport experts call “roads”—sitting in Sydney traffic is enough to make Mahatma Gandhi want to take to the driver in front of him with a crowbar.\\nWith every motorist on the road already burning with incandescent rage, all it takes is for someone on the radio to tell them that the real reason their wife left them is because of the Labor government and you’ve pretty much got a wholesale revolution on your hands.\\nNaturally, being NSW, nothing has changed since 2008 and the good citizens of Sydney remain as committed as ever to their two favourite pursuits of creating open plan dining areas and blaming everything on the government.*\\nSo if politicians want to know where the ``hate media’’ originates from they need look no further than the M4. In other words, if they really want to shut Ray Hadley up, they shouldn’t be building media councils, they should be building motorways.\\nTrain lines too would come in handy. As it stands the CityRail travel experience involves being crammed into a hot and crowded box with a bunch of sweaty strangers. It has all the creepy aspects of a sauna but without the sex.\\nTo be fair to the government, CityRail only fails to do only three things as a train service. It is just unfortunate that these are the only three things a train service is supposed to do.\\nThey are, specifically:\\n1. Show up in a timely fashion;\\n2. Transport their passengers in a timely fashion; and\\n3. Transport their passengers in a sanitary fashion.\\nSadly CityRail appears to have gone for the opposite approach of:\\n1. Making you wait as long as possible for a train to arrive;\\n2. Making it take as long as possible once you’re on it; and\\n3. Making the journey as unpleasant as possible.\\nTo its credit, CityRail does all this in an incredibly inventive way never conceived of by most metropolitan rail operators.\\nFirstly, it makes all its trains double-decker, thus cramming a whole bunch of people into a very small space and putting two storeys where only one storey should be _ which are primal urges for any true Sydneysider.\\nCityRail also came up with the idea of creating a two minute layover at Redfern, thus giving passengers the maximum possible chance of getting mugged.\\nBut it’s hardly fair to pick on the authorities just because they’re not doing anything about Sydney’s road and rail infrastructure, especially when they’re not doing anything about aviation infrastructure either.\\nMany years ago the federal government clearly decided that this whole “flying” thing was never going to take off (don’t even say it) and decided to build an airport basically smack bang on top of the CBD. Granted at the time it was only an empty paddock but anyone who’s been to George St on a Sunday can tell you there’s still very little difference.\\nNaturally this has made expanding the airport rather difficult—even in a town with Sydney’s somewhat, er, “elastic” planning laws. And so everyone agrees that Sydney desperately needs a second airport but of course no one can agree where.\\nThe chief fault appears to lie with Australia’s founding fathers, who, in a naive attempt at democracy, divided up the nation in such a way that everywhere was part of somebody’s electorate. What they clearly failed to foresee was that there would one day be many things—such as airports and nuclear power stations—that could only ever proceed if they were placed in nobody’s electorate.\\nOnce more democracy is the enemy of progress, as the Chinese will happily tell you.\\nBut barring a takeover by the world’s largest superpower—which would at least cut a great deal of red tape for the Mining Resource Rent tax—our local government officials are going to have to do something about it.\\nYes, it’s all very well to have bike lanes, but people with dignity need a means of transportation too.\\n.\\n*Obviously open plan living has little to do with the subject of this article, however I wanted to add an asterisk as a tribute to Good Weekend columnist Mark Dapin, who was axed by Fairfax last week as part of that company’s business plan to be completely irrelevant by the 2012-13 financial year.\\n.\\nIf you want to sit next to me on the train be friends with me on Facebook here\\nAnd make sure this airplane takes off by hitting the recommend button below:\\n', 'page_rank': 1.2542046e-09, 'qid': 12}}, {'_index': 'test_index', '_type': 'doc', '_id': 'clueweb12-0911wb-14-05757', '_score': 22.534286, '_source': {'title': 'And <em>a</em>', 'uuid': 'f9ee69a3-4a5e-5aeb-8136-f7e6ae41ae48', 'score': 754.69653, 'document': '(FT5) UPDATED: Panasonic will release an advanced GF camera!!!

It covers an extensive survey and depicts all graphs, fact and figures of two companies. It begins with the introduction of soft drink industry and introduction of these two companies of soft drink industry. It covers some of the major strategies adopted by Pepsi and Coca-Cola like their pricing policy, sales promotion and advertising policy, distribution policy etc. The project has been made interesting with the inclusion of the topics, which covers the 4P\\'s of marketing.\\nThe major players in the soft drink industry in India are Coke and Pepsi. Pepsi holds the major market share followed by Coke. They have a cut throat competition between themselves. Whatever strategy is followed by one company, it is copied by the other.\\nSample of to brands were selected on the basis of there uses and noticeciability. One of the selected brands is NO1 brand in their respective product categories the other one brand is close competitor of the No 1 brands. Total sample of size of 200 respondents selected on the basic of convenience was surveyed which include consumers.\\nData was collected from secondary as well as primary sources. Structure questionnaire was use to collect primary data\\nINTRODUCTION:\\nIn the modern urban culture consumption of soft drinks particularly among younger generation has become very popular. Soft drinks in various flavors and tastes are widely patronized by urbane population at various occasions like dinner parties, marriages, social get together, birthday calibration etc. children of all ages and groups are especially attracted by the mere mention of the word soft drinks.\\nWith the growing popularity of soft drinks, the technology of its production, preservation, transportation and or marketing in the recent years has witnessed phenomenal changes. The so-called competition for this product in the market is from different other brands. Mass media, particularly the emergence of television, has contribute to a large extent of the ever growing demand for soft drinks the attractive jingles and sport make the large audience remember this product at all times.\\nIt is expected that with the sort of mass advertising, reaching almost the entire country and offering various varieties annual demand for the product is expected to rise sharply in the times to come.\\nIn any marketing situation, the behavioral / environmental variables relating to consumers, competition and environment are constantly influx. The competitors in a given industry may be making many tactical maneuvers in market all the time. The may introduce or initiate an aggressive promotion campaign or announce a price reduction. The marketing man of the firm has to meet all these maneuver and care of competitive position of his firm and his brand in the market. The only route open to him for achieving this is the manipulation of his marketing tactics.\\nIn today\\'s highly competitive market place, three players have dominated the industry; The New York based Pepsi Company Inc. The Atlanta based coca- cola and U.K. based Cadbury Schweppes.\\nThrough the globe, these major players have been battling it out for a bigger chunk of the ever-growing soft drink market. Now this battle has been evolved up to India too with the arrival of these three giants.\\nSoft drink industry is on amazing growth; ultimately these are only one person who will determine their fortunes. The Indian consumer the real War to quench his thirst has just begun.\\nSOFT DRINK INDUSTRY: AN OVERVIEW\\nIt all began in 1886, when a tree legged brass kettle in Hohn Styth pemberton\\'s backyard in Atlanta was brewing the first P of marketing legeent Unaware the pharmacist has given birth to a caramel colored syrup, which is now the chief ingredient of the world\\'s favorite drink. The syrup combined with carbonated the soft drink market. It is estimated that this drink is served more than one thousand million times in a day.\\nEqually oblivious to the historic value of his actions was Frank Ix. Robinson, his partner and book keeper. Pemberton & Robinson laid the first foundation of this beverage when an average nine drinks per day to begin with, upping volumes as sales grew.\\nIn 1894, this beverage got into bottle, courtesy a candy merchant from Mississippi. By the 1950\\'s Colas was a daily consumption item, stored in house hold fridges. Soon were born other non- cola variants of this product like orange & Lemon.\\nNow, the soft drink industry has been dominated by three major player - (1) The New York based Pepsi co. Inc.(2) The Atlanta based coca cola co. (3) The united Kingdom based Cadbury Schweppes.\\nThough out the glove these major players have been battling it. Out for a bigger chunk of the ever-growing cold drink market. Now this battle has begun in India too. India is now the part of cold drink war. Gone are days of Ramesh Chauhan, India\\'s one time cola king and his bouts of pistol shooting. Expect now to hear the boon of cannons when the Coca Cola & Pepsi co. battles it out for, as the Jordon goes a bigger share of throat. By buying Over local competition, the two American Cola giants have cleared up the arena and are packing all their power behind building the Indian franchisee of their globe girdling brands. The huge amount invested in fracture has never been seen before. Both players seen an enormous potential in his country where swigging a carbonated beverage is still considered a treat, virtually a luxury. Consequently, by world standards India\\'s per capita consumption of cold drinks as going by survey results is rock bottom, less than over Neighbors Pakistan & Bangladesh, where it is four times as much.\\nBehind the hype, in an effort invisible to consumer Pepsi pumps in Rs 3000 crores (1994) to add muscle to its infrastructure in bottling and distribution. This is apart from money that company\\'s franchised bottles spend in upgrading their plants all this has contributed to substantial gains in the market. In colas, Pepsi is already market leader and in certain cities like Banaras, Pepsi outlets are on one side & all the other colas put together on the other. While coke executive scruff at Pepsi\\'s claims as well as targets, industry observers are of the view that Pepsi has definitely stolen a march over its competitor coke. Apart from numbers, Pepsi has made qualitative gains. The foremost is its image. This image turnaround is no small achievements, considering that since it was established in 1989, taking the hardship route prior to liberalization and weighed down by export commitments.\\nNow, at present as there are three major players coke, Pepsi and Cadbury and there is stiff competition between first two, both Pepsi and coke have started, sponsoring local events and staging frequent consumer promotion campaigns. As the mega event of this century has started, and the marketers are using this event - world cup football, cricket events and many more other events.\\nLike Pepsi, coke is picking up equity in its bottles to guarantee their financial support; one side coke is trying to increase its popularity through.\\nEat Food, enjoy Food. Drink only coca cola. Eat cricket, sleep cricket. Drink only coca cola. Eat movies, sleep movies. Drink only coca cola.\\nOn the other side of coin Pepsi has introduced AMITABH BACHHAN for capturing the lemon market through MIRINDA - Lemon with \"zor ka jhatka dhere se lage\". But no doubt\\' that UK based Cadbury is also recognizing its presence. So there is a real crush in the soft drink market. with launch of the carbonated organize drink Crush, few year ago in Banaras ., the first in a series of a launches , Cadbury Schweppes beverage India (CSBI) HAS PLANNED:- The world third largest soft drink marketers all over the country.CSBI o wholly owned subsidiary of the London based $ 6.52billion. Cadbury Schweppes is hoping that crush is going well and well not suffer the same fate as the Rs. 175 crore Cadbury India\\'s apple drink Apella. CSBI is now with orange (crush), and Schweppes soda in the market.\\nAs orange drinks are the smallest of non-cola categories that is Rs. 1100 crore markets with 10% market share and cola heaving 50% is followed by Lemon segment with 25%.\\nThe success of soft drink industry depends upon 4 major factors viz.\\nAvailability\\nRange\\nAVAILABILITY\\nAvailability means the presence of a particular brand at any outlet. If a product is now available at any outlet and the competitor brand is available, the consumer will go for it because generally the consumption of any soft drink is an impulse decision and not predetermined one.\\nVISIBILITY\\nVisibility is the presence felt, if any outlet has a particular brand of soft drink say- Pepsi cola and this brand is not displayed in the outlet, then its availability is of no use. The soft drink must be shown off properly and attractively so as to catch the attention of the consumer immediately Pepsi achieves visibility by providing glow signboards, hoarding, calendars etc. to the outlets. It also includes various stands to display Pepsi and other flavors of the company.\\nCOOLING\\nAs the soft drinks are consumed chilled so cooling them plays a vital role in boosting up the sales. The brand, which is available chilled, gets more sales then the one which is not, even if it is more preferred one.\\nRANGE\\nThis is the last but not the least factor, which affects the sale of the products of a particular company.\\nRange availability means the availability of all flavors in all sizes.\\nHISTORY OF COCA-COLA\\nJon Styth Pemberton first introduced the refreshing taste of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, Georgia it was May 1861 when the pharmacist concocted caramel colored syrup in three- legged brass kettle in his backyard. He first distributed the new product by carrying Coca-Cola in a jug coin enjoys in a glass of Coca-Cola at the soda fountain. Whether by design or accident, carbonated water was teamed with the new syrup, producing a drink that was proclaimed \"Delicious and Refreshing\".\\nDr. Pemberton\\'s Partner and bookkeeper, Mr. Frank Robinson, suggested the name and penned as \"Coca-Cola\" in the unique flowing script that is still famous worldwide today.\\nDr. Pemberton\\'s sold 25 gallons of syrup, shipped in bright Red wooden kegs. Red has been a distinctive color associated with the No.1 soft drink brand ever since. For his efforts, Dr. Pemberton grossed $ 50 and spent $ 73.96 on advertising, by 1891, Atlanta chemist as a G.Canler had acquired complete ownership of the Coca-Cola business.\\nHe purchases it from the Dr.Pemberton family for $ 2300. With in 4 year his merchandising flair helped to expand the consumption of Coca-Cola to over $25 million. Robert W. woodruff become the president of the Coca-Cola company in 1923 and his more than six decades of leadership took the business of commercial success making Coca-Cola an institution the world over. Coca-Cola begins as a never tonic, but candy merchant Joseph A. Biedenharn of Mississippi was looking for awry to serve refreshing beverages. He responded to this demand began offering bottle Coca-Cola using syrup shipped from Atlanta, during a hot summer in 1894.\\n1894 ... A modest start for a bold idea\\nIn a candy store in Vicksburg, Mississippi, brisk sales of the new fountain beverage called Coca-Cola impressed the store\\'s owner, Joseph A. Biedenharn. He began bottling Coca-Cola to sell, using a common glass bottle called a Hutchinson. Biedenharn sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler, who owned the Company. Candler thanked him but took no action. One of his nephews already had urged that Coca-Cola be bottled, but Candler focused on fountain sales.\\n1899 ... The first bottling agreement\\nTwo young attorneys from Chattanooga, Tennessee believed they could build a business around bottling Coca-Cola. In a meeting with Candler, Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead obtained exclusive rights to bottle Coca-Cola across most of the United States (specifically excluding Vicksburg) - for the sum of one dollar. A third Chattanooga lawyer, John T. Lupton, soon joined their venture.\\n1900-1909 ... Rapid growth\\nThe three pioneer bottlers divided the country into territories and sold bottling rights to local entrepreneurs. Their efforts were boosted by major progress in bottling technology, which improved efficiency and product quality. By 1909, nearly 400 Coca-Cola bottling plants were operating, most of them family-owned businesses. Some were open only during hot-weather months when demand was high.\\n1920s ... Bottling overtakes fountain sales\\nAs the 1920s dawned, more than 1,000 Coca-Cola bottlers were operating in the U.S. Their ideas and zeal fueled steady growth. Six-bottle cartons were a huge hit after their 1923 introduction. A few years later, open-top metal coolers became the forerunners of automated vending machines. By the end of the 1920s, bottle sales of Coca-Cola exceeded fountain sales.\\n1920s and 30s ... International expansion\\nLed by longtime Company leader Robert W. Woodruff, chief executive officer and chairman of the Board, the Company began a major push to establish bottling operations outside the U.S. Plants were opened in France, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Belgium, Italy, Peru, Spain, Australia and South Africa. By the time World War II began, Coca- Cola was being bottled in 44 countries.\\n1940s ... Post-war growth\\nDuring the war, 64 bottling plants were set up around the world to supply the troops. This followed an urgent request for bottling equipment and materials from General Eisenhower\\'s base in North Africa. Many of these war-time plants were later converted to civilian use, permanently enlarging the bottling system and accelerating the growth of the Company\\'s worldwide business.\\n1960s ... New brands introduced\\nFollowing Fanta in the 1950s, Sprite, Minute Maid, Fresca and TaB joined brand Coca-Cola in the 1960s. Mr. Pibb and Mello Yello was added in the 1970s.

It has a U.S. Fortune rank of 50.The company profits for 1997 were $2.14 billion on revenues of $20.92 billion and Pepsi is bottled in nearly 190 countries. PepsiCo is a world leader in convenient snacks, foods and beverages with revenues of more than $43 billion and over 198,000 employees. Take a journey through our past and see the key milestones that define PepsiCo.\\nPepsiCo is a world leader in the food chain business. It consists of many companies amongst which the prominent once are Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay and Pepsi Food International. The group is presently into two of the most profitable and profitable and growing industries namely, beverages and snack foods. It has scores of big brands available in nearly 150 countries across the globe. The group has established for itself once of the strongest brands in various segments of its operations.\\nThe beverages segment primarily markets its Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew and other brands worldwide and 7-UP outside the U.S. markets. These are positioned in close competition with Coca-Cola Inc. of USA. A point which is worth a mention is that Coca- Cola gets 80% of its profits for International operations while the same figure for PepsiCo stands at 6%. The segment is also in the bottling plants and distribution facilities and also distributes the ready to drink tea products of Lipton in North America.

Pepsi company\\'s restaurant distribution operation, supplies company owned and franchise restaurants in the U.S. The company ventured into restaurant business with Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut ended last year when they were spanned off from the company. A packaged goods company comprised of Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay will continue to bear the PepsiCo name. The move should enhance both corporations ability to prosper with their own fully dedicated structure and management team.\\nPEPSICO IN INDIA\\nPepsiCo gained entry to India in 1988 by creating a joint venture with the Punjab government-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation (PAIC) and Voltas India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994. Others claim that firstly Pepsi was banned from import in India, in 1970, for having refused to release the list of its ingredients and in 1993, the ban was lifted, with Pepsi arriving on the market shortly afterwards. These controversies are a reminder of \"India\\'s sometimes acrimonious relationship with huge multinational companies.\" Indeed, some argue that PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company have \"been major targets in part because they are well-known foreign companies that draw plenty of attention.\"\\nIn 2003, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a non-governmental organization in New Delhi, said aerated waters produced by soft drinks manufacturers in India, including multinational giants PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, contained toxins, including lindane, DDT, malathion and chlorpyrifos  pesticides that can contribute to cancer, a breakdown of the immune system and cause birth defects. Tested products included Coke, Pepsi, 7 Up, Miranda, Fanta, Thumps Up, Limca, and Sprite. CSE found that the Indian-produced Pepsi\\'s soft drink products had 36 times the level of pesticide residues permitted under European Union regulations; Coca Cola\\'s 30 times. CSE said it had tested the same products in the US and found no such residues. However, this was the European standard for water, not for other drinks. No law bans the presence of pesticides in drinks in India.\\nThe Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo angrily denied allegations that their products manufactured in India contained toxin levels far above the norms permitted in the developed world. But an Indian parliamentary committee, in 2004, backed up CSE\\'s findings and a government-appointed committee, is now trying to develop the world\\'s first pesticides standards for soft drinks. Coke and PepsiCo opposed the move, arguing that lab tests aren\\'t reliable enough to detect minute traces of pesticides in complex drinks.\\nAs of 2005, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo together hold 95% market share of soft-drink sales in India. PepsiCo has also been accused by the Puthussery panchayat in the Palakkad district in Kerala, India, of practicing \"water piracy\" due to its role in exploitation of ground water resources resulting in scarcity of drinking water for the panchayat residents, who have been pressuring the government to close down the PepsiCo unit in the village.\\nIn 2006, the CSE again found that soda drinks, including both Pepsi and Coca-Cola, had high levels of pesticides in their drinks. Both PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company maintain that their drinks are safe for consumption and have published newspaper advertisements that say pesticide levels in their products are less than those in other foods such as tea, fruit and dairy products. In the Indian state of Kerala, sale and production of Pepsi-Cola, along with other soft drinks, was banned by the state government in 2006, but this was reversed by the Kerala High Court merely a month later. Five other Indian states have announced partial bans on the drinks in schools, colleges and hospitals.\\nBrand Facts\\nPepsiCo nourishes consumers with a range of products from tasty treats to healthy eats that deliver enjoyment, nutrition, convenience as well as affordability The group has built an expansive beverage and foods business.

infertility\\nFirstly, unexplained infertility is when after a year of unprotected intercourse at ovulation a couple has been unable to conceive and medical evaluation has been unable to determine any

that explains the reason behind infertility.\\nThese sub-clinical signs might include symptoms such as light periods, premenstrual breast distension and stress, clotting with the period, period pain, excessive vaginal discharge, irregular cycle or heavy menstrual bleeding.\\nIt is my experience that given time unexplained infertility is relatively effectively and successfully treated with

treatment plan will insist on treating both partners, some only when clinically necessary.\\xa0 Some will prefer to use one general formula for the duration of the whole menstrual cycle and change it according to how symptoms shift over time.\\xa0 Others will elect to divide the menstrual cycle, usually into four phases and use a different formula for each phase.\\nThe aim of fertility treatment is to increase the likelihood of pregnancy and the intended outcome is pregnancy.\\na)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Unexplained infertility\\nFirstly, unexplained infertility is when after a year of unprotected intercourse at ovulation a couple has been unable to conceive and medical evaluation has been unable to determine any abnormalities to explain the reasons behind the infertility.\\nEven though medical test might hold no explanation, there will commonly be subclinical signs which can be detected by the system of TCM that explains the reason behind infertility.\\nThese sub-clinical signs might include symptoms such as light periods, premenstrual breast distension and stress, clotting with the period, period pain, excessive vaginal discharge, irregular cycle or heavy menstrual bleeding.\\nIt is my experience that given time unexplained infertility is relatively effectively and successfully treated with TCM.\\nb)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Difficulty conceiving a subsequent pregnancy\\nThe next category includes those women who have a history of previous pregnancy. Clearly fertile this group either have children already or have experienced previous miscarriage(s) and are finding it difficult to conceive a subsequent pregnancy.\\nFollowing pregnancy and childbirth there are a number of circumstances that may impede a women’s natural capacity to conceive a future pregnancy.\\nWomen may have a constitutional weakness that predisposes her to a greater risk of compromised reproductive health and fertility.\\xa0 She may have experienced birth trauma or medical complications and intervention, multiple birth, previous miscarriage(s), pregnancies too close together, be an older mum or have inadequate post-natal support and recovery.\\nTCM can be used to help address and resolve these causative factors.\\nc)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Explained infertility\\nExplained infertility is when Western Medical tests have been able to establish a pathology such as endometriosis, hormonal irregularities, poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), fibroids, blocked fallopian tubes, failure to ovulate or poor egg/semen quality which might explain the reason behind infertility.\\nBy the time most women arrive at a TCM clinic they usually have a Western Medical diagnosis and will be looking to explore conjunctive or alternative treatment options.\\nHaving a Western Medical diagnosis can be helpful to TCM treatment in that it offers valuable supplementary information to support and direct a comprehensive treatment plan.\\nOther than diagnostic tests, the scope of Western Medicine practice is primarily limited to drug therapy, surgery and of course IVF treatment.\\xa0 Once the cause of infertility is established then women will be able to use this information to make informed choice about their treatment options.\\nSurgery will remove any pathological growths, uterine obstructions or scarring.\\xa0 Surgery quickly and resolutely removes â\\x80\\x98old’, stale blood and energy allowing the opportunity for a new, voluptuous endometrial layer to develop.\\xa0 This outcome would be one of the intended aims of TCM treatment also, although the end is achieved using techniques.\\nFalling pregnant is only one aspect of the â\\x80\\x98baby making’ equation. The value of TCM in this scenario is in its ability to support and cultivate the fertile ground of the endometrium to provide ongoing nourishment to a growing baby.\\nIt is perfectly safe for women to use TCM in conjunction with Western Medicine and to continue both acupuncture and herbal treatment once pregnant.\\nConclusion\\nThere are a number of possible explanations as to why couples may experience difficulty conceiving.\\xa0 TCM can be used as a stand-alone, natural, drug-free treatment option to enhance fertility and treat both medically explained and unexplained infertility.\\xa0 It can also be safely used in conjunction with conventional Western Medical fertility treatment before and during pregnancy.\\n© October 2009 Karen Pohlner\\n', 'page_rank': 1.1782275e-09, 'qid': 14}}]}}\n"
