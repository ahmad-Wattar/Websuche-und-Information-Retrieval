The South Side of Peak 10 sports big fat bumps, hidden kickers and glades - all without seeing another soul (or at least many souls).\nArapahoe Basin Ski Resort\nThe skiing at Arapahoe Basin is truly legendary. At a summit elevation of 13,050 feet, the Arapahoe Basin boasts the highest skiable terrain in North America. With 360 inches of average snowfall, Arapahoe offers nearly 500 acres of skiable terrain and a trail difficulty rating of 10% beginner, 50% intermediate, 20% advanced and 20% expert. A traverse along the East Wall nearly always will result in finding new powder to ski, while the famous West Wall, with its menacing cornice, provides a spectacular vista while it challenges you to leap off its edge. But perhaps the most-famous run in Colorado is Palavicinni. Formed by a natural avalanche path, it ranks as one of the steepest, longest and most-challenging in North America. Today the Arapahoe Basin Ski Patrol carefully controls the snow to render Palavicinni safe for skiing. Snowboarders flock to Mutha Hucker, the ski area's new state-of-the-art terrain park, which stays open until June each year.\n*New for the 2007-2008 Season*\nA-Basin opens Montezuma Bowl, over 400-acres of blue, black and double-black slopes, totalling 36 runs.

I found it to be perfect for a skier to air and photograph. I had a hard time finding someone willing to jump the cliff for me, but finally found local hot skier Nash Grimm, who styled the line perfectly. I love the extreme backlighting and the timing of the skier jumping right through the sun.

Viktor waited on an overhanging rock while I went down. This is what I saw from under the rock.

It can be seen for many miles around, and I have drooled over it's north-facing couloirs for the last seven years, but access is very long and difficult. On April 11 2011, my brother, Mark Koelker (pictured), Mike Hood and I set out to tackle this peak (my third attempt). In order to reach Mount Jackson's northeast flanks, we skinned over the top of 12,000-foot Beaver Creek Mountain, then into a saddle and back up to a 12,100-foot ridge on Grouse Mountain. We then side-hilled several miles before reaching the bottom of our objective. Eventually we picked our way far enough through the rocks and decided to drop in due to rising temps from the sun. This was Mark's first turn on a 1,500 descent through a couloir with mandatory air in the middle of it. Such an amazing day, and a dream come true due to hard work and perseverance!\nCliff Jump\nPhotograph by Rutger Geerling ,\u00a0My Shot\nIn early May you can still have fresh snow on the glaciers of Europe, and jumping a small cliff while all this fresh powder falls like water makes for an insane photo.\n(This photo and caption were submitted to My Shot .)\nSkier, Switzerland\nPhotograph by Kenji Teshima ,\u00a0My Shot\nThis shot was taken on January 22, 2011, after the only big snowstorm we received during winter 2010-11 in the Swiss Alps.

This allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry.", "explanation": null, "document": "Visit Ski & Snowboard Shop\n1)Get in Shape to Prepare for the Slopes\nDon't try to ski yourself into shape. You'll enjoy skiing more if you're physically fit. Check out Skiing Magazine's fitness section for tips on the best snacks for a day on the slopes and best of all tips and routines for getting in shape to ski and ride.\nWhen you are on the slopes, be sure to drink plenty of water. Be careful not to become dehydrated. If you're tired, stop skiing. Learn to ski and snowboard smoothly-and in control. Stop before you become fatigued and, most of all have fun.\n2) Dressing for the Weather\nThe secret to a fun time in the snow is having the right clothing. You'll want to keep warm, dry and comfortable your first day on snow.\nDress in Layers\nLayering allows you to accommodate your body's constantly changing temperature. Generally, layering is divided into three areas:\n-Wicking layer (polypropylene underwear - top and bottoms) - \"wick\" or move moisture away from your skin and dries quickly\n-Insulating layer (wool, fleece, sweater) - keeps heat in and cold out.\n-Weather Protection - Repels water from snow and sleet, and to block the wind while letting perspiration evaporate (both jacket and pants). Choose a lightweight garment that is made of waterproof, breathable material. There are several synthetic materials on the market and available at outdoor sports stores. When buying skiwear, look for fabric that is water and wind-resistant. Look for wind flaps to shield zippers, snug cuffs at wrists and ankles, collars that can be snuggled up to the chin and drawstrings that can be adjusted for comfort and keep wind out. Be sure to buy quality clothing and products.\nHats or Headbands\nUsually made of fleece or wool, a good hat combined with a neck warmer or gaitor will retain 80% of your body's heat, keeping you warm and toasty even on the coldest days.\nGloves or Mittens\nWaterproof, breathable shell and well insulated. Mittens are usually better for those susceptible to cold hands. Don't forget to get yourself some hand and toe warmers available at our Snowsports Shops, located in various locations around the mountain.\nSocks\nOne (1) pair of light to medium weight works best for skiing and riding. If the sock is too thick or if you're wearing too many, it could make your boots too tight, reducing circulation, which causes cold feet. It's also a good idea to change into fresh socks before putting your boots on. Damp socks worn on the trip to the ski area will quickly become cold and uncomfortable.\nEye Protection\nHave sunglasses and goggles with you. Skiing and snowboarding are a lot more fun when you can see!\nSunscreen and Lip Balm\nProtect yourself from the strong alpine sun. The sun reflects off the snow and is stronger than you think, even on cloudy days! Keep lip balm in a pocket and apply often.\nThere's no reason to be cold out in the snow, and with a little preparation and the proper clothing and accessories, you won't be. Okemo's Snowsports Shops are located around the mountain and feature all of the apparel and accessories you need to enjoy your day on the slopes.Check out our \"What to Pack for your Okemo Vacation\" page for a complete list.\n3) Rental Equipment Tips\nThe Okemo Express Rental Shops are located on the lower level of Okemo Base Lodge and the Jackson Gore Base Area. In our Rental Shop, you can purchase your lift ticket, lesson packages, ski/snowboard rentals, boot rentals and helmet rentals, where you can enjoy one-stop shopping. Visit our Rental Equipment page for more information.\nTip: Don't get dressed to ski/ride when you need rental equipment. Follow these steps:\n1) Get equipment.\n2) Layer Up - Put on final layers of clothing - this way you won't be so hot when trying on boots.\n3) Store personal belongings.\nTo get the right boot fit, be sure to wear the proper socks (see Dressing for the Weather ). The boot should fit like a snug hiking boot with no pressure points. Be sure that your pants are not tucked into the boot.\nPrepare to arrive early enough to get equipment and sign up for lessons (2 hours before the lesson is an adequate amount of time to get equipment and ready for your lesson).\nHow to use your ski bindings\nAlways clean all snow, ice and dirt from your boots, skis and snowboards before stepping into the binding.\nTo open the binding, depress rear lever with ski pole or ski boot.\nStep in toe first. Be sure to clean the snow off of the boot sole first.\nStep down. Heel will close automatically.\nTo exit the binding, depress rear lever with boot, ski or pole.\nStep out. The binding is now ready for re-entry.\nDo not change the binding settings. If you feel that they are not working properly, bring them back to the shop for assistance.\nAvoid walking, skiing or snowboarding through water or mud. Water, mud and dirt can affect your bindings making release more difficult.\nWhile you are skiing or snowboarding, keep your boots properly closed. This allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry.\nIf you have any questions, please ask for assistance. We want to make your skiing and snowboarding as happy and enjoyable as possible.\n4) Okemo's Helmet Policy\nOkemo recommends helmets as a consideration for skiing and boarding participants and parents. We encourage parents and others to educate themselves about the benefits and limitations of helmets.Okemo supports individual and parental rights to choose to wear a helmet or not.

Learn more about Okemo Lesson Options.\n7) Your Responsibility Code\nFollow the \"Your Responsibility Code,\" the seven safety rules of the slopes:\n1. Always stay in control and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects.\n2. People ahead of you have the right of way. It is your responsibility to avoid them.\n3. You must not stop where you obstruct a trail or are not visible from above.\n4. Whenever starting downhill or merging into a trail, look uphill and yield to others.\n5. Always use devices to help prevent run away equipment.\n6. Observe all posted signs and warnings. Keep off closed trails and out of closed ski areas.\n7. Prior to using any lift, you must have the knowledge and ability to load, ride, and unload safely.\nKnow The Code.\nThis is a partial list. Be safety conscious.\nOfficially endorsed by the NATIONAL SKI AREAS ASSOCIATION\n8) Using Okemo's Lifts\nAt first, they can be intimidating contraptions, but you will quickly master them.\nCarpet Lifts\nCarpet Lifts are a great way to get up the hill. You just stand on the carpet and enjoy the gentle ride. Okemo has 5 carpet lifts around the resort.\nPoma Surface Lifts\nPoma Surface lifts consist of a continuously moving cable, which carries a series of perches, shaped like plates, on the end of poles. The goal is to place the plate between your legs and be pulled to the top of the slope. (The only remaining Poma at Okemo is the Pull - primarily used to access the Dew Zone and Blackout terrain parks.)\nHere are some tips on riding a poma surface lift:\nWhen you are getting on, hold your poles in one hand. Wait until it is clear to proceed. You will be signaled by an operator. Grasp the perch with your free hand.\nPlace the perch between your legs, making sure your skis/snowboard are parallel and widely spaced. Brace yourself to be pulled, but don't try to sit down!\nWhile travelling assume a relaxed stance, keeping your skis/snowboard parallel and allow the perch to pull you. If you fall over, clear the track quickly.\nWhen getting off keep an eye out for signs warning of approaching arrival. As you reach the unload sign, pull the perch out from between your legs with your free hand. Release your perch, making sure that it does not hit anyone. Clear the unloading area immediately.\nTriple and Quad Chairlifts\nChairs, three or four-seaters, mounted on a cable, move continuously up the slopes. The high-speed quads, cruise up the mountain, but slow down considerately to load/unload skiers/snowboarders.\nHere are some tips on riding a chairlift:\nSkiers need to take the straps off their wrists. Snowboarders need to attach a leash.\nOutside guests hold poles in inside hand. Middle guests hold poles in either hand.\nOutside guests look over outside shoulder and grasp bail as it approaches. Middle guests should grasp back of chair as it approaches. Sit down as the chair reaches you.\nOnce the chair has left the platform, lower the safety bar. Do not bounce or swing during the ride. Take care not to drop gloves, poles or litter. Should you lose something, note the number of the next tower for orientation.\nWhen getting off, you will see the sign warning of unload area, open the safety bar. Raise the tips of your skis so they don't catch as you approach the platform. As your skis touch the snow, stand up and push yourself off the chair with your free hand.\nMove quickly away from moving chair and keep unloading area clear. Brake once you are well clear of your companions.\n9) Trail Marking Symbols And Trail Map\nTake a few minutes to check out the lifts and the trails marked on the trail map. The colored symbols next to the trails indicate the difficulty of the trail. You will also find them on posted signs on the mountain.\nBefore you ride a lift, make sure the trail symbols off of that lift fit your ability. If you have any questions or need directions, go talk to a lift attendant or anyone in a Okemo uniform.\nIf you find yourself on a slope that exceeds your ability level, always leave your skis/snowboard on and side step down the slope.\n10) Where Can We Eat Lunch?\nOne of Okemo\u2019s most popular features is the variety and the caliber of its on-mountain dining options. And this season is no exception. We have lots of new options for lunch and dinner so be sure to check out our On-Mountain Dining Guide for more information.\n11) Visit the Snow Sports Shop\nYou'll find that as your skills improve, your equipment requirements will change. We recommend that you rent your equipment for your first few visits. As your skills improve and you become more confident about the type of gear you need you may want to consider purchasing a few items. Visit our Snow Sports Shop , located in the Base Lodge and the staff will be happy to assist you with any questions you may have.\nIf you are looking for answers to other questions you may have, check out our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page.\nRemember: Smile, ask questions, and laugh at your mistakes. It won't be long before you are up on the mountain reveling in the wonders of winter and giggling like the kid you suddenly feel showing off inside you.\nWhile you are on the slopes you will be sure to see our Mountain Ambassadors and Ski Patrol Ambassadors on the hill ready to assist you in any way you may need.\nSEE YOU ON THE SLOPES!\nX\n"}, {"score": 1486.2926, "uuid": "98a5b494-6cb7-5ab3-87b9-08cdac6d8acf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-46-33399", "target_hostname": "www.okemo.com", "target_uri": "http://www.okemo.com/okemowinter/learning/skitips/beginnersguide.asp", "page_rank": 1.5426878e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Beginner&#x27;s Guide to <em>Skiing</em> and <em>Snowboarding</em>", "snippet": ". * Avoid walking, <em>skiing</em> <em>or</em> <em>snowboarding</em> through water <em>or</em> mud.

This allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry.", "explanation": null, "document": "Visit Ski & Snowboard Shop\n1)Get in Shape to Prepare for the Slopes\nDon't try to ski yourself into shape. You'll enjoy skiing more if you're physically fit. Check out Skiing Magazine's fitness section for tips on the best snacks for a day on the slopes and best of all tips and routines for getting in shape to ski and ride.\nWhen you are on the slopes, be sure to drink plenty of water. Be careful not to become dehydrated. If you're tired, stop skiing. Learn to ski and snowboard smoothly-and in control. Stop before you become fatigued and, most of all have fun.\n2) Dressing for the Weather\nThe secret to a fun time in the snow is having the right clothing. You'll want to keep warm, dry and comfortable your first day on snow.\nDress in Layers\nLayering allows you to accommodate your body's constantly changing temperature. Generally, layering is divided into three areas:\n-Wicking layer (polypropylene underwear - top and bottoms) - \"wick\" or move moisture away from your skin and dries quickly\n-Insulating layer (wool, fleece, sweater) - keeps heat in and cold out.\n-Weather Protection - Repels water from snow and sleet, and to block the wind while letting perspiration evaporate (both jacket and pants). Choose a lightweight garment that is made of waterproof, breathable material. There are several synthetic materials on the market and available at outdoor sports stores. When buying skiwear, look for fabric that is water and wind-resistant. Look for wind flaps to shield zippers, snug cuffs at wrists and ankles, collars that can be snuggled up to the chin and drawstrings that can be adjusted for comfort and keep wind out. Be sure to buy quality clothing and products.\nHats or Headbands\nUsually made of fleece or wool, a good hat combined with a neck warmer or gaitor will retain 80% of your body's heat, keeping you warm and toasty even on the coldest days.\nGloves or Mittens\nWaterproof, breathable shell and well insulated. Mittens are usually better for those susceptible to cold hands. Don't forget to get yourself some hand and toe warmers available at our Snowsports Shops, located in various locations around the mountain.\nSocks\nOne (1) pair of light to medium weight works best for skiing and riding. If the sock is too thick or if you're wearing too many, it could make your boots too tight, reducing circulation, which causes cold feet. It's also a good idea to change into fresh socks before putting your boots on. Damp socks worn on the trip to the ski area will quickly become cold and uncomfortable.\nEye Protection\nHave sunglasses and goggles with you. Skiing and snowboarding are a lot more fun when you can see!\nSunscreen and Lip Balm\nProtect yourself from the strong alpine sun. The sun reflects off the snow and is stronger than you think, even on cloudy days! Keep lip balm in a pocket and apply often.\nThere's no reason to be cold out in the snow, and with a little preparation and the proper clothing and accessories, you won't be. Okemo's Snowsports Shops are located around the mountain and feature all of the apparel and accessories you need to enjoy your day on the slopes.Check out our \"What to Pack for your Okemo Vacation\" page for a complete list.\n3) Rental Equipment Tips\nThe Okemo Express Rental Shops are located on the lower level of Okemo Base Lodge and the Jackson Gore Base Area. In our Rental Shop, you can purchase your lift ticket, lesson packages, ski/snowboard rentals, boot rentals and helmet rentals, where you can enjoy one-stop shopping. Visit our Rental Equipment page for more information.\nTip: Don't get dressed to ski/ride when you need rental equipment. Follow these steps:\n1) Get equipment.\n2) Layer Up - Put on final layers of clothing - this way you won't be so hot when trying on boots.\n3) Store personal belongings.\nTo get the right boot fit, be sure to wear the proper socks (see Dressing for the Weather ). The boot should fit like a snug hiking boot with no pressure points. Be sure that your pants are not tucked into the boot.\nPrepare to arrive early enough to get equipment and sign up for lessons (2 hours before the lesson is an adequate amount of time to get equipment and ready for your lesson).\nHow to use your ski bindings\nAlways clean all snow, ice and dirt from your boots, skis and snowboards before stepping into the binding.\nTo open the binding, depress rear lever with ski pole or ski boot.\nStep in toe first. Be sure to clean the snow off of the boot sole first.\nStep down. Heel will close automatically.\nTo exit the binding, depress rear lever with boot, ski or pole.\nStep out. The binding is now ready for re-entry.\nDo not change the binding settings. If you feel that they are not working properly, bring them back to the shop for assistance.\nAvoid walking, skiing or snowboarding through water or mud. Water, mud and dirt can affect your bindings making release more difficult.\nWhile you are skiing or snowboarding, keep your boots properly closed. This allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry.\nIf you have any questions, please ask for assistance. We want to make your skiing and snowboarding as happy and enjoyable as possible.\n4) Okemo's Helmet Policy\nOkemo recommends helmets as a consideration for skiing and boarding participants and parents. We encourage parents and others to educate themselves about the benefits and limitations of helmets.Okemo supports individual and parental rights to choose to wear a helmet or not.

It is the largest ski and snowboard resort area in Japan, and probably one of the world's largest, with 21 different resorts all interlinked with one combined lift ticket. You can ski or snowboard all day hardly hitting the same runs twice. To ski all of the runs would require a few days. There is fantastic variety in terms of terrain, modern facilities and fast lifts. Shiga Kogen has 4 gondolas, 14 quad lifts, 7 triples, 35 doubles and 6 single lifts as well as a useful tram. 6 Singles\nShiga Kogen is a highland area northeast of Nagano City located inside Joshin-Etsu Kogen National Park . If you are not driving, there are shuttle buses from Nagano Station, or you can take the train on the Nagano Dentetsu line to Yudanaka, and switch to a shuttle bus from there (20 minutes).\nHalfpipe\nDuring the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, Shiga Kogen hosted the women's downhill, the super Giant slalom, slalom, and all snowboarding events. The snow quality and conditions are usually excellent reflecting higher altitude than many Japanese resorts.\nThe key to Shiga Kogen is altitude. The various resorts are all at different heights. For example Sun Valley Maruike is at 1400 meters (4600 feet), Kuma-no-Yu at about 1700 meters (5575 feet), and each of Higashi Tateyama, Terakoya, and the excellent Yakibitaiyama are all at about 2000 meters (6550 feet). The highest of the resorts is Yokoteyama at 2300 meters (7550 feet). More than 30% of the runs at Shiga Kogen are black runs (advanced), and another 40% are intermediate, which means that unlike most ski areas in Japan, there is plenty of terrain for advanced skiers and snowboarders to explore. These are some of the highest ski areas in all of Japan, and until Spring offer some of the best powder snow outside places such as Niseko or Furano in Hokkaido . If you don't have the time or budget to fly north, head for this part of Nagano .\nSnowboarders can use all of the gelande on offer, but the Kanbayashi area may be the most interesting for those seeking half pipe and other facilities for freestyle. This is the area where the Olympic events were held. The base of the Kanbayashi area is also only a 10 minute or so walk from the Jigokudani monkeys , so if you get tired or need a break there is more to do than chill out in the cafeteria etc.\nThe key advantages of Shiga Kogen is that conditions and snow quality are usually excellent, and the varying altitudes provides an extended season. There are very long runs available (up to 6 kilometers) due to the large vertical drop, and some 80 kilometers of groomed runs in total. Apart from the lift & gondola system there is also a non-stop shuttle bus network that you can use to experience the different areas on offer.\nThe main disadvantage is cost. Shiga Kogen is a little more expensive to get to, and budget accommodation is difficult to obtain in snow. Tsugaike Kogen is a better option for those on a tight budget.\nClick here for more information regarding when Discovery visits this destination.\nPhotographs and contributions\nDo you have good photographs or a story to share about this destination?

Alpine skiers had a significantly higher risk of lower leg fractures compared to snowboarders and telemark skiers.\nFor knee injuries ( table 6 ), the authors found the highest risk among females, beginners, alpine skiers and non-Nordic skiers/boarders.\nFor shoulder injuries ( table 7 ), telemarkers, children under 12 years and adults compared to adolescents, non-Nordic and males were at higher risk.\nCrude analyses of injury risk concerning lower leg fractures, knee injuries and shoulder injuries did not differ more than 15% from the adjusted analyses, thus there is a low degree of confounding.\nCollision with another person or obstacle was reported in 12.9% of all cases, and the remaining injuries were the result of a fall or a jump. Injury as a result of collision was seen more frequently among the alpine skiers (15.6%) than in the other disciplines (9.5%).\nPrevious Section Next Section\nDiscussion\nThe main findings of the present study were that beginners, snowboarders, children and adolescents were at increased overall risk of injury.\nRented equipment and skiing instruction did not seem to influence the overall risk of injury, while skiing instruction decreased the risk of potentially severe injuries. The injury pattern varied between the three disciplines, snowboarding, alpine and telemark skiing, reflecting the inherent differences in user technique and equipment design. Being a beginner was associated with a 2.5 times higher risk of injury. The idea that beginners are at higher risk, is well established in the literature, but the risk estimates have been inconsistent, varying from 1.6 to 7 times higher risk. 9 , \u2013 , 11 13 14\nWhether the female skiers and snowboarders have the same injury risk and distribution as the men is controversial. Prodromos et al 15 found no gender differences in ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tear risk for either recreational or expert alpine skiers in a meta-analysis investigating gender differences for ACL injury in different sports activities. Langran and Selvaraj 7 found no relation with gender in a case-control study during the winter of 2000, involving 674 injured skiers and snowboarders and 336 controls. However, Wasden et al 16 concluded that men are at a higher risk of injuries while skiing or snowboarding, based on a retrospective case series of 1142 skiers and snowboarders treated at the local medical center, but this study did not have a matching control group. In this study, the authors found a 19% lower overall injury risk for female skiers and snowboarders in the crude analysis, but this was not significant in the adjusted model. However, the authors did see a 67% higher risk for knee injuries among female skiers and snowboarders, as well as a 46% lower risk for shoulder injuries and 32% lower risk for head injuries. These gender differences are pointed out in a paper by Shealy and co-workers, 1996. 17 Female athletes are more prone to knee injuries in most sports (ACL ruptures in particular). 18 The injury often occurs as a combination of compressive loading and twisting of the knee. 19 This mechanism is typical in the alpine skiing discipline, when the skier loses balance or the ski edge catches during a turn. 20 21 Upper limb and head injuries are often associated with falling from a jump. 22 23 Thus, more cautious skiing may be an explanation for why female skiers and snowboarders have a lower risk for upper limb and head/neck injuries.\nSacco et al 24 found that alpine skiers and snowboarders were equally prone to injury in an evaluation of skiing and snowboarding injuries admitted to the local level 1 trauma center over a 6-year period, but without any control material their conclusion is difficult to interpret. Langran et al 7 based on their case-control study demonstrated that snowboarders were more likely to sustain upper limb or axial injury, while lower limb injuries were more common in the alpine group. However, they concluded that there is no difference in the overall risk between the two disciplines. In two other studies without control groups, Xiang et al 25 found no significant differences in overall injury risk or admittance to hospital between skiers and snowboarders, while Dohjima et al 6 found that snowboarders had a 6 times higher injury risk. In the present study, the authors found that snowboarders had twice the overall injury risk of alpine and telemark skiers, and a three times higher risk for potentially severe injuries. However, while snowboarders had a higher injury rate than skiers for injuries to the upper body, they sustained fewer lower limb injuries than alpine skiers. In fact, alpine skiers had more than twice the risk of knee injuries compared to snowboarders, and also a significantly higher risk than telemark skiers. The reason why snowboarders suffer fewer injuries to their legs and, in particular, their knees is probably because both feet are fixed to the board. The board is unable to act independently as a lever, thus reducing the twisting and bending forces on the individual knee.\nSome authors claim that the injury rate for shoulder injuries is quite similar between disciplines, 7 26 , \u2013 , 28 while others have found a much higher incidence among snowboarders than alpine skiers. 29 30 These conclusions are mostly based on studies without control groups. McCall et al 30 debated this issue in a recent review, concluding that shoulder injuries account for 8% to 16% of snowboarding injuries and 4% to 11% of alpine skiing injuries. In this study, the proportion of shoulder injuries was highest among telemark skiers (20%) compared to alpine and snowboarders (11% each). Adjusted for other factors, telemark skiers had a 70% higher risk for shoulder injuries compared to snowboarders, while there was no significant difference between snowboarders and alpine skiers.\nThe authors also found that adults and children have a significantly higher risk of shoulder injuries than adolescents. Fractures in the shoulder were common in children, while adults sustained more dislocations.\nLower leg fractures are thought to be a particular risk among younger skiers, but exact risk estimates are missing. Data showed that children younger than 13 years had a four times higher risk than adolescents, and 11 times higher risk than adults. Langran et al 7 found that tibia/fibula fractures represented 5% of injuries to alpine skiers and 0.5% among snowboarders. The authors found that alpine skiers had about 2.5 times the risk of snowboarders and telemark skiers. Other risk factors for lower leg fractures were skiing ability and nationality. Since their introduction, ski release bindings are thought to have reduced dramatically the incidence of lower leg fractures among alpine skiers. 7 31 Nevertheless, lower leg fractures are still common in young alpine skiers (17% of all injuries in alpine skiers up to 12 years old). The high lower leg fracture rate among children is an issue which needs to be addressed, as release bindings alone do not seem to have solved the problem in this age group. The data used in this study were collected in 2002, and the authors do not know how changes in equipment or skier/snowboarder behavior over the past years may impact on the relevance of the study.\nWhat this study adds\n\u25b6 Children, snowboarders and beginners are at increased injury risk.\n\u25b6 Female skiers and snowboarders have a lower risk for shoulder injuries, and higher risk for knee injuries.\n\u25b6 Telemark skiers have a higher risk for shoulder injuries.\nPrevious Section Next Section\nLimitations\nRecent studies on the risk factors of skiing and snowboarding injury have to some extent been inconclusive because they lack an appropriate control group or the number of injuries has been too small for multivariate analyses. The strength of the current study is that the authors could assess key risk factors in alpine skiing and snowboarding by comparing injured cases to an uninjured, representative control group, while correcting for important confounders.\nCentral to the injury reporting is also the definition of an injury. According to the authors' definition, an injury is whatever was reported to and registered by the ski patrol. Obtaining a control group representative of all skiers and snowboarders at risk is another difficult task. The controls were registered during \u2018rush-hour\u2019 in the morning and after lunch, when most users were entering the area through the bottom main ski lift. All users entered here, and many users would end up there after a run, even after going off-piste or in the snowboard park. The authors selected Wednesdays and Saturdays to sample the control group to compensate for differences in user characteristics between weekdays and weekends, and matched the number of controls to the expected injury count in each ski area. Potential confounding by type of run or weekday of injury may have been accounted for, at least in part, by factors adjusted for in the analysis, for example, nationality, skiing ability, rented equipment and skiing instruction.\nThe authors have not assessed the number of injured skiers and snowboarders that bypass the ski patrol for their injuries. Studies have shown that self-reported injuries may be up to ten times higher than recorded by ski patrols, but also that those missed by ski patrols were minor. 26 27 The results of these studies showed that injury risk factors were quite consistent between less and potentially more severe cases, which means that a reporting bias was unlikely.\nRecall bias is not likely to have been a significant factor, since interviews were done on the spot, usually within a few minutes after the injury. Although the authors do not know how a stressful injury situation may have affected how skiers report their skiing ability or ski instruction, most other factors could be observed directly by the ski patrol.\nPrevious Section Next Section\nConclusions\nChildren, adolescents, beginners and snowboarders have an increased injury risk. Alpine skiers, beginners, males, children and adolescents are at a higher risk of lower leg fractures, telemark skiers, males and adolescents are at a higher risk of shoulder injuries, while knee injuries occur more frequently among alpine skiers, females and beginners.\nPrevious Section Next Section\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are indebted to the ski patrols at the various resorts for recording injuries and interviewing the control group.\nPrevious Section Next Section\nFootnotes\nFunding The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center has been established at the Norwegian School Sport Sciences through grants from the Norwegian Eastern Health Corporate, the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Culture, the Norwegian Olympic Committee & Confederation of Sport, the International Olympic Committee, and Norsk Tipping AS.

These scores are added to a rating of difficulty to come up with a final score for each jump.\nMogul skiing is undertaken on a steep course featuring multiple moguls (lumps) and two jumps.\u00a0 Skiers are scored on their speed, the \u201cair\u201d achieved in each jump and their turns.\nIn half pipe, riders compete on a half-cylinder shaped course (similar to skateboarding) built into the snow.\u00a0 The half pipe is approximately 120 metres long and has steeply sloping sides.\u00a0 Riders must travel the length of the pipe, crossing from wall to wall by performing manoeuvres or acrobatic tricks.\u00a0 Riders are judged on factors such as air, rotation, and overall impression.\nCompetition\nThe main competitive season for elite freestyle skiers and snowboarders is during the northern hemisphere winter \u2013 principally, between December to March.\nThe Olympic program for aerial skiing involves a 2 jump qualifying round, with skiers achieving the top 12 combined scores moving through to a 2 jump final in which scoring starts again.\u00a0 The skier with the highest combined total at the end of the 2 jump final is awarded the Gold Medal. Athletes are allowed to undertake training on the jump course before each competition, usually for 1-3 days.\u00a0 The total duration of the event is ~ 3-5 hours.\nMoguls skiers at the Olympics compete in a 1 run elimination round after which the top 16 skiers go through to a 1 run final.\u00a0 The skier with the highest score in the finals run is the winner.\u00a0 The typical duration of the moguls event is around 25-35 sec per run.\u00a0 However, similar to aerial skiing, the mogul competition can take up to 5 hours for all skiers to go through runs and pre event training.\nThe Olympic half pipe snowboard program also involves a qualifying round, with the top 12 competitors progressing to the finals.\u00a0 In the finals, riders complete two runs of the pipe.\u00a0 The better of the two runs counts as the final score.\u00a0 Typically, a run of the half pipe takes 15\u201320 seconds.\u00a0 However, competition also includes a warm-up and practice period.\nTraining\nThe off-season for elite freestyle skiers and snowboarders is during Australia\u2019s winter.\u00a0 During this time, elite athletes typically train on snow in the morning for 2-3 hours and do either a gym or aerobic session (i.e. run, ride) in the afternoon.\u00a0 However, this can vary depending on snow conditions.\u00a0 Freestyle skiers and snowboarders also use dry land training when snow is not available.\u00a0 Aerial skiers use jumps into water or trampolines to practice their skills during summer.\u00a0 Mogul skiers also occasionally use trampolines to complement their training in summer.\u00a0 Snowboarders often use similar sports like skateboarding or surfing to hone agility skills before moving to on snow training.\nPhysical Characteristics\nFreestyle skiers and snowboarders vary greatly in body shape and size, but require strength, flexibility and skill to execute their tricks.\u00a0 Theoretically, carrying excess body fat may make it more difficult to move the body through the air and gain good height on tricks.\u00a0 Traditionally aerial skiers have shared physical characteristics with gymnastic athletes;\u00a0 in fact some of Australia\u2019s best freestyle skiers such as Alisa Camplin and Lydia Ierodiaconou started their athletic careers as gymnasts.\u00a0 It appears that aerial skiing tolerates higher lean muscle tissue than gymnastics, since top level aerial skiers are older and heavier than top gymnasts.\u00a0 Although little published data exists on mogul and half pipe snowboarders.\u00a0 It is usually accepted that they require a moderate amount of muscle mass to deal with the tortional demands of their sports.\nCommon Nutrition Issues\nEnvironmental Extremes\nFactors such as altitude, a cold environment, heavy gear and hard training can increase the fuel and fluid needs of freestyle skiers and snowboarders.\u00a0 Failure to eat and drink appropriately during workouts and competition will result in premature fatigue - compromising performance and increasing the risk of injury. On snow training facilities are typically located in extreme environmental situations where food and fluid supplies are often difficult to access.\u00a0 Skiers and snowboarders need to plan ahead to ensure fuel and hydration needs are met.\nFluid and Hydration- Who feels like drinking on snow??\nMaintaining hydration during snow workouts can be a real challenge that\u2019s often underestimated!\u00a0 Fluid issues differ between summer and winter training sessions.\u00a0In summer, freestyle skiers often do large amounts of training in hot conditions using water ramps.\u00a0 This can increase sweat losses and fluid needs. In contrast, sweat losses decrease in cold weather, but hydration may be compromised by restricted access to fluid and increases in non-sweating fluid loss (e.g. loss of moisture from the nose and mouth in the dry, high altitude conditions).\u00a0 Even when fluids are available on the snow, intakes may be low because of a reluctance to drink in the cold, or fear of the need to urinate (bathroom facilities may be inaccessible!).\nThe following hydration tips may assist in meeting fluid requirements during training and competition on the snow:\n\u2022\u00a0Use sports drinks.\u00a0 They encourage fluid intake and can assist with fluid retention, reducing the need to urinate while on snow.\u00a0 Sports drinks also provide carbohydrate to help meet fuel needs.\n\u2022\u00a0Keep fluids at a comfortable temperature.\u00a0 Fluid intake is usually reduced when fluids are very cold (or frozen).\u00a0Cool fluids (10-15oC) are generally preferred during strenuous sessions.\u00a0 However, in very cold conditions warmer fluids may be more inviting.\u00a0 Try packing a thermos or insulated drink containers to prevent the temperature dropping to very low levels.\n\u2022\u00a0Other good fluid choices for a long session on the snow include flavoured milk, juice, hot chocolate / Milo, soup or water, or meal replacement shakes like Powerbar Protein Plus.\nTiming of Meals and Snacks around Training and Competition\nMany of the exciting new research outcomes in sports nutrition involve clever timing of food and fluid intake in relation to a training or competition session. This presents unique challenges for Freestyle skiers and snowboarders, because the distance between the on snow training facilities and eating facilities is often significant, and the practical problems of taking or preparing food on the snow requires a creative approach!\nIt is essential to make time for a suitable breakfast before heading out for an on-snow session..\u00a0 Good choices include cold or hot cereals, toast or toasted muffins, crumpets, pancakes, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt, eggs or baked beans are good choices.\nTo maintain or replace fuel stores, consume snacks during and immediately after long sessions.. Remote locations often limit the type of foods that are practical to take,\u00a0 Easy and compact choices include:\n\u2022\u00a0easy to eat fruit i.e. banana\n\u2022\u00a0sports bars/breakfast bars\n"}, {"score": 1336.5894, "uuid": "aaa1cd65-d6f6-5bae-9a6b-e28a77ad3bea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-07-16516", "target_hostname": "www.skicoupons.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skicoupons.com/groups.cfm/r/56/g/20", "page_rank": 1.3328757e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Banff - Lake Louise <em>Skiing</em> and <em>Snowboarding</em> - Alberta Canada Discounts", "snippet": "Ski Norquay offers a <em>snowboarding</em> &#x2F; <em>skiing</em> experience <em>which</em> <em>is</em> <em>more</em> geared to families, making it easier for younger children as well as large groups to have a good time learning how to ski and racing down the gentle slopes.", "explanation": null, "document": "Mt. Norquay\nSunshine Village\nBanff is one of the most popular winter resort destinations in Canada \u2013 not only is the town of Banff a popular destination in and of itself, with a number of great mountains surrounding it such as Mount Rundle, Sulphur Mountain, Mt Norquay and Cascade Mountain, the town of Banff and the nearby town of Lake Louise are close enough to the ski resorts of Sunshine Village and Ski Norquay to provide an excellent place to stay while snowboarding at either one of those popular resorts.\nBanff National Park is host to three of the world renowned ski resorts; The Lake Louise Ski Area, Sunshine Village and Mt. Norquay. This spectacularly scenic area offers a tri-area lift ticket that is good at the resorts and free transportation between Banff-Lake Louise and the three resorts.\nThe Sunshine Village Ski Resort is one of the most popular regional ski resorts, yet it manages to provide an uncrowded snowboarding / skiing experience with over three thousand and three hundred acres of terrain in total. The average snowfall for the Sunshine Village Ski Resort is more than thirty feet per year, and as a result the Sunshine Village Ski Resort is known for having an exceptionally long open season which lasts from the middle of November until the end of May.\nThere are three mountains at the Sunshine Village Ski Resort, called Goat\u2019s Eye, Lookout and Standish. These mountains are home to more than one hundred and seven runs. Twelve lifts serve the system of trails, with a lift capacity of twenty thousand people per hour making it easy to get to the top without ever having to wait in line. Sunshine Village Ski Resort has a terrific vertical drop of just over three thousand and five hundred feet which lets you get in some truly epic runs.\nThe challenge levels at the Sunshine Village Ski Resort are also well varied, with twenty percent of the runs being geared towards beginners, fifty five percent being more for intermediate snowboarders and twenty five percent being well suited for expert level snowboarders and skiers. There is also the Rogers Terrain Park for snowboarders, which provides eight acres of terrain including a great selection of boxes, jumps and rails.\nAn A-frame box, a whale tail box, a nutcracker rail, a 20 foot handrail, a banked C box, an old blue rail, a C bow box, a stepdown box, a 40 foot rail, a coffin box, a down box, a Dr. Suess rail, a flat / down rail, a rainbow rail, an up box, a right hip jump and a pyramid are just a few of the great pieces of equipment that you can work off of at the Rogers Terrain Park at Sunshine Village Ski Resort.\nSki Norquay offers a snowboarding / skiing experience which is more geared to families, making it easier for younger children as well as large groups to have a good time learning how to ski and racing down the gentle slopes. While there are also more difficult runs for you to try at Ski Norquay, it provides an easier experience overall for lots of people to come and enjoy.\nThe Banff area is filled with great runs, great back country and lots of great resorts where you can have a great time developing your snowboarding skills or just playing around!\nToday, Alberta has seven impressive, destination ski resorts: Banff, Fortress Mountain, The Lake Louise Ski Area, Marmot Basin, Mystic Ridge/Norquay, Nakiska and Sunshine Village. And don't forget about their six heli-skiing operators!\nFor some, a trip to Alberta is not complete unless it includes a side trip to the West Edmonton Mall--the world's largest shopping and entertainment complex with a wave pool, triple-loop roller coaster, shark tank, ice rink, trained dolphins and an indoor beach.\nAlberta is easy to get to. Simply fly into Calgary or Edmonton and rent a car, or take scheduled shuttle bus service to the ski resorts. And yes, it's still possible to take a sleeper train--just like those first tourists-- right into downtown Jasper. If you have the time, the VIA Rail journey from Vancouver in the west or Montreal in the east, is an unforgettable experience.\n*Written by: Paul McMorris - a contributing editor for Skiing Magazine.\nCopyright \u00a9 1998 - 2012 Vacation Coupons.

After a season spent battling the elements - cold weather, howling winds, driving snow, rain, and other forms of precipitation - the spring season presents a kinder, gentler form of snowboarding. Warmer weather, longer days and softer snow are in effect, as are fun events at resorts, discounted pricing on lift tickets and lodging, as well as great deals on snowboard equipment.\nAlthough many folks are quick to put their equipment away at the first signs of spring, don't follow their lead! Most resorts are open well into April, with deep base depths and a full slate of services still being offered. Spring is also a great time to take a lesson or two, as class sizes are generally smaller, leading to more personalized instruction. And don't worry - you won't forget what you learned over the summer!\nThere are a few things that are important to remember when snowboarding during the spring. First, remember to layer your clothing effectively. Nothing ruins a day of snowboarding more than being uncomfortable, be it too warm or too cold. By wearing several light layers of clothing, you'll be able to easily shed layers throughout the day as temperatures warm up. The second thing to be aware of is the importance of a proper wax application on the base of your snowboard. Spring snow contains a high water content, which can make it difficult for the snowboard to slide properly. A good application of spring wax can easily negate this \"sticky effect.\"\nOnce you've decided you're still up for a few more days on snow, be sure to check out your local resort's events page to see what's going on. Warm weather BBQ's, pond skimming contests, costume parades, Easter egg hunts and more are usually on the list, all of which present a great opportunity to kick back and enjoy the last few days of snow before a long summer!\nMore About Spring Snowboarding\n"}, {"score": 1288.907, "uuid": "0fd6a22d-3bb8-5157-a1c5-e5ee42a16474", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1005wb-48-09944", "target_hostname": "aspen.com", "target_uri": "http://aspen.com/taxonomy/term/199%20210%20207%20208?page=2", "page_rank": 1.1856944e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Sports + Hiking + <em>Skiing</em> + <em>SnowBoarding</em> | Aspen Colorado: Aspen.com - Hotels", "snippet": "For me it <em>is</em> a rite of passage to summit the peak that towers above the town in <em>which</em> I live.", "explanation": null, "document": "Conquering Mount Sopris near Basalt, CO.\nView near summit of Mount Sopris: View near summit of Mount Sopris near the Basalt.CARBONDALE, CO - In most of the Colorado mountain towns where I have lived, there is one peak that dominates the skyline.

So we've done the heavy sledding for you, picking 13 resorts that offer world-class skiing, fine accommodations, and unrivaled apr\u00e8s-ski attractions. All are four- or five-star sites, but some are best for experts, while others are suitable for all levels of skiers.\nIn general, France offers the biggest resorts, with the steepest verticals and the most challenging off-piste (off-trail) skiing. Swiss ski areas tend to have equally impressive mountains, but more charm. In Austria you'll find good value, countless skiing options, and the relaxed feel of small villages. Italy has the lowest prices, the friendliest people, and the most consistent snow in the Alps.\nAUSTRIA\nIschgl\nIschgl, renowned for its consistently high-quality snow conditions, offers all the ski opportunities of a larger resort with all the rustic charm of a Tirolean village. With nearly all the runs above 6,000 feet, the nearby ski area of Silvretta offers the most reliable snow in the Tirol. Beginners will find only a few long runs, but they are conveniently located near the gondola stations and on-mountain lodges. And, from the Palinkopf Summit at the extreme western end of the slopes, intermediates can cruise on long, uninterrupted runs over treeless terrain. From the summit, skiers may also cross the Swiss border to visit the village of Samnaun. Expert skiers may wish to hire a guide to explore the off-piste skiing around Ischgl. Though relatively unheralded, this adventure offers real opportunities for untracked exploration.\nA one-week ski pass for Silvretta costs up to $250 in peak season. For more information about Ischgl, contact the local tourist office, Tourismusberband (A-6561, Ischgl, Austria, 01143-5444-5266).\nKitzbuhel\nThe focus of Kitzbuhel skiing is the Hahnenkamm, the site of World Cup races each January. If you want to avoid the crowds, however, ski the Ehrenbachhohe in the nearby quaint, medieval Kirchberg, or try the 6,500-foot Kitzbuheler Horn, which features long but relatively easy intermediate trails. Despite the attention paid to the World Cup, Kitzbuhel is mostly an intermediate destination, at least when it comes to prepared trails. Off-track fans can go with guides to more challenging sections (about $175 per day), and the ski school gives group classes in off-track skiing for about $55 per day.\nTo get to Kuitzbuhel, fly to Munich and take the train from there. Contact the local tourist office, or Fremdenverkehrsverband (Hinterstadt 18, A-6370, Kitzbuhel, Austria. 01143-5356-2155) when you arrive.\nSt. Anton\nIn the Arlberg region of the Tirol lies St. Anton, one of the oldest and busiest of Austria's resorts. You can ski dozens of runs from St. Anton proper, plus hundreds of other runs in the nearby resorts of St. Christoph, Stuben, Zurs, and Lech. St. Anton offers Austria's largest ski school and perhaps the best skiing for intermediates in the Tirol. From St. Anton, take the cable car to the Valluga summit and you'll enjoy a 9,000-foot half-hour cruise to the valley below. The intermediate run from the Gampberg summit is outstanding, while experts will be challenged by the large mogul field accessed from the Tanzboden lift.\nTo get to Alberg, fly to Zurich, then take the express train to St. Anton or the Arlberg Express ski-bus to Lech. The tourist office can be contacted at A-6580 St. Anton am Alberg, Austria (01143+5446-22690).\nZell Am See\nWith its multitude of options\u0097groomed trails, World Cup downhills, off-track runs, and glaciers\u0097Zell Am See offers the complete Alps ski experience. Most of the best runs are accessed via the Schmittenhohe lifts. There is an outstanding network of intermediate trails, but experts can challenge themselves on the World Cup runs, and a superb run down from the Kapellenlift summit. Nearby Kaprun, located 10 kilometers from Zell Am See, is famous for its high-altitude glacier skiing. Reach the Alpin Center via a cable car, or the Stanseilbahn tunnel route. Ski from there, or those with strong legs can go all the way to the 10,000-foot top station via aerial tram.\nIn low- and mid-season, Zell am See offers a good all-in-one ski package, the Schnee-Okay. for around $350 per person, you get a regional six-day lift pass, seven nights first-class lodging, and use of the regional ski shuttles. Less expensive plans, starting at $270, book you in pensions or B and Bs, but the lifts are extra. Book local accommodations directly through the Zell am see Kurverwaltung (Brucker Bunderstrasse, A-5700 Zell am See, Austria 01143-6542-47555. www.zellamsee.com).\nPaul McMenamin is the author, editor, and photo director of the original Ultimate Adventure Sourcebook.\nPrevious\nLast Updated: 14 Sep 2010\nPublished: 20 Aug 2001\nThe details, dates, and prices mentioned in this article were accurate at the time of publication.\nPost Your Comment\n"}, {"score": 1267.3944, "uuid": "42a1e7fa-fa80-5300-a185-d6acd379ab63", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0006wb-13-12321", "target_hostname": "classic.mountainzone.com", "target_uri": "http://classic.mountainzone.com/gear/99/access/transceiver/index.html", "page_rank": 1.1939171e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "MountainZone.com | 1999 Gear for <em>Snowboarding</em>, <em>Skiing</em>, Mountain Biking,", "snippet": "&lt;META name=&quot;description&quot; content=The Mountain Zone <em>is</em> the definitive source for all mountain related activity.

Not your partner's, your employer's, and certainly not your mother's 'cause she says you shouldn't be out there in the first place. YOUR brain! Too many avalanche accidents are the result of leaving one's brain in the sock drawer.\nYou need your brain in order to figure out\nA) If you are in avalanche terrain;\nB) What the snow pack stability is and how weather is influencing avalanche hazard; and\nC) What the consequences of your decisions may be.\nThe goal should be to avoid getting caught in an avalanche, rather than focusing on getting out of one. Avalanches will kill, maim, and otherwise ruin your trip. Avalanche hazard is not influenced by your work schedule, social life, hormone level or your ambitions. Your decision making, on the other hand, is influenced by these factors and you need to be aware of this. Have you paid a lot of money to get as much vertical in as you can? You feel unsure about crossing a slope and if you speak up your friends might think you are a wimp and will never invite you again? The weather is absolutely beautiful, the snow perfect and the six guys ahead of you made it down okay?\nIf you decide to expose yourself to some degree of avalanche danger, and most of us do if we ski, ride, climb or explore there is some basic equipment that can increase your chances of surviving an avalanche.\nAvalanche transceivers are small devices that transmit and receive a radio signal from another transceiver. When traveling in avalanche terrain, everyone has a transceiver on in transmit mode. In the event that an avalanche catches someone in the party, those that are not buried then switch over their beacons to receive and locate their buried friend.\nIt takes practice, practice and more practice to reliably conduct a beacon search on an avalanche debris pile. Speed is absolutely critical when searching for a buried victim. After 20 minutes under the snow, there is less than a 50% survival rate, but 20 minutes goes by in a flash when an accident happens. Fresh batteries are also essential. Remember this if you rent or borrow a beacon and always put in your own fresh batteries.\n\"After 20 minutes under the snow, there is less than a 50% survival rate, but 20 minutes goes by in a flash when an accident happens....\"\nA major shift in avalanche transceivers occurred several years ago when all new models were switched to a higher single frequency of 457 kHz. There are some older models that can send and receive on two frequencies (dual beacons), but these are becoming rarer and have a smaller range.\nCompatibility is an issue if someone is still clinging on to their old and unreliable single frequency 2275 Hz transceivers. Be sure to check this out with new hiking partners before starting your trip. If you have not retired your old low frequency beacon, do so now. Another major change now underway is the advent of digital beacons.\nThe existing analog beacons work on the principle that the closer you get to the transmitting beacon, the stronger the signal gets. In order to locate the buried beacon, you must know how to perform a specific search pattern to hone in on the signal. The new digital beacons work on the same principle and there is hope manufacturers will incorporate the added feature of direction finding capability.\nYou find your buried partner, now you must have a means of digging them out. A real shovel, and not those little GI things you carried when you were a kid, is absolutely essential. Avalanche debris can set up like concrete, even if the initial snow seemed like bottomless powder, your hands, water bottle or ski tips are not going to do the job. There are good, lightweight snow shovels out there, and if you do not have one now, you will be surprised the neat things you can do with it, including digging quick snow pits as you travel. Carry one. Transceivers and shovels go together and everyone should carry one of each in your party if you are traveling in avalanche terrain.\nClose on the heels of avalanche transceivers and shovels are avalanche probes. Avalanche probes can be a long, collapsible probes designed specifically for this purpose, or convertible ski poles that screw together to become one long probe. In a pinch, regular ski poles, ice axes, tree limbs, and skis can be used. Even if a buried victim is located with a beacon, it can be difficult, the deeper they are, to determine exactly where to dig.\nA probe can quickly pinpoint the victim, thereby minimizing the amount of debris to be shoveled away. This becomes particularly important with deep burials and steep slopes. If the victim is not wearing a transceiver, the only way to locate them will be through the use of probes. Probing is done in a systematic fashion below the last seen area at the toe of the avalanche, near trees and rocks, benches and curves. Probing is exhausting and difficult work and nowhere near as effective as an avalanche transceiver in the hands of someone who knows how to use it.\nCollapsible avalanche probes are now very lightweight and simple to use. If you have probe ski poles, be sure you can really get them to function as such. It has been my experience that most ski probe pole owners can not get their baskets or handles off, or get the poles screwed together so that they will not come apart when probing. They can work if you take good care of them and know how to use them.\nAnother useful bit of equipment, mercifully inexpensive and lightweight, is an inclinometer. An inclinometer is used to measure slope angles, which are key in identifying avalanche terrain. Most slab avalanches release on slopes of 30-45\u00b0, but they do occur at lower and higher angles. Practice measuring a slope you are about to climb up or ski down so you can improve your ability to recognize more hazardous terrain.\nKeep in mind the best use of avalanche safety equipment is locating your body and assisting someone else in getting it out of the snow; it will not keep you from getting caught, nor will it keep you from getting smashed up and killed on the way down. AVALANCHE SAFETY EQUIPMENT IS FOR RECOVERY! Think about this when the thought flashes through your mind, \"I will be okay, I am wearing my transceiver\" or my favorite, \"I am not going to invite so and so along because they do not have a beacon.\" An avalanche beacon is not a magic amulet that will protect you against the evil avalanche spirits lurking in the snow. It will not prevent you from getting swept over a cliff or sieved through the trees.\nA dangerous time exists during the transition from winter sports to spring climbing and hiking. Just because you have hung up your boards for the season and pulled out your rack, it does not mean that chance of getting caught in an avalanche goes away. On the contrary, avalanches can occur whenever you have avalanche terrain coupled with unstable snow. Bring along your beacon, shovel and something to probe with even when no one else in your party does. You never know when you might come across an accident scene, or heaven forbid, you are the subject of a rescue. Your chances of coming home alive are better if you are prepared and at least cognizant of avalanche hazards.\nThis brings us back to your primary piece of equipment, your brain. Know where you are going, know how to recognize changing conditions, and go prepared to accept the consequences of your decisions. Be able to change your plans, stand your ground when you have a gut feeling that something is unsafe, so you'll live to do it again another day.\n\u0097 Cynthia Hickey, Mountain Zone Correspondent\nCynthia Hickey is a field team leader for the Ski Patrol Rescue Team, a unit of Washington State's King County Search and Rescue Association which specializes in avalanche rescue and year-round backcountry medical care and rescue.

Moving east to west, among our favorites are:\nBretton Woods, NH. We defy you to find a more fete-ful atmosphere than the Mt. Washington Hotel. Just looking at that huge white building with its gleaming red roof and endless wrap-around porch all aglitter with holiday lights is enough to create a vacation. But, let's talk special events, shall we? On Nov. 30, Christmas with Dickens features presentations of \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Tea with Scrooge\" and \"Dinner with Dickens\", performed by Gerald Charles Dickens, Charles Dickens' great-great grandson; from Dec. 20-26, the Family Christmas Celebration includes caroling, storytelling, and Christmas Eve Dinner followed by holiday music and fireside winter-warmers with elf tuck-ins available for the youngsters; Dec. 21's Holiday Follies go on all day - cookie decorating, ornament crafting, skiing with Santa and Christmas tree lighting; Dec. 26-28 are Family Fun Days filled with special programs for ages 5-12 and kids' apres ski parties.

Twice the site of the Olympic Games, Lake Placid remains an internationally-flavored American small town. Yet, the is in the celebration of winter. Smack off Main Street you can climb up an old-fashioned toboggan slide and skid across Mirror Lake in an activity that's unchanged in more than a hundred years. (Try it riding backwards!) Downtown Lake Placid is downright cute. And, of course, there's all that Olympic stuff to do - ride the bobsled, watch the lugers go and the ski jumpers fly, and skate in the schoolyard where Eric Heiden won five gold medals - the very same track where this dad took several headers within one lap! Events: Dec. 23-29: An Adirondack Christmas Tradition at Whiteface Mountain with piano, bell choir, clowns and magic; Dec. 26-31, USA Hockey Women's Holiday Tournament; Dec. 28, Annual Coronation Ice Show New Year's Ski Jump Competition.

The Old City is always alluring, a touch of ancient Europe stuck north of New England; during Yuletide the place dazzles. The area is laden with lights, outdoor creche scenes and lit trees. Myriad shops and restaurants are all decked out for the season. With snow on the ground, there's no urban scene quite like it this side of the Atlantic. And, with alpine skiing as close as a half-hour away at Mont Ste. Anne or Stoneham, plus Nordic skiing right in town, you can have the best of all worlds there.

That classic winter image of a New England village originates from Stowe, church steeple and all. Places like the Trapp Family Lodge, with its classic Austrian, Nordic retreat ambience, and events like horse-drawn sleigh rides at Edson Hill Manor, Stowehof, Mountain View Equestrian or the Trapp Family Lodge, and the Helen Day Art Center Festival of Trees in which local businesses compete to create the most interesting Christmas tree, only reinforce the image.

The Butte has a reputation for extreme terrain, and the bad news is that often in December the snowpack lacks the depth to open that territory. But, for most, there's enough downhill sliding to be entertained, and you have an historic landmark town that will charm your pants off. You'll probably need new pants by the time you leave, anyway, because the eating in this village is something taking a gourmet tour of France, Italy, Mexico and other sites in one tiny southwestern spot. Sure, the on-slope development lacks character, but you can stay in slopeside digs and readily ride the free bus to town. Info: cbmr.com; 800-810-SNOW or 800-950-2133.\nBeaver Creek, CO. We're going to go out on a limb here and say money may not buy you happiness but it will buy you holidays with pizzazz at Beaver Creek. This is not for the slight of wallet, but if high-class amenities and all the fixin's is your cup of tea, this is the answer. The base village has it all - shops, spas, fine restaurants, a world-class, performing arts center, skating rink, heated sidewalks - you name it. And, they do the holidays just like they do everything else - first class. Events: Bob Berky, Musical Clown, Dec. 21, a masterful holiday clown show for audiences of all ages; \"A Scottish Christmas\" (Dec. 22) a journey of lively Scottish carols, wassail tunes and traditional Highland dance and music; The BMW Thursday Night Lights, a hosted, weekly glow stick ski-down to music; daily kids' activities at the Park Hyatt Beaver Creek and elsewhere.

It's funky, down home, friendly and filled with hard corps snowsliders. The Big Mountain, twenty minutes up the hill from town, has all the terrain you'd ever want, and some excellent kids programming, too. They're building a new base village up there, but we like being in town, where the long freight trains still roll through (as does Amtrak, which you can ride to get here from east or west), you can buy your latt\u00e9 at the drive-through coffee joint, you can see live theater, and you can, of course, eat well and shop.

If there's a rival city to Quebec City in North America, it's probably Santa Fe. Oh, yeah, it's a little pricey, and the New Agers might make you dizzier than the elevation, but three cultures meet here and they do it with style. Ski Santa Fe also happens to be one of the best \"small\" or \"local\" ski areas anywhere. Better for families than Taos, we think, if for no other reason than snowboarders are welcome. You must drive a half-hour up a wonderful road - watching the topography change from high desert to high mountain - to reach the snowfields, but once you're there you're rewarded with no extraneous development and a ten thousand square mile view.

You've heard the slogan, \"If it was easy, it would be called snowboarding\". Well here's a new one: \"if there was only one way to do it correctly, it would be called alpine skiing!\" Part of the appeal of telemark skiing is that it is much more than just a functional way to get down the mountain. We make telemark turns rather than alpine (parallel) turns not always because they are more functional or efficient, but because they feel good. Telemark skiing is an art - like dancing. Unlike hiking or marching, dancing is beautiful, not utilitarian.\nUnderstood this way, telemark skiing offers more than just a free heel. The old cliche about freeing your mind encompasses one's freedom to select movement options as well. In order to make decisions regarding technique, it's important to understand the mechanical consequences of these various movement options, and then decide which choices best express one's individual conception of telemark skiing.\nIn this article I will discuss two common movement patterns used by telemark skiers. One is characterized by a relatively tall stance and short lead, while the other features a lower stance and longer lead. While there are numerous variations to each of these basic patterns, analyzing them as opposite ends of a spectrum will allow us to understand the consequences of each more clearly.\nThe benefits and drawbacks of each pattern can best be analyzed using the three primary skills of skiing - pressure, edging and rotary - as a framework. All skiing maneuvers utilize each of these three component skills in varying proportions. Balance can be added as a fourth skill, which provides a foundation without which the other skills would be meaningless.\nLet's first examine the tall stance and it's consequences in each of the four skill categories...\nBalance\nA tall stance utilizes a high degree of skeletal alignment, which saves energy, but requires accurate movements in the ankles to adjust balance in response to subtle changes of pressure on the soles of the feet and other proprioceptive feedback.\nPressure\nA tall stance allows for pressure to be borne equally by both feet.\nIn a tall stance the ball of the back foot (rather than the big toe) is weighted, enhancing rear foot control. As the height of stance is generally proportional to the length of the lead, the closer fore aft displacement of the feet under the body allows extension movements for unweighting and unedging to be made more easily. Long legs allow generous suspension travel for regulating pressure over irregular terrain and absorbing impacts from landing jumps.\nEdging\nA tall relatively closed stance allows the legs to create angles that are used to retain balance against turning forces and control the arc of the turn. Angulation allows the skis to be tipped on edge progressively,\nA tall, more neutral stance\nmaking carving easier - especially on hard snow. The edges can be changed quickly without the need for the center of mass to be moved aggressively into the turn. This is particularly advantageous in short turns. In a tall stance the body has the freedom to align with the skis in a turn, or to remain oriented to the fall line according to situational demands. With hip angulation and fall line orientation, extension/retraction turns --where the skis cross under the body during turn transitions-&SHY; become possible. These are very effective in moguls and deep snow.\nRotary\nWhile a tall stance allows only weak rotary power in the legs, the shorter lead enables the feet to pivot and change lead quickly. Counter-rotation can also be used to quickly change the orientation of the skis. This can be helpful if a tree appears suddenly in front of you.\nNow let's look at the low stance....\nBalance\nA low stance requires more power because the skeleton is folded more than aligned. I\u0092m told that sitting on the back heel can be restful, but that position severely limits pressure control movements, and would seem to make one more vulnerable to knee injury. On the other hand, a low position with a long lead is very stable longitudinally if not laterally. High speeds are more comfortable in a low position where a sudden change in snow condition doesn\u0092t rock your world quite as hard.\nPressure\nIn a low stance it's harder, though not impossible, to maintain pressure on both feet, although control over the rear foot is somewhat compromised when the\nLow stance with a longer lead\ntip of the big toe, rather than the ball of the foot contacts the ski. A compact position limits the ability to absorb compressions in irregular terrain. Extension movements require more power when started from a low position.\nEdging\nWith the feet spread ahead of and behind the body centerline, angulation becomes difficult in a low stance. Edge change is accomplished primarily with inclination. Edging tends to happen suddenly as the whole body is tipped into the new turn. This can be very powerful and stable, but difficult to fine tune. Many skiers use strong unweighting movements in turn initiation to compensate for reduced edging ability.\nRotary\nA low compact stance enables the skier to make powerful rotary movements, which can be very effective in heavy snow and steep terrain. With the body restricted to a square position over the skis (aligned with the skis), body rotation is often used as a turning power. Hip rotation coinciding with the lead change can also be used as a powerful rotary power.\nTo put all this in a nutshell, tall skiers take advantage of enhanced pressuring and edging ability, while low skiers benefit from strong rotary ability. Tall skiers can also ski with less energy expenditure. Which style you choose depends partly on your age and physique, but more importantly on what you want out of skiing - your artistic conception. Telemark skiing --unlike rock climbing, for example-- is not about reaching your destination, it's about how you get there.\nLow stance with a shorter lead\nI'll tell you what defines hot skiing for me. One thing is dynamic balance. Skiing is not about being in balance all the time. It's about having it, then losing it, then finding it again.\nLow skiers are mostly in static balance with their weight centered over their base of support. Tall skiers move their bodies outside their base of support in the turn initiation. They are always moving toward a balanced position in the future, rarely dwelling there. This is a cool feeling!\nHot skiers also know how to use ski design to shape their turns rather than relying on brute muscular power. Guiding the skis on edge early in the turn causes them to track in an arc. When done at the right moment, releasing the energy stored in the skis causes them to squirt into the next turn.\nThe essence of dynamic skiing is using the equipment to play give-and-take with gravity, rather than fighting the mountain with your legs. Cranking the skis around with strong rotary movements accomplishes the latter more than the former.\nFluidity and elegance are qualities of good dancing as well as good skiing. Lightness, grace, and the appearance of effortlessness are conveyed by a quiet upper body and seamless turn transitions. While it's possible to exhibit these qualities by skiing low, it's more difficult.\nOnly the very best and strongest athletes can demonstrate these qualities in a wide range of conditions.\nTop: Cali's Ben Paik in Verbier, ph: Chris Lohman. Below: Verbier's Bob Mazarei cruising on opening day at Mammoth. Ph: MW\nJust as clothing styles change, so do skiing styles. These days alpine skiing has become passe for many telemark skiers. They are eager to distance themselves as much as possible from their cousins with the locked down heels. It seems to me that many of the low skiers out there are striving for the \"classic telemark\" look as opposed to the \"alpine telemark\" which is taller with a closer stance. Perhaps for them the telemark dance should not be judged by the same functional standards as alpine technique. After all the telemark turn came first, they might say. There may come a day in the future --after there is no more electricity to run ski lifts-- when alpine skiing will no longer provide the model for functional downhill technique. The parallel turn will be viewed --as the telemark turn was until recently-\u0096 as an anachronism. Until then, follow your muse and express yourself. If your mind is as free as your heels, choose your technique as you see fit --but choose wisely.\nRyan Boyer --A Master Of The Low Style-- In Action\n"}, {"score": 1231.6237, "uuid": "60f244ae-afd2-5a67-b754-40add602dfbd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-89-14245", "target_hostname": "www.fitness.gov", "target_uri": "http://www.fitness.gov/snowboarding.html", "page_rank": 1.233639e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Snowboarding</em>", "snippet": "It&#x27;s sometimes said that &quot;<em>snowboarding</em> <em>is</em> hard to learn but easy to master, and <em>skiing</em> <em>is</em> easy to learn but hard to master.&quot; <em>Snowboarding</em> requires <em>more</em> balance than <em>skiing</em> in the beginning.

It's sometimes said that \"snowboarding is hard to learn but easy to master, and skiing is easy to learn but hard to master.\" Snowboarding requires more balance than skiing in the beginning.\u00a0 Just remember \u0097 you have to learn to walk before you run.\nGETTING IN SHAPE FOR SNOWBOARDING\nWatching Olympic athletes often motivates people to want to try their hand at a new sport or reclaim a sport from the past.\u00a0 The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports encourages participation in a wide variety of activities, including the sports of the Winter Olympics, to enhance health and fitness.\u00a0 Since there are risks involved with sports, before going snowboarding, be sure to consult these links, which offer basic information about getting in shape and protecting yourself from cold-related stress and illness:\nSafety Tips: Cold Related Stress and Illness\nWEARING THE RIGHT CLOTHING\nWearing the right clothing is extremely important when participating in cold weather\u00a0 sports. Dress in layers, wearing warm, waterproof/resistant clothing. Clothing for snowboarding should protect the participant from cold, wind, and precipitation and should also provide ventilation \u0097 be \"breathable.\" To reduce wind resistance, the clothing should fit snugly to the body. Pay special attention to protecting feet, hands, face and head. Up to 40 percent of body heat can be lost when the head is exposed. Footgear should be insulated to protect against cold and dampness.\nWearing multiple layers of varying thickness allows you to regulate your body temperature. You should flexibly layer the clothing and use proper materials so you will stay warm and still not restrict your movement. Many peel off layers when snowboarding, then replace those layers when stopping to rest and rehydrate.\nWear at least three layers of clothing\n! A water-resistant outer layer to break the wind and allow some ventilation (nylon or other water-resistant synthetic fabric)\n! A middle layer of wool or wool-like synthetic fabric to absorb sweat and retain insulation\n! An inner layer close to the skin. It's important to keep moisture away from your skin \u0097 avoid cotton, which clings to perspiration. Synthetic materials such as supplex and coolmax are ideal because they keep you warm and dry.\nEQUIPMENT\n! Helmet. A hard plastic helmet is essential to prevent head injuries; helmets manufactured for ski sports are required for snowboarding competition.\n! Board. For the halfpipe, a wide flexible board; for the parallel giant slalom, a stiff, narrower board to allow for turns and high speed.\n! Boots. For the halfpipe, most participants use soft boots with foot and ankle support and lace-up inner boots; for the parallel giant slalom, you'll need alpine boots with a hard plastic exterior for extensive foot and ankle support, similar to alpine ski boots.\nSNOWBOARDING BASICS\nWhen you're ready to head for the snow, the best way to get started is to sign up for snowboarding lessons at a ski resort. Classes exist for all ages and styles, from the free rider, who just wants to whoosh down the hill, to the freestyle artist, who wants to perform the dangerous jumps to thrill the audience below. Keep your expecta- tions realistic the first day or two.\u00a0 Pace yourself, and commit to keep trying to learn snowboarding for at least three days. Then you'll start to gain confidence and feel more control.\u00a0 Once you are comfortable with momentum and controlling speed, it becomes easier to balance.\nBefore going out on the snow, you might consider \"dry land training\" \u0097 practicing with the snowboard on a carpet indoors to help you become oriented and introduce you to the proper primary body alignment. The goal is an efficient foundation/stance.\u00a0 You should be balanced and relaxed, maintaining an athletic stance over the edge you are riding on \u0097 the heel edge (back) or the toe edge (front).\u00a0 You should\nminimize tension or twist up at the waist, and your upper body should align with the angle of your feet.\u00a0 Remember: you're not skiing!\u00a0 You'll need to keep the upper body in somewhat of an alignment with the lower body. Your shoulders should be parallel with the board to assure that you are weighting and balancing on both feet evenly (50-50) and staying on the \"sweet spot\" (center) of the board.\nWhen you are ready to take your first run down the hill, you will have to decide how you want to stand on the board. Most people stand or \"board\" with their left foot forward, much like sliding into home plate. Others prefer to lead with their right foot. Your choice may depend on whether you are left- or right-handed. Some \"boarders\" can do it either way.\u00a0 You'll quickly discover which side is more comfortable for you.\nNext, strap your front leading foot onto the board. Your toes will inch over the edge of the board a bit, your heel against the toes of the other foot as you balance precariously for a second or two. Strap your other foot in, and start slowly down the mountain side (or bunny hill). Make sure you're facing forward, hands in front; keep your weight low and your knees bent. Try to maintain an even keel in the snow without catching the front or back end of your board in the snow.\n! Turns. Turns are made by leaning forwards or backward and from side to side, using the toe edge (front) and the heel edge (back) of the board for steering and speed control. Similar to rollerblading, the back of your board will slow you down if you press it into the snow.\u00a0 Many new riders find it disconcerting to travel facing the trees or the side of the slope while going down the mountain, but after a few gentle turns and twists you'll be thrilled as you gingerly pick up speed and enjoy the powder under your feet.\n! Stopping. Stopping a snowboard is much like coming to a stop on ice skates \u0097 bring both feet perpendicular to the slope, then scrape to a stop. Be prepared to fall more than a few times while learning this skill. Just as in ice skating, you have to learn how to balance your weight to scrape the snow/ice just enough to stop but not so much that you upset your position and fall. These maneuvers will take time and practice to learn, but they are necessary skills to acquire and are fun once you master them.\nFinally, unbuckle your back foot from the board and push off with your foot, sliding easily to the lift for your next ride up to the top to continue snowboarding. Hands free and fancy free, you're on your way to becoming a great snowboarder!\nWHERE TO GO SNOWBOARDING\nSnowboarding is usually done on the snowy slopes and hills of ski resorts. Opportunities to enjoy snowboarding are available at many winter resorts and ski areas. In the United States, winter resorts\nare plentiful in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Western states. Canada and Europe also have many resorts featuring winter sports. Some states have snowboarding available at park and recreation areas. You can call your travel agent or search the Internet (search under \"snowboarding\") for packages and special travel fares. There is an abundance of information on the web. Of course you'll want to check snow conditions at your chosen location. Some resorts keep their slopes snow-covered with snow machines. In addition to the cost of staying at a resort, the main expense for snowboarding is buying or renting equipment and clothing (board, helmet, boots, clothing) and purchase of lift tickets.\nSNOWBOARDING GLOSSARY\nAir to fakie.

Ski slopes, ski lifts and options for snowboarding and skiing in Uzbekistan\nDescription of the slopes, lifts, and routes of Beldersay:\nThe mountain resort of Beldersay is located 80 km to the South-East of Tashkent. It takes approximately 1-1.5 hours by car on the new highway to get there during which you are in stunning highlands with the mysterious and picturesquespurs of the Western Tian Shan covered by archa, juniper and apple forests, bushes of dog-roses and barberry, and rapid rivers and waterfalls.\nThick snow cover lies on the region of Beldersay, on the slope of Kumbel Mountain on which the route is located, and it doesn't melt from December till April. Justifiably, Beldersay is considered to be a world class resort. Here, travelers can ski and snowboard as well as sun-bathe, thanks to the fact that there are more than 300 sunny days a year.\nUntil recently, a phenomenon of the Chimgan region had not been discovered - at a height of 1 meter off the thick snow cover the air temperature can reach +18OC!\nThe continental climate provides the extreme temperature and abundant snowfalls. Due to sharp temperature variations between day and night, a firm surface is formed that adds better glide and provides first class exciting skiing. When the slope has been smoothed out, it is only necessary to wait until a new snowfall and then there is an opportunity to ski on fresh soft powder.\nIn Beldersay there are two coffee-bars open for visitors, and the one that is located next to the rope tow that allows you the opportunity to purchase fast food and drink hot home-made wine during the skiing.\nThe distance to the nearest skiing center \" Chimgan \" is 4 km, and there you can go to a Disco club or go on a horse riding trip.\nBeldersay.

The entire length of the route is 3020 m. The route with the most extensive areas for skiing is considered a \"black\" (difficult route) and is divided into 3 skiing zones that can be conditionally divided into the upper routes from Kumbel Mountain (being served by the rope tow), lower route (being served by the chair-lift) and the extreme skiing zone to the left and right sides of Kumbel Mountain.\nUpper routes are not marked and are determined by the configuration of the peak itself. Basically, they are the \"black\" and \"red\" routes (6-7) but there are also 2-3 \"blue\" routes for beginners. The length of the routes is from 500 to 1200 m, though due to the huge size of the mountain there is a possibility for professionals oflonger traverses up to 2 - 3 km.\nThe lower route has a length of approx. 2,5 km. The entire route is \"red\", except for one small \"black\" area where the \"aces\" of \"red\" routes can descent sideways.\nThe Extreme zone is the area on each sides of Kumbel Mountain. Depending on the snow conditions these areas are very often buried by avalanches. In the last 18 years, 5 people have died due to prohibited skiing in the avalanche zone. That's why it is necessary to consult with the representative of the Rescue service regarding snow condition (an exception is the areas where caution signs or fence are installed).\nThe cost of single lift ticket:\nRope tow - 0,7 US$ for adult, 0,3 US$ for children;\nChair-lift - 2,7 US$ for adult, 1,3 US$ for children;\nSki Pass (per day) - 16,7 US$.\nTransfer: Tashkent - Beldersay - Tashkent\nCar Daewoo Nexia - 130 US$\nMinibus (Ssang Yong \"Istana\", Hyundai \"Starex 8-14 pax) - 200 US$\nTransfer: Charvak (hotel \" Charvak Oromgohi \") - Beldersay - Charvak\nCar (Niva) 25 US$ per day\nWe are thankful to\n"}], [{"score": 1211.2623, "uuid": "49c33b93-22d8-5690-b0ee-4dbf2a1840f8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-14-17744", "target_hostname": "www.sportsmatchmaker.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sportsmatchmaker.com/rules/s-sports/skiing.cfm", "page_rank": 1.1793793e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Skiing</em>", "snippet": "<em>Skiing</em> techniques are <em>difficult</em> to master, and accordingly there are ski schools that teach everything from the basics of turning and stopping safely to <em>more</em> advanced carving, racing, mogul <em>or</em> &quot;bump&quot; <em>skiing</em> and newer freestyle techniques.", "explanation": null, "document": "News\nSkiing\nSkiing (technically snow skiing) is the activity of gliding over snow using skis (originally wooden planks, now usually made from fiberglass or related composites) strapped to the feet with ski bindings. Originally used primarily for transportation, snow skiing evolved into a popular recreational and competitive activity during the 20th century. The sport consists of many variations, each of which fits into one of the major categories of alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, or telemark skiing.\nTypes of skiing\nSkiing is a pastime which has brought together all cultures of today. Many different types of skiing are popular, especially in colder climates, and many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Ski Federation (FIS), and other sporting organizations. Skiing is most visible to the public during the Winter Olympic Games where it is a major sport.\nIn skiing's traditional core regions in the snowy parts of Scandinavia, as well as in places such as Alaska, both recreational and competitive skiing is as likely to refer to the cross-country variants as to the internationally downhill variants.\nFor most people worldwide, the term \"skiing\" refers to alpine skiing where one visits a ski resort, purchases a lift ticket, dons cold-weather clothing, skis, ski boots and ski poles, and embarks on a chairlift, gondola lift, or other means of mechanical uphill transport. Upon reaching the summit, the skier disembarks from the ski lift and travels downhill, propelled by gravity, usually along a marked route known as a piste, \"run,\" \"trail,\" or \"slope\". Most ski resorts use mechanical equipment to \"groom,\" or pack down and smooth, the snow surface on certain ski trails. Grooming is normally associated with trails of lesser difficulty. Off-piste skiing includes skiing in unmarked or unpatrolled areas either within the ski resort's boundaries or in the backcountry, frequently amongst trees (\"glade skiing\"), usually in pursuit of fresh fallen snow, known as powder.\nSkiing or snowboarding outside a ski resort's boundaries, also known as out of bounds skiing, is illegal in some ski resorts, due to the danger of avalanches on the un-patrolled areas; or the cost of search-and-rescue for lost or overdue skiers. France and Canada are two of the few countries generally permitting this activity. In the United States, out of bounds skiing regulations vary by ski area; many ski resorts prohibit it and some simply post warning signs that skiers are leaving the patrolled ski area boundaries. However, lost or overdue backcountry travellers are usually held responsible for the cost of search-and-rescue service if uninsured. Backcountry skiers traveling in steep terrain prone to avalanches are encouraged to take avalanche training, travel with other experienced people, and carry special equipment for self-rescue. It is recommended that skiers make the local ski patrol aware of where they are going if they stray off-piste in case of avalanches or bad weather that could put skiers in danger.\nSkiing techniques are difficult to master, and accordingly there are ski schools that teach everything from the basics of turning and stopping safely to more advanced carving, racing, mogul or \"bump\" skiing and newer freestyle techniques. There are two primary types of downhill skiing -- \"telemark\" and \"alpine.\" Telemark skiers use flexible ski boots, either leather or plastic, and do not have their heels locked to the skis. Alpine skiers use stiffer plastic, non-flexible boots and have their heels locked to the skis with releaseable bindings. The venue, speed and technical difficulty associated with the sport can lead to collisions, accidents, hypothermia and other injury or illness, occasionally including death. Regional Ski Patrol organizations, such as the National Ski Patrol in the U.S., exist as a voluntary organization to provide guidance, help, medical assistance and emergency rescue to those in need of it.\nFor beginning skiers learning under a trained instructor, skiing speeds are low, the terrain is not steep and is often well-manicured, and the risks are relatively low. For extreme skiers, testing their expert abilities against ever more challenging terrain, the risks may be much higher.\nIn addition to its role in recreation and sport, skiing is also used as a means of transport by the military, and many armies train troops for ski warfare. Ski troops played a key role in retaining Finnish independence from Russia during the Winter War, and from Germany during the Lapland War, although the use of ski troops was recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The sport of Biathlon was developed from military skiing patrols.\nAnother type of skiing called Jib skiing or New freestyle is a new style of skiing that started in the late 1990s. In this type of skiing, skiers use jumps also called kickers,or rails to do urban style aerial tricks.\nSkiing for people with disabilities\nDownhill skiing for people with disabilities is both a recreational pastime and a competitive sport open to those with any manner of cognitive and/or physical disabilities. Adaptations include the use of outriggers, ski tip retention devices, sit-skis like monoskis and bi-skis, brightly colored guide bibs, ski guides, and inter-skier communication systems or audible clues for blind skiers. Recreational skiing programs for people with disabilities exist at mountains across the globe. In the northeastern United States, Maine Handicapped Skiing is one of the largest, operating at Sunday River ski resort, Other New England resorts with adaptive skiing programs include: Loon Mountain, Waterville Valley, and Mount Sunapee. In the western part of the United States, the National Sports Center for the Disabled at Winter Park Resort near Denver, Colorado attracts both first-timers and world-class disabled athletes from Europe, Asia, and North America. Currently the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Ski Federation (FIS) sanction a number of regional, national, and international disabled skiing events, most notably a World Cup circuit, a Disabled Alpine Skiing World Championships, and the Paralympic Winter Games. Skiing for people with disabilities became popular after World War II with the return of injured veterans.\nSnow and weather\nSkiers and snowboarders can encounter a wide range of snow and weather conditions, in part due to the location of specific resorts and global weather patterns at the time.\nNatural snow ranges in consistency from very light and fluffy to dense and heavy, depending upon atmospheric conditions as it falls. Snow is often measured by moisture content, or the amount of water in a given volume of snow. Some areas of the United States' Rocky Mountains, for example, can receive considerable amounts of snow with moisture content as low as three to five percent; in the Northeastern United States and the Alps, moisture content is more typically 15 percent or more. Snow made by mechanical snowmaking often has moisture content of 35 percent or more.\nTemperatures play a critical role in snow moisture content, but other atmospheric conditions are also relevant. Air currents and other factors determine snow crystal shape; obviously, the farther apart given snow crystals are, the more air is contained in the newly settled snow, resulting in lower net moisture content in a given volume of snow. Snow produced mechanically typically has high relative moisture content and low amounts of loft because the crystal structure resembles small, dense pellets.\nEven the fluffiest snow has mass, and snow typically settles under its own weight after time. This is one reason why untouched snow measuring 20 cm on the day it falls might be measured at 15 cm the day following. Snow is also subject to sublimation \u00f3 a process by which water can go directly from a frozen state to a gaseous state without first melting. It is this same process that ultimately makes ice cubes shrink in a freezer.\nThere are other factors that impact snow beyond its moisture content and crystal shape, however. Snow is impacted by wind, sunlight, skier traffic, ambient air temperature, relative humidity and grooming equipment; all of these factors combine to change snow crystal shape and density over time.\nThus, skiers and snowboarders typically encounter a wide range of snow conditions over the course of a season. Some of the more common conditions include:\nPowder: Light, fluffy snow, found during and immediately after snowfall. Skiing and snowboarding in deep powder snow is a favorite among skilled, experienced skiers and snowboarders; sometimes known as \"powderhounds.\" Because Western snow generally has a lower moisture content, western powder is lighter and easier to ski than heavier eastern powder. Utah snow is especially known for being extremely light and dry.\nPacked Powder: Packed Powder is powder snow that has been compressed, either by means of mechanical snow grooming apparatus or skier traffic. The term can also be used to describe snow that has been properly made with adequate control over snow-making apparatus. This snow condition is favored by beginners and the majority of recreational skiers, in that it tends to be relatively forgiving, easy to turn upon, and requires less skill to negotiate than powder snow.\nGranular snow: Granular snow crystals are small pellets. Depending on sun and temperature conditions, it may be wet granular snow \u00f3 meaning that there is a considerable amount of unfrozen water in it, or loose granular snow, which has no unfrozen water. Wet granular snow will form a snowball; loose granular snow will not. Wet granular conditions are often found in the springtime. Loose granular conditions are generally produced when wet granular snow has re-frozen and then been broken up by snowgrooming apparatus.\nCorn snow: Corn snow is the result of repeated daily thaws and nightly re-freezing of the surface. Because of the thaw-refreeze cycle, snow crystal shapes change over time, producing crystal shapes somewhat akin to wet granular, but larger. True corn snow is a delight to ski or ride.\nIce: skiers and snowboarders typically regard any snow condition that is very hard as \"ice.\" In fact, true ice conditions are comparatively rare. Much of what is perceived to be ice is actually a frozen granular condition \u00f3 wet granular snow that has refrozen to form a very dense surface. Telling the difference is comparatively easy; if one can get a ski pole to stand up in it, the surface is likely to be more of a frozen granular surface than an icy one \u00f3 and while it's certainly not as enjoyable as many other snow conditions, skilled skiers and snowboarders can successfully negotiate it. In fact, it's a preferred condition among racers, in that the surface tends to be quite fast and race course conditions tend to remain more consistent during the race, with fewer ruts developing on the course. Another form of icy condition can be found at higher elevation resorts in the Rocky Mountains and in Europe; direct sunlight can melt the top layers of snow crystals and subsequent freezing and produce a very shiny, slick surface.\nCrust: Crusts are extremely challenging conditions. A crust condition exists when soft snow is covered by a harder upper layer upon the surface. This crust can be created by freezing rain (precipitation formed in warmer upper levels of the atmosphere, falling into a temperature inversion at which surface temperatures are below freezing, and freezing on contact with the ground), by direct sunlight, and by wind loading which packs down the upper layers of the snowpack but leaves lower layers more or less unaffected.\nSpring Conditions: a catch-all term ski areas use to describe conditions when numerous different surface types can be found on the mountain \u00f3 usually in the later part of the season, although the term is sometimes used during an extended midwinter thaw. The term also generally reflects the presence of bare spots and/or areas of thin cover. With spring conditions, the snow is usually firm in early morning (even reaching frozen granular status if left ungroomed), breaking a softer corn or wet granular surface mid-day, and is often very soft and mushy in afternoon (many skiers refer to this type of snow condition as \"mashed potatoes,\" due to its heaviness). In some instances when the snow is untracked, sun baked, slightly dirty, with the consistency of a snow cone, it is called \"tecate powder.\" The speed with which conditions change on a given spring day is directly related to the exposure of the slope relative to the sun. East- and south-facing slopes tend to soften first; west-facing slopes generally soften by mid-day. North-facing slopes may hold on to their overnight snow conditions throughout the day.\nTrivia\n\"Skiing\" is one of the few words in the English language that contains two \"i\"s in a row.\nTypes of skiing\nAlpine skiing (also known as downhill skiing)\nBackcountry skiing (also known as off-piste skiing)\nBiathlon\nCross-country skiing (one style of Nordic skiing)\nArtificial Dry Ski Slope skiing\nDisabled alpine skiing\n"}, {"score": 1187.0858, "uuid": "d32b84bf-05e3-5472-aa1f-2d214623270f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1212wb-42-07492", "target_hostname": "www.mtnguide.net", "target_uri": "http://www.mtnguide.net/trips_courses/backcountry_skiing/", "page_rank": 1.2176405e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Backcountry <em>Skiing</em> and <em>Snowboarding</em> in Durango Silverton San Juan Mountains", "snippet": "There <em>is</em> little doubt that interest in the sport of backcountry <em>skiing</em> has grow appreciably in recent years.

Originally used primarily for transportation, snow skiing evolved into a popular recreational and competitive activity during the 20th century. The sport consists of many variations, each of which fits into one of the major categories of alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, or telemark skiing.\nTypes of skiing\nSkiing is a pastime which has brought together all cultures of today. Many different types of skiing are popular, especially in colder climates, and many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Ski Federation (FIS), and other sporting organizations. Skiing is most visible to the public during the Winter Olympic Games where it is a major sport.\nIn skiing's traditional core regions in the snowy parts of Scandinavia, as well as in places such as Alaska, both recreational and competitive skiing is as likely to refer to the cross-country variants as to the internationally downhill variants.\nFor most people worldwide, the term \"skiing\" refers to alpine skiing where one visits a ski resort, purchases a lift ticket, dons cold-weather clothing, skis, ski boots and ski poles, and embarks on a chairlift, gondola lift, or other means of mechanical uphill transport. Upon reaching the summit, the skier disembarks from the ski lift and travels downhill, propelled by gravity, usually along a marked route known as a piste, \"run,\" \"trail,\" or \"slope\". Most ski resorts use mechanical equipment to \"groom,\" or pack down and smooth, the snow surface on certain ski trails. Grooming is normally associated with trails of lesser difficulty. Off-piste skiing includes skiing in unmarked or unpatrolled areas either within the ski resort's boundaries or in the backcountry, frequently amongst trees (\"glade skiing\"), usually in pursuit of fresh fallen snow, known as powder.\nSkiing or snowboarding outside a ski resort's boundaries, also known as out of bounds skiing, is illegal in some ski resorts, due to the danger of avalanches on the un-patrolled areas; or the cost of search-and-rescue for lost or overdue skiers. France and Canada are two of the few countries generally permitting this activity. In the United States, out of bounds skiing regulations vary by ski area; many ski resorts prohibit it and some simply post warning signs that skiers are leaving the patrolled ski area boundaries. However, lost or overdue backcountry travellers are usually held responsible for the cost of search-and-rescue service if uninsured. Backcountry skiers traveling in steep terrain prone to avalanches are encouraged to take avalanche training, travel with other experienced people, and carry special equipment for self-rescue. It is recommended that skiers make the local ski patrol aware of where they are going if they stray off-piste in case of avalanches or bad weather that could put skiers in danger.\nSkiing techniques are difficult to master, and accordingly there are ski schools that teach everything from the basics of turning and stopping safely to more advanced carving, racing, mogul or \"bump\" skiing and newer freestyle techniques. There are two primary types of downhill skiing -- \"telemark\" and \"alpine.\" Telemark skiers use flexible ski boots, either leather or plastic, and do not have their heels locked to the skis. Alpine skiers use stiffer plastic, non-flexible boots and have their heels locked to the skis with releaseable bindings. The venue, speed and technical difficulty associated with the sport can lead to collisions, accidents, hypothermia and other injury or illness, occasionally including death. Regional Ski Patrol organizations, such as the National Ski Patrol in the U.S., exist as a voluntary organization to provide guidance, help, medical assistance and emergency rescue to those in need of it.\nFor beginning skiers learning under a trained instructor, skiing speeds are low, the terrain is not steep and is often well-manicured, and the risks are relatively low. For extreme skiers, testing their expert abilities against ever more challenging terrain, the risks may be much higher.\nIn addition to its role in recreation and sport, skiing is also used as a means of transport by the military, and many armies train troops for ski warfare. Ski troops played a key role in retaining Finnish independence from Russia during the Winter War, and from Germany during the Lapland War, although the use of ski troops was recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The sport of Biathlon was developed from military skiing patrols.\nAnother type of skiing called Jib skiing or New freestyle is a new style of skiing that started in the late 1990s. In this type of skiing, skiers use jumps also called kickers,or rails to do urban style aerial tricks.\nSkiing for people with disabilities\nDownhill skiing for people with disabilities is both a recreational pastime and a competitive sport open to those with any manner of cognitive and/or physical disabilities. Adaptations include the use of outriggers, ski tip retention devices, sit-skis like monoskis and bi-skis, brightly colored guide bibs, ski guides, and inter-skier communication systems or audible clues for blind skiers. Recreational skiing programs for people with disabilities exist at mountains across the globe. In the northeastern United States, Maine Handicapped Skiing is one of the largest, operating at Sunday River ski resort, Other New England resorts with adaptive skiing programs include: Loon Mountain, Waterville Valley, and Mount Sunapee. In the western part of the United States, the National Sports Center for the Disabled at Winter Park Resort near Denver, Colorado attracts both first-timers and world-class disabled athletes from Europe, Asia, and North America. Currently the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Ski Federation (FIS) sanction a number of regional, national, and international disabled skiing events, most notably a World Cup circuit, a Disabled Alpine Skiing World Championships, and the Paralympic Winter Games. Skiing for people with disabilities became popular after World War II with the return of injured veterans.\nSnow and weather\nSkiers and snowboarders can encounter a wide range of snow and weather conditions, in part due to the location of specific resorts and global weather patterns at the time.\nNatural snow ranges in consistency from very light and fluffy to dense and heavy, depending upon atmospheric conditions as it falls. Snow is often measured by moisture content, or the amount of water in a given volume of snow. Some areas of the United States' Rocky Mountains, for example, can receive considerable amounts of snow with moisture content as low as three to five percent; in the Northeastern United States and the Alps, moisture content is more typically 15 percent or more. Snow made by mechanical snowmaking often has moisture content of 35 percent or more.\nTemperatures play a critical role in snow moisture content, but other atmospheric conditions are also relevant. Air currents and other factors determine snow crystal shape; obviously, the farther apart given snow crystals are, the more air is contained in the newly settled snow, resulting in lower net moisture content in a given volume of snow. Snow produced mechanically typically has high relative moisture content and low amounts of loft because the crystal structure resembles small, dense pellets.\nEven the fluffiest snow has mass, and snow typically settles under its own weight after time. This is one reason why untouched snow measuring 20 cm on the day it falls might be measured at 15 cm the day following. Snow is also subject to sublimation \u00f3 a process by which water can go directly from a frozen state to a gaseous state without first melting. It is this same process that ultimately makes ice cubes shrink in a freezer.\nThere are other factors that impact snow beyond its moisture content and crystal shape, however. Snow is impacted by wind, sunlight, skier traffic, ambient air temperature, relative humidity and grooming equipment; all of these factors combine to change snow crystal shape and density over time.\nThus, skiers and snowboarders typically encounter a wide range of snow conditions over the course of a season. Some of the more common conditions include:\nPowder: Light, fluffy snow, found during and immediately after snowfall. Skiing and snowboarding in deep powder snow is a favorite among skilled, experienced skiers and snowboarders; sometimes known as \"powderhounds.\" Because Western snow generally has a lower moisture content, western powder is lighter and easier to ski than heavier eastern powder. Utah snow is especially known for being extremely light and dry.\nPacked Powder: Packed Powder is powder snow that has been compressed, either by means of mechanical snow grooming apparatus or skier traffic. The term can also be used to describe snow that has been properly made with adequate control over snow-making apparatus. This snow condition is favored by beginners and the majority of recreational skiers, in that it tends to be relatively forgiving, easy to turn upon, and requires less skill to negotiate than powder snow.\nGranular snow: Granular snow crystals are small pellets. Depending on sun and temperature conditions, it may be wet granular snow \u00f3 meaning that there is a considerable amount of unfrozen water in it, or loose granular snow, which has no unfrozen water. Wet granular snow will form a snowball; loose granular snow will not. Wet granular conditions are often found in the springtime. Loose granular conditions are generally produced when wet granular snow has re-frozen and then been broken up by snowgrooming apparatus.\nCorn snow: Corn snow is the result of repeated daily thaws and nightly re-freezing of the surface. Because of the thaw-refreeze cycle, snow crystal shapes change over time, producing crystal shapes somewhat akin to wet granular, but larger. True corn snow is a delight to ski or ride.\nIce: skiers and snowboarders typically regard any snow condition that is very hard as \"ice.\" In fact, true ice conditions are comparatively rare. Much of what is perceived to be ice is actually a frozen granular condition \u00f3 wet granular snow that has refrozen to form a very dense surface. Telling the difference is comparatively easy; if one can get a ski pole to stand up in it, the surface is likely to be more of a frozen granular surface than an icy one \u00f3 and while it's certainly not as enjoyable as many other snow conditions, skilled skiers and snowboarders can successfully negotiate it. In fact, it's a preferred condition among racers, in that the surface tends to be quite fast and race course conditions tend to remain more consistent during the race, with fewer ruts developing on the course. Another form of icy condition can be found at higher elevation resorts in the Rocky Mountains and in Europe; direct sunlight can melt the top layers of snow crystals and subsequent freezing and produce a very shiny, slick surface.\nCrust: Crusts are extremely challenging conditions. A crust condition exists when soft snow is covered by a harder upper layer upon the surface. This crust can be created by freezing rain (precipitation formed in warmer upper levels of the atmosphere, falling into a temperature inversion at which surface temperatures are below freezing, and freezing on contact with the ground), by direct sunlight, and by wind loading which packs down the upper layers of the snowpack but leaves lower layers more or less unaffected.\nSpring Conditions: a catch-all term ski areas use to describe conditions when numerous different surface types can be found on the mountain \u00f3 usually in the later part of the season, although the term is sometimes used during an extended midwinter thaw. The term also generally reflects the presence of bare spots and/or areas of thin cover. With spring conditions, the snow is usually firm in early morning (even reaching frozen granular status if left ungroomed), breaking a softer corn or wet granular surface mid-day, and is often very soft and mushy in afternoon (many skiers refer to this type of snow condition as \"mashed potatoes,\" due to its heaviness). In some instances when the snow is untracked, sun baked, slightly dirty, with the consistency of a snow cone, it is called \"tecate powder.\" The speed with which conditions change on a given spring day is directly related to the exposure of the slope relative to the sun. East- and south-facing slopes tend to soften first; west-facing slopes generally soften by mid-day. North-facing slopes may hold on to their overnight snow conditions throughout the day.\nTrivia\n\"Skiing\" is one of the few words in the English language that contains two \"i\"s in a row.\nTypes of skiing\nAlpine skiing (also known as downhill skiing)\nBackcountry skiing (also known as off-piste skiing)\nBiathlon\nCross-country skiing (one style of Nordic skiing)\nArtificial Dry Ski Slope skiing\nDisabled alpine skiing\n"}, {"score": 1053.9822, "uuid": "45bc9ff0-d454-544b-83fa-10da0d9461c1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-72-14488", "target_hostname": "www.heliskidirectory.com", "target_uri": "http://www.heliskidirectory.com/heli%20skiing%20blog/", "page_rank": 1.7761962e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Heliskiing | Heli <em>Skiing</em> | Canada", "snippet": "Lift off <em>is</em> approximately 10.00am.

At least that's the opinion of the reviewer, a whitebread middle-aged guy who is blissfully ignorant of nearly everything dealing with MTV, indie rock, and hip-hop. He has been known to take a glass of wine with dinner or a pint of stout during an evening among friends, but can't imagine that drinking until dawn and then puking on the chairlift the next morning is any fun.\nHe's also a cruiser rather than a cliff-dropper, and is taking his time in trying out the halfpipe. He does not think that sports injuries are cool or a badge of honor, but he does appreciate the poetry of a well-executed turn, jump, or landing. Keep these things in mind, reader, as they color the reviews below. Though he enjoys riding, our reviewer bristles at the thought that snowboarding is a \"lifestyle,\" reserving that term for other matters such as faith and family.\nYour mileage may vary; adjust your TV set accordingly.\nPricey and Classy\nWe start out with a high-gloss, high-price production, Frequency: The Snowboarder's Journal , It's on the expensive side; subscriptions go for $40 (4 issues a year), and a newsstand copy will set you back $13. But take consolation in this: high price means less advertising clutter. The magazine has 110 pages available, but use only 10 or so for advertisements. The high price is likely the reason why there is little content on the magazine's web site; no use giving away the store.\nFrequency emphasizes big mountain riding, including back country terrain suitable only for advanced or even expert riders. In a typical issue, it includes an interview with or profile of a professional rider, and a story about riding somewhere outside the U.S. Most importantly, it features full-page photos, on heavy paper stock, of spectacular scenery and riders enjoying untracked powder. You don't have to be able to ride on that terrain to appreciate the eye candy.\nSubscriptions also come with a DVD, so you can enjoy more visual treats. One downside to the magazine: like others in the trade, it uses very small fonts. Maybe that's a clue to pay more attention to the photos.\nThe Snowboard Journal used to fill this market space as well, but it ceased publication after only few years.\nFair to Middlin'\nFuture Snowboarding\n[NOTE: Future Snowboarding ceased publication in June, 2008; the the review below is from 2006 or 2007.]\nFuture Snowboarding made its debut with the November 2005 issue. It suffers from some of the design problems that plague other snowboarding magazines, namely, a difficult-to-read color combination of fonts and background, along with tiny typefaces. Do you get the impression that snowboarders aren't much interested in reading? The magazine indulges a fair amount of vulgarity, though not as much as TransWorld Snowboarding, while sharing much of its attitude. In his inaugural letter to readers, for example, the editor muses that snowboarding requires a \"recessive gene that starts humming as soon as you point your carcass down a hill.\" To which we say: nonsense! To begin with, humans don't have carcasses, thank you very much, and some of us snowboarders don't appreciate the \"recessive\" comment.\nOh yes, there's also a one-page review of some indie music. The \"lifestyle\" folly appears once again. Can we instead get some letters-to-the-editor? Gear review? Something actually related to riding?\nFuture Snowboarding does have a useful Q&A section as well as a collection of readers' tips, and factoids about snowboarding. The first issue contains a review of boards, including women-specific boards. A photo gallery provides a tie-in to the web site, with a \"vote for your favorite photo\" feature. A review of Whistler contains a fold-out trail map, and a \"best of\" list, that includes--cue up the stereotypes--\"Best place to eat breakfast with a hangover.\" If that's your thing, it will be useful to know.\nThe charter issue came with a DVD. The disk has better resolution on the computer than on a regular DVD player/TV combination. It also contains computer wallpaper and links to web sites, neither of which will do any good on a TV-top DVD player. The features of the disk could be better arranged, but it's a start. Published bimonthly, Future Snowboarding is available for subscription at a rate of $12 per year, the news stand price of one copy of the two previously reviewed magazines.\nSnowboarder\nSnowboarder is dominated by freestyle and hardcore snowboarders. How hardcore? Consider this: One of its features is \"Battle Wounds,\" in which readers submit stories of injuries suffered, usually while performing tricks in the terrain park. Black-and-blue photos are included.\nStill, Snowboarder gets some credit. A recent issue featured a letter from a 56-year old rider, and a list of 22 notable riders who are \"Over 30 but not over the hill.\" The DVD that came with the issue used for review purposes had many freestyle tricks worth a look, for admiration if not inspiration. On the graphic design front, the web site may be more readable than the print edition, which is not a great testimony to the magazine.\nBy the way, the magazine's name is snowboarder, but its web site is snowboardermag.com. Enter snowboarder-dot-com, and you get taken to a spammish web site. [October 2009: Now you get taken to Snow on Grind TV , a great improvement.]\nSnowboard\nSimply titled Snowboard, and subtitled \"Products, Places, and Personalities,\" this bimonthly magazine has good photos but microscopic text. It also favors odd color combinations, such as light sage type on a white background. What were they thinking? Tricks get heavy play here, but there's also room for big mountain riding.\nThe copy reviewed for this site included one article authored by a man who concludes that snowboarding is his life (yawn). On the other side of the maturity divide, a second article was penned by someone who has come to peace with the fact that he can't ride 100 days a season anymore. There's also a photo spread of various gear and clothing; since the credits are obscured, one must conclude that the feature is meant to be eye candy rather than informational. There are a few interviews of pro riders, who talk about the boards they have designed. Unfortunately, the interviews come and go without leaving much of a trace. On the other hand, the magazine does have some impressive photos of backcountry riders.\nYou can get a subscription for about $10, but be prepared for a lot of ads.\nNote that its web site is snowboard-mag.com, not snowboard.com.\nIf you like MTV\nTransWorld Snowboarding\nA magazine that seems to go out of its way to reinforce the popular stereotypes of snowboarders, TWS makes liberal use of vulgarity, profanity, and crude and juvenile humor. To be fair, these elements, especially crude language, are not absent in the other magazines reviewed here. But TWS seems to use them more than the others do.\nOlder \"out of it\" adults may wish to keep a dictionary of hip-hop words on hand. With its references to \"your parents\" and \"your grandparents,\" TWS pitches itself as a \"no adults allowed\" club. That might be just as well; older eyes strain at the extra-small types used in some of the articles, as well as the white text laid out on red backgrounds.\nSnowboarding history is filled with anxiety over \"selling out,\" or what the rest of the world calls \"growing up and getting a job.\" TWS pays tribute to that ethic, though it should be noted that the periodical is published by a giant corporation (Bonner) with nearly $3 billion in annual revenue. In other words, it is owned by \"the man.\"\nHere's a clue, folks: snowboarding can happily exist as a participant sport, a spectator sport, and a business. The mountain's big enough for everyone to find a place.\nWhile TWS has elements that the grown-up reader may find tiresome, it does have a handful of useful articles. A recent edition, for example, featured stories about gear and techniques, as well as a preview of the 2006 Olympics.

Meet members of McMaster University\u2019s Solar Car Project team with one of their solar racing cars; hang out with Animal Ambassadors from the Earth Rangers team; listen to your favourite tunes powered entirely by solar energy through the Collus Renewable Energy Trailer; test out your power on the bicycle and hand-crank generators with Elephant Thoughts; and write, paint or draw on our Keep Winter Cool art mural. Representatives from the Environment Network, Bullfrog Power, Free Spirit Gardens, and the Town of Blue Mountains will also be on site so our guests can learn more about how to Keep Winter Cool!\nIn addition, a special screening of the\u00a0 highly acclaimed ski film All.I.Can will take place that evening at the Blue Mountain Inn.\u00a0 The movie is the winner of the best feature-length mountain film at the 2011 Banff Film Festival and is the first of its kind to integrate discussion on climate change and sustainability into a ski film. Shot on six continents over two years, the world\u2019s best skiers deliver inspirational performances while ground-breaking cinematography expands our vision of the natural world.\nI will be on hand to speak briefly before the screening of the film and will also act as MC.\u00a0 Tickets for the event are only $10 and all proceeds from the event will be donated to The Environment Network , a local charitable group which suppies funding to a variety of local environmental initiatives.\u00a0 The event begins at 8PM and tickets will be available at the Blue Mountain Inn, all Blue Mountain Guest Services locations and the offices of the Environment Network in downtown Collingwood.\nThrough events like this, one hopes that those passionate about winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding will find the personal motivation within themselves to become more active in our collective fight to stop man made climate change.\u00a0 The day long event promises to be both enjoyable and informative and a great way to spend part of the March Break.\nI\u2019d encourage everyone with the ability to attend to join me at Blue Mountain on March 15th and I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you there!\nTags: All.I.Can , Blue Mountain Resort , Climate Change and Skiing , Enviro Dad , Keep Winter Cool Event , Sherpa's Cinema\nAbout Eric Novak\nEric Novak is a father of 4 who also thinks that environmental stewardship is a requisite of parenting.

Skiing, which is now an international sport, was originally invented during the early 19th century by Sondre Norheim. Over the years, skiing's popularity has grown, and has even spawned other activities such as the slalom jump and snowboarding.\nIf you ever get the chance to travel to Europe, then you should consider spending some time in Austria. Austria is a country that is surrounded by the Alps and has some of the best ski resorts in the world. There are two places in Austria that are known for skiing.\nThe first place is St. Anton, which is located in the Arlberg region. You can do a number of different things here but it is mostly known for its school that teaches beginners how to ski. The Arlberg School has over 300 ski instructors that speak a number of different languages that can teach a beginner how to ski like a pro in just a few days.\nThe second place is Kitzbuhel, which has existed for over 700 years. Those who are not interested in skiing can go into town and go shopping, while those who do want to ski can take one of more than 50 lifts to get to the top of the mountain.\nMuch like baseball in the United States, skiing is considered to be the national past time in Austria. This is one of the main reasons why Austrians finish in the top positions at the Winter Olympics and the World Championships on a regular basis. If you ever get the opportunity to visit Austria, then aside from skiing, one event you should definitely check out is the annual reindeer sled race. It's not the Tour de France but it draws large crowds every year.\nSome people think that learning how to ski is very difficult. But as long as you keep an open mind and learn from the instructors who make a living off of teaching people how to ski, then it is not impossible.

It's a pro-level, single-track course, where enthusiasts compete only against their own times, and not other skiers. Deer Valley's Ski School has been using the Skier Cross course frequently for intermediate and above-level classes, particularly the youth Adventure groups ages 8 to 12. Deer Valley's Skier Cross course is open seven days a week, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The cost is $3 per run, and tickets can be purchased at the race course start in the timing building.

It has 14 pistes in total with pretty much something for everybody (including night skiing), though if you're looking for the difficult stuff, you might want to concentrate on the Qstrebets section, where a number of World Cup competitions have been held.\nThere's a reasonable selection of on-mountain accommodation - some 'old' Bulgaria, some a little more modern. The nosh is cheap and the drinks are even cheaper, which means you'll have plenty of energy for the slopes, but almost certainly be nursing a sore head on the first lift up. Oh well ...\nOf the three, Bansko is the least authentic Bulgarian ski resort.

The patriarch, Dorian \"Doc\" Paskowitz, began life on a commendable, even enviable course, with an M.D. under his arm, rippling sandy-haired good looks, and experience almost single-handedly teaching the country of Israel how to surf. But in the years to follow, bitterness and inveterate disappointment ensued as Dr. Paskowitz tried to settle into a conventional existence. Two broken marriages and a medical career that Dorian would later describe as \"miserable\" left him clawing his way out, desperate for an \"alternative\" lifestyle. He soon met, courted, and married his third wife, a ravishing, sexy young woman named Juliette; these two free spirits jointly decided that they would live life, budding family in-tow, on the open road, in a series of low-budget trailers. As one child after another cropped up over the course of a decade, the family toured the country winning one surfing competition after another, and Dr. Paskowitz accepted low-rent medical jobs for the poor that reeled in little to no income.\nIn theory, this all seemed idealistic, even utopian; in reality, Dorian Paskowitz was reportedly a severe disciplinarian who denied his children the benefits of school and financial security, forced everyone to stick to an almost unbearable diet of a gruel-like substance, and -- even more alarmingly -- felt comfortable having open and noisy sex with his wife, with the children only a few feet away. In time, as one child after another grew up, left the clan, and attempted to survive, they found it difficult, if not impossible to function in the day-to-day world without the education, social skills, and monetary know-how that so many young adults take for granted. With his documentary Surfwise, filmmaker Doug Pray tells the Paskowitzes' strange, bewildering, and ultimately heartbreaking story via incisive interviews with family members, still photographs, and telling archival footage. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi\n"}, {"score": 978.89435, "uuid": "84e094c2-c6f0-5e5a-8dc0-12794821d4e2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0802wb-00-15939", "target_hostname": "www.dcski.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dcski.com/articles/view_article.php?article_id=1323&mode=headlines", "page_rank": 1.194601e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Firsthand Report from Liberty Mountain: <em>Skiing</em> <em>is</em> Therapeutic!", "snippet": "At Seven Springs, you&#x27;ll find a mountain of fun - <em>skiing</em>, <em>snowboarding</em>, snow tubing, snowmobiling, snowshoe tours, a luxurious spa, sporting clays, delicious dining, nightlife and <em>more</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Firsthand Report from Liberty Mountain: Skiing is Therapeutic!\nBy Connie Lawn, DCSki Columnist\nJanuary 8, 2012 \u2014 The sun shone, the weather was warm, many trails were snow covered, and I conquered my demons. Nine months after breaking my hip, and two years after I was diagnosed with Parkinson disease, I was delighted to learn I could still ski. More about that in a moment.\nFirst of all, Pennsylvania\u2019s Liberty Mountain has done an incredible job creating snow and grooming the mountains. Despite the late start to the season, experts worked their magic and made more than enough snow for skiing and snowboarding. That is quite a feat with weather in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. It looked as though a thousand people or more took to the slopes on Saturday, January 7, 2012. It was a dramatic contrast to the golf course next to the slopes, and the brown fields and farmlands beyond. I don\u2019t know what the future will bring, but this weekend was glorious. And this is a time when there is a general lack of snow in resorts all over this country and Europe.\nNow, going back to my experience. My greatest fear was being able to walk and ski in my heavy boots and skis. I was completely dependent on my husband Charles Sneiderman to carry the equipment and help me get the heavy boots on and off (I make no secret of my disdain for today\u2019s heavy, difficult boots \u0096 they are doing their part to ruin the sport and drive more people to snowboarding!). But once I was on the slopes, I felt like the young girl who danced down the mountains fifty years ago. My trembling and pain disappeared \u0096 it was magic.\nI owe a special thanks to a New Zealand company that helped me keep my hip intact. A company called Impactwear.com sent me plastic pads that slip into the pockets of special under pants. It is billed as \u201cprotection against fall related hip fractures in the elderly.\u201d It worked! I took one fall and hit exactly the spot I had broken last Mach. I honestly did not feel a thing. Of course, I could not get up without the help of Charles and my friends, but that is another story. I have real issues with getting up from the snow. Guess I am meant to just stay there and enjoy it.\nAdaptive volunteers at Liberty Mountain. Photo provided by Charles Sneiderman.\nThis year will be a different ski experience in many ways. Charles and I signed up to volunteer with the excellent group that teaches disabled, or adaptive skiers. At Liberty it is called BRASS, or Blue Ridge Adaptive Snow Sports. It is organized and directed by two wonderful couples \u0096 Leslie and Dick White, and Trippie and Tom Penland. Leslie was the founder, and gave our group of volunteers a fascinating opening training session. Then my long-time friend Trippie took us up in the mountain and gave us training on the varied and intricate type of equipment used by the many disabled skiers and wounded warriors. We will have more detail on that as the season progresses. Charles and I will never be instructors \u0096 that takes years of training, dedication, and skill. But, it will be enough if we can assist the instructors and the students. In the process, they help us too.\nBy the way, many ski areas now have programs to help adaptive sports people and wounded warriors. They all need private donations to keep the costs of the programs low. In some cases, they are free to the participants. To contact BRASS and help out, email info@brassski.org. Now, get off the computer and get out and enjoy the slopes!\nRelated Links:\n"}, {"score": 976.5186, "uuid": "d4e527f2-1d19-59a2-9a2f-d793e2770f1a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-58-27240", "target_hostname": "adventuretravel.about.com", "target_uri": "http://adventuretravel.about.com/od/skiingandsnowboarding/a/Whistler_Extrem.htm", "page_rank": 1.2314711e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Inbounds Extreme <em>Skiing</em> at Whistler Blackcomb - Find Extreme <em>Skiing</em> at", "snippet": "If you\u2019re not sure what backcountry <em>skiing</em> <em>is</em> outside ski resort ropes, visit What <em>is</em> Backcountry <em>Skiing</em> and <em>Snowboarding</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Inbounds Extreme Skiing at Whistler Blackcomb\nA Canadian Guide's Advice on Extreme Skiing at Whistler Blackcomb, Canada\nBy Lois Friedland ,\u00a0About.com Guide\nSee More About:\nExtreme skiing at Whistler Blackcomb, Canada\nPaul Morrison\nWhistler Blackcomb not only has some of the longest vertical in North America, it also has a lot of the most challenging terrain at ski resorts on this continent.

Stay right at the bottom to head to Shale Slope. This is the glory line on a powder morning as the entire run is visible by the snow hungry mob waiting at the bottom. Or for a more soulful experience veer left at the bottom of Whistler Bowl and head into the steep, open glades of Doom and Gloom. This area is perfect for expert skiers looking to pound long vertical with sustained steep sections and pillows galore.\n\"Next run, go straight from the top of the peak chair and follow Frontier Pass to the Wide open spaces of West Bowl. The entire bowl is rated double black and there are multiple options for entry. Stefan's Chute at the skiers left, all the way up to Mondays on the skiers right. Be very careful where you drop in, some of the entries involve mandatory air, and you never know whose tracks you're following!\"\nDerek\u2019s Take on Blackcomb Mountain: Spanky's Ladder\n\"Spanky's is the heart and soul of Blackcomb's steep skiing scene. One little two minute hike accesses more terrain than most other resorts can dream of. The area is split into Ruby Bowl at the far left, Diamond Bowl straight down from the top of the bootpack, and Saphire Bowl to the skiers right.\n\"Ruby is the easiest, with a low shoulder \"Roll In\" entry. Diamond is the most difficult to navigate through. It feels more like European skiing than anywhere else in North America. More of a maze than a bowl. Saphire Bowl offers up the most challenging lines with a mandatory straightline to enter. This is not easy to find, and very easy to get cliffed out while searching.

Just check out the Snowlife events diary .\nThe main snowboard competition circuit in the UK is the British Snow Tour . To take part you'll need to register, visit the British Snow Tour website .\nThere is a full half\u2013pipe at the Sheffield Ski Village. It plays host to a number of competitions, and is perfect for practising moves before heading into a real snow half pipe. Sheffield also has the National Aerials Water Ramp. Although it was designed for freestyle skiing, the ramp was instantly adopted by the snowboard big air specialists.\nFor more information on the UK snowboarding visit the Soulsports website and the Snowboard Club UK .\nInternational competitions\nThe International competition circuit is made up of independent events in various disciplines and an established World Cup Series run by FIS (International Ski Federation).\nFIS is the governing body for skiing, and started to run World Cup snowboard competitions in 1995. It was also responsible for getting snowboarding into the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. British half pipe star Lesley McKenna made history in 2002 in Salt Lake City as the first British snowboarder to compete in the Winter Olympics.\nTo compete on the FIS tour you must have a FIS Licence, which is issued by Snowsport GB. To move to the international stage you need to be performing to a very high level at national competitions. An international licence gives access to open and then European events. World Cup events have entry restrictions and are usually for British Team members only (FIS).\nIndependent international competitions such as Air and Style, Verbier Ride, Bomb comp and Cham Jam are open events held in Europe for both the pros and aspiring rider alike. The Snowlife events diary has dates and website links to European events happening this year.\nParallel Slalom and Giant Slalom\nThink fast. Very fast. Competitors race down a course of tightly set control gates against the clock. As well as Slalom, competitors can also compete in giant slalom (control gates set wider apart), parallel slalom (two riders race head to head on identical courses set beside each other) and parallel giant slalom.\nBoardercross (Olympic discipline)\nThis is where competition gets gladiatorial (although deliberate bodily contact is a strict no-no). Groups of four or six riders start together and descend a specially built course which mix up banked turns, jumps, waves and other variations in the terrain. First across the line wins and moves on to the next round.\nLet the best boarder win.\nHalf Pipe (Olympic discipline)\nThe pipe is the ultimate playground for tricks on a snowboard. The snowboard half pipe involves riding from wall to wall in a pipe around 110 metres long, 15 metres wide The average gradient is 17 degrees, and the walls around four metres high.\nRiders take off and perform a huge range of manoeuvres. Some are borrowed from other sports such as skateboarding, while others are exclusive to snowboarding. Riders take to the pipe one at a time, with judges marking on degree of difficulty and execution.\nBig Air\nThe title says it all. Take a big jump. Add a good run in, landing zone and plenty of music. Go for it. The moves get wilder every year, as the impossible becomes the humdrum. Inverted manoeuvres with ever more difficult combinations of twists, rolls, hand grabs, reverse landings and spins provide great entertainment. Judges award points for the degree of difficulty and the execution.\nSlopestyle\nThe rider performs a variation of tricks back to back over a course of obstacles including jumps, halfpipe, hips, rails and fun boxes.\nSnowlife is an initiative of the Snowsport Foundation and is supported by Snowsport Industries of Great Britain (SIGB).

We discussed ways to prepare for your first day on the slopes, including how to get into shape, and what clothing you should wear to keep you warm and dry. We talked about what you can expect when you arrive at the ski resort, weighed the options for choosing your equipment, and we touched on the fundamentals of skiing. Now, it's time to strap on your skis and hit the slopes.\nSkiing basics\nComic-genius Stephen Wright used to joke, \"You know that feeling when you're leaning back in your chair, and you lean too far back, and you almost fall over backwards, but then you catch yourself at the last second? I feel like that all the time...\" Once you are actually standing in the snow, with the skis attached to your feet, you'll be feeling like that all the time. When you first realize that you can't hold your balance the way you normally could, this is the moment where terror strikes, and everything you were taught about skiing tends to go out the window. But take heart, and remember these tips about navigating on skis.\nGetting Around on Skis\nHow are you supposed to get around with these things on your feet? Walking forward is just one foot in front of the other, you'll just be taking bigger steps. If you opted for ski poles, they will help you to keep steady.\nBut, what happens when you're trying to get up a small slope, which you're probably going to do very early on? Well, you can try taking \"Herring Bone\" steps. This is when you point your skis out at an angle, separating the front of your skis, and forming like a \"V-shape,\" while pressing the edges down into the snow a little bit to get some grip, and trying not to step on your own skis. For sharper inclines, you might have to do a side step. Turn to the side, perpendicular to the slope; move your first ski up, get a good grip, and then bring your other ski up next to it.\nComing to a Stop\nUsually, the first question on every beginner's mind is \"How do you stop?\" For the absolute beginners, the best way to stop is usually to simply fall down. For example, if you start down the slope for the first time, and you start picking up speed, don't panic and lock up. Just bend your knees, and drop gently to the ground.\nWhen you are finally able to push off and glide along the snow for the first time, you will quickly have to learn to stop. The basic way for all beginners is usually a \"snowplow,\" also called a \"wedge\", and sometimes younger kids call that a \"pizza.\" What's happening here is, you're going to bring the tips of your skis together in a sort of upside down-V, opposite of what you did for the Herring Bone. This is where you want to keep your legs strong, because you don't want your skis to cross and overlap each other. You're pushing against the snow to slow down, so you're also going to apply pressure to the outside edge of your skis, enhancing that snowplow effect. You can apply this method more gently if you just want to slow down a little bit. Now, while you're learning to do this basic snowplow, it's also interesting to know that this is one of the simplest ways to turn.\nTurning\nLet's say you're going down a gentle slope, and you decide you're going to snowplow to slow yourself down. While you're snowplowing, put a little extra lean on your left leg, applying pressure down onto the inner-edge of the ski. You'll find yourself gliding a little more towards the right. Naturally, if you apply a little more to your right ski, you'll find yourself gliding towards the left. Suddenly, you realize that you've just learned how to make a turn. It's literally as simple as that. Of course, this is only the beginning.\nBy watching the more experienced skiers going left and right down a steep slope, you'll soon realize that the snowplow is only going to get you so far for so long. Keep this in mind, as you watch those advanced skiers come down the slope; put simply, they are simply using a more exaggerated method of the principle we just talked about.\nFor example, they're coming down harder and faster. So whereas we just applied a little bit of pressure to one ski to slow down and turn, they're going to have to apply a lot more pressure. To make that left turn, they're going to have to throw all their weight down onto the right ski; in fact, they will have to lift up that left ski, and throw both skis down so they are traveling in the same direction. This is why skiier must keep thier legs bent and stay flexible, because they need to be ready to give a little bounce when they want to change course. This is also when you will be happy you did some strength training in your legs. This action of shifting your balance and throwing your weight on different skis, is the way you slow your body down, and change course. Essentially, that's what skiing is. It's the art of slowing yourself and changing direction, to easily navigate the slope.\nThis is, of course, completely counterintuitive to a beginner's first instinct to throw down the skis, pointing towards the bottom of the slope, and just go forward. You're going to be in a constant state of motion where you're changing directions and slowing yourself down periodically. It's very rare that you see a skier just pointing straight down the mountain. Even when you see an advanced skier doing that, he's never going faster than he can control. He knows that he needs to slow himself down. He might go forward for a little while, then apply pressure to his skis to change direction and slow himself back down.\nThe name of the game is staying in control.\nThis is why we start out on hills that are not very steep at all. You only want to go as fast as your stopping ability will allow, as you are learning to control your skis and stop yourself. As you get better at stopping, as you get better at changing direction, you can start to tackle steeper hills.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are only two speeds for a beginner; too fast and too slow. But, as you start to get better, and as you learn to control yourself on the skis, you start to move more toward the center. You will find that middle ground where skiing becomes exciting and fun.\nThat's the science of skiing as I have come to understand it. Now, how about a few more practical things before you head off to the lift to catch up with your friends and show them what you've learned?\nGetting Up After a Fall\nThe first time you try to stand up in skis after falling down, you'll feel like a turtle on its back. So, what's the best way to do this? Anytime you need to stop on the slope, either due to a fall, or just to adjust our equipment, always place your skis perpendicular to the slope. This is the one position where they won't be facing up or downhill, so they won't slide. So step one is to try and get yourself perpendicular with the slope.\nThe next thing is to try to get the skis down hill. Try to rotate your body so that your skis are actually down hill, and your head is pointing towards the top of the slope. This helps because, as you're lying on the slope, the gravity is at your feet, and your body is already shifted towards an upright position. In other words, if you're laying down on a very sharp incline, you don't have to push yourself up as far for you to be standing vertical. So, always try to position yourself so that your skis are downhill.\nIf your skis are more or less still parallel to each other, you're in good shape. Try to position your skis perpendicular to the slope. Now, you want to pull your inside leg up a little bit higher. When I say \"inside leg,\" I mean the leg that's closest to the ground. For example, you're laying down on your right side, and your head is pointed toward the top of the slope. Looking down, your skis are pointed toward the right side of the slope, and are now perpendicular to the slope. You're going to pull your right leg up a little bit, and now if you push up with your arms, you should be able to get yourself on top of the two skis to stand up. You can use your ski poles to help you by pushing yourself up on the poles to get yourself upward.\nNow, if you've really got yourself tangled up, you can try another way. Roll yourself onto your stomach. When you get to the point where your thighs and knees are on the ground, bend your knees, so your skis will go up in the air and straighten themselves out. If you can turn your ankles in the same direction, keeping your skis parallel, then roll to your side and push yourself up normally. If you're having trouble getting to your side, then twist your feet so that your heels are coming together and your toes are pointed out, you can now put your legs down so that your skis are back on the ground, forming a V-shape. Then, you'll come back up on your knees and try to push yourself up. You should be able to push yourself off, put your rear end up in the air, and then stand up. It's not very graceful to look at, but neither is sitting in the snow for too long.\nRecovering your Skis\nWhat happens if you fall and lose one of your skis? What's the trick to getting the ski back on? The rule of thumb is that it's always easier to step uphill. If you try to step downhill into your ski, it's going to be really easy to lose your balance. Place the ski next to you so that it's perpendicular to the slope, then turn around or move your ski so that the ski is uphill, and then step up into the ski.\nNow, with that out of the way, I think you're ready to hit the lifts, and join the rest of your crew who are tearing up the slopes.\nSki lifts\nThe first time you get on a ski lift might be a little intimidating, but you'll be surprised how easy it really is, and how nice the ride to the top can be. When the time comes, be alert and keep moving forward in line. When it's your time to board the lift, you will be directed where to stand. You'll know exactly when it's time to sit down, as the chair will simply come up behind you and scoop you up. From there it's just a nice, enjoyable ride to the top.\nGetting off is just as easy. You'll always know when it's time to step off. As you get to the top, and it's almost time to step off, you'll scoot up to the edge of the chair, and when your skis meet the snow, you'll know it's time to slip off.\nNavigating the trails\nNow, when you're actually on your own and hitting the slopes, make sure that you bring a trail map with you. Every ski trail has a trail map so that you'll know which ski trail is the easiest, which are intermediate, and which trails are the most difficult. You'll always be able to identify the trails according to their markings. The trails are always clearly marked according to their difficulty levels, and the markings are usually universal. The easier trails are marked with a green circle. The intermediate trails are marked with a blue square. Of course, the more difficult or expert trails are marked by a black diamond, or for the really difficult trails, two black diamonds, or a \"double black diamond.\" Naturally, you want to start off on the greens. Stick to those until you're ready to tackle the blues, and then, when you're ready to ace the blacks, that's when you're going to feel like James Bond trying to outrun the villains.\nKnowing when to hit the lodge\nLater on, after you've been carving up the snow for a few hours, if you find yourself falling down more often, and you're getting a little bit frustrated, take heart; your skiing ability isn't slipping away from you. Your body is just telling you that you're getting tired, which basically means its time to hit the lodge and warm up with a cold beer, a hot chocolate, or a nice Irish coffee.\nOnce you discover that apr\u00e8s ski after a long day of carving up the slopes, you can officially call yourself a skier.\nSki destinations\nAs we said earlier, after your first day, you're either going to love skiing, or you're going to hate it. My guess is that you're going to love it. Maybe you'll get so good that you're going to venture off to some more challenging ski locations. If you're on the East Coast, the best skiing is in New England, in states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Of course, for the best skiing in the United States, the real skiing is out in Colorado.\nOnce you've mastered the U.S. slopes, you can really follow in the footsteps of 007 and head to Europe; specifically the Alps, the Mecca of skiing. Countries like Austria, France, Italy, and of course, Switzerland are the major Alpine countries, and Bond has skied most of them. What this all means is that, if you find yourself being seduced by skiing, if you learn to love it, you'll go often, and you'll get better. Once that happens, the possibilities are endless. The world is your oyster. One day, you might even find yourself carving up the Swiss Alps, just like James Bond.\nSafety and etiquette\nAs a beginner, the other skiers are going to be very forgiving of your mistakes, but it's quite another thing to be reckless and stupid. Here are some things to keep in mind as you set out onto the slopes:\nKeep Control\nAlways keep control and able to stop when you need to, especially when avoiding objects or other people. If you find yourself in a situation where you're going too fast, and can't get control, just bend your knees and go down to the ground. That hurts a lot less than crashing into another skier.\nKeep Your Eyes Forward\nPeople ahead of you have the right of way. It's your responsibility to avoid them, just as the people behind you are responsible to avoid you. Keep your eyes forward and stay sharp.\nDon't Stand Around the Slope\nTry not to stop and stand in the middle of the trail so that other skiers have to try to avoid you. If you need to pause to catch your breath or get your bearings, move to the outer edges of the slope. And always keep visible.\nLook Before Merging\nWhenever you're stepping onto a trail midway, or your trail merges with another trail, be sure look uphill and yield to other skiers.\nHold Onto Your Equipment\nAlways use devices to prevent runaway equipment. Keep your hands through the straps of your poles so you don't lose them, and if you find yourself losing your skis a little too frequently, your bindings might need an adjustment. So head back in the rental office and get them adjusted.\nRead the Signs\nPay attention to the posted signs and warnings. Watch for signs indicating the trail's difficulty levels, and avoid the trails that have been closed off.\nBe Aware at the Ski Lift\nStay sharp when you're getting on and getting off the ski lift. Getting distracted when it's your turn to board the lift can lead to some embarrassing, and possibly dangerous moments. Use your head, and follow what the other skiers are doing.\nSnowboarding\nIn my mind, if Ian Fleming's James Bond was a skier, then I am a skier; but having said that, it would be remiss if I didn't talk about snowboarding. After all, James Bond snowboards (technically,) in A View to a Kill. In fact, you could even make the argument that James Bond did a lot to push snowboarding into the mainstream. At the time A View to a Kill was released in the mid-80s, the idea of somebody surfing on snow was so strange that the filmmakers even decided to highlight the absurdity by adding that awful surfing music that makes most Bond fans cringe. However, if James Bond can lose his skis and easily jump onto a snowboard, then it's something that Being James Bond should touch on.\nMuch of what we've covered so far about skiing also applies to snowboarding; including conditioning, clothing, and navigating the slopes. Snowboarding has become widely acceptable in most ski areas, and you should also be able to find yourself some snowboarding classes.\nSo, what are the differences between skiing and snowboarding?\nI've heard different schools of thought when it comes to the similarities between skiing and snowboarding, but one thing is for sure; just because you have good skiing experience, doesn't mean you can switch easily over to a snowboard. (And, I can vouch for that. The first time I tried to snowboard, it was an absolute fiasco.) On the other hand, if you do have some experience carving up the snow, you at least know a few general principles, but don't expect your body to communicate with the snowboard in the same way it communicates with skis.\nIf you are an absolutely beginner about to set out on the slopes for the first time, it might good to decide up front if you want to be a skier or a snowboarder. Here are a few of the differences that you should consider before making the choice:\nStopping a snowboard is a little bit awkward. Snowboarders are always exerting energy to stay on the edge of their board if they way to keep from sliding. Either that or they have to sit down. Plus, you don't have the poles to keep you upright and stationary. Another difference is that snowboarding tends to be easier on the knees than skiing. Knee injuries are a lot less common on snowboards than on skis. On the other hand, snowboarding can be pretty rough on your wrists, so you should probably wear some protective wrist guards. Flat surfaces can be particularly frustrating for snowboarders, because you don't have your poles to move you forward. The only thing you can do to get around is to take one foot out of your snowboard and just walk.\nAnother difference between snowboarding and skiing is that snowboarding works better in deeper, softer snow, whereas skis are much better handling bumps and ice. Also, they say that getting up on a snowboard is easier than getting up and getting yourself together on skis.\nNow, if you're learning to ski just to get your adrenaline going, it might surprise you that skiers get a lot more velocity than snowboarders, so factor that in when you're making your decision.\nI hope I didn't show too much bias in this explanation, but as I love to remind my snowboarding friends, if Fleming's Bond skied, I ski! Of course, there's plenty of room on the slope for all of us, so whatever you decide to do is fine. Both activities will give you a great feeling at the end of the day, as you're relaxing in the lodge.\nWith that out of the way, we're almost at the end of this article on skiing.\nTo learn more about skiing, you can check out The Essential Guide to Skiing: 201 Things Every Skier Must Know by Ron LaMaster, and Essentials of Skiing: The Fastest Way to Master the Slopes by Harold Harp, which also came with an instructional DVD. There were even a few great websites offering some good tips and techniques for learning to ski. Check out ABC of Skiing ( www.abc-of-skiing.com/learn-skiing ), Ski Great ( www.skigreat.com ) and GETskiing ( www.getskiing.net ), all of which had some great videos or animations to help explain good skiing techniques.\nAnd of course, there is no better way to learn than to hit the slopes and take a skiing class with a qualified instructor. Even if you already have some experience, a few lessons should really bring out your personal best, and take your skiing ability to the next level.\nNow before we finish out this article, we're going to have to make one stop. As promised, we're going to visit Piz Gloria on Mount Schilthorn in Murren, Switzerland.\nPIZ GLORIA\nWhen it comes to skiing, Switzerland is unmatched, and when it comes to Bond locations, there is one that is second to none. The grandfather of all Bond ski chases started at Piz Gloria, and endured down the side of Mount Schilthorn, in Murren, Switzerland.\nGetting to Piz Gloria can be half the adventure. A train from the town of Interlaken will take you to nearby Lauterbrunnen, where a few scenes from On Her Majesty's Secret Service were shot. From there you take funicular right up the side of the mountain. At your next stop, another rail will take you into the town of Murren, and from there it's two gondola lifts up into the mountains, and to the outstanding Bond location Piz Gloria.\nMake sure you're dressed appropriately. It was a mild spring afternoon on the day I went, but by the time I stepped off the gondola onto Piz Gloria at that altitude, it felt like a blustery winter afternoon, just as it must have felt when they filmed On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\nOnce inside Piz Gloria, it seemed that little had changed since James Bond was here. Walking up the stairway along its familiar golden balustrade to the revolving restaurant will make even the mildest fan of On Her Majesty's Secret Service feel as if they were about to walk into a room filled with exotic women from around the world and only moments away from confronting his most dangerous adversary. Be sure and order the James Bond Breakfast Special, complete with champagne and scrambled eggs.\nPiz Gloria still pulsates with the feeling of stepping into a James Bond film. Atop Mount Schilthorn in the village of Murren, Piz Gloria offers views that extend along the Bernese Alps to Mount Blanc on a clear day, and walking along the terrace, you can still envision the curling rink and the helipad where Bond let the aerial assault on Blofeld's fortress.\nAs much as we enjoy visiting well-known Bond locations, Piz Gloria certainly enjoys being one. Underneath the terrace is the Tourist-O-Rama. Press the '007' button in the center of the large circular room, and with a low mechanical hum, the shades will slowly lower on all the windows, and visitors can relive Bond's adventures in Switzerland through a panoramic slide presentation about the preparation and filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, including a video montage of the highlights of the film.\nUpstairs is the gift shop where there are airbrush murals of Bond and Tracy; I hope you like a little nostalgia. You'll find a few souvenirs here from you trip with a classic 007 insignia.\nOnce you've had a hearty meal in the restaurant and just before you're about to throw down your skis and ski down Mount Schilthorn, don't forget to stop off at the James Bond bar for a cocktail. Be sure to order a malt whiskey with branch water, of course.\nFor more information on Piz Gloria and Mount Schilthorn, look them up on the web at www.schilthorn.ch , or e-mail them at info.schilthorn.ch .\nAnd with that, that concludes this article on skiing.\nGood luck, and I'll \"see ya back at the lodge!\"\n\u00a9 2010 Joseph Darlington - beingjamesbond.com\nAll copyrights for products, logos, images etc are held by their respective owners.

Jake is the founder of Burton Snowboards , one of the largest and most well-established snowboard companies in the world. In the early 1980s , snowboard companies such as Sims, Winterstick, and Avalanche began emerging across the country. Also in the early 1980s, films by Warren Miller and Greg Stump began to feature clips of snowboarders, boosting the popularity of the sport among the skiing community. It was not until the mid-1980s that snowboarding exploded into the mainstream, when the first snowboard magazine, Absolutely Radical, hit the racks; it was soon renamed International Snowboard Magazine. For more on the history of snowboarding, see this Snowboard History Timeline.\nClick picture for video.\nThere are four primary sub-disciplines or sub-styles within snowboarding with each favoring a slightly different snowboard design .\nFree ride\nFree riding is using the natural terrain of the mountain for recreation, without focusing on technical tricks or racing. Most snowboarders aspire to be free riders and will explore the mountain through trees, in powder bowls or anywhere else they feel comfortable riding. Free riding is also known as all-mountain snowboarding . A variant of free riding focusing on extremely difficult lines is known as extreme snowboarding or big mountain snowboarding.\nFree ride snowboarding, where the focus is on riding cleanly and enjoying the freedom to go and explore anywhere is influenced significantly by surfing . Many free ride purists attach an almost spiritual connotation to carving down the mountain. The Free riding is mostly for periods of relaxation, due to the relative \"calmness\" one feels going down a slope at one's own speed.\nFreestyle\nFreestyle snowboarding is the practice of doing different kinds of tricks on a snowboard, hence the name freestyle. Tricks can either occur on the ground (e.g. jibbing, bonking, grinding, pressing, buttering etc.) or in the air (e.g. spins, flips, grabs). Freestyle snowboarders typically use shorter boards and softer boots than other snowboarders, as the shorter board length reduces the weight and moment of inertia , making it easier to spin and maneuver, and the softer boots make the board more forgiving to control for the particular demands of freestyle riding, such as slower speeds, high landing impacts, quick turns, and imperfect landings. Softer boards allow the snowboarder to press, or butter, with ease, but many freestyle snowboarders, especially half pipe riders, use stiff boards that have a lot of \"pop\" to allow them to jump higher and absorb hard landings.\nMost freestyle boards are directional, in that the tip is typically softer than the tail, and with the bindings and center of the side cut located slightly aft of center. As on a free ride board, this can make turn initiation more forgiving and help float the tip in powder and variable snow. Some freestyle snowboards are true twins, with the side cut radius being equal on both rails of the board and the stance centered on the board. Riding a twin-tip board makes it easier to land switch and compensate for changing riding conditions. Softer boots and boards also allow riders more flexibility in body movement and the ability to reach very convoluted or stretched out, stylish body positions (known as tweaks).\nFreestyle snowboarders often 'detune' or dull the edges of their snowboards so as not to catch them on rails or boxes when jibbing. One except however, being in the half-pipe, where edge hold can be critical.\nFreestyle snowboarding is arguably the most popular discipline, and is certainly the focus of most of the lifestyle marketing in the snowboarding industry. Freestyle is probably most demanded because of the thrill. Freestyle snowboarding can be done almost anywhere that has snow.\nFreestyle snowboarding is influenced greatly by skateboarding . Many ski resorts operate terrain parks which often simulate the urban skateboard environment, complete with half pipes , handrails , boxes , and machine-formed jumps.\nAlpine\nAlpine snowboarding is the practice of turning by carving the snowboard (such that the board turns by using the radius side cut of the edge), as opposed to skidding the snowboard (where the board is traveling in a different direction than it is pointing). Both traditional snowboard racers (though not necessarily boarder cross racers) and recreational carvers are alpine snowboarders.\nAlpine riders use hard plastic snowboarding boots, which resemble ski boots, except that they tend to be less stiff in the ankles and have a shortened heel, to minimize hanging over the edge of the snowboard. They tend to angle their feet much more forward than other snowboarders, and also ride narrower boards. Alpine boards are usually, but not always, longer and much stiffer than free ride boards, as the particular demands of carving usually require as much usable edge length as possible. The hard plastic boots stiffens the ankle joint up significantly, making it more difficult to make small ankle adjustments while making skid turns, but making the board much more stable and powerful at higher speeds and the much higher g-forces typically felt by an alpine snowboarder in carved turns.\nAn analogy made by some alpine enthusiasts is that free ride and freestyle snowboards are like dirt bikes, and alpine/carving snowboards are like road bikes. (Hence riding a freestyle snowboard on groomed slopes is like riding a dirt bike on a road track or what is called SuperMoto .)\nPowder riding\nPowder is a term for snow that is very light and fluffy. Powder is known as being the most fun and challenging condition for skiing and snowboarding, solely because it is so soft. If powder snow sits undisturbed for too long it may become compacted and hard, sometimes icy. This is considered more difficult terrain to negotiate. Generally colder climates sport the lightest, driest powder, or \"cold smoke\", and countries like Switzerland are becoming known as powder havens.\nIn places where almost all of the runs are groomed, and powder is a rare find, you must venture into the tree trails. Powder makes for much smoother turns and smoother riding. Powder also makes for softer landings and reduced chances of injury compared to man made terrain parks, though landing in deep snow can take some practice. Powder is best to ride when it is fresh, before other riders \"track it out\" and make ruts in the smooth surface. The powder snow will hold consistency if the temperature stays as cold or colder than when the snow fell, however when the sun melts it the so called \"slush\" is formed. This is exceptionally frustrating since it slows the board down rapidly, and if it is hit at high speed, a fall usually occurs. Other risks with skiing or snowboarding in powder include avalanches , injuries when falling on hidden obstacles such as rocks or tree stumps snowed over, loss of equipment, and the difficulty of getting oneself out of deep powder snow after a fall.\nSnowboarding in deep powder snow doesn't actually require a sharply tuned edge at all as there is nothing to 'grip' in the lightly compacted snow. However, it is preferred to have a tuned effective edge in case the terrain suddenly changes and grip is required.\nBackcountry\nThis type of boarding started out with fresh powder-craving snowboarders who, most likely, didn't have the cash to spend at crowded upscale ski parks. In fact, before snowboarding was allowed at resorts, this was the only form of snowboarding; Jake Burton , one of the original pioneers of snowboarding, never even considered resorts; backcountry was what he envisioned as the future of snowboarding. Today, backcountry snowboarding is often for those who have enough cash to afford trips to Alaska or the mountain ranges of the West, to ride outside resorts. Donning snowshoes or a split-board with skins, the backcountry snowboarder cuts a new path up the side of the mountain in search of the very best vistas and untouched snow. Some of those more cash-endowed riders can even hire snowcats or helicopters to take them where they want to go; this is known as cat boarding or heliboarding respectively.\nA split-board is a snowboard cut in half along its length. When apart, the two halves can be used like cross-country skis to ascend a hill. When the snowboarder is ready to descend, the halves are mechanically secured together, and the bindings are repositioned for a snowboarding stance. Without a split-board, snowboarders who want to experience backcountry terrain, bear a little extra burden by carrying their snowboards with a backpack and using snowshoes or cross country skis to ascend.\nSnowboarders also use snowmobiles to ride in the backcountry. If the hill is too steep a snowmobile may not make it up the hill. Often snowboarders use snowmobiles to make jumps into the powder.\nSafety is key when hiking and riding in the backcountry, especially after a fresh 'dump' of powder. Snow can be extremely unstable, often leading to avalanches . Backcountry riders are advised to take extreme caution in all conditions, to carry avalanche equipment including a probe, beacon, and shovel, and never to ride alone in the backcountry. Avalanche equipment can be purchased or rented at outdoor equipment stores. Courses in avalanche safety are also available.\n"}, {"score": 944.2353, "uuid": "9980d281-503f-5a8a-acef-1cb0fae7c6de", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-49-03039", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/08/winter-sports-fails_n_1262880.html", "page_rank": 1.1737487e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Winter Sports Fails: <em>Snowboarding</em> Falls, <em>Skiing</em> Flubs And Other Winter", "snippet": "Watch the video above and let us know <em>which</em> fail you think <em>is</em> the best <em>or</em> most cringeworthy (<em>or</em> perhaps both?) in the comments section.

Perhaps if I was 20, Art Of Flight could be the best film ever. But now I look through the tricks and the scenery and attempt to capture the message and the feeling that the film tries to present. And now Art Of Flight has That\u2019s It That\u2019s All to compete against.\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean that Art Of Flight is a bad snowboarding movie. Hell no! It is one of the very best ever created. Amazing shots, remarkable tricks, amazing places. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s older brother, when it came out, it was so distinct, so much \u201cbetter\u201d from everything else created till that point that it stood out. It amazed. It took the snowboarding community by storm. It broke the snowboard barrier and became the one snowboard movie to see even if you\u2019re not a snowboarder.\nArt Of Flight is the same, however that is specifically its issue, same isn\u2019t good enough three years later when lots of other movies are shoot making use of helicopters and super slo-mo HD cameras.\nBut that is not the largest problem for me. The biggest problem is the point, the message of the movie. It\u2019s OK for the snowboard, surfing, BMX, skate, MTB, MX\u2026movies to have no message. A bunch of tricks, fantastic music\u2026 people having fun doing things other mortals can\u2019t. But if they have one (a message) or if they try to have one be sure this message is legit.\nArt Of Flight fell in to the retro, soul, hippie, search hole which is THE Thing in the last few years. Each other movie tries to be something more than just a film, tries to have a meaning, to have a soul, to explore the depths of human lives, our purpose on Earth, to hug trees, care about the environment and global warming, to be in touch with nature, take in soybean steaks, do yoga and go back to the roots. Which is fine if it is true. But if you get the feeling that all this is just a cover, that all this is just there simply because it\u2019s hip, then this is an epic fail. You could get away with it several years back when being soul and stuff was fresh and special, but today\u2026. oh no.\nAnd why is not it legit in Art Of Flight? You may not make a deep movie if individuals are blowing things up with shotguns in the middle of it. If they\u2019re shooting at trees and making giant bonfires and generally acting as a standard hyperactive and a little drunk male would. If snowboarders are explaining things in a deep meditating voice but not saying anything that makes sense. If they\u2019re burning gallons of kerosene flying around the globe and attempting to be concerned at the same time. It\u2019s OK but it is not in line with the feeling you wish the movie to carry. It is just stupid and fake. Next time, just make a movie that is fun as an alternative.\nThe author has dedicated a website that serves as a guide to extreme sports like surfing, wakeboarding, snowboarding, mountain biking, windsurfing, and the like.

I got hooked on it like, 2 years ago when my best friend got it! She loves it and rides it everyday.\nIt took me a while to get the hang of it, but once you have it down you feel so free. It\u2019s a cool idea, and a great product. Its definitely worth it. They may break a bone without a rip stick anyway! Flow boards have 7 wheels in a semicircle in front and 7 wheels in a semicircle in back for a snowboard feel.\nBecause his 10-year-old cousin already had one, I guess he had an idea of how to ride it, so it took only 5-10 minutes for my son to be standing and sliding (slowly) on the thing for 10 seconds or so. A Kid\u2019s Review I rode my friends rip stick and it\u2019s so much fun. It took us some time to figure out how to move uphill.\nThe good news is, you don\u2019t have to buy the replacement \u201crip stick\u201d wheels. Very heavy duty, worth the money absolutely. However, they are both thrilled with their Rip Sticks and spend hours riding them.\nIt is just fun at a fast or slow pace. It\u2019s a winner. There is absolutely no way to stop, you have to carve to slow down! I bought it for my husband as a surprise gift.\nLike skateboards, but the decks are in three sections. He is getting to the point of mastering his own technique. When I first saw a college student riding one of these, I asked him about it. Our six year old can go down a little hill with very little help in one day.\nAfter you learn how to ride it is so addictive. Another fun game is playing \u201ctag\u201d on caster boards.\nRazor helmets are very heavy so you might not want to go with that.\nIt was packed well and I am very happy with my first buy, on Amazon Best Snowboarding Jacket !\nTips On How To Prevent Injuries When Boarding\nSnowboarding is an extreme sport that became popular around 1995. The sport has since gained widespread recognition such that it is now being featured in the Olympic Games and in the winter X games. If you are someone who would not like to remain indoors during the winter, taking up the sport can be a great way for you to get the very best winter. In addition, you will enjoy many thrills from the sport because it is a challenging, yet, highly rewarding sport.\nHowever, you may be interested in knowing that chances are that you will fall down a couple of times during the your first classes on the sport. However, the falls are nothing compared to the fun that awaits you once you have mastered the basics. Interestingly, you can do some things to ensure that the severity of the injuries sustained is minimal in nature.\nNonetheless, many people often forget about learning about their safety, what they are usually after is the development of the skills that will make them perform twists and turn in the air like the pros. However, the key to ensuring that you do not become a victim of serious injuries is to learn all the safety procedures and precautions necessary for an injury free session on the slopes.\nThe key to being properly informed inasmuch as your safety is concerned is that you should have your beginner classes under the tutelage of a professional. You need to understand the fact that you cannot rely on the information available in DIY books because nothing can be compared to the real thing. More so, learning from a professional makes it easier for you to assimilate the skills needed to perform movements without endangering yourself.\nAnother thing that will protect you from becoming injured is to be properly attired for the sport. You would not want to appear on the slopes with your every day clothing and a snowboard unless of course you want to watch other snowboarders. Before starting the sport, it is essential that you visit a sport shop to get the necessary gear.\nWhen you are in the market for the sporting gear, it is imperative that you buy, helmets, knee pads, wrist guards and hip guards just to name a few. In fact, the wrist guards and helmets that you should buy must be top of the line products. This is because the wrist guards will guide against fractures when you use your hands to break falls.\nYou also need to spend good money on a good helmet because the helmet has no other function than to protect your head. A good helmet ensures that you do not suffer concussions when you hit your head against hard objects. For example, it is possible that you collide with trees or packed ices on some kind of terrains.\nYou also need to ensure that your boots, snowboard and bindings are the perfect fit. The reason for this is that if your footwear is not balanced, your footwork will not be correct and you will not be able to develop proper balance not to mention fluid movement. However, when you have the perfect footwear, you can be sure that your snowboarding activities will become something that you look up to every winter.\nClick Right Now If You Have Injured Yourself During A Winter Vacation And Do Not Have Medical Insurance To See You Through Hard Times.

So to achieve maximum board manage you should have the proper gear. When selecting the type of snowboard boots to purchase you need to pick based on the style of snowboarding which you are most likely to make use of. You\u2019ll find fundamentally 3 varieties of snowboard boots and they\u2019re the tough boot, the soft boot and the hybrid boot. The exterior in the boot is exactly where the greatest difference lies because the inner linings are relatively similar in between each sort of boot. Inside all snowboard boots you\u2019ll find \u2018inner bladders\u2019 and their function is to cushion and support your feet. They also maintain the water away from your feet so assist to help keep your feet dry and warm. The inner bladder will typically have its personal laces which enable you to wrap the liner tightly around your feet ensuring no rubbing against your skin as well as give a much better amount of comfort.\nFirst up let\u2019s take a look at the tough snowboard boots. Because the name implies, these possess a tougher much more rigid exterior. Hard boots are usually employed on-piste in events like slalom and events where tiny movements in the feet give a greater edge performance. The outer shell of these boots is usually make from hard plastic as well as the boots provide support for a rider\u2019s ankles, feet and lower legs. Hard boots tend to have a toe and heel clamp to secure the boot for the snowboard.\nNext we have soft boots which could be the most comfy boots that you can wear for snowboarding. Soft boots could be employed combined with binding highbacks to enable the rider to have a lot more control on the heel edge. Because the boots are soft the rider can move their feet much more naturally and they are much more comfortable and therefore very best suited for freestyle riding. Numerous people will choose soft boots as they may be able to walk and go out briefly whilst wearing them.\nLastly there is certainly they hybrid boots which are a mixture of both the difficult and also the soft boots. The hybrid boots give a sturdy difficult sole having a soft upper boot. These boots supply flexibility and comfort too as a good deal of manage that the tough boots supply.\nWhen trying to acquire boots it really is advised to take along the leggings and footwear that you will be wearing while snowboarding then you\u2019ll be certain to get the correct size boot fitted. Try various boots and buy from an expert so they know what they may be talking about when helping you to pick the most effective boot suited to you.\nFor more information about everything involving snowboards, check out our snowboard reviews site!\nThe Special Design Of Under Armour ColdGear And When It\u2019s Suitable To Use\nWhile HeatGear is designed to be worn in extremely warm weather, Under Armour ColdGear is Under Armour\u2019s line of apparel that is built to keep the user warm and comfortable in temperatures typically under 55\u2032F. With the number of uses of the apparels included in this line, as well as with the number of benefits that can be derived from their use, they are, today, among the most popularly used winter sports clothing by athletes.\nUnder Armour ColdGear, as mentioned, is a full line of specially designed athletic clothing that is ideally worn in temperatures under 55\u2032F.

In this fascinating snow time activity, the men and women who participate put on specific boot sets that are attached for the board on which they are going to use to navigate a path down a slope which is covered in snow. In 1965, snowboarding was initially created and it was inspired by sledding, surfing and skiing.\nRegardless of the reality that it\u2019s fairly new towards the sporting globe, snowboarding has turn out to be wildly well-liked all about the globe.\nThe weight from the snowboarders is balanced on the board whilst they\u2019re creating the downhill trek. The boots are attached securely towards the snowboard to make sure that the snowboard and also the rider don\u2019t turn out to be separated. In contrast to skiing, no poles are utilized by snowboarders to help in steering and propelling themselves forward. Rather, snowboarders are dependent on the shifting of their weight from 1 side towards the subsequent to be able to make a turn.\nIn spite of the truth that it really is deemed to become a legitimate sporting activity, several men and women just take pleasure in snowboarding for purely recreational purposes. Amongst essentially the most well-known areas to carry out snowboarding for entertaining is at ski resorts. Despite the fact that the majority of ski resorts had been previously inside the habit of catering exclusively to skiers, just about all the lodges and resorts now play host to an equal level of snowboarders and skiers.\nOne of many fantastic capabilities of snowboarding is the fact that it may be carried out in any place exactly where there\u2019s a hill which is covered in snow and sloped to perfection.

Many want to try something new so they choose snowboarding best way to learn.\nStarting out in 1929 with a piece of plywood on a snow slope, progress continued. It was in 1980 that actual boards were built that had bindings and high backs to help with control. Those snowboarders were not welcomed by ski resorts for a number of reasons, one of which was because of possible injuries. Today it is possible to find many locations that are completely dedicated to this sport.\nAs with other sports, having a board appropriate to your size and weight is important. Another important requirement is to start out on a bunny hill or small slope. This is not a matter of making a purchase and immediately mastering the sport. It may take considerable time to learn how to keep your balance and control the board when moving.\nThe next thing to learn is how to stop and carve the board. This is done by having placing your heels to your toes, back and forth, until you get the feel control. You must feel able to maneuver the board easily prior to moving to steeper slopes in order to avoid injury.\nAfter learning how to balance the next step is to learn how to pop up on the board, called an \u201cOllie\u201d. An easy way to learn this trick is to practice on grass. By correctly adjusting the straps the snowboard can be used to practice jumping on various objects. This makes it much easier to do this when actually on the snow slope.\nIt is obvious that good balance must be obtained if snowboarding is to be an enjoyable sport. This is accomplished by being sure that the bottom of the board is flat on the surface. Many fun maneuvers can be accomplished with practice.

The sportsmen who pursue these difficult activities frequently turn out to be as devoted as Olympians and allocate hours each day practicing and enhancing their method to be well placed to delight in the thrill that only generating the great ollie or dropping a hill on a buttboard can bring. Extreme athletes often refer to the adrenaline hit of competing as becoming born once more and many say that there is no other feeling in the globe that's as satisfying. For many of these coarse and tumble athletes, part of the attraction of extreme sports is the danger.\nUnlike sports that are regulated by official certified judges and need the sportsmen to wear protective gear and carry out with ship shape gear, extreme sports competitions from time to time incorporate comparatively unprotected athletes competing on somewhat ruined trappings, like luge boards produced out of skateboards with plywood additions. These conditions lead directly to better thrills for a lot of of the participants, down to the fact the more hazardous a circumstance is the additional adrenaline the physique produces, top to the feeling of getting born again.\nHowever, the extended-term harm that results from the types of wounds that many extreme sportsmen endure often leaves these passionate men and females feeling less than excited. Whether or not the fun of extreme sports is worth the danger is a thing that nobody can decide but the sportsman who is placing their body on the line. On the other hand, if you or somebody in your life is brooding about joining the hardcore world of extreme sports, it is a good idea to do some research into what well-liked wounds are, and how they can be forestalled.\nRegularly wearing a helmet or certain kinds of padding can make the difference between ending up in the surgery soon after a wipeout and walking away with a handful of pesky bruises. The hazards of each sport are exclusive, so the types of kneepads that a skate boarder favors would possibly not be pretty significantly help to a street luger. The sole protecting gear that may really help a sporting hero is the gear that is particularly appropriate to his or her sport, so prior to you put any bucks into protective gear, read as a lot as you can about the perils you are likely to face, and attempt to get some firsthand steering from talented sportsmen in the field you would like to take part in.\nA few extreme athletes don\u2019t bother with the sort of protective gear that they should truly be wearing, in element since they worry that kneepads or elbow pads will rein in their cool component. Nonetheless, taking care of your physique is as important for an extraordinary athlete as it is for any athlete, if not a lot more so. Regardless of whether throwing bales may actually not seem as exciting with a helmet as it is lacking in a single, if you protect oneself it's usually possible to be positive that you'll have the opportunity to take one more crack at your favored extraordinary challenge.\nMatt Ball, owner of BMX Game .org.ukExtreme sports are my passion, found through BMX Racing .\nWhy You Should Perform A Ski Helmet Test Before Buying\nSki helmets are considered as must haves by many skiers and snowboarders here and abroad. These are essential in ensuring the safety of the player when in the snow in case of accidents. This is despite of the popular belief that snow is so soft that you will not get any injury once you fall on it. The increased popularity of these helmets proved to be beneficial to manufacturers as more brands, styles and types of ski helmets are introduced to the market every day. Thus, it is very important that a ski helmet test be properly done before choosing which one to use.\nGoing to steep slopes and rocky snowy have proven very dangerous by many. This also has proven that the use of ski helmets greatly help in minimizing the risk of head injuries in case of accidents. Such helmets absorb the shock and impact of a fall and further reduce the jarring of the brain against the skull during impacts with the ski slope or other terrain features such as rocks, trees, and even other skiers. As per latest studies released by the US, at least 7000 head injuries have been successfully avoided by the use of helmets.\nAs mentioned, the growing number of skiers and snowboarders using ski helmet brought about an increase in the number of brands and styles of ski helmets now available in the market to choose from. As such, it is very important to perform a ski helmet test before making a purchase decision. When shopping for these items, the first and most important priority is the gear\u2019s fit-a properly fit helmet will be comfortable and offers the maximum amount of protection and performance. It is important to remember that not all helmets fit the same. One should also keep in mind that a perfectly fit helmet has pads that are flushed against the cheeks and forehead and its back does not touch the nape of the neck. Also, the helmet should be snug and comfortable when the chin snaps are fastened.\nStyle is another part of the ski helmet test. There are two types of styles available for players to choose from, the open-face and full-face models. The first one which is the open-face model is mostly used by recreational skiers as they offer a greater ranger of vision. Full faced model on the other hand offers greater protection to the face but has a restricted range of vision. This is more popular among ski racers and professional snowboarders. The third test of a perfect helmet is its ventilation. Many models come with vents that can be easily opened or closed.\nWhen shopping for ski helmets, purchasing a brand from a quality manufacturer with a reputation for quality control is recommended. These companies can be identified by performing researches on various websites online, as well as on print media. Also, it is vital to check the helmet certification standard. Various organizations worldwide perform a ski helmet test on the gears\u2019 ability to withstand impacts. In North America and Europe, the three helmet organizations that provide the most stringent ski helmet certification standards are the Snell RS-98, ASTM F2040 standard, and the CEN 1077.\nConducting a ski helmet test prior o purchasing one is very helpful in ensuring utmost protection when in the snow and already playing. As such it is very important to familiarize yourself with the things included in these tests in order to perform them properly.\nDawn Esguerra is a snowboarder from Alaska who recently migrated to Germany. Dawn is among those snowboarders who believe that ski helmets are indeed a life saving accessory. When shopping for these gears, Dawn always perform a Skihelm Test in order to find the best one she will be using.\n"}, {"score": 933.74786, "uuid": "e69efb87-f856-58ab-a5fd-f9d40561e84d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1809wb-73-15707", "target_hostname": "downwindsports.com", "target_uri": "http://downwindsports.com/mainSite/category/snowboarding/", "page_rank": 1.5801279e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Snowboarding</em> | Down Wind Sports", "snippet": "for a high level of comfort and protection from the elements, this seamless tube of fabric can be worn for everything from <em>skiing</em> to cycling * Seam-Free\u2122 construction means there are no irritating seams <em>or</em> hems, making it ideal to wear under a helmet <em>or</em> other headwear Designed to offer technical performance", "explanation": null, "document": "Made In America- Shop Locally This Holiday Season!\nNovember 11th, 2011 bill Comments off\nWe try not to get to political here at Down Wind Sports\u2026heck we would rather be outside playing, but we are passionate about supporting local retailers.\u00a0 So this holiday we implore everyone to think about shopping locally and keeping your money in the local community.\nOn that note while not all of the products we sell at our store are made in the U.S.A. some of them are and would also make nice holiday gifts for someone on your list!\u00a0 Check out some of our good ol\u2019 made in America products!\nCrescent Moon Snowshoes\nAs an outdoor products manufacturing company we have a special obligation to make our snowshoes out of components which do \u2018no harm\u2019 to the environment in which they are used.\u00a0 With that as a guiding principle for our products and the way we make them, Crescent Moon chose to locate its manufacturing facility in Boulder, CO from our inception, in 1997.\n907 Fat Bikes\nWe wanted a top-flight frame that adhered to the highest quality standards.\nTo achieve this goal, we felt we needed to be able to communicate directly with the manufacturer; therefore, we decided the 9:ZERO:7 frames had to be produced in the U.S. To bring our designs to life, we decided to partner with Merlin Metal Works for the production of our titanium frame.\nOur aluminum 9:ZERO:7 is produced in Portland, Oregon by the same craftsmen who have welded for Turner, Titus, Ellsworth, Santa Cruz, and others.

Well, push aside any preconceived notions you may have about the South, and re-think your answer. In the high country of North Carolina, three ski destinations offer visitors an experience not unlike that found in the country\u2019s more well-known ski resorts.\nWhat sets these resorts apart is their ability to produce ideal ski conditions without the necessity for natural snow or constant sub-zero temperatures. Each resort is equipped with its own snowmaking technology, which allows each one to create prime ski slopes practically overnight.\nAppalachian Ski Mountain\nAppalachian Ski Mountain features 12 slopes and three terrain parks, perfect for skiers and snowboarders of all ages and skill levels. Photo courtesy of High Country Host.\nLocated in Blowing Rock, Appalachian Ski Mountain offers skiers and snowboarders 12 slopes and three terrain parks to choose from for testing their skills. The site\u2019s base elevation is 3,635 feet, while the peak elevation tops out at 4,000 feet, with a vertical drop of 365 feet. Slopes open at 9 a.m. and run until 5 p.m., with a night session from 5 to 10 p.m.\nHome to the French-Swiss Ski College, Appalachian Ski offers the perfect location to learn how to ski or brush up on your skills, which is exactly what I did. And, I believe, I did quite well. I made it down the small, short hill as instructed. Several times in fact. As a result, I felt pretty good about my progress and was looking forward to my next lesson at my next ski stop. Turns out, that was my first mistake.\nSugar Mountain\nA short drive away in Banner Elk, Sugar Mountain features 20 slopes and trails situated on 115 acres. Base elevation is 4,100 feet, while the summit reaches 5,300 feet, with a vertical drop of 1,200 feet. Thanks to such a large vertical drop, Sugar Mountain is home to North Carolina\u2019s only double black diamond trail: Whoopdeedoo.\nSnowshoeing is a great alternative to skiing when it comes to exploring the slopes of Sugar Mountain. Photo by www.bushphoto.com.\nSince the slopes are open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., plus a night session from 6 to 10 p.m., you can work up your courage on the less difficult trails before tackling Whoopdeedoo. For those new to the sport or wanting to tweak their skills, ski and snowboard lessons are offered for all ages.\nIt is here that I take my next ski lesson. However, unlike my previous lesson, this lesson took an immediate turn for the worst. Unlike at Appalachian Ski, where I donned my skis and walked \u2013\u00a0yes, walked \u2013 up my small, short hill, at Sugar I was quickly directed to the ski lift. I knew this wasn\u2019t going to go well, and I was right. First, I fell trying to get off the ski lift at the top of the mountain \u2013\u00a0yes, mountain.\nOnce I regained my footing, a new fear set in: How was I going to get down this mountain? I drew upon my limited ski knowledge obtained in yesterday\u2019s lesson and tried desperately to implement it. Unfortunately, my knees quickly rebelled. Since I was at a much higher elevation, my speed increased much faster than I expected, and my knees were not able to catch up.\nIn moments I knew I wouldn\u2019t make it down this hill via skiing. Thankfully, my instructor was understanding and did her best to help me get down without ripping my knees apart. Once I was back at the lodge, I traded my skis in for something a little more comfortable: snow shoes. For those without the skiing gene, this is a great way to hit the slopes without fear of running wild into a tree. Trust me! Sugar Mountain offers one-hour snowshoe tours across the mountain four days a week, and I highly recommend it. You get to check out the slopes and see some of the view without risking life or limb.\nBeech Mountain Resort\nEastern North America\u2019s highest ski resort, Beech Mountain Resort welcomes skiers and snowboarders to test their prowess on 15 different slopes.\nIn the town of Beech Mountain, Beech Mountain Resort welcomes visitors to display their skiing and snowboarding prowess on its 16 trails, day or night. The highest ski resort in Eastern North America, base elevation is 4,675 feet, while the peak elevation reaches 5,506 feet, with an 830-foot vertical drop. With seven lifts, including a high-speed quad chair lift, you\u2019ll be back at the top of the slopes ready for more in no time. However, after my experience at Sugar, I decided to forego the skis and see what else the resort had to offer.\nFor something different or while taking a break from the slopes, take a spin on the ice skating rink located in the middle of Beech Tree Village or peruse through the village\u2019s gift and clothing shops. If you\u2019ve worked up an appetite or simply need to refuel, stop by one of the resort\u2019s four dining destinations for a snack or a meal.\nAs you can see, there\u2019s no need to head out west or up north for a great winter vacation. So the next time you\u2019re planning a snow ski trip, think outside the norm and consider a visit to North Carolina\u2019s high country.\nDisclosure: Karon Warren visited these ski resorts as a guest of High Country Host.\n"}, {"score": 923.80743, "uuid": "d72fe8b9-24c2-56b9-90cc-445cb2b6e927", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-84-23297", "target_hostname": "milan.angloinfo.com", "target_uri": "http://milan.angloinfo.com/information/31/ski.asp", "page_rank": 1.2361234e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Skiing</em> in Lombardy, Italy - AngloINFO Milan", "snippet": "This resort, with <em>skiing</em> and <em>snowboarding</em> facilities for all skill levels, <em>is</em> located in Valtellina in the Province of Sondrio.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet this!\nPractical information on skiing in the Italian Alps.

I prefer to spend enough time somewhere to see not just the famous facade, but the view from the top, from the bottom, from the back door and from the inside out. (Incidentally, spending a semester abroad is a great way to do this.) Still, sometimes you don\u2019t have the luxury of a long, unhurried visit. Sometimes you have no choice but to walk (or even run) the well-beaten path. Sometimes, for example, a quickly approaching spring means the ski-season is set to end before you get out of your orientation program. And so, sometimes, you have to run to Austria for the weekend. Tragic, really. You know there\u2019s so much more to see and do, you know you haven\u2019t done the country justice. But you have to admit, it feels pretty good to stroll into class at 9 a.m. Monday morning \u2014 fresh from the overnight train with a bag of Alpine milk chocolate over your shoulder and fresh ski bruises flowering on your legs.\nI couldn\u2019t have done it without my friend Lea. In 24 waking hours, she took me from the former imperial palaces of Vienna to the ski slopes of Semmering, and half a dozen unique places and experiences in between. I never even felt overwhelmed. If she ever gets sick of international business, she\u2019d make a brilliant tour guide!\nMy day in Vienna started out slow and cozy at a traditional Viennese Coffee House. This was exactly what I needed after taking the overnight train in, but the stop was more than practical. The coffee house culture is a major part of the daily life in Austria. For years people have been heading to them for a slow breakfast or an afternoon tea while studying, reading newspapers or even finding romance.\nNext, we headed to Sch\u00f6nbrunn, the imperial summer palace on the outskirts of Vienna. The place is enormous, beautiful and filled with memories of some of Austria\u2019s most beloved historical figures \u2014 chief among them Sisi, the unwilling queen whose story has inspired countless operas, films and PEZ containers. Perhaps more impressive than the palace itself were its extensive gardens and grounds\u2026 unfortunately not at their best in early March.\nHeading back into the heart of Vienna, we ate lunch at the Naschmarkt, or Nibbling Market \u2014 a long street filled with shops and stalls selling every kind of food imaginable. We feasted on feta stuffed zucchini, dried pineapple, artisan chocolate and, of course, Wiener Schnitzel. We worked off the calories soon after, though, when we headed to St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral and climbed 300-something stairs to the top of the tower.\nBut Lea saved the best of Vienna for last. As shadows grew long, she took me to the imperial winter palace of Hofburg. Being in its proper season, and a somewhat more public building than Sch\u00f6nbrunn, it managed to be even more impressive, ringed with cold marble statues that stare condescendingly down onto passerby. We peaked into the adjoining Spanish Riding School and caught a glimpse of the world famous Lipizzaner stallions, then continued on through the imperial gates.\nThe view from the other side of them was incredible. We were suddenly completed surrounded by stunning and monumental buildings. It was difficult to process it all at once. To our backs, yet another facade of the Hofburg. To our left, the National Library. Ahead, among others, were the governmental buildings, Vienna\u2019s city hall and another cathedral\u2026 all towering grey and white with glittering gold detail and statuary. Horse drawn carriages hired by wealthier tourists wove daintily through the maze of opulence.\nAs darkness fell, we headed to Lea\u2019s hometown. Baden is a small but pleasant town near Vienna, with residential streets in classic Art Nouveau, an old hot spring spa and one of Europe\u2019s larger casinos. For dinner, we met some of Lea\u2019s friends at a Heuriger, a traditional wine tavern. A quiet evening at a Heuriger is the very embodiment of Austrian Gem\u00fctlichkeit \u2014 which is often translated simply as \u201ccozy,\u201d but it goes beyond good furnishings and a warm fire to describe a sense of overall well-being and belonging.\nThe next day, I got to share in Lea\u2019s family breakfast. The meal itself was actually very similar to what we had in the coffeehouse the day before \u2014 the same rolls and marmalade, soft boiled eggs and, of course, liberally flowing coffee and cocoa.\nIt was wonderful to meet Lea\u2019s parents \u2014 they were incredibly welcoming and hospitable, even though I chose to visit on a very busy weekend for them (and, let\u2019s get to the point, I love the Austrian accents!).\nThe last part of the trip was the long-awaited alpine skiing experience. We headed south as fast as we could to reach the quickly receding winter snows, and found them at the ski resort of Semmering. We rode the lift up to the top, over acres of eerily-quiet pine forest, and suddenly the mountain lay before our feet in all of its glory \u2014 the snow glittering brilliant white and the slopes seeming to go on forever. For a little Missouri girl who\u2019d only been skiing at St. Louis\u2019 less-than-world famous Hidden Valley, it was unbelievable to be able to glide downhill for half an hour before having to take the ski lift up again!\nI know this sounds lazy, but eating lunch at the ski chalet was easily the highlight of the day. We ordered delicious Tirolean dumpling soup, and a big Germkn\u00f6del (yeasty cake with sour plum sauce) for dessert. These are traditional skiing foods, and they were perfect as we sat and ate in the deliciously cool air, watching teenagers try new snowboarding jumps, parents ski with children as young as two and three between their legs and the mountains rise all around us into the blue sky of a perfect weekend.\n"}, {"score": 911.5075, "uuid": "ee779859-7b68-5213-ad5a-dbd34866b98e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-12-13347", "target_hostname": "allrileyedup.com", "target_uri": "http://allrileyedup.com/2009/01/25/skiing-in-utah/", "page_rank": 1.2611089e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "All Rileyed Up \u00bb <em>Skiing</em> in Utah", "snippet": "<em>Which</em> brings me to Park City Mountain Resort, Utah. <em>Skiing</em> <em>is</em> sometimes a <em>difficult</em> vacation to go on when you have children <em>or</em> a family in <em>which</em> half the members don\u2019t ski, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> why a place like Park City Mountain Resort <em>is</em> so cool (literally and figuratively).", "explanation": null, "document": "Written by Riley on January 25, 2009 in: Family , Product reviews | Tags: family skiing , Park City , Park City Mountain Resort , skiing Utah , skiing vacation , snowboarding , snowmobile rides , Utah vacation , winter skiing , winter sports , winter vacation\nPark City Mountain Resort\nI want a vacation.

This means knowing the layout and the hotspots popular among ski enthusiasts and other vacationers. Let\u2019s assume, for now, that the vacation rental is for a ski vacation.\nThe town is, after all, primarily a ski resort. A good one it is too, with a nice location and magnificent ski slopes a short drive away from Denver, and shopping, dining, entertainment, etc. All year round. The downtown area is at a breathtaking altitude of 9,100 ft while the highest incorporated point stretches into the clouds at 12,060 ft.\nGetting down to the vacation rentals, visitors have a truckload of choices, starting from ski-in/ski-out town homes and condos scattered all over the resort. The downtown area in Winter Park and neighboring Fraser offer an even wider range of rentals. Mountain homes offer a cozy Alpine experience similar to wealthy Swiss chalets.\nLet\u2019s assume, again, that the purpose of the trip is a ski vacation. If so, choosing the right one basically depends on the budget, number of people and length of stay. Not to mention a little comparison shopping for finding the right one with all kinds of facilities and a lot of space. So a 1-bedroom condo with pullout beds would be cheaper for a family of four, as compared to a 2-bedroom without pullouts.\nFinding such a matching property in a suitable location such as Fraser Crossing shouldn\u2019t be all that hard. There are many condos and townhomes here that are a short walk away from the lifts and the resort\u2019s new village, and also on the free resort shuttle route. So all a small family on a ski vacation has to do is find an affordable 1-bedroom condo with suitable amenities in this or a similar location in the resort.\nAmenities should include everything that people use at home, plus things a ski resort needs such as space for skis, bikes, etc. Most homes in Winter Park have a fireplace and a full-service kitchen with everything from refrigerators to microwaves and utensils. Outdoor hot tubs and heated pools are quite common too, and so is wifi internet, cable TV with a DVD player and movie collection. Pullout beds are very helpful, and as mentioned above, can help save a lot on rental costs.\nVacation rentals with all this and more are available at strategic locations in the resort, from the new Village Lofts to Founder\u2019s Pointe and Fraser Crossing. In the downtown area, Sawmill Station and Telemark are popular locations. Visitors can combine a ski vacation along with urban activities like shopping and dining in Winter Park.\nAll of these Winter Park Colorado vacation rentals, and many more in and around the town and resort, will almost surely offer a uniquely exciting ski experience. Some make it a lot better by paying attention to detail, and offering guests everything from discount lift tickets to free laundry, use of free video games and parking garages. The single most important factor that makes people want to choose a specific property is of course the view \u2013 a sweeping view of the mountains in Winter Park is priceless. But for those that want to put a price on it, it is equivalent to the cost of a vacation rental.\nYou can get the most out of your winter holiday by choosing Winter Park Colorado vacation rentals . You can arrange for Colorado ski vacation rentals easily and quickly, using your Internet connection.\n"}, {"score": 902.7163, "uuid": "d791136a-d2f1-5b5a-bf81-f7c446cc39c8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-01-29878", "target_hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "target_uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slalom_skiing", "page_rank": 1.4643788e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Slalom <em>skiing</em> - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "snippet": "A hairpin <em>is</em> a series of gates including two gates with one closing gate. A flush <em>is</em> a series of gates including three <em>or</em> <em>more</em> gates with one closing gate.", "explanation": null, "document": "[ edit ] Origins\nThe word \"Slalom\" is from the Morgedal / Seljord dialect of Norwegian slal\u00e5m: \"sla,\" meaning slightly inclining hillside, and \"l\u00e5m,\" meaning track after skis. The inventors of modern skiing classified their trails according to their difficulty. Slal\u00e5m was a trail used in Telemark by boys and girls not yet able to try themselves on the more challenging runs. Ufsil\u00e5m was a trail with one obstacle (ufse) like a jump, a fence, a difficult turn, a gorge, a cliff (often more than 10 meters high) and more. Uvyrdsl\u00e5m was a trail with several obstacles. [1]\n[ edit ] Proper definition\nSlalom and Giant Slalom make up the \"technical events\" in alpine ski racing. This category separates them from the \"speed events\" like Super-G and Downhill .\nA course is constructed by laying out a series of gates. Gates are formed by alternating pairs of red and blue poles. The skier must pass between the two poles forming the gate. (Strictly speaking, the tips of both skis and the skier's feet must pass between the poles.) A course has 55 to 75 gates for men and 40 to 60 gates for women.\nFor slalom the vertical offset between gates is around 9 meters (30 feet) and the horizontal offset around 2 metres (6.5 feet), although these figures have changed in recent times because of significant technical developments in ski equipment (namely, increased sidecut ) that have revolutionized the sport. The gates are arranged in a variety of different configurations to challenge the competitor, including delay gates and vertical combinations known as hairpins and flushes. A hairpin is a series of gates including two gates with one closing gate. A flush is a series of gates including three or more gates with one closing gate. The worldwide governing body, FIS (Federation Internationale de Ski) has a set of regulations detailing what configurations are allowed or mandated for an official course.\nBecause the offsets are relatively small in slalom, skiers take a fairly direct line and often knock the poles out of the way as they pass, which is known as blocking. (The main blocking technique in modern slalom is cross-blocking, in which the skier takes such a tight line and angulates so strongly that he or she is able to block the gate with the outside hand.) In modern slalom, a variety of protective equipment is used such as shin pads, hand guards, helmets and face guards.\nRules for slalom skiing are managed internationally by the International Ski Federation . In the United States, skiing events including slalom are managed by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association .\nFor those who live in a warmer climate, slalom skiing is defined as water skiing with only one ski through a course very similar to the downhill skiing version. The boat drives through the middle buoys while the skiier cuts through the water from side to side, rounding a buoy on each pass.\n[ edit ] History\nThe rules for the modern slalom were developed by Sir Arnold Lunn in 1922 for the British National Ski Championships, tried by the FIS in 1928, and adopted for the 1936 Winter Olympics. Under his rules, the gates were marked by pairs of flags rather than single ones, were arranged so that the racers had to use a variety of turn lengths to negotiate them, and scoring was on the basis of time alone, not time and style.\n[ edit ] Innovation and rule changes\nIn the early 1980s, bamboo poles were replaced by hard plastic hinged poles invented in 1979 by Peter Laehy and Stefan Dag of Aspen based rapidgate, inc. The new gates allowed skiers to take a much more direct path down a slalom course through the process of \" cross-blocking \" or \"as shinning\" the gates. Cross-blocking is when a skier's legs go around the gate with their upper body aiming at the gate and their outside arm going forward and their outside pole would hit the gate and their shinguards would hit the gate down. The rigid nature of bamboo gates had forced skiers to maneuver their entire body around each gate, while the hinged gates require only that the skis and boots of the skier (as the FIS rules state) go around each gate, with the body passing through or on the inside of the pole. In the early 1990s, flags were removed completely from slalom gates in international competition.\n[ edit ] Equipment\nWith the innovation of \"shaped\" skis around the turn of the 21st century, equipment used for slalom in international competition changed drastically. World Cup skiers commonly skied on slalom skis at a length of 203-207 centimeters in the 1980s and 1990s but by the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , the majority of competitors were using skis measuring 160 cm or less.\nThe downside of the shorter skis was that athletes found that recoveries were more difficult with a smaller platform underfoot. Over concern for the safety of athletes, the FIS began to set minimum ski lengths for international slalom competition. The minimum was initially set at 155 cm for men and 150 cm for women, but was increased to 165 cm for men and 155 cm for women for the 2003-2004 season.\nAmerican Bode Miller hastened the shift to the shorter, more radical sidecut skis when he achieved unexpected success after becoming the first Junior Olympic athlete to adopt the equipment in giant slalom and super G in 1996. A few years later, the technology was adapted to slalom skis as well.\n"}], [{"score": 901.5767, "uuid": "b46a7fae-cb14-5bdd-a9bc-95b16931bf95", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-01-25590", "target_hostname": "www.skimountaineer.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skimountaineer.com/EquipInfo/Equipment.html", "page_rank": 1.3808086e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Ski Mountaineering &amp; Backcountry <em>Skiing</em> Equipment", "snippet": "Adjustable ski poles are a big advantage for ski mountaineering, since it <em>is</em> much <em>more</em> efficient to have a longer pole when touring <em>or</em> <em>skiing</em> uphill than when <em>skiing</em> downhill.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ski Mountaineering Equipment | Equipment 2 | Book Reviews | Web Links\nBasic Information and Brief Reviews of Ski & Snowboard Mountaineering Equipment\nModern ski and snowboard mountaineering equipment makes it possible for any reasonably athletic person to do trips which a few decades ago were possible only for the most hardened climbers and backcountry travelers. Ski mountaineering gear is becoming consistently easier to use and lighter in weight, although perhaps also increasingly expensive. There are many choices these days in ski mountaineering equipment, but the most basic choice is whether to use alpine, nordic, or snowboard gear. Alpine equipment can be either standard downhill skiing gear or specialized alpine touring (randonnee) gear, whereas the only nordic gear suitable for serious ski mountaineering is heavy-duty telemark gear. Telemark gear has long been the standard in the US, although randonnee is rapidly gaining popularity. In Europe, the cradle of the sport, randonnee equipment has been the choice of almost all ski mountaineers for many years. In addition to the two \"traditional\" choices, snowboards are becoming increasingly popular in the backcountry, and snowboarding is usually the easiest of the three forms to learn for those with no previous skiing experience.\nThe best choice of equipment is the type one feels most comfortable using for a given trip, since most ski mountaineering trips can be done on any of the three types of gear. In some difficult snow conditions (breakable crust, partially refrozen slush), alpine skis and snowboards have major advantages over telemark, while for long high-country or icefield traverses telemark is often best. However, the weight difference between alpine and telemark gear has been greatly reduced, although snowboarders still require the additional weight of snowshoes or ascent skis if the snowpack is not well-consolidated. I will concentrate here on alpine touring (randonnee) equipment, since that is what I use and it is the most natural type for those with a downhill skiing background, which is certainly true of the majority of prospective ski mountaineers. Randonnee is also the natural choice for those coming from a mountaineering/climbing background, since randonnee gear can be used with plastic or (very stiff) leather mountaineering boots (see below). There is also now expanded coverage of snowboarding equipment, due to the huge growth of backcountry snowboarding and the available gear over the past several years.\nThis page was originally created in early 1998. It was last fully updated in December 2000. Many interesting products\nhave been introduced since then, so hopefully I will have time to update this page again soon.\nAlpine Touring (Randonnee) Equipment\nAlpine Touring Bindings & Adapters:\nThe essential element of the alpine touring setup is the binding, which must allow the heel to be freed for uphill travel and yet secure it firmly for downhill skiing, while allowing the protection of releasability in case of a severe fall. A good alpine touring binding such as the Fritschi Diamir (left; info at Black Diamond and also the Swiss Fritschi site ) meets all of these goals admirably. This is the most modern randonnee binding available. It consists of a Titanal rail on which the toe-piece and heel-piece are mounted, with the rail attached to the ski by a hinge at the front and a hold-down lever at the rear. It is strong and light, accepts either downhill or randonnee boots, and it releases nearly as well as an alpine binding, both at the toe and heel. In addition, it is a step-in binding allowing hands-free operation, and it has a very tall four-position heel elevator to ease skiing up very steep slopes. It has even been used to ski from the summit of Everest by Hans Kammerlander in 1996! I have used the Fritschi Diamir for four years and have found it to be an excellent binding overall. There is an updated version available since 1999 (the Diamir 2), which includes a strengthened rail and redesigned heel elevators to resolve some durability issues, but unfortunately the heel elevator is now somewhat shorter and has only three positions instead of four.\nTwo other solid choices are the Silvretta 404 (left), which is THE classic randonnee binding, and the Silvretta Easy-Go, an updated and improved version of 404. These accept nearly any type of downhill, randonnee, or plastic climbing boot on account of their rigid wire toe bail, but they do not offer any release at the toe, only at the heel. New in 2000 are several versions of the Easy-Go series, the 500, 505, and 555. For those who use climbing boots instead of true randonnee boots (see below), the Silvretta 404 and 500 are the best choice, and are nearly identical except for lightweight carbon-fiber rails on the newer 500. The 505 and 555 also have the carbon fiber rails, and offer the convenience of a step-in heel, but because of this may not fit certain climbing boots. The Silvretta SL (no longer made) and the popular Dynafit Tourlite Tech are a different sort of binding from any of the others. They are both extremely lightweight bindings without any hinged bar, with the boot itself being clamped and hinged at the toe by a specialized fitting. These are by far the lightest randonnee bindings available, yet they do lose some ease of use (one must get out of the binding to switch from freeheel to locked heel or vice-versa) and also some skiing stability in order to achieve this. In addition, only randonnee boots with specialized fittings built-in to the toe can be used with them. There are several other bindings on the market, see the Marmot Mountain Works site for more info. Most alpine touring bindings cost about $300 or more.\nThe cheapest option for a person who owns downhill ski gear is to use an alpine touring adapter. The most popular of these is the Alpine Trekker (left, $180), although there have been a couple of other brands on the market. This adapter fits into your regular alpine ski binding, and then your ski boots clip into it, using a binding system similar to a step-in crampon binding. The adapter is hinged at the toe to allow free-heel uphill travel. For skiing down, you simply remove the adapters, put them in your pack, and ski down as you would at a ski area. I own a set of these adapters, my friends have used them several times and they work quite well. The big disadvantage is that this setup is much heavier (several pounds) than a true alpine touring setup, due to the weight of the adapters and the fact that standard downhill skis and boots are usually much heavier than randonnee skis and boots.\nMany people have emailed me to ask if randonnee (ski mountaineering) boots can be used with these adapters, which would allow for greater comfort during ascents. The answer is unfortunately, NO, because although randonnee boots will fit in the adapter, they will not fit in DIN standard downhill ski bindings. Randonnee boots meet a different DIN standard than downhill ski boots, since they have a rockered (curved) sole while downhill ski boots have a flat sole, and thus randonnee boots will not fit into the toepiece of DIN standard downhill ski bindings. On the other hand, most DIN standard randonnee bindings have an adjustable-height toepiece which can accommodate either randonnee boots or downhill ski boots.\nAlpine Touring Boots:\nA ski mountaineering boot is a hybrid of a plastic climbing boot and an alpine ski boot. It has the high cuff, lateral stiffness, and buckle closure of a ski boot, with a deep lug sole and an easily removable, lace-up inner boot like a plastic climbing boot. A switch allows the cuff to be locked (stiff flex) for downhill skiing or hinged (soft flex) for uphill skiing or climbing. The Scarpa Denali (left) offers perhaps the best mix of skiing performance and mountaineering capability, although they are somewhat heavy (about 8.5 lbs / 4 kg per pair). Although not the best for hiking, I have hiked in these boots up to 5 miles (each way) with 3000 ft of gain on the approach for several ski trips, without pain. The downhill skiing performance is very good, although not quite as good as my usual four-buckle downhill ski boots. Since 1999 the Denali has been improved by adding a fourth buckle, which should further improve downhill performance. Scarpa also makes several lighter weight models, such as the Lazer, Tambo, and Titan, for those desiring easier touring (or lower cost) at the expense of ultimate downhill performance.\nOther popular randonnee boots geared towards skiing performance include the Nordica TR12 and Raichle Concordia. The TR12 matches the downhill skiing performance of the Scarpa Denali, while the TR10 is a softer version. In addition, several companies offer lighter weight randonnee boots, such as the Dynafit Tourlite Tech series, Dachstein Tour AS , Garmont GSM SL , and Lowa Struktura , which have fewer buckles and softer flex for more comfortable ski touring and hiking. Most randonnee boots cost from $300 to $500. Although standard alpine ski boots can be used for ski mountaineering, randonnee boots offer the advantages of lighter weight, lug sole, and hinged cuff, for greatly increased comfort and climbing capability.\nAnother possible choice of boot is a plastic climbing boot such as the Scarpa Inverno/Vega (left) or various models by Koflach and other companies. These are compatible only with randonnee bindings which have a wire toe bail, such as the Silvretta 404 and 500 mentioned above. Plastic climbing boots have far too little ankle support for serious skiing performance, but are a good choice when randonnee skis are being used as approach tools on heavily crevassed glaciers or for winter climbs. However, a friend of mine uses the Scarpa Inverno and Silvretta 404 combination as his standard randonnee setup. He has even skied from the summit of Mount Rainier with that gear, proving that serious ski descents are possible. Plastic climbing boots are also ideal for use with the short figle skis described below . Some skiers also use very stiff leather mountaineering boots (such as Salomon Super Mountain Guide) with randonnee gear, especially for long traverse routes where weight is a major concern. And such boots are perfect for use with the short figle skis.\nAlpine Touring Skis:\nA randonnee ski is a versatile, lightweight alpine ski, designed for performance across the vast range of snow conditions likely to be encountered in the backcountry. It is typically shorter than a standard alpine ski, available in lengths of 160 cm to 190 cm, with a softer flex pattern and slightly more width for flotation. The Tua Excalibur MX (above) is a classic example, performing quite well on anything from ski area hardpack to powder to spring crud. Following the industry-wide shaped-ski revolution, Tua has now come out with a variety of wider shaped ski designs based on the classic Excalibur, including the Mito, Sumo, and Helium. Other popular brands of randonnee skis include the Atomic Tour Guide series, Black Diamond Arc series, Fischer Tour Extreme, and Volkl Mountain series. Dynafit also makes a series of lightweight skis, one of which is designed to be used only with its lightweight binding system. Finally, for the ultimate in lightweight randonnee skis, the custom skis used by Davo Karnicar to ski from the summit of Mount Everest in October 2000 are available for a limited time from the manufacturer, Elan Skis.\nStandard alpine skis can also be used for ski mountaineering, and a variety of so-called \"mid-fat\" and \"cross ride\" skis are popular with backcountry skiers. However, many high-performance models are too stiff for comfort in backcountry snow, and too heavy during long ski ascents or climbs on foot. Most randonnee skis also have holes drilled in the tips and tails (and sealed to prevent water entry into the ski), to allow the skis to be lashed together along with additional poles and a shovel blade to form an emergency rescue sled. Prices for randonnee skis are typically in the $400 to $500 range, which surprisingly is quite a bit cheaper than comparable downhill skis. But not as cheap as simply mounting randonnee bindings on an old pair of alpine skis, which is also a popular course of action for many.\nAdjustable Poles with Self-Arrest Grips:\nAdjustable ski poles are a big advantage for ski mountaineering, since it is much more efficient to have a longer pole when touring or skiing uphill than when skiing downhill. Most adjustable poles such as those from Leki and Life-Link use a twist-lock system, which works adequately but is prone to accidental loosening and to freezing tight in cold, wet conditions. Far superior is Black Diamond's Flicklock system (left), which uses a plastic clamping lever to allow instant adjustment and secure locking. The lower sections of the BD Adjustable Probe poles screw together to form a 6 foot long avalanche probe. The upper sections shown here are the BD Whippet self arrest grips. The pick of the Whippet is similar to that of a ice axe, and can be used for self arrest in quite firm snow conditions. The pick is mounted on a skewer which locks into the grip and shaft of the pole, and it is easily removed (about 30 seconds), to avoid impaling oneself in a fall when one is in terrain not requiring self arrest. As shown on the left pole, it is replaced by a \"dummy\" skewer which holds the strap, but does not have a pick. The cheapest way to acquire this setup is to buy the two Whippet upper shafts (sold separately), and then special order a male/female pair of the Adjustable Probe Pole lower shafts. Several other self-arrest grips are available (including the Life-Link Claw ), but the Black Diamond Whippet is the most effective of them and the only one whose \"sharp-end\" can be easily removed when not needed.\nClimbing Skins:\nClimbing skins provide traction while skiing uphill. Originally made of sealskin many years ago, most skins are now made of nylon or mohair. One side of the skin has hairs which grip the snow in one direction (backward), while slipping easily in the other (forward), to provide both good traction and (some) glide. The other side is coated with an adhesive which grips the ski base in order to secure the skins. This allows the skins to be removed and reattached hundreds of times, with minimal loss of adhesion. A metal loop at the ski tip and a metal hook at the tail provide added security. Skins are available in a variety of widths and with several attachment systems. For optimal traction, the skin should cover as much of the plastic ski base as possible while leaving the metal edge completely uncovered for adequate grip on traverses. This means buying them about 6 mm narrower than the ski waist, although some people (especially those using highly shaped skis) buy wider skins and then trim the waist portion to the proper width. ( Life-Link also now makes skins pre-cut to fit various shaped skis.)\nThe two standard types of skins typically available are nylon and mohair. In general, nylon skins are more durable and retain less water than mohair, while mohair provides somewhat better glide -- overall, most ski mountaineers choose nylon skins. A fine choice for most ski mountaineering trips are the Ascension Skins now sold by Black Diamond (upper left), in a 60-64 mm width with the TTP or \"Euro\" attachment system (far left, with a stretchy rubber tip loop and fixed tail hook). This attachment system is superior to the standard method (near left, which uses a metal tip loop and no tail hook), since the skin is less likely to peel off accidentally under a lateral load (such as while traversing). However, it is a good idea to carry a spare rubber tip loop on longer trips, in case of possible breakage. Other good choices of skins are similar models made by Pomoca, Colltex , and G3 .\nA very different type of skins are Voile Snake Skins (lower left), which are made of plastic with grooves cut in the bottom. The Snake Skin is stretched tight along the ski, which raises small \"scales\" to provide traction. The Snake Skin is strap-on, with no glue. Its advantages include freedom from icing and low maintenance, at the expense of poorer uphill traction and much diminished traversing ability relative to nylon skins. Snake Skins cost about half as much as most good nylon skins ($50 vs. $100), and are best suited for \"yo-yo\" type ski runs instead of serious ski mountaineering ascents.\nSki Crampons (Harscheisen):\nIn some situations, the snow is too firm and steep for skins alone to provide the necessary traction. Ski crampons provide an added degree of safety on steep, icy traverses and also allow one to ski straight uphill more steeply in slippery conditions. Ski crampons are available as an accessory for most randonnee bindings, including the Fritschi Diamir (left) and the Silvretta 404 and Easy-Go series . These ski crampons usually attach to the hinged portion of the binding, thus releasing from the snow to allow forward motion when the heel is raised. Longer teeth are typically better, since they will penetrate the snow even when the heel elevators are in use. (Note that the Fritschi crampon shown at left is the original version, and the teeth have unfortunately been shortened a bit on the current version.) Ski crampons are also available for the Alpine Trekker touring adapter and for direct attachment to the ski topskin (useful for telemarkers), although these types are fixed in place and do not swing up with the heel. All types of ski crampons simply snap into place within seconds, and are easily removable when not needed. I bring ski crampons along with me on nearly every trip since they weigh little, and when the skinning conditions become tricky (firm or icy, such as nearly every spring morning), they are truly indispensable.\nSections: Alpine Touring | Figle/Skiboard | Telemark | Snowboard | Avalanche Safety | Lightweight Mtneering | Useful Gadgets | Where to Buy?\nFigle Skis and Skiboards:\nFigle skis and skiboards are very short, wide alpine skis which have become increasingly popular in Europe over the past several years, with a wide range of brands and types available. One of the originators of this trend is the Kneissl Big Foot (left), now available in several models ($150-$250). This is a 63 cm long, metal-edged ski, with the edge wrapping around the back of the ski in a semi-circle. It comes with a binding very similar to a step-in crampon binding (i.e. rigid wire toe bail and adjustable heel lever), which accepts any downhill, randonnee, plastic climbing, or step-in crampon-compatible leather mountaineering boot. The Big Foots weigh only 3 lbs (1.4 kg) per pair, so they are ideal for trips with very long approaches for relatively short ski runs (late summer hikes which cross snowfields, for example, or perhaps even for skiing on remote desert volcanoes in the Andes ). Since I always use trekking poles on any hike, and my usual stiff leather mountaineering boots are step-in crampon-compatible, carrying the Big Foots is a small burden for the big reward of being able to ski a snowfield during a hike/climb instead of sliding down on my butt! Due to their very short length, however, skiing on Big Foots with a full pack may result in repeated face-planting if the snow is heavily sun-cupped or sastrugied, so it is best to shed the pack for the ski run if possible.\nA new skiboard introduced during the 1997-98 season is the Salomon Snowblade (far left), which is a 90 cm cap ski with a binding similar to the new Big Foots (wire bail at heel, lever at toe). This appears to be a considerably more high-tech ski than the Big Foot, with superior skiing performance. However, it is longer, bulkier, and heavier than the Big Foot, possibly reducing its usefulness for those trips mentioned above where the Big Foot shines. Since the Salomon Snowblade hit the market, numerous other companies have also developed similar 90-100 cm skiboards. For fun, check out this page from the Europa Ski Lodge store which has photos of many different models of skiboards.\nSeveral people have emailed me to ask about the possibility of using skiboards for ascents. Unfortunately, most skiboards come with fixed bindings (i.e. no free-heel capability), and thus they can not be used for ski ascents. However, some of them are becoming available with simple randonnee bindings, such as the Kong Grimper (lower left). Another option is to remove the fixed binding from the skiboard (down to a completely flat surface) and mount a randonnee binding such as the Silvretta 404 or 500 mentioned above. Older Silvretta models (the 300 and 400) can sometimes be found at a deep discount (try Marmot Mtn Works ), and these are often used with skiboards by winter climbers (for approach skis) or snowboarders (for ascent skis, see also below). Note that any standard skins of the appropriate width will work well with these short skiboards, since the skins are designed to trimmed to the proper length.\nTelemark Equipment\nTelemark Skis and Bindings:\nStrictly, the telemark is a turn which can be made using any type of free-heel (nordic) ski equipment. In general use, telemark equipment refers to heavy-duty nordic gear suitable for backcountry ski descents. Telemark skis are often quite similar to alpine skis, and in fact many people simply mount tele bindings on old alpine skis. Telemark skis are usually softer flexing, since a free-heel skier has much less leverage to flex the ski than a fixed-heel skier. Many of the major ski manufacturers produce telemark skis, including Atomic , Rossignol , K2 , and Tua , along with backcountry gear manufacturers such as Black Diamond . In addition to models intended for telemarking, skis intended as randonnee models often are ideal for aggressive telemark skiers.\nTraditional telemark bindings are very simple and inexpensive (about $80-$150) compared to alpine touring bindings. The two basic types are three-pin, which clamps down the extended toe of the boot, and cable, which uses a cable around the heel to hold the boot into the toe-piece. Cable bindings such as the Black Diamond Riva (top left), Voile Cable , and G3 Targa have long been the choice of most serious telemarkers, since they provide the greatest degree of stability and control for downhill skiing, and provide a more rugged attachment than three-pin alone. Cables can be used to supplement three-pin systems for an added margin of security and power on descents ( Voile 3-Pin Cable , middle left), while allowing easier touring with the cable removed. Most telemark bindings have no release mechanism in the event of a fall, although falls on tele gear produce less severe forces on the legs than with alpine bindings since the heel is free. Several companies have developed releasable tele bindings, foremost among them the Voile CRB Cable, although these systems are not very widely used. For 2000, Voile has also introduced its new V-Cam heelpiece (middle left), which allows step-in entry and can be retro-fitted to older Voile bindings. Heel lifters can be added as an accessory to most tele bindings to ease leg strain during steep ski ascents.\nBut by far the most revolutionary development in the history of telemark bindings is the Skyhoy (lower left), a joint project of Black Diamond and Fritschi introduced in 1999. This sophisticated binding finally brings all the advantages of randonnee bindings to the telemark world, with step-in convenience, reliable release, and torsional rigidity for edging power. It also carries the alpine disadvantages of extra weight and greater cost, since it weighs nearly 4 lbs (1.8 kg) and retails for $330. The Skyhoy can also take its own accessory ski brakes and ski crampons, with the brakes useful for lift-served skiing and the crampons nearly essential for serious ski mountaineering trips. This radical and innovative product is sure to cause a revolution among serious telemarkers over the next few years.\nTelemark Boots:\nTelemark boots can be made of either leather (similar to mountaineering boots), or plastic (similar to randonnee or plastic climbing boots). While many still use the \"traditional\" leather type, which are usually lighter and less expensive, more and more telemarkers are switching to plastic boots for their superior warmth, waterproofness, and skiing performance. The most popular plastic tele boots are the Scarpa Terminator series, especially the T2 (left) which has gained very wide acceptance by a broad range of telemarkers. Other major manufacturers of tele boots include Asolo , Crispi , and Garmont . Most leather tele boots cost $200-$300, while plastics are typically $300-$500. The taller and stiffer plastic tele boots are often designed for on-piste telemark racers, while the softer and lighter models a step below are much better suited for backcountry use.\nThis has been only a brief overview of telemark gear, since there are many other sites dedicated to telemarking and telemark gear. Visit Yahoo:Recreation:Sports:Skiing_Snow:Telemark for a list of sites with more telemark information.\nSnowboard Mountaineering Equipment\nBackcountry Snowboards (Splitboards):\nThe popularity of snowboards in the backcountry has been skyrocketing the past few years, in parallel with the vast growth of snowboarding at lift-served areas. Snowboards are an ideal tool for backcountry descents, since their large width provides floatation in a variety of difficult conditions, from heavy powder to breakable crust to wet spring glop. The usual stumbling blocks for backcountry snowboarders are the access and ascent, with standard techniques (other than simply hiking) including snowshoeing and using short alpine touring skis (typically 90-130 cm). However, both of these methods carry a severe weight penalty, as the snowboard must be carried on the pack during the ascent and the snowshoes or short skis carried during the descent.\nThe Voile Split Decision (below) provides an ingenious solution to this problem. This consists of two specially shaped skis which latch together to form a snowboard. The bindings are mounted parallel to the skis in touring mode, behaving as alpine touring bindings (left), while they are mounted across the board in snowboard mode, helping to lock the two halves together. The Split Decision comes with special wide skins which allow very steep ascents. After some initial quality problems, the board now gets very favorable reviews from those who have used it. The complete board comes in lengths from 159 to 182 cm, at a cost of $650, and includes special extra-wide skins (\"Tractor Skins\") which provide lots of traction for ascents. A separate Split Kit is available, which contains the joining hardware needed to convert any old snowboard into a split model, for those who can't afford the high cost of the full setup.\nThe Split Decision has been redesigned this year to be much more symmetrical end-to end and also eliminate the gap between the two halves (below right). A lightweight plate binding is also available from Voile for those planning to use plastic climbing, randonnee, or even telemark boots with the Split Decision (left). Also new this year from Voile is a longer, swallowtail version of the splitboard designed for deep powder snow. Planned for next season (2001-2002) is a ski crampon, which would help fill a serious need for many snowboard mountaineers. I believe that Burton is also coming out with its own splitboard model sometime in 2001.\nSnowshoes, Ascent Skis, and other Accessories:\nBackcountry snowboarders who choose not to use splitboards, either for cost or high-end performance reasons (a splitboard can never be quite as torsionally rigid as a single snowboard), will typically require some means of assistance for the ascent. While the well-consolidated snowpack of late spring and summer can easily be walked upon without sinking in, during winter and early spring snowshoes or ascent skis will be necessary to avoid the exhaustion of \"post-holing\" through deep snow. Snowshoes are the most common ascent aid used by backcountry snowboarders, since they are simple and require no additional skills to use. Good choices for such use are the new generation of plastic snowshoes such as the MSR Denali series (upper left), which are very lightweight and very inexpensive compared with traditional snowshoes. The advanced plastics are nearly indestructible, and the compact size doesn't get in the way once stored on the pack during the descent. However, in very light powder snow, the compact size may not provide adequate flotation, although extension tails are available to help somewhat.\nAscent skis offer the advantage of more rapid movement than snowshoes, especially on relatively flat or gently sloped terrain, yet they are still short enough to be stowed easily on the pack during descents. Numerous choices for ascent skis are now becoming available, depending on the type of snowboard boot one is using. For those using plastic climbing or randonnee boots, one option is simply to mount a randonnee binding on a figle ski or skiboard, as mentioned above in the Figle/Skiboard section. K2 has also developed some ascent skis for those using its Clicker binding system (lower left), along with Clicker-compatible crampons.\nRegardless of whether one chooses to ascend via splitboard, ascent ski, or snowshoe, an important item for every backcountry snowboarder is a pair of adjustable ski poles (see info above in the \"Alpine Touring\" section). These provide essential support during the ascents, and can then be collapsed to a minimal length for easy carrying on one's pack during the descent. In addition, poles can often be useful even during the descent, if there are any flat sections or very short uphills during the runout back to the trailhead. Snowboarding with poles takes some practice at first, but it sure beats having to take one foot out of the binding repeatedly, or even giving up the descent and simply walking the rest of the way back to the car.\n"}, {"score": 900.0561, "uuid": "08d9557b-a28b-54bd-9b8b-9bb2a01ecf90", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0702wb-14-17110", "target_hostname": "www.telemarktips.com", "target_uri": "http://www.telemarktips.com/Verbier.html", "page_rank": 1.1885168e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Telemark <em>Skiing</em>, telemarktips.com", "snippet": "Being able to ski anywhere you like, be it tree <em>skiing</em> <em>or</em> glacier <em>skiing</em>. <em>Or</em> anything in between.

After weeks of skiing on the weekdays, early and late season, the Sunday crowds can become a bummer. Fed up, we decided that Sundays would become our official touring day, sort of a Joy-Luck Club on Skis. Using the vast lift system that is Verbier, we would pop up high, move away from the crowds, and explore the vast backcountry in this part of the Swiss Alps. Verbier, in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, is perched perfectly on a sunny plateau halfway up the Val de Bagnes (pronounced \u0093Baan\u0094) and is ground zero for the type of ski adventures that we all dream of, and in the end, deserve.. Thirty minutes by car to Italy, and 45 minutes to France. With nearly 100 lifts that connect numerous villages\u0097collectively known as les 4 Vall\u00c8es\u0097accessible on one pass, Verbier is the perfect starting point for exploring on skis.\nRosablanche\nGetting off of work at 8am on a splendid morning in January, I hurriedly got changed from suit and tie to ski clothes and walked the five minutes to the Medran telecabine for our Sunday rendezvous. Bernie, Ace, Falkiner and I got the early jump on the crowds and three rides later; we were on the Mont Fort deck at 3330 meters (10,922 ft). I never tire of this viewpoint\u0097it is one of the most breathtaking in the Alps\u0097and take pleasure in it every time I come here. Classic mountains such as the Weisshorn, Dent Blanche, Cervin (Matterhorn), Dent d\u0092Herens, Pigne d\u0092Arolla, Grand Combin, Grand Jorasses, Mont Dolent, Mont Blanc and Dent du Midi are all within ones circle of vision.\nThe backside of the Mont Fort\u0085My first visit to Verbier was in 87 and back in those days only a handful of skiers were venturing off of the back, most notably John and Ace. They pioneered various lines back then, mostly on free-heel gear. A few years back, Bernie and I were showing a film crew from Jackson around. One of the skiers had grown up and skied all of his life in Alaska. This guy John was around to see the whole Chugach-by-air thing develop and competed in the early events. We were poking our heads over the edge of a couloir and he turned to me and said, \u0093Damn Bob, this is Alaska terrain\u0097lift served Alaska terrain!\u0094 I told him, \u0093yeah, but with bigger vertical and a croute au fromage and cold Cardinal waiting at the end.\u0094\nVerbier, along with Chamonix (an hours drive away), offer perhaps the steepest, most varied lift-accessed steep skiing in the world. Nowadays, with the help of shorter and wider shaped skis, many people ski the normal route off of the back.\nWe waited for everyone to start down the front side before we dipped into the soft snow blanketing the back. A traverse off left led us to the main bowl which opened up to concave delights only a glisse rider can know. I was psyched on this early descent in 92, to be with two guys who knew this area so intimately. I couldn\u0092t believe what we were skiing down\u0097the combination of gravity fed steeps along with error forgiving powder certainly made for the perfect blend. Twenty minutes later we came to a stop on the Grand Desert (say with French accent), a huge glacier that is another link in the famous Haute Route chain. Sunscreen slathered, skins slapped on and poles lengthened, we started up the Grand Desert, no one else around.\nWhile everyone was queuing up at the lifts, we quietly moved up the immense glacier, acres and acres of light and dry all around us. After a few hours we skinned up to near the summit of the Rosablanche. A short scramble later, we were munching Ragusa (the best chocolate known to man\u0085) and eying various peaks, cabanes, and future descents with Ace\u0092s Leica binoculars.\nThe descent from 3336 meters to the village of Siviez at 1730 meters (10,940 ft to 5674ft) took nearly two hours. We followed John in tight fighter formation as he led between barely perceptible dips that we knew were hidden crevasses. Farther down the run we experienced snow crystals that had grown to the size of small leaves, something that I had only seen in books. Finally we stopped on a flat run out, turned and looked back at our four tracks cut through the knee- deep diamond dust.\nTop: Steve Hadik Bottom: Bob Mazarei. Photos: Mark Shapiro\nThen we looked at each other, and no one said anything. We could see it in each other\u0092s eyes, and nothing needed to be said.\nFionnay\nI had heard of this really cool village up the valley from friends and I wanted to visit but it was January and snowed in until spring. Towards the end of the month we skied to Fionnay.\nBernie, Ace, John and I had a new member with us. Abson was an ex-Canadian freestyle member with a strong inclination towards hilarious good-old-days stories sprinkled with tales of sexual prowess. He was on a three-year snowboard kick at the time but got talked into skis for this adventure.\nOn top of Mont Fort early, Ace and John decided upon our route down to start the tour. Foolishly, I was expecting straight off of the back, which had soft snow when we had skied it last. I had brought along a pair of Tele Sauvage that were perfect for the fluff but had edges as dull as an Economics class at 8am. They decided on the SW face. We traversed high and sidestepped up a bit only to look down this very steep and exposed face.\nBob Mazarei. Photo: Mark Shapiro\nThe pitch was magnified by the cliff band that ominously traversed the face 40 meters (130ft) down. Steep and soft is the ultimate situation where one can flow and go\u0097the steep and firm I was looking down had me shuddering in my boots, heart trip-skipping in my chest.\nPhoto: Nigel Lumsden..\nAnyway, the boys got into it, very gingerly sideslipping into cautious parallel jump turns. This was not a situation for telemarks as it was so steep and firm that the parallel was the only solid turn to go for. I thought to myself ok, control the breathing. No problem, I can do this\u0085I\u0092ll just sideslip down a bit then go for some turns. As soon as I got in I realized that I couldn\u0092t control my sideslip with the dullards that I had on. Terrifying stuff, considering the man-eating cliffband. Ace saw my situation and as I sketch-slipped up to him (thankfully it was a bit less steep here) he said, \u0093Bob, plant your pole back by your heel, jump the parallel but land the skis straight down the fall-line, then turn into a controlled skid.\u0094\nIt can be very dangerous sometimes to do a complete jump turn from one stance across the fall line to another that is across, one can easily trip on landing, leading to a headfirst plunge. I took his advice about the jump \u0093J\u0094 turn and got past the cliffband. We proceeded down one at a time so as not to get caught unawares.\nMy heartbeat started slowing down sometime after we started putting skins on. It started racing again after looking back up at what we had descended. We were now on the edge of the Grand Desert with views up and across the Val de Bagnes that are as awesome as anywhere on Earth. We each fell into our own rhythm-of-the-skin; attitudes well adjusted, rolling up and down the terrain. The map was brought out for the benefit of the novice in the group (me) while John pointed out passes and peaks. We soaked in the surroundings, and like a hundred more times in the ensuing years, I was awestruck at the beauty and grandeur of it all.\nAfter some time we reached the col that marked the beginning of our descent. I sat and checked the route slack-jawed as it disappeared out of sight. The run was basically an immense gully that descends for nearly 2000 vertical meters (6500 v.ft) all the way to the chalet roofs of Fionnay. As it turned out, the gully was not basic at all, but a crazy, wonderful concoction of varied snow conditions that had me reaching into the bag of techniques the whole way.\nFirst turns were by Bernie, who has one of the most powerful telemark styles I have ever seen. He is hyper-vite, as the Swiss say, and cat-like in his execution. Like a tai-chi Snow Leopard, his athleticism comes from\u0097and is honed by\u0097his years of playing professional soccer. His overwhelming desire to just shred any condition is infectious\u0097we all ski better because of him. Falkiner is one of the most stable, smooth and complete skiers around. Economy of motion and experience\u0097in all the forms of mountain sport (as well as mountain culture)\u0097are his trademarks. It is a bit of a cliche, but if anyone can be called a guru, it is John.\nHe is my guru, anyway.\nAbson in those days, was always jiveing us about skiing\u0097snowboarding is the best, he would proclaim. He has since come full circle again dividing his time between boarding, and the joys that the new generation of skis afford (it is truly a great time to be a skier). We even see him on tele gear from time to time.\nAnd then there is Ace. Ever since I had first skied with Ace I realized that he never believed the dogma\u0097as some do\u0097that you must always try to use the telemark turn. This type of thinking is especially prevalent in Europe\u0097that making parallel turns are somehow cheating. I think this stems from\u0097at least in Europe\u0097a racer mentality that a lot of Swiss-German speaking skiers have. Ace believed the opposite. He would try and ski the most difficult conditions\u0097conditions that heavily favored the telemark\u0097alpine style. And he ripped tele, no worries. I remember skiing with him in Telluride\u0097the \u0093Home of the Bump\u0094\u0097in the late 80\u0092s. He would just schralp the steep moguls alpine style. I could only shake my head. \u0093Yo Ace, do some tele\u0092s for me,\u0094 I would ask. \u0093Yeah, ok,\u0094 as he flashed by, his upper body looking exactly the same as when he were doing the alpine turns. This kind of thinking had a large effect on all of us, and we would find ourselves going parallel through the hardest \u0093carton\u0094 (pronounced French-style\u0097means breakable crust) and the heaviest powder. He constantly challenged us with his light, and seemingly effortless skiing. When Ace turned it on, there was nothing more pleasing to the eye.\nI moved to Verbier for precisely this type of apprenticeship.\nBernie got old powder for his first forty turns, blowing through it like he was late for his date with Miss February. We were hooting like school kids playing socco in the yard. One at a time, we worked that old pow, egging each other on. Then traversing left of the gully; we each picked a different line. Firm carvable snow in between the rock garden led to a fine, lightly breakable \"souffle\" down below. Pitch variations and a thousand different fall lines brought out creativity in our descent. There were steep couloirs all around us, years worth of possibilities. I wondered how often this stuff gets skied anyway. I have since learned that people around here ski in some of the most unlikely places.\nAfter descending for almost two hours, we glimpsed Fionnay. Coming around a corner, we almost skied over the dead carcass of a Bouquetin, an Ibex that is indigenous to the Alps. From what we gathered, the poor beast fell from rocks way the hell up above the gully. Bouquetins are among some of the most surefooted of animals, but even they can get killed sometimes, a reminder to the vulnerability of living beings in the mountains. Towards the end of the descent we were forced to the left of the gully, sideslipping next to big chunks of avalanche debris where the gully got steeper and skinnier. A talus cone traverse and minor bushwhack and just like that, we were in Fionnay.\nBruson\nIt was a white morning in this part of the Pennine Alps in Western Switzerland. We wanted to go for a ski so we decided upon a familiar plan, a plan borne of numerous days of skiing in the Alps. This plan would involve trees. Ahh, the trees. They are our best friends on these jours blancs. On normal sunny days, not much attention is paid to the life giving forest. Sure, we go by them skiing moguls or powder, looking at the spaces between the trees. And we go by not truly appreciating the forest until the weather turns. Not only do the humble trees anchored firmly to our earth give us the gift of oxygen, they give us skiers the gift of three-dimensional vision on the jours blancs\u0097the white days. They give us the ability to let loose and go fast.\nFriends from Colorado were visiting, everyday tasting a bit more of what our mountains have to offer. They live in the ski towns of \u0093Ski Country, USA,\u0094 but return year after year, like addicts that can\u0092t quite drop. It has to do with the expansive, easily accessed terrain. Not having to fight to get to the fresh snow first.Being able to ski anywhere you like, be it tree skiing or glacier skiing.\nPhoto: Nigel Lumsden\nOr anything in between. It is about, most of all, the freedom.\nThis freedom also relates to the equipment we are using...telemark gear that is perfectly suited for anything from excursions off of the ski lifts to heli-skiing, to first descents off of Himalayan peaks. to powder and mogul skiing. From terrain parks and halfpipes to simply skinning up with friends to your favorite high mountain cabane to take photographs, drink some wine, and have a croute au fromage.\nWe rode the telecabine down to the valley floor heading for Bruson on the other side. Although I hadn\u0092t really thought about the trees in a while, peering through the blurry window at the forest beyond, I did now. I looked up at Tom and he gave me a crack of a knowing smile. We both knew those trees pretty well. Surprisingly, halfway up the lift, the clouds started to break. There was untouched powder everywhere, a still life canvas undisturbed by any skiers. We soon discovered why...there were only 15 other skiers at Bruson.\nFifteen centimeters of powder covering the smooth piste went first. We ripped fast round turns, sometimes parallel and sometimes in a telemark, as easy and precise as sharp scissors through fine silk. The powder piste gave way easily to our tele gear. Fresh snow next to the piste fell next. This was all very casual, mind you, as the fifteen other skiers would have attested to. With a light heart, we skied knee-deep powder all day without once crossing a track. I have always thought that the tree skiing in this region is the best that I have ever seen. This day didn\u0092t prove any different. As we skied yet another exquisite lap through the steep, perfectly spaced trees, I had to stop for a moment because I was cracking up. After calming a bit, Tom asked me what was so funny. I said, \u0093oh, I was just thinking back to the intro section in that American ski magazine that proclaimed there was no tree skiing in Europe!\u0094\nNorth Face Mont Fort\nBeing on the Mont Fort is truly breathtaking. Besides the view, which one must see, and most photographs don\u0092t do justice to, one is awestruck and just a little frightened by the exposure of it all. The front side develops large bumps and is steep. The backside you already know about, and then there is the North Face. I\u0092ll never forget the first time I went up there\nIt was one of those spur of the moment runs that happen when wondering what to ski next. Bernie, Canadian Doug, and I got to the Mont Fort when we encountered Norbert. Now, Norbert is a true local, meaning he is a Bagnard (pronounced banyard). Young Bagnards are savages in there own special way, and I mean this in a good sense. They grow up hunting mushrooms and wild boar, are sturdy as the forest trees in the Val, and say, \u0093Ca va ou Quoi\u0094 a lot. Williamine, Fendant, and Bon Pere are the drinks of choice, meat and fondues, the nourishment. And they grow up skiing the big mountains\u0097well.\nNorbert was one of our best alpine bump skiers\u0097and then he tried telemark. Most of the time nowadays, we see him in knickers, long wool socks, and wool mittens, even on the coldest days, slicing and dicing telemarks. Half the time I see him skiing without any gloves on.\nIt was decided without my input\u0097I had never been up there before\u0097to ski the North Face. This descent requires you to grab a rope with your right hand with skis over your left shoulder while you work your way up this slick snow arete. Then the rope is gone, and you have to make your way along the snow spine that is a meter and a half wide but feels less than half that width because of the exposure on either side. Norbert was up and fairly running along the spine in his olive knickers. Half way along the top\u0097I was feeling pretty anxious at this point\u0097we came upon this big sloping rock cutting the snow in two. Norbert takes half a step back and launches over it like he was hopping out of a pick-up truck. I got on all fours and made like a lizard to get past the obstacle. Bernie was cracking up and told me he was the same way the first time.\nPut skis on? Where, here? A 15 meter, way exposed sidestep was the next heart-stopper. Gripped, I called out to Bernie asking him to talk to me. He did as I slowly made my way down. Talking to him as I went calmed me. The sidestep over, he related to me the time he came in here with Powers, got all the way to the face, only to find it iced up. And once you are in, you can\u0092t really back out of it either. They had to ski it.\nA hanging 90-meter traverse over the precipice got us to the start of the descent. Looking down, I felt a slight twinge remembering the icy face story. But happily there was powder. The fluff was about 20cm (12 inches) deep and the untouched blanket was sprinkled with ice chunks that stuck out of the surface like so many frozen tiki-heads. Oh yeah, and then there was the cliffband.\nNorbert jumped in tele-ing from the outset, the soft snow permitting more outrageousness than slopes this steep would normally allow. Bernie, Doug, and I followed his lead, doing reachy pole plants right down the fall line. We skied down as close as we dared to the cliffband then hooked left accessing the lower part of the face. The second half was especially sweet, knowing it was steep and soft with a safe run out in case you did blow it. We did tele\u0092s where we dropped a meter and a half with each turn. Complete hero turns! Man, what an experience that was. Pumped after our descent, we stopped to check it out. Norbert then looked at me, and with a smile and a wink, pulled out a bottle of Fendant from his pack\nWe then had the 1400 vertical meter (4600 v.ft) descent all the way to Siviez.\nPlateau du Trient\nBig Tim was over on his annual pilgrimage, and he had brought Salt Lake Brian and Dan-O with him, too. This time of year is always a rocking time for me\u0097BT\u0092s arrival. Hell, everyone in town looks forward to seeing the \u0093100 Kilos (220 lbs) Of Telemark Fury.\u0094 We always let the Big Guy get first tracks when he is in town, as he is an awesome gauge of how the snow conditions are.\nIf he is busting through the Weyerhauser (le carton), it means we will probably stay on top. If he is gouging the firm, it means we have to pressure extra hard. Light powder or heavy powder; crud, glop, or candy shop, it doesn\u0092t matter because BT powers through like a Peterbilt that has lost it's brakes down Interstate 5's Grapevine Hill. That\u0092s Power with a Big \u0093P\u0094 son. Hell of a football player in high school, too.\nWe had been skiing the classics all week, having superb weather and lots of fresh snow. Well, in Verbier, finding soft snow to ski is rarely a problem. A 15-minute hike here, ten-minute walk there, and you can be skiing hundreds of vertical meters of powder, sometimes weeks after a storm. It is so casual at times, that stopping for a long lunch or a quick drink never makes you feel like you are \u0093missing it.\u0094 It was such a good week, however, that we could only think of one other thing that would make it better\u0097a little heli-ski action. One phone call to Hans and it was set.\nI rushed out of work lickety-split the next morning and by chance got on the same bus as the rest of the boys. We met up with Hans and Big Tom from Telluride at the Savoleyres lift station. Big Tom and Big Tim\u0097the Twin Towers of Trouble. Big Tom (perhaps the best 6\u00927\u0094 mogul skier in the world) along with his wife little Marie, live in Telluride, but ski there maybe two days a season. Little Marie was born in Verbier (a Bagnard). They spend two months of every year skiing their brains out here. Why? Because they prefer it that way.\nWe all rode the lift up to Savoleyres and skied down to the \u0093airport.\u0094 This staging area is 100 meters from the piste and very convenient. Airplanes land here, too.\nIn ten minutes the Lama swooped in, plucked Dan-O, BT and Hans up, and deposited them on the Plateau du Trient 15 minutes later. The Plateau is one of four spots that helicopters are allowed to land in the Val de Bagnes. The Lama then picked Big Tom, Salt Lake Brian and I up. As we were flying over the beautiful peak of the Catogne, the pilot let go of the joystick and let the Lama fly by itself while he casually snapped pictures with his Nikon. I couldn\u0092t believe it! I was like, \u0093dude, conduisez l\u0092helico s\u0092il vous plait!\u0094\nThe Trient is impressive to say the least. The giant glacial plateau is surrounded by steep skiable faces on the French border side\u0097gems to be skied when conditions permit\u0097interspersed by wonderful spires of golden granite. And then there are the couloirs and glaciers below the Plateau.\nHanding me a radio, Hans led off down the Fenetre du Saleina, the snow knee-deep but contrailing in swirls\u0097 Space Shuttle-style\u0097behind him to the point where we could only see his head.\nPhotos: Hans Solmssen\nSwooping big-mountain Alaska turns; he turned the corner and disappeared.We realized then why Hans\u0097who was the first American to make the UIAGM grade in Switzerland\u0097gets hired for a month a year to guide the Chugach. The radio crackled, \u0093yo, you guys ready? The snow is sweet! Come down one at a time.\u0094 Spooning Hans\u0092 tracks, we worked turns at a serious clip. And so it went, on and on, blower knee deep, week old powder as light as anything you will find in the Rockies. Believe it.\nBy the time we got past the lower-angled crevasses, the snow covered car-sized granite blocks, and finally onto the jeep roads, we had skied well over 2000 vertical meters (6500 v.ft). We reached the road going to Italy and were high-five-ing in a farmers field, when I said, \u0093we have got to go back for more!\u0094 There wasn\u0092t any hesitation and no let up with the high-fives, as Hans pulled out his phone and made a quick call.\nTwenty minutes later the Jet Ranger touched down in the farmers field. We loaded up the clean-machine, Hans in front, the five us in back. Phillipe, who bears a striking resemblance to George Clooney, took his time getting back up to the Plateau, giving us the sweet aerial tour. Back up, we donned skins and moseyed across the Plateau towards the Cabane Trient. A half hour later we were skin-zagging up the face behind the Cabane, the light just starting to turn golden. Regrouping at the top, we then focused our attention to the task at hand\u0085skiing the huge Val d\u0092Arpette.\nWorking south along the top of the Arpette, we skied a small face heading towards our entrance as I worked the tailgunner position. Hans hooked right through a not too obvious col, slipped slick as could be through it, rolled his knees left then right and came to a stop in a protected niche next to a massive granite monolith. \u0093Done this a few times, eh Hans?\u0094 I joked. We got into position next to Hans on the wave of snow extending up from the niche, and got a good look at our couloir. I think we were all a little in awe of what was in front of us\u0097the couloir was steep as hell, and for lack of a better word, was humongous.\nHans led off, hands tight as he laid over turn after turn, his inside edges up above his knees at every apex. The powder was just a bit heavier than earlier in the day, but certainly deeper. Back and forth, 100 turns, 150 turns, before he came to a stop, just a speck of red. The radio crackled, \u0093ok, you know the drill, one at a time.\u0094 He wasn\u0092t even out of breath.\nDan-O went next, working his big Iggy\u0092s as he sent rooster-tails into the blue sky, no doubt helped by his Skeg-edge. Tom, and I went next. I always joke with Tom saying, \u0093oh man, that was the best run of the year!\u0094 I say this all the time. So when I said it now, he looked at me like I was the boy who cried wolf. Salt Lake Brian then surprised us by skiing the whole couloir parallel on his Mito\u0092s, an awesome display to his Wasatch-honed prowess.\nBut in the end, it was Big Tim\u0092s show. He dropped in and we could all see that he was disappearing on every turn. The snow was just exploding skyward and we knew there was no stopping this train. Gigantor the Giant Robot was somewhere, raising his metal arms to the sky, praising the Power and the Glory that is BT.\nWe pretended we were snowboarders the rest of the 1200 vertical meters (4000v.ft) to the Champex-Lac ski station, working rolls and depressions, staying tight then splitting off, finessing it. Snaking through the lower trees, we finally hit Champex\u0092s piste where we proceeded straight to the restaurant where the first round of beer was on me\nLogistics\nGetting to Verbier is easy. Catch a flight to Geneva, Switzerland. My guess is that with the recent global situation, one can score great airfares with little effort. Zurich, Switzerland is another option, but it requires a bit more train time. Once you are at the airport, collect your luggage (you can change money here also), go through the Green Zone (nothing to declare) and hang a quick left, staying in the terminal. Keep going straight until you reach the large revolving door. Go through the door. Just ahead on the right-hand side is where you buy your train ticket.\nAsk for a 2nd class ticket to Verbier (credit cards accepted), either one-way or roundtrip (roundtrip is cheaper and is good for one month). When you have your ticket, ask when the (this is important) next Direct train to Martigny (pronounced Mar-tee-nee) is. (If you do not get on the direct train, you will have to change trains in Lausanne.) Look up and you will see the information board that will tell you times and which track (\u0093Voie\u0094) to go to.\nThe trains, conveniently, are downstairs. Look up at the signs and find the correct \u0093Voie.\u0094 The baggage carts work on the escalators, just roll onto one and take the ride down. Find a car that says \u00932\u0094 (2nd class) on the outside as well as the universal \u0093no smoking\u0094 symbol. Hop on, get comfortable and order a beer when the girl comes around with the cart.\nIt is a two-hour ride to Martigny where you get off. Look up and you will see a cute little train that has St. Bernards and telemarking monks wearing robes painted on its side. Get on the one that says \u0093Le Chable.\u0094 Thirty minutes later, you will be in Chable. Then get on the bus that says \u0093Verbier.\u0094 The bus will drop you off at the post office at the Place Centrale. You will see the tourist office straight across the Place.\nThe best deal going for the budget-minded is specifically tailored to telemarkers. The Bunker in association with Tua skis is offering \u0093Telemark Freeride Weeks,\u0094 this season which include accommodation in 4 to 8 person dorm-style rooms; breakfast and three-course dinner; free entrance to the swimming pool, Jacuzzi and ice rink; and best of all, demo Tua skis, Garmont boots, and pole rentals included for the week. No need to bring gear, if that is your inclination.\nBetter still is the same package plus two days of being guided to all of the best spots with UIAGM telemarking mountain guide, Stephen Hadik.\nLow season prices are:\n499 Swiss Francs per person, per week.\n699 Swiss Francs with two days guiding.\nOne dollar=1.65 Swiss Francs at the time of this writing.\nLift tickets for les 4 vallees is SFr 56 per day, a bargain.\nFor more info:\n"}, {"score": 899.40955, "uuid": "0fabd9f7-4e19-5a17-b9ef-ec92cdf65e79", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0607wb-31-04697", "target_hostname": "www.skicoupons.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skicoupons.com/groups.cfm/r/9/g/385/s/history", "page_rank": 1.3644511e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Snowmass <em>Snowboarding</em> Guide for Riders", "snippet": "There <em>is</em> over 4,400 feet of vertical, <em>more</em> than any other mountain in the United States.

We can all appreciate the improved thermal environment provided by enclosed gondola lifts that you sit inside, instead of totally exposed \u2018all-weather\u2019 chairlifts. Or the way that manual dexterity problems have been overcome by the installation of automated lift pass systems where an electronic chip in the card is detected by the machine from a distance. This means that you can go straight through the turnstile without having to root around in the wrong pocket for a swipe card. (The combination of gloved fingers and a slippery card often resulted in a stinging slap from the recoil of the elastic cord attaching the lift pass to your jacket!)\nAnd anyone who\u2019s ever experienced the anthropometric disaster that is the T-bar lift will not be sorry to see its decline! The theory was that the cross bar sat comfortably behind your bottom and dragged you up the mountain. Good plan, but they were \u2018designed\u2019 for two people to ride them together side by side. The chances of getting someone next in the queue with a bottom at the same height as your own were remote to say the least. The bar was more likely to end up around your knees or halfway up your back. One of you (and often both) inevitably ended up with a face full of snow at some point of the journey. Still, it helped to hide the humiliation of falling off the lift (as it was usually in full view of the queue).\nBut there\u2019s still the daily struggle to ensure that you\u2019re prepared for all weather conditions with hat, gloves, goggles, sunglasses, suntan lotion, lip salve, lift pass, phone, money, snack, and hipflask (most vital!) tucked into your numerous jacket pockets.\nAnyway, the big question is, should you ski or snowboard? For my part, I have always skied rather than snowboarded; it\u2019s nothing personal, just that I was pushed down the mountain at a young age on two planks instead of one. Like most skiers, I do admire the cool and effortless glide achieved by boarders but still I cannot bring myself to convert. I have often wondered why this is. I now know - snowboarding is not as ergonomically friendly as skiing!\nFirstly, let\u2019s look at the differences in posture. The neutral, forward-facing stance adopted by skiers as they carve their turns down the mountain comes more naturally to most; it eases the burden on the joints and muscles, working with more natural movements. The posture of a boarder, with one shoulder leading the way, puts more strain on the upper body due to the twisted position. And having the head always turned so you can look down the slope, can lead to muscular fatigue in the neck.\nIn addition to these anatomical issues, there is also the practicality of overcoming areas of flat piste (run outs). As we (skiers) view the run out from the top of the piste and negotiate the start of the schuss (skiing straight down) to ensure that we can gain enough speed to cover the ground, spare a thought for the boarders. They may have to unclip their bindings and walk, sometimes with one foot still attached - a very ungainly action - until a suitable gradient kicks in again where the board can slide on its own. Skiers also have extra tools to hand which can help in this situation - ski poles. Being able to gain momentum by pushing along is something that skiers gloat about as they leave the snowboarders in their wake.\nThere are, of course, differences in the equipment for each sport too. The one area where snowboarding can take a point away from skiing is the design of the boots. Snowboarders have the luxury of soft boots, something that after a full day on the slopes has a lot going for it. The external hard shell of ski boots makes them much more difficult to walk in. This may be the determining factor on whether to head straight to the bar and the gluwein after your last run or whether to head back to the chalet for a quick change of footwear! Ski boots have a huge array of adjustments that help you to get just the right fit to transfer your weight to the right part of the ski. These include the pressure strap, the clips and buckles, flex adjuster and cant adjuster. Boarders\u2019 boots have laces.\nStill, all boots now are far removed from the leather boots you had to nail to the wooden planks that counted for skis. Ski bindings hold your boots on the skis, and transfer the pressure you put on your boots to the skis, allowing you to control their direction. Modern skis are fitted with safety bindings so that the boot releases quickly from the ski when excess pressure is exerted or when the foot twists; ultimately helping to avoid injury when you fall. Ski bindings also offer good adjustability, not only to accommodate people with different boot sizes, but they are also set to accommodate the skier\u2019s weight, strength and skiing ability - important points if you\u2019re to avoid knee ligament injuries. Snowboards do have adjustability but it is much more limited, enabling users to change the angle of their feet on the board according to their preference but not much else. Without a quick release mechanism it means that snowboarders are attached to their boards until the bindings are manually undone - not a desirable prospect if you find yourself tumbling down the mountainside or sliding uncontrolled on a patch of ice. However, knee injuries are less common in boarders than skiers because their legs can\u2019t slide apart.\nThe winter holiday experience has undoubtedly improved dramatically over the last 20 years thanks to the consideration given to the anatomical limitations of skiers and the subsequent effects on design of the equipment. It\u2019s just a pity that fitness and ability are then left entirely to us!\nFrom 'The Ergonomist', January 2009\n"}, {"score": 895.4658, "uuid": "7339cb95-ac18-5a97-86c9-ab293be7f2fd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1018wb-80-28600", "target_hostname": "www.coloradoinfo.com", "target_uri": "http://www.coloradoinfo.com/wintervacationplanner/history-of-skiing", "page_rank": 1.2293466e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Colorado <em>Skiing</em> History: The History of <em>Skiing</em> in Colorado | Winter Vacation", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> our open space.

Once simply a mode of transportation, skiing has been used in military training and combat, as a form of recreation, and as a competitive sport. From long boards to short \"fat\" skis, telemark skiing to alpine skiing, ski jumping to slalom racing, skiing is more popular than ever before. And here in the Colorado high country, it lives on, not just as a sport, but as a thriving way of life.\nEMERGENCE OF SKIING IN COLORADO\nWhile the European sport and recreation skiing scene was quickly carving a popular niche at the end of the 19th century, skiing in Colorado and much of the West was emerging out of necessity. By the late 1800's, Colorado's high country was bustling with miners searching for the big strike. Men, many with families in tow, came from all over the world in search of a grand fortune, and they arrived to find a beautiful and harsh environment. Towering peaks and heavy snowfalls made travel by wagon, train, or horse difficult, if not impossible at times. Scandinavian miners who joined the influx of immigrants offered a solution. They taught their fellow mountain dwellers how to craft skis and use them to travel through the snow, whether it was simply to ski to town to pick up supplies, ski to school or visit friends.\nThe group most famous for ski travel in the mining days were the mailmen. These hardy individuals lashed on eleven-foot wooden boards, threw 25 pound mailbags on their backs, and traveled from one mining camp to the next, often over dangerous mountain passes in the dead of night when the crusty snow made travelling easier. Skiing soon emerged as a form of entertainment. Jumping and racing contests were established in camps to pass the long winter days. As the century came to a close and mining began to dwindle, skiing gained momentum as a sport and a form of recreation. Clubs sprang up throughout the state. As interest grew, so did the sports clubs' membership, which led to an increase in competitions but also provided companionship for a casual day on the slopes.\nIn the decades to come, a growing interest in alpine skiing, innovations in ski equipment, an increasing number of national and international events, and the U.S. hosting the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid led to a soaring interest in the sport. Small ski areas popped up around Colorado, and in January 1940, the first major ski area in Colorado was dedicated at Winter Park.\nAs tragedy struck when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the nation's focus naturally shifted away from recreational pursuits. However, during the war years, skiers in Colorado were still getting out on the mountains, even if the towropes weren't running. In fact, the war would be a major factor in the soon-to-come Colorado skiing boom.\n10th MOUNTAIN DIVISION\nIn 1941 the 10th Mountain Division, comprised, in part, of former collegiate skiers, coaches and Olympians, was established for military combat on skis. About 14,000 men trained at Camp Hale located near Leadville between 1941 and 1944.\nTraining for the 10th Mountain Division included snowshoeing, skiing, high altitude s\nurvival and cold weather training. To help the troops battle the elements, gear was subsequently revolutionized, and many of the innovations that sprung from Camp Hale provided models for modern day equipment. For instance, the men wore an all-around boot designed for use when skiing, snowshoeing, hiking or climbing, and ski bindings could be used for either downhill or cross-country skiing.\nThe 10th's most notable tour of duty was in Italy, a mission that eventually led the Germans to surrender. In a night assault, 10th troops climbed 1500-foot sheer cliffs thought impassable, and took the ridge which was a key position in German defense.\nPOST-WAR BOOM\nWith the war behind them, the troops of the 10th headed home, but many sought the mountain lifestyle they enjoyed during their tour of duty. In Colorado and throughout the West, former 10th Mountain Division soldiers discovered their own pieces of heaven, and many opened ski areas or helped run existing ones. To date, close to 60 ski areas in the U.S. have been constructed and/or founded by veterans of the 10th Mountain Division.\nAs the post-war economy boomed in the U.S., so did skiing. Ski areas installed lifts and T-bars, and night skiing was even instituted in Colorado with the first lighted runs at the Continental Ski Area on top of Fremont pass. In addition to attracting a flood of recreational ski enthusiasts, Colorado was also attracting major competitions. In 1950 Aspen hosted the World Alpine Ski Championships which marked the coming of age for skiing in this country.\nTHE AGE OF MODERN RESORTS\nUnlike the European ski scene that developed around existing summer alpine resorts that simply extended their season to accommodate the sport, Colorado ski areas lacked resort status. Restaurants, lodging, and parking did not exist at most ski areas, and it was only Aspen, with its Jerome Hotel, that could claim resort status In order to meet the rising demand, resorts at Breckenridge, Vail, Crested Butte and Steamboat Springs rose rapidly with great success. By the early 1970s Colorado had earned its status as a prime skiing destination and paved the way for more resorts to open up including Telluride, Keystone and Copper Mountain.\nSNOWBOARDING GIVES A FACE-LIFT\nThe sport of skiing, long associated with Europe's upper-crust, was gaining \"elite sport\" status in the U.S. The large resorts catered to people hoping for a posh destination vacation, which gave skiing an air of sophis-tication. Yet the ingenuity of a few \"garage\" and \"backyard\" invent-ors would add a fresh new element to the ski resort experience. By the mid-1970's a handful of innovators -- Jon Burton, Mike Olson, Bob Webber, Tom Sims, Sherman Popper and Dimitri Milovich -- had each developed what would evolve into the modern snowboard. By 1981, the first snowboarding competi-tion was held at Ski Cooper in Leadville, Colorado, and ski areas have never been the same since. Resorts that once subtly snubbed their noses at the enthusiastic riders, are now catering to their interests. Half-pipes and snowboard terrain parks have been built throughout the state, and many resorts host snowboard competitions that receive worldwide coverage. Though the sport is still relatively young, it is sure to be a force on the mountainfor decades to come.\nCOLORADO SKIING TODAY\nWith continuing innovations in ski technology, expanded terrain, and a world-class resort experience, skiing in Colorado just seems to get better and better. More than just the cash cow of the state's economy, skiing is sacred to many Coloradoans and those who travel here to live the mountain lifestyle. Though the sport will continue to undergo countless innovations as we move into the 21st century, there is a sense of certainty that skiing will remain for many, not just a sport, not just a form of recreation, but the only way of life.\n"}, {"score": 889.7775, "uuid": "c71c100a-1c59-5710-9637-5573800695ab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-80-32162", "target_hostname": "berlin.angloinfo.com", "target_uri": "http://berlin.angloinfo.com/countries/germany/ski.asp", "page_rank": 1.2243488e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Skiing</em> in Germany - AngloINFO Berlin", "snippet": "Green <em>is</em> easy, blue <em>is</em> average, red <em>is</em> <em>difficult</em> and black <em>is</em> very <em>difficult</em>. * The national <em>skiing</em> organisation in Germany <em>is</em> Deutscher Skiverband (in German) There are some other <em>more</em> local ski clubs such as: * Munich Ski Club who organises trips for members to resorts at discounted rates * Destination", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet this!\nInformation on skiing in Germany, the rules of the slopes and details of the facilities for skiers, snowboarders, cross-country skiers and other snow sport enthusiasts.\nGermany is not renown for it's ski resorts and facilities.

You can read more about the new BOTD round here .\n\u00c2\nCardbender: To start things off, can you tell the readers more about yourself?\nkennyxx: I'm 25, single, I'm from Czech Republic and I work as a technician for a notebook manufacturing company.\nCardbender: Do you put those spiral rings in books? :)\nkennyxx: You can be sure I do :D\nActually my job is related to the European service centre.\nCardbender: What else is there to do in the Czech Republic, other than poker ?\nkennyxx: I like going snowboarding, playing darts and photography. In fact we can do almost everything here except swim in the sea - there's no sea in CZ of course.\nCardbender: Great. When the Maniacs get hired to report at the WSOP, we can use you to take pictures :)\nkennyxx: Of course, but I need some money to travel there.\nCardbender: No problem, PS will treat us well I\u2019m sure! Snowboarding huh\u2026 I know a few Pokerstrategy members that like skiing/snowboarding. Is there a good place in Czech Republic to do this?\nkennyxx: There are not that many places here but I found some good snow parks around; however, the best skiing action is in France or Austria. I hope to go there soon! I'm trying to spend at least weeks there every year.\nCardbender: Great! I'll have to check out the snow there! Get a few more BOTD wins and your trip will be paid for!\nkennyxx: It would be nice :)\nCardbender: How did you feel about your play during the tournament ? Did you have any lucky moments or was it all skill ?\nkennyxx: As I wrote in forum, I was the luckiest community member last week. I remember I hit runner-runner-flush, then I hit a 1-outer set on the river later on... last hand I lost with AKs against JJ. I think I hit enough of them in a row during the tournament so it occasionally happens that I lose one of them.\nCardbender: It's nice when luck happens and it sucks when you don\u2019t hit those coin flips. Next time then :) When did you start playing poker ?\nkennyxx: I started in February (twice because I went broke within a few days), then I won some free rolls and started loosing my winnings so I stopped playing until May when I joined PS. I started to play more regularly at the end of August.\nCardbender: Do you ever play live games?\nkennyxx: Not yet, but I would like to. I don't know any players nearby, so my only chance to play live games is in Prague, which takes too much time.\nCardbender: You mainly stick to online play - do you have a preferred limit and game type?\nkennyxx: I mainly play at Titan and Party, while the MTTs on PokerStars. I\u2019m playing FL right now, I tried NL but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the SSS.\nCardbender: What was it that you didn\u2019t like about NL and SSS?\nkennyxx: It's only raise/fold or raise/all-in and I like playing with a bigger stack . In fact, I tried and ran for 39BB/100 in the first 1500 hands but I wanted to try something different. I like playing different game types that people don\u2019t normally play like Omaha , Stud and even Horse, which I have to say I didn\u2019t do to bad at.\nCardbender: Omaha is an interesting game. Do you play it often?\nkennyxx: No, I just tried it for a few sessions. I need to change the game from time to time.\nCardbender: Is there something in your game you are working on at this time?\nkennyxx: Now I\u2019m trying to improve my cash\u00a0game and finding a way to play limit cash and no limit tourneys altogether. I am mainly working on my cash\u00a0game play these days.\nCardbender: Sounds like a good combination.\nkennyxx: Sounds nice but it is not so easy - switching between FL and NL... I recently made a deposit on PokerStars for BOTD and found some FL tourneys, so maybe that\u2019s the way for me. I have played four of them now and reached one final\u00a0table :)\nCardbender: Great start! If you enjoy FL, the same will be true for the tourneys. Good Luck :)\nkennyxx: Thank You!\nCardbender: Have you set any short/long term goals?\nkennyxx: I don\u2019t like long term goals, I like to say I want to have this amount of money at this date etc\u2026 So I try to stick to short term goals. At this time, I am working on reaching the next limit , rereading articles this week, that\u2019s hell for me :) I have also started a blog.\nCardbender: Do you feel starting a blog will help you on you poker journey?\nkennyxx: I hope so, I hope it will be the place where I can discuss my play with others and cover the leaks in my game. Feedback will help my play progress.\nCardbender: The Pokerstrategy forum is a great place to discuss poker . I\u2019m sure it will help! How has your game improved since you joined PS?\nkennyxx: The improvement is huge - before I joined, I didn't care about BRM . Since I played SnG and tourneys only, I found that SnGs are no longer fun for me. I found too many leaks in my play, so I decided to leave them for a while and start playing cash games.\nCardbender: Since you joined PokerStrategy, have you found cash tables to be more profitable than SnG/MTT\u2019s?\nkennyxx: Yes, I was afraid of cash games before I joined Pokerstrategy but they helped me improve my cash\u00a0game a lot. SnGs were a losing game for me, but after joining I started to win. I read some interesting articles about cash games and they have become more profitable for me so far.\nCardbender: Have you attended coaching sessions or have you been involved in the hand evaluation threads?\nkennyxx: Last couple of weeks I became more active on the boards and I posted some hands too. I have found coaching sessions to be really helpful. I have to say thank you very much to all coaches and judges here.\nCardbender: Sounds like you're on the road to success!\nkennyxx: I hope so!\nCardbender: Do you have any favorite sports teams you want to give a shout out to?\nkennyxx: We have best hockey team in the world :D. Yesterday we beat Slovakia 7:0 in a friendly match :) *\\o/*\nCardbender: Do you think the Czechs have a chance vs Team Canada in the next world championship?\nkennyxx: I\u2019m not sure but we have a new coach now and some players are back in the national team (such as Jaromir Jagr), so we have a chance, but still, it's Canada\u2026\nCardbender: It will be a tough battle! :)\nNow for everyone\u2019s favorite, \"Pick The Prize\" !!! You won 13.38 this week in BOTD. If you had to spend you winnings, which one of the following items would you purchase?\nA vintage Batman water pistol.\nA can of premium armadillo meat.\nOne night accommodation at the luxurious Heldon Von Shoehorn Inn.\nkennyxx: That\u2019s a really difficult decision to make. I\u2019m going to request time\u202659\u202658\u202657...:) Since I have not much time these days, I will leave the accommodation offer for now. Armadillo meat could be interesting for me because of one of my friends is a really good cook and he can do almost anything you can imagine. But as I have my nephew next to me right now, I will choose the vintage Batman pistol for him this time.\nCardbender: Great choice! Tell him not to get too trigger happy :)\nIs there anything at all you would like to mention before the interview ends?\nkennyxx: I would like to wish all PS members the best of luck at the tables (but not against me :D)\nCardbender: Thank you very much for taking the time to do this interview, kennyxx. Best wishes for the future and I'll hopefully see you next week in the BOTD : )\nkennyxx: It was my pleasure, I wish you good luck also.

While to our knowledge, no political distinction exists between these proposed halves, the character of their respective ski scenes might very well differ. Does the rugged North triumph over the flashy South? Is the powder deeper? Are the runs better? We'll let you be the judge.\nBurke Mountain\nA tree skiers rejoice! Delightful Burke Mountain boasts more than 100 acres of glades, which is more than one third of its skiable acreage. Plus, a yearly average snowfall of 240 inches keeps those natural runs well supplied with fresh powder.\nAs the training grounds of a prestigious academy that has matriculated more than 50 Olympic athletes, Burke Mountain's layout literally has skiers and snowboarders graduate up the mountain . The lower slopes are for beginners , with wider berths and less aggressive grades, while the upper runs from the summit offer \"classic Vermont skiing\" on \"winding trails that ride the natural contours of the mountain.\"\nNorthern Vermont Ski & Snowboard Resorts Map\nClick pinpoints for driving directions.\nJay Peak\nIn terms of snowfall, Jay Peak is tops in the East . The Green Mountain resort sits in the direct line of prevailing winds coming off of the Great Lakes, which means that most major weather systems will dump snow on its slopes. Its average of 376 inches is the best skiers are likely to find outside of the Rockies, and that number is just one of many attractions that draw skiers of all skill levels to this small resort near the Canadian border. Another leading factor would be the resort's reputation as a haven for woodland and backcountry skiing.\nJay Peak has a very open policy where glade skiing is concerned. Essentially, skiers and riders are welcome to explore and test their limits in any wooded area within the resort's 385-acre boundaries, as long as they \"ski in threes and exercise caution when re-entering the trail system.\" The resort management recommends previous experience and \"a healthy dose of common sense\" to ensure that tree skiers stay safe, but not all of Jay Peak's gladed areas are reserved for experts. In fact, its 76 trails include the most intermediate-level glades in the Northeast.\nWATCH: Powdery Jay Peak Glades\nMad River Glen\nAlthough somewhat notorious for its ban on snowboarding , cooperative-owned Mad River Glen remains a magnet for serious skiers in search of a Northeast-style challenge. It's not a big resort -- only 46 runs on 110 acres of skiable terrain -- but a lot of what it offers comes packed with moguls, rocky crags and narrow glades. Yet that's not to say that it's all tough stuff ; smooth, broad, groomed runs from Birdland and the Fox-Vixen connector off the Sunnyside double lift are perfect for newer skiers, or anyone looking for a break from the intensity.\nStowe\nClose to Burlington and even closer to the action, Stowe is a quintessential Vermont ski resort. In operation since the 1930s, the mountain's 485 skiable acres and 333 inches of natural snowfall welcome generations of skiers, season after season.\nSituated on the slopes on Mount Mansfield, the highest peak in the Green Mountains, Stowe's trail layout clearly marks boundaries by skill level. Its famous \"Front Four\" are the steepest, most difficult trails at Stowe. Beginners can ride Toll Road from the summit of Mount Mansfield, then drop into a nest of green runs or cut low across the base of the mountain. Intermediate trails make up the bulk of Stowe's famous acreage . Equally notable are the apres-ski attractions at the resort, which include an on-mountain day spa and a performing arts center.\nDid we miss your favorite ski and snowboard resort in Northern Vermont?

You can do a five-day course to build you up to do this run (with the tutors then judging if you\u2019re ready or not for the challenge), or you can close your eyes and hope for the best.\nPhoto: Looking into Corbets Couloir, Jackson Hole\nDelirium Dive, Sunshine Mountain \u2013 Banff\nis only accessible through a locked gate, which is opened by the avalanche transceiver you have to wear if doing this bowl. You will also need a guide and a shovel if you are thinking of taking on this challenge.\nOnce in, a pretty short hike will take you up to the ridge and from there you can chose your route. There is an \u201ceasy\u201d way down which doesn\u2019t include jumping off a cliff, which is the preferred route for most, but locals will launch themselves off the overhang and into the steepest bits of the bowl.\nPhoto: Skiing on Delirium Drive\nFeuz Bowl, Kicking Horse\nis the steepest bowl in an already very steep resort.\nThe traverse along the mountain ridge isn\u2019t the easiest and then as the bowl drops away at a ridiculous pitch you don\u2019t really have a choice but to do the first turn into it and then give it all you have.

Perhaps the problem is that dramatic peaks are surrounded by steep slopes which are not appropriate for cross-country ski trails -- so might want to be prepared to rent snowshoes to hike to, or ride a mechnical lift up to see bigger views (but then also make inquiries about avalanche danger).\nSome of the \"alpine downhill\" ski trails (and alpine ski mountaineering tours) are more likely to have dramatic views than the cross-country ski trails -- but alpine downhill skiing (or ski mountaineering) requires different skills and equipment than cross-country skiing.\nSovereign Lake -- British Columbia, Canada (near Vernon and the Kelowna airport) -- notably technically interesting cross country ski trails, and connects to the Silver Star trail network (which also has alpine downhill skiing with lifts).\nKey drawback is that it's so far from any major airport.\nNorway -- where it all started.\u00a0 I've had fun XC skiing in Oslo Nordmarka (great skiing just a trolley ride from downtown Oslo), Sjusjoen ( cabins ), Geilo.\u00a0 Lots of skiers you meet on the trails speak English, though you might not guess that from the websites.\u00a0 See ski info - Story1\nBut lots of the trails I skied in Norway did not have so many interesting curves + fun dips + rolls as favorite ski centers in France and Italy (though not so different from average trails in France + Italy). I assume there must be more interesting fun ski trails in Norway, so if it's important to you to ski that sort of style, I'd suggest do some more specific research in advance, rather than assuming you'll find it on the obvious trails at the obvious places.\nAnd most of the scenery is not dramatic in the obvious way of some places in the Alps, so if you're looking to ski with a view of something more obviously dramatic than the wide spaces of the overall \"plateau\" environment, do some specific advance research.\n"}], [{"score": 875.67175, "uuid": "919961b0-a82a-5adf-b41d-ebb520ce258e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-73-27428", "target_hostname": "www.skiingthebackcountry.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skiingthebackcountry.com/ski-articles/Interview_Backcountry_Skiing_Author", "page_rank": 1.195828e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Interview about | <em>Skiing</em> The Backcountry", "snippet": "And the answer had always been <em>difficult</em>...

The book is part of the Mountaineer's Outdoor Expert Series and provides a great resource for beginning and intermediate backcountry skiers.\nMartin Volken on the Coleman Glacier, Mt Baker, Washington\nScott wrote the book along with Martin Volken and Margaret Wheeler. He has been an avid backcountry skiing enthusiast for the last 15 years. He is AMGA certified, teaches avalanche classes and guides for a company called Pro Guiding Service in North Bend, Washington. During the interview, he provided us with insight into the book. He also dared to comment on some hot topics related to backcountry skiing in general\u0085 Here is a transcript of the conversation:\nMargaret Wheeler finds some powder in Schweitzer, Idaho\nAbout the Book\nCan you tell us about the authors (including yourself)?\nScott Schell:\nMartin comes from Switzerland. He was certified as a mountain guide in Switzerland and moved to the US around 1991. He started a little ski shop in Seattle called Pro Ski Services. It must have been one of the earliest hard-core backcountry ski shops in the country.\nI met Martin when I answered an ad in \u009196 and eventually ended up managing his store. It was early on... We were selling lots of Fritchi and Dynafit bindings... I don\u0092t remember the numbers anymore, but I remember at one time that we sold more Fritchi bindings than any other single store in the country! We were selling the first generation Fritchi Diamars (which all broke by the way) before any ski magazine ever showed a picture of touring gear.\nSkiing the Backcountry :\n(So we can blame today\u0092s backcountry crowds on your shop...)\nScott Schell:\nWell, not really. My point is that it became a cool little epicenter, at least in the Northwest. And a lot of that comes from the fact that Martin had brought over his European training. There were a lot of good stories\u0085 Like when a guy, who was a Boeing engineer, came in to the shop to explain his brilliant idea of a binding with a hinge that allowed you to go downhill skiing and also go uphill if you just bolted a hinge underneath your bindings. And Martin said, \u0093oh yeah... Kinda like this binding?\u0094 and showed him the Fritchis. To the hard core people, the randon\u00e9e world was pretty much a mode of transportation to access ice climbing. For most winter enthusiasts if you were a skier, you were on telemark gear.\nThat was exactly my trajectory. I had heard that if I wanted to go into the backcountry, I needed to go get some goofy things called skins, and some leather boots. Even though I was a downhill skier! And so it was kind of an interesting time for the whole backcountry world. I do think that Martin had a little bit of a role in getting downhill skiers into the backcountry (at least in the Northwest) with randon\u00e9e gear.\nOf course REI and Marmot in Seattle were selling some touring gear. But they weren\u0092t making the crossover to downhill skiers. They were selling touring gear primarily to climbers.\nMartin, on the other hand, would convince downhill Skiers to buy randon\u00e9e gear instead of telemark gear for backcountry skiing. It was a different deal. Kinda neat.\nThen, Margaret\u0085 She got in to backcountry skiing in Europe. Out of college she spent a couple winters in Chamonix, developing some solid skiing skills. I met her a couple years later and was pretty immersed in the guiding world. I got her involved in guiding as well. She has now become one of only 3 US women to get fully certified through the AMGA to meet international IFMGA standards.\nSkiing the Backcountry :\nWho had the idea to write a book about backcountry skiing?\nScott Schell:\nWriting the book was my idea. I don\u0092t know if it was a good idea or a bad idea. It\u0092s a good idea now that it\u0092s done\u0085 At times, it seemed like it was a bad idea while we were working on it.\nAbout 3 years ago, I had the idea to write an updated backcountry guide book for Washington State. At an industry gathering, I asked a woman from The Mountaineers if there would be interest in the project. She responded by saying that their interest would be much stronger in a Ski Mountaineering/Ski Touring book that would be part of The Mountaineers outdoor expert series.\nThat conversation really turned a light on. I had always thought about the need for such a book. People would take intro courses and then ask what they should pick up to read. And the answer had always been difficult... There were a couple of good books that were out of print. There was Mike and Allen\u0092s Backcountry Book, which has some really good points, but is not all inclusive.\nAs I thought about the book proposal, I realized that such a comprehensive book would be a rather daunting task, and so I asked Martin if he would be interested and he said yes. Then, since Martin and I are not necessarily writers by trade, I asked Margaret if she would like to help. She is much more of a writer than both of us.\nThat\u0092s how the three of us ended up doing it. We created a book proposal and got it. 3 years later, here we are.\nSkiing the Backcountry :\nNow that it\u0092s done, what is one thing that you would like to say to your readers that was not included in the book?\nScott Schell:\nWow, that\u0092s a big question. Almost all of the topics could be further expanded upon. Whether more information would benefit the beginning to intermediate backcountry user is hard to say. It\u0092s always a challenge with a book of such scope. However, I think something that was edited a little too heavy was the navigation section.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nFunny you mention that\u0085 It seems like the majority of people who backcountry ski rarely get out and practice with their compass.\nScott Schell:\nThat\u0092s a big difference between the average North American backcountry skier and the average European backcountry skier. My perspective of being a mountain guide is that if you don\u0092t know how to use a map and compass, you sure as heck shouldn\u0092t have skins on your feet.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nIs there anything in the book that would be new information for your average backcountry enthusiast? Say someone who has taken a couple avalanche classes and backcountry skied for a few years.\nScott Schell:\nUphill travel and kick turns. It\u0092s amazing how many people (who have backcountry skied for more years than I am old) take our Intro to Ski Touring Course, come out of the class and say, \u0093I had no Idea that\u0092s how you walk up hill.\u0094 People always underestimate going uphill.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nWhat did you learn from writing the book?\nScott Schell:\nTime management is tricky. Better ways of explaining things. Again the uphill section was hard to write because there is little written about it in the detail we wanted for our book. How do we explain something that we have been doing for years, and can teach to someone in person? Making sure the words and the photos we used in the book accurately depicted what we were trying to say was very challenging.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nWhat sort of feedback has the book received?\nScott Schell:\nExcellent Feedback, so far. Lou Dawson\u0092s posted a nice review on his blog.\nGeneral Backcountry Skiing Questions\nWhat do you consider acceptable risk?\nScott Schell:\nFirst and foremost, acceptable risk in a group should be accepted by all group members. The risk level needs to be set to the lowest common denominator. The problem with acceptable risk is that it is rarely discussed until the group is actually traveling in avalanche terrain. I think acceptable risk should be discussed in some manner with the entire group before embarking on the tour. For me, my acceptable risk has decreased as I have gotten older.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nHave you ever participated in an avalanche rescue, or been involved in a slide?\nScott Schell:\nNo, I never have participated in a rescue. Yes, I have been in a slide. It wasn\u0092t very big, but I was definitely under for a little bit, and came out partially buried. It was in an avalanche-controlled side-country area. I recognized the slope, my partner spotted me, I knew enough that I recognized a hazardous wind pocket, but I figured I was in a controlled area and figured the snow would be good. Sure Enough the slab popped, about a meter and half deep, by forty feet wide. I went over a fifteen foot cliff and into a narrow trough, lost my skis and poles. It gave me a real appreciation for how fast things can go wrong, and the amount of force involved with something like that. I nailed a tree and still have a bum shoulder from it. That was six years ago. I think once you experience the acceleration of the snow it really changes your attitude on how much damage it can do. Definitely changed my outlook- I never want to be caught in a slide again. It changed my awareness of consequence.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nWhat is in your ski pack right now? How much do you think it weighs?\nScott Schell:\nThe guides training has ingrained in my head to be prepared. I do take all the things we wrote about, even ski crampons in mid winter, I have been burned too many times without them. It probably weighs around 20 lbs.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nThe ski industry is undergoing some dramatic changes. How do you feel about extreme skiers who push the limits?\nScott Schell:\nI think it\u0092s awesome. I think it allows the sport to progress. The athleticism is amazing.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nDo you think that the film companies bear some responsibility for a casual attitude towards backcountry safety?\nScott Schell:\nOne thing I don\u0092t like is that whole risk acceptance thing is not portrayed well in the mainstream movies. I do think they should take a more progressive role in either explaining how things are done, and or explain the consequences of the lines these athletes are skiing. In regards to avalanches, it seems the only footage they show is the uber athlete making it out of the avalanche path just in the nick of time. Not that I want to see people die or be buried but there is nothing being shown of the reality of the consequences. You don\u0092t see the behind the scenes- that there is a guide and a snow safety person evaluating which slopes these athletes should ski \u0096 I suppose this would not make the most gripping scene and that\u0092s probably why they don\u0092t bother. There\u0092s way more to it that flying out in a helicopter and pointing to which mountains you want to ski. I don\u0092t hold the movie\u0092s responsible for the complacent attitude in the backcountry, but I do think they can help improve upon the attitude in the backcountry.\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nHow do you view all of the recent technology advancements in avalanche safety gear. For example, airbags and multi-search beacons?\nScott Schell:\nI am most excited about the technology that will come from the airbag advancements. I think people need to dial in and practice their shoveling techniques. The bulk of the burial time is in the excavation of snow. The average amount of snow for an average North American burial is right around one ton! So shoveling techniques are huge! I always tell people, bring at least a shovel, beacon, and probe. But statistically if you forget one of these items, you might as well leave the other two because they won\u0092t do you much good. Those are the three main safety, but I think in the next couple of years the avalanche airbag may be a fourth item that avalanche instructor will say, \u0093If you don\u0092t bring these four items, don\u0092t bother bringing any of them\u0094. The airbag has some really good statistics and test results. With all the tests they have done almost no one gets buried!\nSkiing the Backcountry:\nThank you so much for your time! We really appreciate having the opportunity to talk with you. Happy skiing!\n"}, {"score": 873.474, "uuid": "e766440a-5db4-563a-b5d4-2b2dfae01a4f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1114wb-70-21314", "target_hostname": "www.glaciermt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.glaciermt.com/cross-country.php", "page_rank": 1.2211658e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Glacier Country Montana | Do | Cross Country <em>Skiing</em>", "snippet": "Provides three separate routes through the burn; one most <em>difficult</em> and two <em>more</em> <em>difficult</em>.

However there are certain runs that offer more contrast providing vast amounts of skiing/snowboarding when the flakes are falling. The trick is to head for the pistes that are tree-lined, as they help provide definition when everything else seems to be white. Keep in mind that the valley itself can be covered in an all-encompassing fog, but the top of the mountains can be bathed in glorious sunshine (check out the webcams! ). Also, if it\u2019s lashing down with rain in the valley, it means it\u2019s snowing up top, giving you the best and freshest powder you\u2019re likely to ski on! And because it\u2019s a bad weather day, chances are, you\u2019ll have the mountain to yourself.\nBad Weather Ski Areas in Courchevel\nWhen visibility is difficult due to snow or white-out, there\u2019s one important thing to remember: keep the poles in sight.\u00a0 The poles marking the edges of the piste are the colour of the difficulty of the run (green, blue, red or black). Have you ever noticed that the poles on the right side of the piste (looking down) have a 20 cm band of orange at the top? This is so that in a white-out when you really can\u2019t see very much, if you come across a pole with an orange top, leave it on your right. If the pole is one colour all the way to the top, leave it on your left. That way you\u2019ll stay safe & on piste!\nVisibility tends to be better in amongst the trees when there\u2019s a whiteout. So head for the black runs into Le Praz (Jockeys & Jean Blanc) or the red run (Brigues ). The long blue run into La Tania is also a good bet (Folyeres).\nAvailability Search\nSAVE TIME!

If you are experienced and like to go fast, your ski will likely be longer.\u00a0 Longer skis will also help with flotation on powder snow.\u00a0 Don't forget to take your ski boots with you when purchasing skis, so that the bindings can be fitted and adjusted for you by the ski technician.\nSki poles:\nSki poles help you to maintain your balance on the slopes.\u00a0 Generally speaking, to select the correct height poles for you, turn the pole upside down and rest it on the floor.\u00a0 Place your hand under the pole basket, your elbow should be 90 degrees.\u00a0 This may differ slightly if you have long or short arms relative to your body height, in which case you may want to try a few different sizes while skiing.\u00a0 If your ski poles are too short your balance may shift too far forward as you plant your poles in the snow while turning.\u00a0 If your poles are too long, your balance is likely to shift too far backward increasing your chances of a fall.\nIf you are purchasing poles, you'll have already established the correct height pole by testing rental poles first.\u00a0 The choice of alumnium or composite poles will largely be based on preference.\u00a0 Composite poles are lighter and more resistant to bending, but some people like the feel of a heavier alumnium pole.\u00a0 Small baskets on poles are good for hard-packed ski slopes, while big baskets don't get left behind in powder snow.\nSki Boots:\nSki boots should fit snugly all around the foot.\u00a0 There should be just a little toe wriggling room when the boots are fastened and your knees are bent.\u00a0 Loose boots will reduce your control over your skis.\u00a0 Boot lining packs down during skiing, so make sure you don't have excess space in your boots, especially if you are buying new boots.\u00a0 Boots can usually be modified to give you extra space later, but it is difficult to make boots smaller.\u00a0 If you are renting boots, point out any foot anomalies you might have, so that the ski technician can adjust your boots to make sure you are comfortable.\u00a0 You may need to try on several different boots, different brands, or male and female models, to get a good fit.\u00a0 If you have the option to rent boots at the ski hills, this is a good option, if your boots get uncomfortable you can have them adjusted or swapped during the day.\nDon't tuck your ski pants into your boots, it will create an area of pressure that will likely make you uncomfortable.\nSocks:\nFor comfort wear only a single pair of socks, preferably socks that extend above the top your ski boots.\u00a0 If you ski often technical ski socks are a good investment.\u00a0 Ski socks are thin and made of material that wicks moisture away from your skin.\u00a0 Some cushion key areas of your foot to help prevent blisters.\nHelmets:\nSki helmets reduce the risk of head injury by at least 29%.\u00a0 (Ref: http://www.csa.ca/cm/ca/en/search/article/alpine-helmet-standar-make-skiing-and-snowboarding-safer , 2005 )\u00a0 They have become popular with expert skiers and children.\u00a0 Keep in mind that while you wear a helmet your hearing may be reduced.\nSki helmets are insulated and provide impact protection, but only if they fit your head.\u00a0 Once fastened, your helmet should not move around your head when you turn your neck.\u00a0 Don't buy helmets to grow into.\nBuy a helmet that has been accredited by the Canadian Standards Association (C.S.A.) as shown by a sticker on new helmets.\u00a0 Prior to the 2009-2010 ski season the C.S.A. accreditation program was not in effect for ski helmets. If you own an old helmet, check if your helmet is designed for single-impact use, or multiple-impact.\u00a0 If it is designed for single-impact and you've had a crash, it's time for a new helmet.\u00a0 Damage to the interior of the helmet may not be visible.\nGoggles or sunglasses:\nWhatever the weather, you'll need some kind of eye protection.\u00a0 Even on overcast days, you'll be exposed to UV light, not only from above, but also reflected from the snow.\u00a0 For skiing in mild conditions sunglasses with 100% UV protection are usually adequate.\u00a0 For colder conditions or in snow, wind or rain, goggles offer better eye protection.\u00a0 Select goggles with 100% UV protection for daytime skiing and untinted goggles for night skiing, so you can see the bumps and icy patches.\nClothing:\nYou'll need three layers of clothing for alpine skiing - a base layer such as thermal underwear (top and bottom), an insulating layer such as a wool, fleece, polypropylene or fibre-pile sweater, and a protective layer (top and bottom) that is wind and waterproof.\u00a0 Weather conditions can change quickly and so can your body temperature - one minute you are hot from the exertion of skiing, the next minute you are cold in the wind on a chair-lift that has stopped.\u00a0 Even in dry skiing conditions, chances are you'll end up with more than your skis in the snow - making waterproof gear necessary at all times.\nSki suits or jackets and pants are made from material that keeps water out and allows your skin to breathe.\u00a0 These outer garments are sometimes available for rent.\nIf you are not wearing an insulated helmet, most ski days you'll need a hat (touque or beanie).\u00a0 Select a hat\u00a0 made of fleece that covers your ears.\nGloves or mittens:\nSki gloves or mittens protect your hands during a fall and keep your hands warm.\u00a0 Select waterproof gloves or mittens that wick moisture away from your skin.\u00a0 Mittens may take away some dexterity, but they tend to keep hands warmer in cold conditions.\nSun and wind protection:\nApply sunscreen and lip balm before you head outdoors for skiing.\u00a0 Keep sunscreen in your pocket to reapply as directed on the tube.\u00a0 If you choose not to wear a helmet or hat, wear a cap in mild conditions. Even if the day is not windy, you will be traveling at high speeds in cold weather and a wax-based skin protector can help protect against frost bite and wind burn.\nHydration\nKeeping hydrated will help you stay alert while skiing, may help to prevent muscle cramps and will help your post ski recovery.\nThe easiest way to meet your hydration needs is to use a hydration backpack.\u00a0 We recommend that you drink about 300-400 mL before you ski (ref: http://www.ausport.gov.au/sportscoachmag/nutrition2/pre-event_nutrition , and 250mL (1 cup) of water or sports drink every 20 minutes of skiing (ref: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/106/1/158 ) and for one hour after you ski.\u00a0 Your fluid requirements will vary depending on the environmental conditions and your body size.\u00a0 To check that you are adequately hydrating, you can weigh yourself before and after you ski.\u00a0 If your weight remains the same then you are likely to be well hydrated.\nIf you are a beginner and don't want to purchase a hydration pack, you can keep a regular back pack with drinks in a central location, or take cash to purchase drinks and make sure you stop for regular drink breaks throughout the day.\n"}, {"score": 865.409, "uuid": "9d4df13a-25e8-5a28-8a61-fdc72e4d3066", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1115wb-78-24122", "target_hostname": "www.podiatry-arena.com", "target_uri": "http://www.podiatry-arena.com/podiatry-forum/showthread.php?t=1383", "page_rank": 1.1785718e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Foot orthoses and <em>skiing</em> - Podiatry Arena", "snippet": "The approach for alpine <em>skiing</em> <em>is</em> really no different than the approach you would use in making orthoses for <em>snowboarding</em>, running, racketsports, cycling, basketball <em>or</em> walking, for that matter.", "explanation": null, "document": "Thanked 250 Times in 131 Posts\nFoot orthoses and skiing\nPodiatry Arena members do not see these ads\nWhat do you do?\nHere is part of a press release from NewsUSA :\nQuote:\nIf you're a skier, podiatrists say you should think of your feet as your steering wheel.\n\"External forces of gravity, inertia and centrifugal force all act on a skier in motion,\" said Dr. Ben Pearl, a member of the American Podiatric Medical Association and a part-time ski instructor. \"A skier needs a good sense of balance, particularly in the feet.

Any additions/modifications to the foot orthoses must have provision for the first ray to adequately exert a medial plantar force to help with setting the ski edge.\nDue to the slightly flexed knee stance in skiing which will have a natural pronatory effect on foot, consider casting the foot for orthoses in a slightly pronated position.\nIn some cases (eg tibial varum), wedges or cants between the boot and ski have been used\n__________________\nhttp://www.latrobe.edu.au/podiatry\n__________________________________________________ ___________________________________\nGod put me on this earth to accomplish a certain number of things - right now I am so far behind, I will never die.\nThe views expressed above are those of the author and not that of La Trobe University.\nThis website is not operated or associated in any way with La Trobe University which does not accept responsibility for any views expressed or for any loss or damage occasioned by users of the site.\nThanks: 0\nThanked 0 Times in 0 Posts\nI can't really see the need to cast in a slightly pronated position. Short of a medial flange up to the medial malleoli, the foot will pronate over the top of the orthoitc when enough force is pushed through it (when the skier transfers their weight forward, iniaiting the next turn)\nOr simply build an orthose with a bit of flex.\nMy experience has been that you can get away with a very controlling device, more so than you would with a device for normal gait. The devices for my ski boots are about 4 cm at the highest point on the medial side (size 12 foot). I personally prefer using 260 EVA. Have also found for that you can use FF varus posts quite nicely (due to the fact the foot remains in Midstance)\nNot that carve ski's are new now, but turning on edge is infintiely easier than it was 10 years ago, meaning you can really lean the ski's over. Correct foot position in the boot allows more control, as well as speeding up reaction times to initiate a turn in the other direction.\nTom\nThanks: 0\nThanked 2 Times in 2 Posts\nOne of the interesting and often annoying things about most ski boots is that the shaft (cuff) of the boot is set at an angle, not the forward lean angle but a lateral angle of (depending on the make and model) approx 1-2.5 degrees inverted the average on a mens boot being 1.5degrees.\ncombine this with a pronated orthotic and you get some really interesting results\nThe point about FF varus posts has always caused an argument, however as PF3 says the foot remains in midstance. and any time i used a lab built orthoses the best successes have been with full forefoot correction and a narrow grind, never the less i still see clients with some massively over sized orthotics from their doctor to put into ski boots, as a plea to these doctors please either learn to understand the biomechanics and fit of a ski boot or reffer your patients to someone who does.\nCEM\nThanks: 0\nThanked 2 Times in 2 Posts\nJust to add to the above, i think it was Kevin Kirby that said \"skiing is one of the only sports were everyone could benefit from an orthotic\"\nI am sure he would agree that it needs to be suitable for the patient and well made!\nCEM\nThanked 988 Times in 602 Posts\nQuote:\nOriginally Posted by CEM\nWhat on earth is the point of casting them in a pronated position!!! the most common problem i see is people in this position with badly made ski shop orthoses (sorry footbeds in most cases) with pain from the medial ankle and the lateral forefoot hitting the shell of the boot. in 17 years of working with skiers of all levels from novice to world cup racers casting in a neutral postion with an orthoses designed for skiers has always worked for me\nAlpine (downhill) skiing is a very interesting sport when it comes to the function of the foot. One of the first lectures I did during my Biomechanics Fellowship at CCPM was on the Biomechanics of Downhill Skiing. Along with some of my skier students, we also did some preliminary research on ski biomechanics during my Biomechanics Fellowship. One of my students, who had been a ski boot fitter before podiatry school, and I did a paper on ski boot fitting many years ago. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, this paper from 19 years ago is still the only paper published in the podiatric literature on ski boot fitting (Santoro JP, Kirby KA: Boot fitting problems in the skier. JAPMA, 76: 572-576, 1986).\nBasically, in order to be an effective alpine skier, the individual must be able to generate force between the medial edge of the downhill ski and the snow surface. The force that the snow exerts on the ski, or snow reaction force (SRF) will bend the ski, which, along with the frontal plane angle of the ski relative to the snow surface, will help generate the forces necessary to allow the skier to make a turn.\nWhen making a ski turn, the skier must lean into toward the center of the turn's radius in order to keep their center of mass (CoM) in line with the SRF vector. If they don't, then they will become unstable and fall. Because of this lean, the skier's legs will naturally have an angulation with the snow surface in order to counteract the effects of the centripetal force from the turn. See the attached lecture slide from 20+ years ago when we used this antiquated technology called 35 mm Kodachrome for our lectures.\nThe best \"natural\" alpine skiers tend to have rigid forefoot valgus type feet or, another way of saying this, is that their foot have increased medial column dorsiflexion stiffness. One of the worst types of feet for alpine skiiing are those that have \"overflexible\" medial columns where the medial forefoot will simply dorsiflex with increasing plantar force acting on it (i.e. low medial column dorsiflexion stiffness). Most of these feet will have difficulty initiating and maintaining a ski turn since, in order to generate sufficient SRF on the medial edge of the ski, they must internally rotate and adduct their knee excessively to try to get their medial forefoot to generate enough force on the boot bottom. Firm medial forefoot force transmitted to the boot, binding and then to the medial edge of the ski is necessary to initiate and hold an edge during a alpine ski turn.\nFoot orthoses nearly always can be made to make the skier more efficient since the foot orthosis can be used to optimize the foot-boot sole interface to allow more efficient weight transfer between the medial foot to the ski. I will use polypropylene orthoses, generally about 3/16\" thick, with full length Spenco topcover, flat rearfoot posts, casted in STJ neutral, and often times with a forefoot varus extension to get the medial forefoot to be able to bear good weight onto the boot bottom.\nThe shell of the boot (i.e. boot cuff) may, in some alpine ski boots, be able to be adjusted in the frontal plane relative to the boot bottom. This type of boot design is highly desirable in patients with tibial varum. Another alternative is to add a \"cant\" between the binding and ski in patients with tibial varum. However, many ski shops don't like doing this because it may alter the release mechanism of the binding which may increase the liability of the ski shop if an injury occurs with the canted binding.\nThere's much more to talk about, but that's all for now.\nAttached Images\nAlpine skiing2.jpg (50.9 KB, 668 views)\n__________________\n"}, {"score": 864.0315, "uuid": "3806bd33-4d58-5199-8cf3-4b0a2effd42e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1306wb-09-26030", "target_hostname": "www.suedtirols-sueden.info", "target_uri": "http://www.suedtirols-sueden.info/en/winter.html", "page_rank": 1.4527503e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Bolzano and environs: Winter, ski areas, <em>skiing</em>", "snippet": "All ski resorts are suitable for <em>skiing</em> and <em>snowboarding</em>, with easy pistes for beginners and <em>difficult</em> ones for the ski experts.", "explanation": null, "document": "59 km\nA wintry pleasure\nAll ski resorts are suitable for skiing and snowboarding, with easy pistes for beginners and difficult ones for the ski experts. While the Jochgrimm ski area is particularly attractive for newcomers to the sport, i.e. the manageable Rittner Horn which is mainly for families, for those who like to get going on their skies on the Europa Cup pistes, you will be happy to hit Reinswald.\nClose by, you'll also find Bozen, Castelfeder, Truden or Altrei with the ski resort of Obereggen Val di Fiemme \u0096 practically right at the front door. For those who love variety: you can change ski resort every day, or the same is true with the type of sport.\nSome look forward to the 'old' style of winter sport such as figure skating or a toboggan run and some follow the trend like snow-shoe hiking, reaching the summit on skies or cross-country skiing.\nThe bathing and mountain lakes, even Lake Kaltern, which is the warmest bathing lake in the Alps, changes through the cold season into an icy meeting place for the old and young. The 400 metre ice-rink in Klobenstein, where the world elite prepare for the important events of the year, is open to anyone who would like to try it out.\nWinter combination\nDuring the day, you can enjoy the pistes and in the evening, you can stroll through the Bozen porticos. Or do you prefer an evening out at the theatre? The ski resorts of Reinswald and Rittner Horn are only 30 minutes by car from the provincial capital.

However there are certain runs that offer more contrast providing vast amounts of skiing/snowboarding when the flakes are falling. The trick is to head for the pistes that are tree-lined, as they help provide definition when everything else seems to be white. Keep in mind that the valley itself can be covered in an all-encompassing fog, but the top of the mountains can be bathed in glorious sunshine (check out the webcams! ). Also, if it\u2019s lashing down with rain in the valley, it means it\u2019s snowing up top, giving you the best and freshest powder you\u2019re likely to ski on! And because it\u2019s a bad weather day, chances are, you\u2019ll have the mountain to yourself.\nBad Weather Ski Areas in Courchevel\nWhen visibility is difficult due to snow or white-out, there\u2019s one important thing to remember: keep the poles in sight.\u00a0 The poles marking the edges of the piste are the colour of the difficulty of the run (green, blue, red or black). Have you ever noticed that the poles on the right side of the piste (looking down) have a 20 cm band of orange at the top? This is so that in a white-out when you really can\u2019t see very much, if you come across a pole with an orange top, leave it on your right. If the pole is one colour all the way to the top, leave it on your left. That way you\u2019ll stay safe & on piste!\nVisibility tends to be better in amongst the trees when there\u2019s a whiteout. So head for the black runs into Le Praz (Jockeys & Jean Blanc) or the red run (Brigues ). The long blue run into La Tania is also a good bet (Folyeres).\nAvailability Search\nSAVE TIME!

You can also hangout in the game room, grab a massage, or relax in the whirlpool.\nThe Deal - If you are ready to snowboard in Minnesota and to show off you skills, you can get there by driving on I-35 if coming from the south. You will then jump on HWY 61 and the Lutsen snowboarding area is only a couple miles off of the highway. If you are coming from the north, you will take Highway 61 the majority of the way.\nCopyright \u00a9 1998 - 2012 Vacation Coupons.

The ride up the mountain in a helicopter is a surreal experience in itself, and once you\u2019ve finished taking photos of the spectacular views, the ski or snowboard down the mountain is even better!\nHeli skiing operators have access to vast areas of backcountry terrain so the likelihood of riding virgin snow is very high, if not guaranteed. And for powder-holics, heli skiing can be absolute nirvana; a place to visit the powder room where you not only powder your nose but your whole body!\nHeli skiing is an experience that\u2019s not just exclusively for the rich and famous or Warren Miller stunt skiers. Sure heli skiing costs much more than a lift ticket, but addicted powderhounds will claim that it is great value for money considering the number of quality powder turns on offer.\nBenefits of Heli Skiing and Heli Boarding\nWhy heli ski rather than resort ski?\nHeli skiing out in the backcountry offers an opportunity to get away from the hordes commonly found at ski resorts. With heli skiing you don\u2019t have to stand in lift queues or race to get first tracks, and fresh tracks won\u2019t have disappeared by 9:30am.\nAt ski resorts you may find slops rather than slopes. At the higher elevations often achieved with heli skiing, the snow conditions are generally superior.\nBenefits of heliskiing over ski touring\nSome people like to earn their turns by ski touring or hiking. The advantage of heli skiing is that you spend much less time going up the mountain and more time doing what you love most \u2013 skiing or snowboarding down the mountain!\nBackcountry touring requires a lot of knowledge, skill and equipment. As most heli skiing is guided, you can largely rely on the expertise of the guides for route finding, avalanche mitigation and radio communication.\nWhy heli ski rather cat ski?\nHeli skiing tenures are usually significantly larger than cat skiing areas, so there are more opportunities to find great quality snow and fresh tracks.\nHelicopters are less restricted than snowcats in regards to the terrain they can access. Helicopters can get right up to the really magical terrain.\nHelicopters get up the mountain much faster than snowcats, so it\u2019s often possible to get a lot more skiing or boarding in each day.\nTypes of Heli Skiing The format of heli skiing packages varies somewhat. Some heli ski operators offer single day packages which range from one run to full day affairs. Single day heli skiing is the norm in New Zealand and Japan, and can also be found in North America and Chile. Many of these operators are based at or near ski resorts.\nMulti-day trips are common in Canada and Alaska. These multi-day packages are inclusive of the heli skiing (or at least part of it), accommodation, and meals. You typically pay for extras such as massage services, drinks, and additional vertical skied beyond the guaranteed vertical. In Canada the accommodation is commonly provided in remote backcountry lodges, some of which are only accessible via helicopter. For a truly novel and luxurious heliski experience, it\u2019s also possible to stay on a yacht or boat!\nOperators also typically provide a range of packages that vary from standard group packages where the helicopter is shared by 2 to 5 groups, up to private deluxe trips where you only have to share the helicopter and the lodging with your closest friends.\nTypically heli skiing is guided whereby a lead guide takes responsibility for safety instruction, snowpack stability testing and route finding. Some companies also have a tail guide who brings up the rear and provides additional support. In very rare cases, heli skiing is unguided. Helipark in New Zealand is unguided although it operates within a very small avalanche controlled area. Alpine Heliski in NZ also offer a similar arrangement on their freeskiing and freeriding days. In some parts of Europe, heli skiing is essentially just a lift to the top of the mountain, and then riders find their own way down.\nHeliskiing terrain varies remarkably from steep chutes to mellow bowls, but the largest variable is probably related to the presence of tree skiing. Canada and continental USA usually have a combination of alpine and tree terrain, whilst heli skiing in New Zealand, Alaska and Chile is all above the timberline. Tree skiing can be highly advantageous because commonly the snow quality is superior to that in the alpine, although many heliski aficionados prefer the majestic alpine where they can let it rip!\nCanada Heli Skiing and Heli Boarding Heli-skiing was pioneered in Canada, and BC Canada continues to be the home of heli skiing. British Columbia has at least 34 heliski operations that have huge backcountry tenures. Multi-day trips that are based at remote lodges is the norm, with only a handful of companies offering single day heli skiing.\nHeli skiing in Canada is world renowned for good reason. Snowfalls are prolific, particularly in northern BC where there is 20 to 30 metres of snow per season. Further south in the BC Interior the snow is legendary, with 12 to 20 metres of light dry powder per season. In amongst the trees in particular, it is not just face shot territory \u2013 it\u2019s snorkel country!\nSee our Canada heli skiing overview and comparison of BC heliski operators for more information.\nUSA Heli Skiing In the lower 48 states of the U.S. there are only nine operators, so heli skiing is somewhat rare. This is in part due to the many regulations in the USA that make it difficult to start up a heli ski business. And unlike Canada, all operators offer single day packages.\nThe largest concentration of heli ski operators in the United States is in the Chugach Range of Alaska.\nSee our USA heli skiing overview and US heli ski comparison for more information.\nAlaska Heli Skiing\nThe gnarly Alaska heli skiing terrain has been made world famous via many ski and snowboard movies. The maritime snowpack is reasonably strong, so the likelihood of skiing super steeps is higher than many other parts of the world. The Alaskan mountains get tons of snow. The only downside of the stormy weather that produces all that snow is the high rate of no-fly dates.\nMost of the operators offer either multi or single day packages, and as a general rule, the multi-day trips are very economical.\nNew Zealand Heli Skiing New Zealand has the most helicopters per capita so it makes perfect sense that NZ has lots of heliski operators. New Zealand heli skiing and heli boarding provides access to the amazingly spectacular Southern Alps, the backdrop for the Lord of the Rings movies. Like Alaska, the terrain is all in the alpine and there are a large proportion of no-fly days. The quality and quantity of the New Zealand snow may not be a match for North America, but it\u2019s really inexpensive so you get more snow for your dough!\nSee our NZ heli skiing overview and New Zealand heli ski comparison for more information.\nEurope Heli Skiing Considering the abundance of European ski resorts, surprisingly heli skiing operators in Europe are somewhat scarce. Many of the European countries are highly regulated and unfortunately (for heli skiing enthusiasts) heli skiing is banned in many parts. Tirol Austria has one operation, Italy and Switzerland have about four companies, and there are a few in Sweden. Eastern Europe has a couple of outfits in Romania, whilst in the far east of Russia, heli skiing in Kamchatka and Caucasus is becoming particularly trendy.\nSouth America Heliskiing There are only a handful of Chile heli skiing operators, some that offer multi-day packages with accommodation, and others that are based at ski resorts and provide single day heli tours. The heliski terrain is way up high in the alpine of the gigantic Andes Mountains, and runs are typically super long. Whilst Chile offers a magical experience, the heli skiing can be a little pricey. Even resort skiing in Chile is targeted to the elite of South America.\nSee our heli skiing Chile summary and Chile heli ski stats for more information.\nArgentina heli skiing also exists, although it\u2019s via charter (e.g. Powderbird Guides) or a season by season proposition.\nJapan Heli Skiing Japan is a truly intriguing country and it\u2019s the powder capital of the world, so it\u2019s a shame that Japan has negligible heli skiing. The Japanese ski resorts are sometimes overly zealous with safety considerations just in the off piste areas (!!), so heli skiing is generally considered a very hazardous activity.\nThere are a couple of operators (at Tsugaike Kogen and Kagura ski resort) that offer a really lame form of heli skiing where they repeatedly use the same drop-off zone, so fresh tracks are hard to come by. Tomamu ski resort also offers heli skiing about 12 days of the season. Thankfully at least one U.S. company runs charter heli ski trips to Japan.\nOther Heli Ski Trips Visit India to spice up your life. High up in the Himalayas in the Kashmir region of India, heli skiing not only offers a vast backcountry and truck loads of fresh lines, but an opportunity to lap up a fascinatingly unique culture. Gulmarg Heliski offers single run trips or week long packages, and there is also helicopter skiing in Manali.\nOther exotic heli ski destinations include Nepal, Uzbekistan (frequently very inexpensive), and Greenland.\nGo Heli Skiing Heliskiing is an unforgettable experience - infinite lines of virgin snow that are yours for the taking. For some it\u2019s a once in a lifetime experience, whilst for others it becomes an addiction, because once you\u2019ve been spoilt with heli skiing you may never want to go back to resort skiing ever again.\n"}, {"score": 846.9576, "uuid": "2c93a021-c0ad-546e-9b4c-1969de66e522", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1204wb-52-18114", "target_hostname": "athens.angloinfo.com", "target_uri": "http://athens.angloinfo.com/information/38/ski.asp", "page_rank": 1.1927164e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Skiing</em> and Ski Resorts in Greece - AngloINFO Athens", "snippet": "Most resorts offer accommodation: hotels, apartments <em>or</em> chalets, and have shops selling <em>or</em> renting ski equipment.

A skier following the fall line will reach the maximum possible speed for that slope, which is often dangerously fast even on relatively shallow hills. A skier with their skis pointed perpendicular to the fall line, across the hill instead of down it, will not move at all. The speed of descent down any given hill can be controlled by changing the angle of motion to the fall line, skiing more across the hill rather then down it.\nHowever, as the ski runs are generally of finite width, for any angle other than directly down the fall line, the skier will eventually move sideways to the edge of the run. At this point the skier must turn around and continue the decent in the opposite direction. In theory, a run down the hill would consist of straight sections across the hill, followed by sharp turns to the complementary angle, as if the skier is being reflected from the edges of the run.\nDownhill skiing technique focuses on the use of turns to smoothly turn the skis from one direction to another. Additionally, the skier can use the same techniques to quickly turn the ski away from the direction of movement, generating skidding forces between the skis and snow which further controls the speed of the decent. Good technique results in a flowing motion from one decent angle to the opposite one, adjusting the angle as needed to match changes in the steepness of the run. This looks more like a single long series of S's than turns followed by straight sections.\nThis skier is performing a right turn using the classic stem-Christie technique. The left (downhill) ski has been stemmed out from the body, and their weight shifted onto this ski. This drives the inside edge into the snow, generating forces to their right (uphill). Note that the weighted ski is on-edge and forming an arc; if both legs were parallel the skis would begin to smoothly carve.\nGenerally there are two main forms of turns used in downhill skiing. The oldest, and still common, is the concept of \"stemming\", pushing the front (\"tips\") or rear (\"tails) of the skis sideways from the body so they form an angle to the direction of travel. In doing so, the ski pushes snow forward and to the side, and thus by Newton's third law , the snow pushes the skier back and to the opposite side. The force backwards directly counteracts gravity, and slows the skier. The force to the sides, if unbalanced, will cause the skier to turn.\nThe most basic form of stemming is the snowplough turn taught to first-time skiers. In this technique, the skier uses their lower legs to angle the skis outward at the tails and in at the tips, forming a shallow angle between the ski and upper body. The two skis are angled in opposite directions, forming a V-shape. In this position, the sideways force from one ski is balanced by the opposite sideways force of the other, leaving no net turning forces. However, both skis are creating backward forces, which add together and create significant drag, keeping speeds slow. To turn, pressure against one of the skis is relaxed so the snow pushes it back towards the body. This lowers the turning force on this side, thereby allowing the other ski to dominate and turn the skier toward the straightened ski. The turn is stopped by forcing this ski out again. This technique is simple and extremely powerful, however, it is also quite tiring as the skier has to keep the skis in position against the inward-directed force of the snow. It is very difficult to use on steeper slopes or higher speeds.\nStemming is also the basis of one of the most common types of downhill techniques, the Stem Christie . In this case the skis are normally kept parallel to each other, and to initiate a turn, only one ski is forced away from the body. This creates the same general position as the snowplough, and the same forces cause the skier to turn. However, as the skis are pointed parallel between turns and do not have to be pushed against the snow, the total workload is greatly reduced. And as the drag force is only generated during turns, this technique results in faster speeds. Whereas a snowplough might safely be used directly down the fall line of a given hill, a Christie on the same hill would result in higher speeds, and skiing this technique normally requires the skier to turn across the fall line almost constantly.\nThe ultimate development of the stemming technique is the parallel turn, a name that is no longer descriptive. In the classic parallel, the basic turning forces are generated the same way as the stem Christie or snowplough. However, the forces are applied to both skis at the same time, so they remain parallel to each other as they rotate. When rapid parallel turns are quickly linked together, the upper body remains pointed down the fall line, and the lower body and skis are alternately driven into the snow in one direction and then the other. This was considered the height of good technique during the \"hot dogging\" era from the 1970s into the 1980s. [2]\nThis skier is in the middle a high-performance turn during a slalom race. The arced shape of the ski can be seen, especially on the outside ski (right side of the image). Snow being ejected from under the ski illustrates that skidding is taking place.\nA different form of turn is the \"carve\". Carving is based on the shape of the ski itself; when the ski is rotated onto its edge, the pattern cut into its side causes it to bend into an arc. The contact between the arc of the ski edges and the snow naturally causes the ski to want to move along that arc. Starting a carved turn simply requires the ski to be rotated onto its edge, which can be accomplished through small movements of the hips and knees. This motion is very easy to apply to both skis at the same time, and carving is a naturally parallel technique. Carving turns are generally much smoother and longer than stemming, and keep the skis along the direction of travel as opposed to angled across it. Both of these reasons means that carved turns require far less effort than stemming for the same given amount of control over the decent. However, the technique is not simple to learn, at least before the introduction of \"shaped skis\" in the 1990s. Since that time, it has become increasingly common to teach carving as a form of parallel skiings, as opposed to the \"classic\" parallel technique. [3]\nModern downhill technique is generally a combination of carving and skidding, varying the ratio between the two when rapid control over the turn or speed is required. However, pure carving and pure stemming are used in certain circumstances. Pure carving is a useful technique on slopes of moderate steepness and smooth snow - \"groomer carving\" is widespread and there are skis dedicated to this style. Likewise, competitive mogul skiing remains an almost pure parallel Christie technique, although the turn initiation is aided by the moguls themselves.\nDefinitions of 7 Keys or Secrets of Skiing to Remember - Source www.the7secretsofskiing.com from Chalky White's book, The 7 Secrets of Skiing.\nSecret 1: Athletic Stance; the basis of all technique - The goal is to create a solid, athletic stance that encourages ease of balance; balance that allows forceful utilization of leg and hip joints. Also, athletic stance should be set up and maintained in such a way that it can be re-established as easily as possible; even following serious balance losses. All skier balance skills will be enhanced as a result of continued sound athletic stance development.\nSecret 2: Fore and Aft Balance \u2013 The goal of fore and aft balance is for a skier to utilise her/his bulk in a way that it assists in creating pressure evenly along a ski's full length. The combined focal points are those of feet, boots and ski centres. Achieving this goal, in part, offers the opportunity for maximum ski edge grip.\nSecret 3: Lateral Balance - The Goal of creating lateral balance is to allow a skier to consistently exert pressure through the centre of the inside edge of the outside turning ski. It must be stressed that achieving this goal can only, consistently, occur with the presence of very efficient fore and aft balance (Secret 2) that develops from functional athletic stance (Secret 1). Those skills combined with the, now possible, lateral balance are the platform that allows all-around skier balancing and turning capabilities.\nSecret 4: The Simple Skidded Turn - The goal of learning the simple skidded turn is to create a platform from which, advanced turning techniques can efficiently develop. The basis of a simple skidded turn is the ability of a dynamically balanced skier to rotate his legs, as accurately as possible, around their own axis. In so doing, centrally located pivot points can be created. These pivot points offer the opportunity to skid skis in a manner that assists the skier to then steer them accurately. Size of turning arcs can be varied through utilisation of, more or less, leg rotary and pressure application actions. Vitally, simple skidded turning techniques are major in assisting a skier, at will, to maintain and control down hill speed. As with all skiing skills, success is truly attained only when the skills of Secrets 1, 2 and 3 are adopted.\nSecret 5: Carved Turns - The goal of Carved Turns is to employ, when required, the full gripping snow capabilities of the skis. To do this, skis must be used as, more or less, cutting through the snow implements. Success depends on a high degree of precise ski operation. To carve/cut a ski must be allowed to travel along its own length, meaning its tail must follow the very same line as its tip through the arc of the turn. Further, a ski must be sufficiently tilted onto its edge with an appropriate amount of pressure applied to, particularly, its centre. Under most skiing circumstances primary concentration should be given to operation of the inside edge of the outside of turning arc ski. For the skier who has ambitions to travel faster while still maintaining control, development of these ski-cutting skills are key to that ambition.\nSecret 6: Skidded Carved Turns \u2013 The goal of skidded carved turns or short radius turns is to enable the skier to take full advantage of the combined carving/cutting and skidding capabilities of the skis. Skiing in this way allows the skier to forcefully control speed over or through the snow even when the speed being carried is high. The skidded carved turn offers the skier the possibility to constantly adapt technique appropriate to current on snow skiing circumstances. For example, the skier may wish to increase speed; so, using the skis' cutting capabilities more than those of skidding maybe more appropriate. Or, the skier may wish to reduce pace and so use the skis' skidding capabilities and reduce the force utilised that cause the skis' edges to cut carve. Such fluctuations of skills utilised allow the skier to vary turn arc length to almost any degree desired. Skidded carved turns are often referred to as short to medium radius turns.\nSecret 7: Recovery Powers \u2013 The goal is for the skier to recover all manner of loss of balance situations through alertness, determination, strength and skill. The skier is not a tough-to-topple statue. Rather, the skier is largely unsupported, standing on just two legs and skis' soles that are largely frictionless. Only constant skier balance adjustments or recovery of that control prevents these slippery implements from sliding from underneath the skier's body and causing a fall. Ever-changing snow conditions, terrain, weather, skier skill adeptness and skier mental state all combine to cause every skier to, partially or totally, lose balance. Therefore, the secret of Secret 7 is in your discovering ways to first adjust your balancing efforts to prevent falls. Secondly, it's in ways of recovering from previously apparent lost-balance causes. Skiing by its very nature, is a \"Series of Linked Balance Recoveries.\" NOTE: Remarkably, the key to balance recovery is in an athlete's skillful ability to re-establish athletic stance; refer to Secret 1 above.\n[ edit ] Equipment\nAlpine skiing evolved as a specialization on the general sport of skiing during the late 19th century . In this era before ski lifts , all skiing requires some cross-country, some uphill climbing, and some downhill skiing. Equipment during this era was largely similar to modern cross-country gear - a normal leather boot was fastened to the ski at the toe, allowing the heel to rise off the ski and allow striding motions. During the 1930s, the Kandahar binding was introduced, which could be locked down at the heel for the downhill portions. The Kandahar remained in widespread use until the 1960s.\nAs more and more skiers took up the sport, especially in the 1950s, broken legs became all too common. In one instance, Dr. Richard Spademan saw 150 spiral fractures pass through his emergency department near Squaw Valley in 1960, an event that led to the development of the Spademan binding . By the early 1950s, several \"safety bindings\" were on the market that allowed the ski to come off when the ski twisted to the side. This helped reduce the indigence of spiral fractures, but the lack of standardization in measurements and the always-changing mechanical interface with leather boots make these less than foolproof.\nIn 1950, Howard Head introduced the Head Standard ski. This consisted of a conventional wooden ski sandwiched between two thin layers of aluminum. When the ski was rotated on-edge, the aluminum sheets prevented the wooden core from twisting longitudinally, and kept much more of the ski's edge firmly pressed into the snow. This so dramatically improved turning performance that it was referred to as \"The Cheater\", because it allowed even beginners to \"cheat\" their turns and look like pros. A further advance around 1960 replaced the metals with fibreglass, which improved the \"springiness\" of the skis and made them much more lively over bumps. The Dynamic VR-17 took this process to its modern conclusion in the late 1960s, when they introduced the torsion box design, which further improved longitudinal stiffness.\nThe evolution of torsional stiffness in skis allowed increasing control over the edging, and thus continued to improve the amount of carving relative to skidding through the turn. However, this evolution also demanded more of the skiers effort to be put into rotating the skis onto edge, as opposed to forcing them to rotate tip in or out. A true carving turn was not generally possible, because the lateral motion of the leg would not be transmitted to the ski through the ski boots of the era. These were generally cut low, just over the ankle, and soft laterally, both of which limited the amount of sideways turning force that could be applied.\nIn the winter of 1965/66, two new ski boots made of plastic came to market. Compared to leather designs, the Rosemount and Lange boots dramatically increased the amount of lateral stiffness, and in turn, the amount of edging control over the ski. Additionally, the plastic did not change shape over time or when it got wet. This allowed the bindings to be much more closely matched to the fit of the boot, and offer dramatically improved performance. For the first time, safety bindings were no longer looser than cable bindings , and rapidly took over.\nBy the early 1970s, fibreglass tortion-box skis about 200\u00a0cm long, plastic boots rising half way to the knee, and safety bindings of various construction were universal. Wooden skis, leather boots and cable bindings disappeared almost overnight, and were generally gone by 1972. Technique developed, but the sport remained little changed between this time and the 1980s. The only dramatic changes during this period were in form; the rear-entry ski boot was common during the 1980s but became unpopular and disappeared by the early 1990s, and Salomon's introduction of the monocoque ski design led to widespread use of the \"cap ski\", different only in that it was cheaper to produce.\nBy 1990, the sport was essentially the same as it was in 1975. Ski design was effectively at a dead end, and many changes in material or construction technique were largely for marketing. The introduction of snowboarding captured the imagination of a younger generation, to whom skiing appeared moribund. By the mid-1990s, many ski hills were dominated by boarders, and their ability to do stunts in terrain parks.\nA major change took place after the introduction of the Elan SCX ski in the early 1990s. The SCX was the first widely available \"parabolic\" ski, which dramatically improved carving performance. It required no real changes in construction, only the designer's desire to experiment with more radical designs. By 1995, practically every ski produced had more or less \"shaping\", and for a time, carving became a sport onto its own. A similar change occurred with the \"rocker\" design, which bends the ski into a banana-like shape, as opposed to the classic bow-like shaping with the tips and tails pressed down and the center raised. Today, almost all skis include both of these design notes, further improving the ability of the ski to be smoothly carved in a wider variety of conditions and terrain. The introduction of twin-tip (\"park\") skis allowed them into the terrain parks, where they are now common.\n[ edit ] Competitions\nThis article's factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information.

There may be additional information on the talk page .\n(February 2010)\nSki racer competing in a Giant Slalom race\nVarious Alpine skiing competitions have developed in the history of skiing . Broadly speaking, competitive skiing is broken up into two disciplines: racing and freestyle .\nRacing involves making fast turns around gates in an attempt to attain the fastest overall time down one or two runs of a race course by having the tightest line possible. Elite competitive skiers participate in the annual World Cup series, as well as the quadrennial Olympic Games and the biennial World Championships . Slalom (SL), giant slalom (GS) , super giant slalom (super-G) , and downhill (DH) are the four racing disciplines. Slalom is the most technical discipline and has the shortest turns with distances ranging from 6 to 15 metres apart. It has speeds that can reach 35km/h. Downhill is the fastest, where speeds can exceed 140km/h, showing the clear distinction between the two disciplines. The Giant slalom event is also considered a technical event with medium sized turns and the Super-giant slalom considered a speed event, as similar speeds are reached as in the downhill discipline though jumps are provided. There is also a \"Super Combined\" event that includes one downhill run and one slalom run in a single day. In 2004, the FIS (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski) introduced a new event to the World Cup calendar called the super combined , or super combi, consisting of one shortened downhill run and just one slalom run. That year, the FIS also introduced an Alpine team racing event at the World Championships in Bormio , Italy . Ski racing is controlled by a set of rules which are enforced by FIS. These rules include such things as regulation ski sizes, sidecuts, boot heights, binding risers and other regulations such as limitations to chemical substances found in winning racers as well as many other things which all ensure one particular skier has no advantage over another. In 2008, these regulations were changed in order to make it harder for racers to complete a race course. Some changes included increasing the minimum ski length and also the sidecut which makes the ski turn less tightly.In 2008 ski lengths were increased as it was found by physiotherapists that the shorter skis combined with the constant knee jerking movements were considered unnecessarily harmful to racers knees due to the turning radius of the skis (especially the slalom skis) therefore the F.I.S made the minimum ski length for women in slalom 155\u00a0cm and men 165\u00a0cm. Other size minimums were put in place in the other three events.\nFreestyle skiing incorporates events such as moguls , aerials, and sometimes \" new-school \" events such as halfpipe , big air, slopestyle , and skiercross . Together with extreme skiing , new-school freestyle skiing is also sometimes known as freeskiing . Until relatively recently, freestyle competitions also included an event called ballet, later renamed \"acro-ski\".\nIn addition to racing and freestyle, other types of Alpine skiing competitions exist. One discipline administered by the FIS but not usually considered part of racing is speed skiing , in which competitors strive to achieve the highest total speed in a straight line, with no gates or turns. Numerous non-FIS competitions have emerged over the years. More traditional events include gelandesprung jumping ( ski jumping for distance on Alpine equipment), and \" powder 8 \" contests; among the more recent introductions are \"big mountain\" or \" extreme skiing \" contests, in which athletes start at the top of a mountain and ski a route down that involves wide, fast turns as well as cliff drops. The competitors are judged on the technical difficulty of their routes and any tricks they perform on the way down the hill.\n[ edit ] Organization of Alpine ski competition\nSki competition rules and scheduling are managed internationally by the International Ski Federation (FIS) based in Switzerland . Each participating nation worldwide is represented by a national association that manages the sport in that respective nation.\nRecreational Ski Racers at a NASTAR race\nMan skiing slope overlooking Lake Tahoe\nMost organized skiing competitions are dependent on a team of Race Officials and course workers who plan, organize and run the events. Alpine ski races are usually organized by a Race Organizing Committee (ROC), led by a Race Chair. Race Officials include the Chief of Race, chief of course, starters, timers, gate judges, referees, a jury and others who organize the event and ensure it is run safely and according to governing body rules. Under the leadership of a Chief of Course, course workers erect safety systems (usually nets), prepare and maintain the surface of the race course, erect and maintain other equipment such as a start tent, a finish area and the gates through which competitors must pass, and remove any fresh snow that may fall during the event. A FIS World Cup downhill, for example, requires a team of several hundred course workers that may spend over two weeks preparing a course prior to a week of racing, during which the course workers will continue to maintain the course. Race Officials and course workers are usually volunteers, but may include paid staff and, in some European countries, members of the military. Most regular venues of major Alpine ski races have a local ROC which remains in place from year to year. An example of an organization of volunteer course workers are the Whistler Weasel Workers .\n[ edit ] Ski trail ratings\nIn most ski resorts, the runs are graded according to comparative difficulty so that skiers can select appropriate routes. The grading schemes around the world are related, although with significant regional variations.\nTypically, grading is done by the resort, and grades are relative to other trails within that resort. As such, they are not classified to an independent standard; although they are likely to be roughly similar, skiers should be cautious about assuming that grades in two different resorts are absolutely equivalent.\n[ edit ] North America, New Zealand and Australia\nIn North America, a color\u2013shape rating system is used to indicate the comparative difficulty of trails (otherwise known as slopes or pistes ). Australian ski slopes also share the same rating system.\nSki resorts assign ratings to their own trails, marking a given trail according to its relative difficulty when compared with other trails at that resort. Although slope gradient is the primary consideration in assigning a trail rating, other factors come into play \u2014 including trail width, normal snow conditions and whether or not the resort regularly grooms the trail.\nSki trail difficulty ratings in North America\nTrail\u00a0Rating\n"}], [{"score": 835.7558, "uuid": "5ee4cbdd-2f18-522d-a577-3fa9146ebe6c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-08-32077", "target_hostname": "www.graysontrays.com", "target_uri": "http://www.graysontrays.com/clip-snowboarder.php", "page_rank": 1.1748145e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Grays on Trays: <em>Snowboarding</em> for Adults.

Here is the text of the interview. (Much of the text was edited out for publication.)\nGraysOnTrays.com\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: As an older adult do you relate to the sport as it is today, or do you feel that youth snowboarding is a separate entity and adult riding is its own sport?\nGraysOnTrays.com: I think the biggest divide is not age, but what kind of riding that people do. Working in the pipe and carving on the slope are two different, though related activities. If I ride up on the lift with someone 30 years younger than me, and we both ride down the mountain, we're in the same sport, even though there's a large age gap between us.\nOn the other hand, if someone is in the pipe and I'm freeriding, he's in a different sport, even if he is the same age as me. Now, I certainly would admire his skills. But I think that riding in the pipe looks a lot like skateboarding, whereas mountain riding is more similar to downhill skiing. In one sport, you plan your jumps, landings, spins, and grabs. In the other, you pick your fall line and decide how you are going to descend the mountain. So I think that there are two different sports, separated not by age but by activity. (I'm leaving out hot-dogging skiers who work in terrain parks.)\nThere is a good reason why people often think that youth snowboarding and adult snowboarding are two different sports: youth riding is very oriented towards the park and pipe. It's my impression that most adults who come to riding are coming to it from alpine skiing, so alpine riding is going to be more comfortable to them.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: Is GraysOnTrays.com something that you see as a national trend, like would you like to see their being a national Grays on Trays club, where do you want it to go?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Is the site part of a trend? Definitely. The number of older snowboarders is increasing, no doubt. The median age of beginning riders has increased from 21 to 23, for example. Two resorts in Maine have as many adults in their snowboarding classes as they do in their skiing classes. A reporter for the New York Times estimated that a third of the boarders he saw at Sun Valley were \"well past adolescence.\" As the current, younger snowboarders age, the age of people in the sport is going to increase. Add into that some skiers crossing over as they age, and the sport is getting older.\nSome snow sports areas, ranging from small skill hills in the Midwest, to destination resorts in Colorado, run snowboarding classes just for adults. I think that's another sign that something is going on.\nThe first article I've found on the subject of older riders is a Popular Mechanics article from 1997. Since then major publications such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and the Minneapolis Star-Tribune have run articles about people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and even older riding.\nMore recently, you've got John Kerry, who is about 60, on a snowboard. Here's a senator who could become president of the U.S. You can't get a much more high-profile example of an older person riding.\nWould I welcome a grays on trays riding club? Sure. There are least 15,000 people in the 70-Plus Ski club. Why not a 30-plus riding club?\nLet me say that I don't expect snowboarding to become dominated by older folks. But I think there is some place for companies such as Burton or K2 or someone else to make some sales by appealing to adult riders. They could, for example, emphasize technology that helps you ride, and talk in terms that adults can understand. There is a growing number of products for women, so the marketplace is recognizing that customization in design and marketing can reach new customers.\nWhy a web site for adult snowboarders?\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: Why do you think that there is a need for the gray on trays website?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Two reasons: One, snowboarding is great, and I think more people should get into it. Two, there's little out there that speaks in the language of the adult. When I look at snowboarding publications and web sites, I don't easily relate to them.\nFirst, you've got the language barrier. Now, I know that every sport has its lingo: sacrifice fly (baseball), unforced error (tennis), bogey (golf), and parallel turn (skiing). So when I read about someone doing a 720 or suffering a face plant, well, that's nothing new. There's always some terms to learn.\nBut then we've got the slang and colloquial language that doesn't reflect the way that a lot of would-be adult snowboarders talk. I try to think that I'm not an old fogey, but I have a hard time saying \"POW,\" \"freshies,\" and \"Duude.\" If I read someone's story about their latest exploits, and it starts out \"School really sucked today,\" well, that doesn't reflect my world, either. For one thing, it's been years since I've stepped into a school building.\nThen there's this image of snowboarding. It's all about rebellion, being unconventional for the sake of standing out, or wearing your clothes in a strange way. Some of that puts off older people. I think \"enough already. I don't need this.\" You may say that this is a superficial GraysOnTrays.com, and that older people ought to look past the attitudes. But I say that learning to ride is difficult enough on the physical plane, without having to enter a different subculture.\nSo what I hope to do with GraysOnTrays.com is to talk with adults in a way that doesn't scare them off or make them think that they've got to talk like some teenagers do. I want people to know that they don't have to pierce their tongue or dye their hair flaming red or risk life and limb to enjoy this great sport. I'm not asking existing publications and web sites to change their style or tone. But I would like to see something to reach the adult learner. That's what GraysOnTrays is all about.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: What kind of GraysOnTrays.com have you gotten from the site?\nGraysOnTrays.com: The hits are modest a this point; the most interesting feedback comes from people who write in. For example, I've exchanged letters from a man in Tahoe, who rides with his son. Then there's a fellow in Minnesota. He's about 10 years older than I am. He's a powder hound, going to remote areas in Canada whenever he can. He's invited me to out west with him when the snow is good. But he is a much better rider than I am so I don't think I can keep up with him.\nDo Adult and Young Snowboarder Mix?\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: Do you think that the younger kids can learn something from the older people riding, and do you think the older can learn from the younger? What should we learn?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Older riders can teach the younger crowd to try new things despite the obstacles. It isn't easy to swallow your pride and learn something new, especially if it will be embarrassing, and awkward. Learning to ride can be like that. I think that people of all ages need to be open to new challenges.\nWhat can the younger riders teach older students? How enjoyable riding can be. When I see a younger rider making a graceful ride down the hill, I'm inspired.\nI think that for the good of the sport, both younger riders and older ones need to treat each other with respect.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: How are you treated on the hill?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Ah. Great question. I know that some kids hate it when adults get on a board. It's like we are invading their turf. But I have not gotten any negative reaction.\nOne young teenager, 13 years old, I would guess, was quite helpful during my first season. He offered some advice and encouragement one day, which turned out to be a breakthrough session.\nOther than that, though, I don't have much interaction with the younger set. The younger snowboarders usually avoid riding on the lift with me. I think a large part of it is that they want to hang out on the lift with their pals. And I must admit, sometimes I feel very out of place in the crowd.\nI meet some older guys on trays every so often. (In fact, one day I met three others.) We usually encourage each other, since we know that it's harder for us to learn. Most of the time when I find a fellow \"gray,\" he's a few places in front of or behind me on the learning curve. We help each other out. Two of the guys, I specifically remember, were being trailed by their children, who were helping them out. I've seen one guy riding an alpine board, ripping up the place; it was obvious that he knew what he was doing.\nAt the local hill, I took some group lessons during my first season; there were five students and one instructor. Only one of the other students was over 21. After our lesson, he said something like \"That was really cool, what you were doing out there.\" Puzzled, I asked him what he meant. His reply? \"I mean, for someone your age.\" Hey, I ain't dead, yet!\nThis year, I took a lesson out west. One of the instructors was in her 50s. All the students and the instructors were adults. We all had a great, though exhausting time.\nI had gone out west as part of a ski party of about 20 people. They've been going to Colorado for decades, and I started making the trip with them a few years ago. Nearly everyone else in the group is in their 70s. A few of them gave me a hard time about riders who make deep carves in the snow, or who (they say) travel out of control at high speeds. But there was also a member of the group who has done some riding back home, so they couldn't criticize me too much. Besides, I spent most of my days on skis.\nThe Off-Season\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: What do you do in the off season?\nGraysOnTrays.com: I golf, for one thing. The sport is a tease: in every round something good happens, something good enough to make me want to go back. I also shoot free throws, to help develop my eye-hand coordination for putting. Occasionally I'll hop on a street bike, and I bought a pair of roller blades that I try from time to time. Once or twice during the summer I will ride jet skis in Lake Michigan with my parents. We have a blast jumping the waves. I also do some limited weight training. But week in and week out, I probably spend more time on a stair-stepper than doing any other exercise.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: I am convinced that snowboarding is better than golf, but what are some other retiree sports you think you could pull some people away from and into snowboarding?\nGraysOnTrays.com: You must have looked at the section on the site called \"Top 10 Reasons why snowboarding is better than golf.\"\nWell, first of all, golf is not just for retired people! Remember, Tiger Woods was wowing people with his putting skills when he was three years old. The latest phenomenon in the golfing world, by the way, is 13-year old Michelle Wie.\nFor most people, snowboarding and golf are both seasonal activities, so they can complement each other. My golf game is improving, so I'm not sure that snowboarding is actually better, but I thought it would be fun to catch the attention of an older crowd by making the comparison.\nI know that many riders and skiers go mountain biking in the summer, but that's not something I've done. Maybe some day--after all, I read that President Bush took a 17 mile ride the other day, and he's not a young guy.\nObviously the sports that involve balancing on a board of some sort may draw people to snowboarding -- wakeboarding, surfing, skateboarding, windsurfing, water skiing, and alpine skiing. Don't forget plain old skiing. Supposedly, riding is easier on the knees than skiing, so maybe that's one way that older folks will take up a snowboard.\nI also think that riding personal water craft (jet skis) can be an entry point to snowboarding. If you enjoy riding one of those machines on the ocean or one of the Great Lakes--something with choppy water--you may like snowboarding. You've got the thrill of speed and the need to watch for traffic and read the terrain properly (you'll even have \"hits\" in both activities).\nWhy Ride?\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: How often do you get out and ride and at what mountain?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Nearly all of my riding is at mini-hills in the Midwest. Last season I had a season pass, and got to my local hill once a week. Next season I may diversify and try some of the other areas around here. I also take an annual trip to Colorado. It's always been about skiing, but this last time out, I took a day lesson on a board, and I will probably do that next season, too.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: What is the hook about snowboarding, what does it do for you?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Since I've taken up snow sports a few years ago, I actually look forward to winter. That's a good thing, since it's so long here. If I couldn't do something outdoors, I would eat potato chips all the time and gain 20 pounds a year.\nSo I ski around here, but skiing in the Midwest gets to be old hat pretty quickly. In my attempts to learn snowboarding, even a tiny hill becomes an adventure all over again. There's simply the challenge of linking turns on a consistent basis, for one thing. From time to time, I also work at riding switch, which is something I've never done on skis.\nWhen I'm satisfied with my ability to handle alpine riding, there's always the terrain park, which is a whole new world. I don't know if I will actually do that, but then again, I never thought I would be on a snowboard in the first place.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: Glad to hear you are shreddin. Keep it up!\nGraysOnTrays.com: Thanks. I'm still learning, but it's been worthwhile.\nDiscussion\nFor more information about snowboarding for adults, check out the Grays on Trays discussion board\nReturn to the clips page.\nReturn to the home page.\nCopyright \u00a9 2003-09 John R.

The Grays on Trays web site has garnered some press as well.\nSan Jose Mercury-News\nThe San Jose Mercury News (circulation 304,814) quoted the site publisher in a story about adult snowboarders, called Snowboarding Grows Up , in its November 13, 2005 edition.\nDaily Universe\nThe Daily Universe, the student publication of Brigham Young University, included several quotes from the Grays on Trays publisher in its November 17, 2005 story on the changing nature of snowboarding .\nBend Bulletin\nThe December 3, 2004 Bend (Oregon) Bulletin carried an article about grown-up snowboarders who ride at Mt. Bachelor . It had this to say: \"The term 'grays on trays' -- used to describe snowboarders over age 30 -- is sometimes used derisively by younger snowriders. But the grays on trays don't care. A Web site devoted to adult snowboarders titled graysontrays.com suggests as much.\"\nEugene Register Guard\nThe story was reprinted by the Register-Guard of Eugene, Oregon.

It's always been about skiing, but this last time out, I took a day lesson on a board, and I will probably do that next season, too.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: What is the hook about snowboarding, what does it do for you?\nGraysOnTrays.com: Since I've taken up snow sports a few years ago, I actually look forward to winter. That's a good thing, since it's so long here. If I couldn't do something outdoors, I would eat potato chips all the time and gain 20 pounds a year.\nSo I ski around here, but skiing in the Midwest gets to be old hat pretty quickly. In my attempts to learn snowboarding, even a tiny hill becomes an adventure all over again. There's simply the challenge of linking turns on a consistent basis, for one thing. From time to time, I also work at riding switch, which is something I've never done on skis.\nWhen I'm satisfied with my ability to handle alpine riding, there's always the terrain park, which is a whole new world. I don't know if I will actually do that, but then again, I never thought I would be on a snowboard in the first place.\nSNOWBOARDERMAG: Glad to hear you are shreddin. Keep it up!\nGraysOnTrays.com: Thanks. I'm still learning, but it's been worthwhile.\nDiscussion\nJoin the conversation, and meet us at the Grays on Trays discussion board .\nReturn to the home page.\nCopyright \u00a9 2003-09 John R.

So far this season more than 20 IPC Alpine Skiing competitions have taken place, with around a quarter of the athletes being women.\n\u201cAt present there is an under-representation of women and girls in our sport,\u201d said Sylvana Mestre, the IPC Sports Council Representative for Alpine Skiing.\n\u201dThis lack is a cause for concern that the Sport Technical Committee will address in its meeting next spring in order to establish a positive trend to increase women's participation in the sport at all levels.\u201d\nMestre stresses the importance of grassroots development, but she recognizes that skiing at an elite level is not easy for anyone. It is expensive, requires huge time commitments and lots of travel to competitions. On top of that, the extra demands of home and family often fall on women.\nOne development initiative will take place in March, when the Agitos Foundation will hold a Winter Youth Camp in Spain. Though the camp is aimed at both sexes, the Agitos Foundation always encourages delegations to bring equal numbers of boys and girls.\nDeveloping the grassroots\nAs well as initiatives driven by the IPC, Skiers themselves are also leading by example to bring more women into the grassroots level.\n\u201cThe grassroots development is absolutely critical. There is no future if you don\u2019t develop the youth. You need a grassroots programme in order to have an international racing programme,\u201d said Canada\u2019s Colette Bourgonje, a competitive Nordic sit-skier, who works on a project called SASKI Skiing for Disabled to recruit people with a disability and teach them the basics of skiing - whether alpine, cross-country or snowboarding.\nMany women, Bourgonje says, are not aware of the opportunities out there for them.\n\u201cMany women say, \u2018oh I didn\u2019t know that existed\u2019. And even if they knew it existed they didn\u2019t know they could get the equipment in Saskatchewan. It\u2019s motivating to me to see how excited these girls are and how it can add to their quality of life physically and mentally, so that to me is highly motivating.\u201d\nCourtney Knight is another Canadian Paralympic skier who has channelled her energy into coaching a programme called \u201cSkiing is Believing\u201d at a local ski club.\nThe programme teaches skiing to people with a disability as well as their family and friends. The idea is that by teaching them together, they will go skiing together, which Knight says encourages more women to take part.\n\u201cIf we can teach a friend or family member how to go out on snow with person with a disability and they\u2019re both comfortable on the snow, then you\u2019re going to increase the opportunity that those two are going to ski again because they have that social connection, which I think is more important for women than for men,\u201d said Knight, whose ultimate goal is to find the next generation of skiers.\nBy staying with their sports, both women are, on an individual level, encouraging the next generation of women to compete.\nMore women as leaders\nAs well as training grassroots skiers, another opportunity for women is as the national coach \u2013 an area that men have traditionally been dominant, not just in Parlaympic sport.\n\u201dWe need to ensure there are female role models athletes, coaches and IPCAS officials,\u201d said Sylvana Mestre.\n\u201cWe are nominating women as officials in our big events. In Sochi we will have a female Technical Delegate, Elena Gaja from Italy.\u201d\nWith women like Mestre driving change, there are signs of greater inclusiveness in the Paralympic Movement, with three female coaches working on the Alpine Skiing circuit.\n\u201dI'm happy about the fact that in this circuit we don\u2019t have that many challenges as women. Everyone is respectful about that,\u201d said Alexia Tauler, who has been coaching the Spanish team for three years.\n\u201cI would encourage women to become sports coaches. It's a very cool job especially if you love sport and teaching.\u201d\nDaniela Mandler, Austrian Alpine Skiing Coach since the 2009/10 season, reaffirmed this.\n\u201cIn Paralympic Sport, it\u2019s not difficult to become a coach as a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cIn non-disability sport it\u2019s much worse, I think.\u201d\n\u201cYou need a bit of time, until you get the trust of the athletes because when you go there as a woman, they think at first, \u2018A woman, she can\u2019t do anything\u2019, but after a while, you win the trust of the athletes and now it\u2019s no problem.\u201d\nAlison Bombadier, who coaches the Australian Paralympic Alpine Skiing team says it is important to have female coaches as role models.\n\u201cI think you are a role model to the girls,\u201d said Bombadier. \u201cBut you\u2019re also a role model to the boys\u2026 For male athletes to see women in a strong position, it can change their mindset.\u201d\nWith a strong female contingent on the Australian skiing team, including Melissa Perrine, Jessica Gallagher and Victoria Pendergast, Bombardier hopes girls will open their eyes to the opportunities out there.\n\u201cRight now we have three females on our team and the exposure that they get can show other girls out there that it\u2019s something they can do,\u201d said Bombardier.\n\u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t as strong as what they could be, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll build up.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 831.4731, "uuid": "ff3e021f-7f5f-53a8-a137-92e9c66f44a5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-14-09459", "target_hostname": "www.co-operativetravel.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.co-operativetravel.co.uk/ski/usa/breckenridge/", "page_rank": 1.2528637e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Breckenridge Ski Holidays \u2013 cheap <em>skiing</em> holiday deals", "snippet": "<em>Skiing</em> on the slopes around Breckenridge <em>is</em> considered <em>more</em> for experts than beginners, with <em>more</em> than half of the runs being classified as \u2018most <em>difficult</em>\u2019 <em>or</em> for experts only.", "explanation": null, "document": "breckenridge ski holidays\none of the most popular in the United States\nJust celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2009, the Colorado ski resort of Breckenridge is one of the most consistently popular in the United States, and you can discover its delights on a winter break with The Co-operative Travel.\nComprising four peaks, Breckenridge is proud to cater for skiers of all abilities, as well as offering top-class snowboarding facilities.\nThe character of much of the original gold-mining town still shines through as you wander past the clapboarded houses at the bottom of Main Street, which contains no fewer than 170 listed buildings.

Based on the reports of the last couple of days, I wasn't expecting good snow, at least in the lower reaches, and I was not disappointed.\nThe 4818 road was closed by about 2' of snow at the Lake Kachess snowpark (~2200'), so I fishscaled the 1.5 miles to the actual trailhead on forest roads nicely groomed by snowmobiles (none out today, fortunately). From there, I skinned up the trail, where the snow was mostly frozen tree-drip, or in the open, breakable crust. There had been gusty east winds on the road approach, but the climb was protected and the sun came out occasionally, softening the breakable crust in open areas. When I reached the lip of the hanging valley (~3600') and the start of the nice old-growth forest, the trees were suddenly holding lots of snow in their branches, and the quality of the snow became better - more powdery, though dense and still crusted in places from tree-drip. The snowpack was 4-5' deep here, judging from the stream banks. A pole could be pushed in 15-20\" before hitting a crust, but trail breaking wasn't bad as my skis only sank in a few inches at most. I skied about a mile up the valley (very flat here), then considered my options.\nI have always had as my destination the meadows and short runs at the head of the valley, but I didn't think I would make it that far (another 4 miles) this day, so I decided to skin directly up the NE-facing valley slope to the top of Kachess Ridge. The first 600' was pretty straight-forward, in open forest and mostly on tree-bombed dense powder or light tree-drip, although it didn't look so good with descending eyes. Then I got into an area with many more small trees, and had to do some traversing to the left before I could climb again. I stopped for lunch, got cold (it was ~25 degrees and somewhat windy), and so started skinning up again, discovering that my lunch spot was only about 50vf below the ridge top, which I gained at ~4600'. Wow, it was a nice place! Open, wide, fringed with trees, and with great views out to Mt. Rainier, Snoqualmie Pass area peaks, and Mt. Stuart, and down to Kachess Lake and the Yakima River valley. There weren't much in the way of cornices, so I skinned N to the top of Point 4884. From there, it would be possible to continue on to Point 5194 (and beyond?), but I was out of time (it was 2:45), so I took off the skins and started my glorious 2600' powder run. Oops, that was another day.\nThe run down the ridge was fun, with a variety of not bad snow conditions - powder, light tree-drip, and, in exposed areas, stiff wind-pack. The run back down the NE slope to the valley floor was not good - too dense small trees at the top, too variable conditions to get any real rythym going for most of the rest of the way. I did find one open glade toward the bottom and got about 10 linked turns in very nice, dense powder. The ski back to the lip of the hanging valley was fast, and the waxless skis allowed me to climb the little rises along the way but get long glides as well. From there, I mostly skied right down the trail. Or rather, I side-slipped along the uphill side of the trail cut, the snow being way too fast to just point 'em, and this was easily the most tiring part of the trip. I gave up skiing the trail about 100vf from the trailhead because my tips kept getting caught on shrubs protruding from the dwindling snowpack, but had a fast glide/skate/double-pole ride back to the car on the forest roads.\nCorn dog report: I stopped by the corn dog shack next to Traveller's Rest at Snoqualmie Pass on the way back. The shack is open and the corn dogs are as good as ever (and that means the best corn dogs in the world - dipped and fried while you wait). You can still get your dog dipped in jalapeno batter only on Saturdays and Sundays.\nCharles\n"}, {"score": 823.3018, "uuid": "6097b609-44bd-584b-ad54-47ab1cad8d82", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0607wb-11-34190", "target_hostname": "www.skicoupons.com", "target_uri": "http://www.skicoupons.com/groups.cfm/r/15/g/26/s/info", "page_rank": 1.5513646e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Ski Heavenly - California <em>Skiing</em> at Lake Tahoe", "snippet": "$100 OFF Mention this Ad and Receive $100 Off the Event Tent <em>or</em> Bride and Groom Stay Free With 5 <em>or</em> <em>More</em> Rooms* <em>Skiing</em> at Heavenly <em>is</em> an unforgettable experience replete with stunning mountain vistas, deep powdery chutes, flawlessly groomed trails, and state of the art lifts.", "explanation": null, "document": "$100 OFF Mention this Ad and Receive $100 Off the Event Tent or Bride and Groom Stay Free With 5 or More Rooms*\nHeavenly Ski Experience\nSkiing at Heavenly is an unforgettable experience replete with stunning mountain vistas, deep powdery chutes, flawlessly groomed trails, and state of the art lifts.

Rocky Mountain Nordic, a division of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA), is the Rocky Mountain region's official governing body for Nordic ski racing. The Colorado Cup's first season took place in the 2005-06 winter and resulted in a successful combination of citizen and elite ski racing, Colorado's best races and the establishment of a body of Nordic competition in the region.\nThe 2006-07 schedule includes the Snow Mountain Stampede and the Crested Butte Alley Loop-the two biggest and most prestigious ski marathons in the state-as well as the Owl Creek Chase, a 25km freestyle race included in the USSA SuperTour series of national level races. A full schedule of events and details can be found at www.rmnordic.org.\nThe Colorado Cup's goals are to integrate Nordic races and recreational events in an organized body of events that both serve the racing and recreational skier while also serving to develop and support world-class athletes to compete on the international level. Together with the new Rocky Mountain Nordic Tour events which will allow recreational skiers to enjoy non-competitive events on unique courses throughout the state, the Colorado Cup aims to benefit skiers, racers, ski areas and the sport as a whole. Eventually, Colorado Cup races hope to include juniors, collegiate, masters and elite racers.\nRacers in the Colorado Cup earn points based on their finishing place. The points are tallied cumulatively throughout the season based on official USSA five-year age groups and overall categories by gender. At the end of the season, overall male and female winners are declared the Colorado State Champions and age-group winners are named to the RMN Select Team. Overall and age group leaders are identified in each race by special bibs that denote their status.\nSumming up the upcoming season, spokesperson Matt Muir says, \"We're all excited and the hope is that we can continue to improve Nordic events for everyone involved and for the good of the sport as well.\"\nFor more information, contact spokesperson Matt Muir at matt@skifire.com or RMN executive director Ivana Radlova at ivana@rmnordic.org.\nCrested Butte Nordic to Host 6th Annual Thanksgiving Training Camp November 24-26\nStart the Nordic season off right with cross country ski clinics designed for the beginner to advanced skiers wishing to hone their skate or classical skiing techniques.

The \"Ultimate Outdoor Adventure\" recently welcomed a group of newly injured soldiers - predominately amputees - to hike, raft and climb together in the rugged terrain of the Grand Canyon. Managing Program Director, Sarah Williams, led the soldiers on the groundbreaking Challenge Aspen expedition. \"This 10-day program was undoubtedly the most powerful experience that we have encountered,\" Williams says. The group of 16 veterans, physical therapists from Palo Alto Medical Center, Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Brook Army Medical Center and an experienced staff from Challenge Aspen covered 226 miles in motorized boats, maneuvering their prosthetics on day hikes through creek beds and waterfalls.\n\"For some of the soldiers, it was only a matter of months since their injury,\" Williams explains. \"It was clearly evident that this trip not only challenged their physical abilities, but proved to be a catalyst for emotional and psychological breakthroughs. These guys have been so busy healing that they have all this to learn about real possibilities down the road. The experience was invaluable for all involved, building confidence by adapting and succeeding and ultimately leading to a smoother transition back into society,\" she adds.\nSeveral of the soldiers were transitioning from a hospital bed to this more practical therapy offered by Challenge Aspen in the unique terrain of the Grand Canyon. \"For some, it had only been months since their injury in Iraq or Afghanistan,\" explains Kristi Say, a Physical Therapist who joined the trip from Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Brian Fountaine, a 24-year old soldier was scheduled to fly out of Iraq on June 10, but on June 8 he was hit by an IED and lost both legs bi-laterally, below the knees. Brian healed well enough to be able to join the trip, but was still very fresh off his injury. \"I think that these outings and opportunities challenge more than physical abilities,\" says Say. \"There is only so much that we can do in a hospital or clinical setting. All of the work that they have been doing in physical and occupational therapy is truly tested out there in the 'real world,\" she explains.\nJoey Bozik, a 28-year old was injured in Iraq 18 months ago, suffering a triple amputation. \"The Grand Canyon trip came at the perfect time. I was able to let go of all the things that had been weighing me down and just enjoy the nature that was surrounding me. You may never know how much you have helped me, but I will always carry your gracious love for soldiers with me,\" he wrote in a letter of thanks to the staff of Challenge Aspen.\nAnother physical therapist that accompanied a group of newly injured soldiers on the excursion offered her perspective on the therapeutic growth on the trip, \"It's difficult to put into words what the guys obtained from the opportunity to do \"normal\" outdoor activities,\" she says. \"Over the course of the trip, many guys appeared to grow in confidence: they attempted new challenges, trying to outdo each other. They also seemed to be less afraid of asking for help and less embarrassed by stumbles or falls. The Challenge Aspen staff/volunteers were instrumental in facilitating this growth, not treating the guys as babies or invalids, but encouraging and providing assistance in dignifying ways.\"\n\"Tri-It\" Camp for Women\nA Workshop for Blind Athletes and Sighted Guides\nA fun three-day instructional camp aimed at introducing visually impaired women and sighted guides to the sport of triathlon will be offered April 19-22, 2007 in Glenwood Springs, Colo. Participants will be introduced to basic swim, bike, and run/walk skills necessary to complete a sprint triathlon. Sighted guides and blind athletes will learn the fundamentals of swimming together with a bungee cord, riding together on a tandem bicycle and running together with a tether. The camp will conclude with a mini-tri on Sunday morning.\nThe camp is open to adventurous blind or visually impaired women who have a desire to learn the sport of triathlon. In addition, courageous sighted women who wish to give the gift of guiding to a visually impaired woman are invited to participate. Visually impaired women are encouraged to recruit and bring their own sighted guides.\nParticipants should be in good health and complete a physician consent form and waiver prior to camp. Participants should have elementary skills in swimming, biking and run/walking: be able to swim two lengths of a pool freestyle, ride a bike if you are a sighted guide, be able to ride a tandem if you are visually impaired, and be able to walk/run a mile under 20 minutes.\nFor more information on coaches, costs or how to apply, contact Nancy Stevens at nstevens@sopris.net or call (970) 945-2171.\nMICHIGAN\nNational Ski Championships Heading for Houghton\nThe nation's top cross country skiers will travel to Houghton, Michigan, in early January for the 2007 U.S. Cross Country Championship. The Michigan Tech Nordic Training Center will host the national championship for cross country skiing January 1-7, 2007.\nThe event features four days of racing, including distance races on January 3 and 4 and sprint races on January 6 and 7. More than 400 skiers will participate, including many members of the U.S. Ski Team, regional development teams and top collegiate teams.\nSpectators will walk on groomed trails leading to virtually any part of the race course. Three web cams will allow distant visitors to log into www.seniornationals.org and track starts and finishes. A huge stadium scoreboard will display results throughout the race day.\nBoth the 2007 and 2008 championships will be held in Houghton. The races are the United States Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) national Nordic skiing championships. USSA is the national governing body for skiing (both Nordic and alpine) and snowboarding.\nThe Houghton organizers earned the bid based on the success of the 2006 Junior Olympics (JOs), which were held at Michigan Tech University last March. The JOs serve as the national championship for skiers ages 14-19. More than 350 skiers from around the country attended the week-long series of races.\n\"The upcoming event is the national championship for cross country skiing in the U.S.,\" said Mike Abbott, chair of the organizing committee. \"With the experience our volunteers and organizers gained at the JOs, I'm confident we will be just as successful with this event.\"\nThe cross country championship week begins with two training days, January 1 and 2, before the first races commence on Wednesday, January 3. Skiers will participate in the distance classic races, with men covering a 10km course, while the women will ski 5km.\nJanuary 4 features the freestyle races: 10km for women and 15km for men. After a training day on January 5, skiers will race a classic sprint on Saturday, January 6 and participate in a team freestyle spring on January 7. This will be the first time the USSA has held a team sprint at a national championship.\nThe Michigan Tech Nordic Training Center was designed to be spectator friendly. Many viewing locations are an easy walk, on a groomed trail, from the stadium. Most of the sprint course can be seen from the stadium. The large stadium, including bleachers, allows easy viewing of the start and finish areas.\nThe newest improvement to the trail system is the Boss Snowplow Nordic Wax Center, added for the Junior Olympics with a generous donation from Boss Snowplow, based in Iron Mountain, Michigan. The center includes ten separate team wax rooms and a community wax room and changing area.\nComplete information on the event, and a peek at the webcams, is available at www.seniornationals.org\nTHE NORTH AMERICAN VASA: A 'FESTIVAL OF RACES' FOR SKIERS OF ALL AGES AND ABILITIES\nBryce Dreeszen has skied in some of the top cross-country races in the U.S. and Europe, but he considers himself an \"everyman\" skier rather than an elite competitor.\nAnd as the new race director of the North American Vasa Festival of Races in Traverse City, he insists that every skier deserves to have a \"world class skiing experience\" at the Vasa - whether that skier is a potential Olympic contender, an eager novice or just someone who wants to enjoy some magnificent woodland scenery and a little race-day excitement on one of the best groomed trails in the Midwest.\n\"We've been working to correct the impression that the Vasa is only for the hard-core competitive skier,\" he said. \"The truth is, we have something for everyone. We expect to have 800 skiers this year, and probably 10 percent or less of them will be elite skiers. The bulk of the people out there will be competing against the clock, against their buddies or against themselves - and some won't be competing at all.\"\nNow in its 31st year, the Vasa is held each February in the pinewoods of Traverse City, Mich. (This year's event is scheduled for Feb. 9-11.) The main Saturday race, which features 12K, 27K and 50K loops, in either freestyle or classic styles, is one of 14 U.S. events listed in the prestigious American Ski Marathon Series, where most of the nation's elite and professional ski racers compete. Sunday's 16K traditional-style race, the Gran Travers Classic, is an equally prestigious event for old-school Nordic skiers, and one of the events in the Michigan Cup classic race series.\nOver the past decade, race organizers have added a wide range of other events for skiers of all shapes, ages and skill levels: 1K sprints for preschoolers, 3K freestyle and classic events for older youths, and even noncompetitive 3K and 10K tours for those who prefer to enjoy winter's natural beauty at a more leisurely pace.\nAnd there's a lot of beauty to appreciate. The Vasa is held on a beautifully crafted trail that winds through the dense pines and hardwoods of Michigan's Pere Marquette State Forest, just east of Traverse City. Since 2005, the start and finish lines for the various events have been at the Timber Ridge RV and Recreation Resort, whose trails connect to the main Vasa system.\nIn addition to the hundreds of skiers who actually head out on the trails, hundreds of spectators come to watch the race and enjoy the festivities that surround it. Over the past three decades, the Vasa has become a treasured part of winter life in Traverse City, and almost everyone in the community seems to participate in it one way or another.\nThe festival actually begins the day before the main race with registration, social time, and a day-long series of free on-snow equipment demonstrations where participants can try the newest ski and snowshoe gear. That evening, there's an annual \"Vasa Pasta\" dinner, an all-you-can-eat event where contestants try to pack away as many carbohydrates as possible.\nThe first races, the 27km and 50km classic competitions, start at 8:30 Saturday morning, followed by 27km and 50km freestyle races, the 12km classic/freestyle race, and finally the 3km and 10km adult touring events. In the afternoon, starting at 12:30 p.m. are the Junior Vasa races, a series of 1km and 3 km competitions for children ages 4-15.\n\"Junior Vasa skiers will be the Vasa skiers of the future,\" said the Vasa's executive director, Pete LaPlaca. \"Hopefully they'll remember the fun they had on skis in this event, and continue the sport for their entire lives. The smiles on these kid's faces are our reward.\"\nOn Sunday, the course is regroomed and turned over to traditional-style skiers. The Gran Travers Classic race, which starts at 9 a.m., features 6km and 16km loops on a tracked trail.\nFor information about the North American Vasa and other winter events, festivals and activities in beautiful Traverse City, call the Traverse City Convention & Visitors Bureau at 1-800-TRAVERSE or visit www.mytraversecity.com.\nMichigan's ABR Ski Trails Opens October 14 and 15\nAn early October snowstorm hit Ironwood, Michigan, a small town of 6,238 people on the Wisconsin border, on October 12, 2006. It ended up dropping about 19 inches of snowfall. The ground was still warm, but blanketed with the white magic which got trail groomer Eric Anderson and his team from ABR Ski Trails to take a gamble and prepare a portion of their 42 km cross country ski trail system for skiing.\n\"We knew this snow was coming from the weather reports, we just did not know if the folks down south would come up this early. They are biking, golfing and gardening now. We opened October 28 and 29 in 2003, and had over 300 hundred skiers so we figured we would give it a try\" says Eric Anderson head groomer and co-owner of ABR. \"This weekend we had 219 skiers on Saturday and another 104 on Sunday. Conditions were pretty good on Saturday until the sun came out and the skier traffic wore out the snow in the afternoon. We groomed and opened up another eight-10 km of trails on Sunday, and had good early season skiing on Sunday right up until 6 PM as we closed with the St. Olaf Ski team from Northfield, Minn.\"\nRandy Coleman, an Ironwood native now living in Richland Center, Wis. is the unofficial Nordic ski historian of the Midwest. He cannot remember an earlier opening of groomed skied trails for the Midwest in the last 32 years.\nMatt Liebsch, CXC team skier from Minneapolis, Minn., was headed to train on hiking trails and roller skis in Duluth. \"I saw they had snow and our team changed plans fast. Skiing on snow trains different muscles and mostly helps motivate us for upcoming season.\"\nMarty Wacker a recreational skier of Stevens Point, Wis. came up to ski and planned to go muskie fishing on the way home on the Turtle Flambeau Flowage. He said has never seen October skiing in his 34 years of skiing.\nOllie Garrison, coach of St. Olaf Ski Team had a weekend planned to dryland train and quickly changed plans to train on snow with his team from Northfield Minn. \"The team is ecstatic to be on snow this early, sometimes we have a difficult time finding snow during the main season.\"\nABR (Active Backwoods Retreats) has just completed 10 years of expansion and refinement. Originally a bare bones cross country ski area with just 12 kilometers of trails, they're now a full-service cross country ski center. This winter you can enjoy 42 kilometers of groomed trails spread over 600 acres, complemented by a ski shop and ski-in/ski-out lodging.\nMINNESOTA\nMarshall Holiday Ski Camp\nThe Marshall Holiday Ski Camp for children ages 5-12 will be held on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday December 27, 28 and 29 from 1-4 pm each day at Snowflake Nordic Ski Center in Duluth, Minn. The camp is supervised by the Marshall Nordic Coaching Staff. Instruction is provided by the members of Marshall Nordic High School Team.\nCamp registration materials can be found: www.marshallschool.org/school/johnson/marshallholidayskicamp.htm.

This year is no exception.\nIn the Upper Gunflint Ski Area winter lodge guests will find several changes. Gunflint Pines Resort notes that this winter the \"Pines\" will join Gunflint, Bearskin and Golden Eagle Lodges in offering a lit night ski trail. Gunflint Pines' lit trail will run through their campgrounds. Gunflint Lodge plans to have their new Red Peddle Bistro open daily from noon to 9 PM throughout the winter. And according to Lee Kerfoot of Gunflint, five of the lodge's cabins are being renovated; two of which will be open by Christmas. The cabins will feature king beds, hand crafted wood burning fireplaces made of native rocks and super showers with 3 showerheads. At Heston's Lodge one of their log cabins is being restored and will be open for the winter ski season.\nAlong the Banadad Ski Trail System, Boundary Country Trekking is planning several changes to greet skier this winter. First, a new 1.6 km. tracked trail to the Tall Pines Yurt has been built. According to Boundary Country's Barbara Young, \"Skiers on the way to the Tall Pines Yurt will no longer have to travel along the old untracked service road.\" Near the Banadad's eastern trailhead the Swamp Lake Snowshoe Trail has been expanded with the addition of a new 1/2 km connecting trail section. Boundary Country will also be offering a new luxurious ski-in two-bedroom rental cabin - the Poplar Creek Retreat. The cabin currently is under construction and will be available for rent by the end of January.\nNear the Central Gunflint Trail System, Lynn Pauloski co-owner of Clearwater Lodge plans to open the two B&B suite in their historic lodge building and a modern two bedroom cabin this winter. According to Pauloski, this will be the first time in many years that the lodge has been open during the winter. The Lodge is just a short drive from the Central Gunflint ski trails.\nThe 180-km Gunflint Nordic Ski Trails consist of three interconnected trails systems. Beginning 24 miles up the Gunflint Trail from the Lake Superior coastal town of Grand Marais is the Central Gunflint Trails operated by Golden Eagle and Bearskin Lodges. Further up the Gunflint Trail around Gunflint Lake is the Upper Gunflint Trail System operated by Gunflint, Gunflint Pines, Heston's and Moosehorn lodges. Connecting these two trail systems is the BWCA longest tracked trail - the Banadad operated by Boundary Country Trekking.\nFor additional information on the Gunflint Nordic Trails and trail maps go to the Gunflint Trail Association's cross country skiing website at - www.gunflint-trail.com/winter/xcski.html or call (218)387-3191 or (800)338-6932.\nLake Superior College Online Sponsors Nordic Spirit Ski Event\nLake Superior College in Duluth, Minn. and LSC Online are the title sponsors of this year's Nordic Spirit Ski Race and Tour. The event will take place on the scenic and challenging Spirit Mountain/Magney-Snively ski trail system on Sunday, January 28, 2007.\nThe Nordic Spirit Ski Race and Tour is conducted by the Duluth XC Ski Club. It features three race categories: a 10k Classic event and 13 and 25k freestyle races, providing opportunities for both serious racers and recreational skiers.\n\"We believe that the Nordic Spirit is sure to become a premiere regional sporting event,\" Barry Dahl, LSC's vice president of technology and the Virtual Campus, explained. \"It's a great partnership opportunity for us because of the Duluth XC Ski Club's focus on education and training. It promises to be a high-quality, mid-season race that will attract increasing numbers of skiers to our community.\"\nLSC is a leading provider of online training programs for recreational sports. In recent years the college has offered college credit courses in cooperation with Grandma's Marathon, the American Birkebeiner and the NorthShore Inline Marathon.\nFor more information about the race visit www.DuluthXC.com.

The trail will be double tracked for classic skiers adding to the extensive network of classic groomed trails at Maplelag. With this new trail the total kilometers of groomed trails at Maplelag is now at 64km. Other cat work this fall included the building of \"Mount Maplelag\" and the Nordic Fun area. Plans are to enhance the area with rails, barrels, flat box jumps and kickers for the Jib skaters and other Nordic trick-seeking enthusiasts.\nHigh School Ski Camps\nOnce again, Maplelag will be hosting the popular high school ski camps featuring members of the skinnyski.com racing team the second and third weekends of December. The camps include a classic ski race, clinics covering both classic and skate technique, waxing, training and nutrition seminars and ski games on Sunday. Space is limited so coaches, parents and boosters clubs are encouraged to register early.\nSugarbush Trail Enhancements\nThe Sugarbush Trail Association has completed the addition of a 6km connector trail and the addition of a 5km cross-country ski trail for skijoring. The extensive 65km Sugarbush Trail cross country ski trail system is located near Tofte, Minn. and is accessed by three trailheads Moose Fence, Britton Peak and Oberg Mountain.\nGrooming will continue this year on the 4km Summit View trail for skijoring, which is accessed from the Britton Peak trailhead, 3 miles north of the Sawbill Trail from Tofte. The new 5km skijoring trail will be accessible from the Moose Fence trailhead, 6.5 miles north of the Sawbill Trail from Tofte. This beautiful, rolling trail encompasses the Upland Loop and a portion of the Maple Loop. The new skijoring section will have a one-year trial period.\nAfter three years of overgrowth and non-use, the connector trail from the Sugarbush Trail system to the Lutsen Trail system has been opened again. This 6km connector allows skiers to ski all of the Sugarbush system then proceed to the Lutsen/Tofte Nordic Center at Superior National golf course. From the Nordic center, skiers can then ski an additional 20km to the Cascade trails near Lutsen, Minn.\nThe Sugarbush Trail Association along with the cooperation of the U.S. Forest Service is also pleased to announce the expansion of the parking lot at the Britton Peak trailhead near Tofte, Minn.

It is still a young sport and there are many people eager to learn more about the enjoyment the sport has to offer. Without going to a mountain and taking a few lessons it is hard to fully appreciate what the sport really is, and the sensation that riding a snowboard gives. Hopefully, my report will tell everything a person would need to know about equipment, so that they can go try the sport out for themselves. The first snowboard ever marketed was produced by Shervin Popper, in 1964. It was a crude model put together in his garage, after he saw his daughter trying to go down a hill on a sled standing up. It consisted of two children\u0092s skis strapped together, with some doweling on the top for foot attraction. His daughter took it to the local sledding hill, and soon enough all the kids wanted one. Another pioneer was Dimitrije Milovich, a surfer from the east coast. He made his invention because of the lack of warm water in the winter. This board also had no bindings, but it included iron edges. In the early seventies Milovich began limited production of these custom boards. In 1977 the main snowboard company for today started production. Jake Burton made and sold his prototypes with handmade bindings. These included some elements similar to modern design. Tom Sims also started production of some boards. In 1979 Tom Sims and Chuck Barfoot created the first board made of fiberglass. At the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties, the snowboard began to appear in some sports magazines and on American and Canadian TV. A beer commercial showed Paul Graves riding a snowboard. This introduced the snowboard to the public, although it was still considered a strange sport. Now that snowboards were allowed on some mountains, the board needed to be redesigned so that it would work on packed snow. Shaped wood can slide along on a hill of deep powder, and it could turn pretty good, but it still was slow and hard to turn on packed snow. In 1980 and 1981 the three main snowboard companies, Burton, Sims, and John Winterstick began to produce fiberglass boards with polietilene (P-tex) bases, as well as metal edges. The same year the Struck Brothers produced a board with two small skis on the bottom. Called the Swingbo, it was easier to carve and turn on packed snow. When snowboard companies found out about the importance of flex, sidecut, and camber, nine basic materials began being used. They could be manipulated or have substitutions, depending on what the board was supposed to do. These parts were wood or foam, fiberglass, poly MDI, epoxy matrix, polietilene (a.k.a. P-tex or PE), flacee or ABS, Fenolo-reinforced poly MDI or P-tex, steel inserts, and steel with rubber dampening. Wood or foam makes up the core of the board. Usually the core is made of different types of wood, stiff and light to make the board flexible and durable. Wood needs to be laminated vertically so that the glue doesn\u0092t play too important a role in the board\u0092s performance, and so the board will keep it\u0092s characteristics over time. This process is more expensive than the process to make a board with a foam core. A foam core is cheaper than wood. It can also be produced an a larger scale easier. The only problem is that it isn\u0092t as durable as a wood core, and it often needs to be reinforced with materials such as Kevlar. There are many variations of the size, shape, and placement of the core within the board. For example, a board with most of the core in the center of the board would spin easier, because there would be no counterweight to slow the spin. Fiberglass is used in all boards over and under the core to increase stiffness and to keep the board from deforming. The process of putting all the layers together is called lamination. Fiberglass is a woven structure which is usually Biaxle, meaning there are two directions in the weave, but even better is Triaxle, which has three. Poly MDI is a polymeric matrix that gives the board good flexibility over time. The epoxy matrix is the glue used to stick parts of the board together in the laminating process. It has a good shock resistance, is lightweight, and has a long life of rigidity. Steel inserts are the holes that you see on the top of a board that has no bindings on it. They are the holes that bindings screw into. They are imbedded into the fiberglass and are very strongly rooted into the board. They come in three basic patterns. The basic 4 by 4 pattern is 8 aligned inserts on each half of the board. Almost every board uses this pattern. Next is Burton\u0092s 3-d insert pattern. It only requires that three screws go into the board per binding. The up side to this is the thousands of stance possibilities that can come out of this pattern. The down side is that a lot of binding plates don\u0092t fit this pattern. The third is not very popular, it has a weird set of holes that are meant only to be filled by baseless bindings, which only have screw holes on weird parts of the edges. It is not extremely common. Maybe 1 out of 20 boards have it, if not less. The shiny layer that you can see on the top of a board is called the top sheet. Usually it\u0092s made of flacee or ABS, two extremely hard materials that are very difficult to cut. Underneath it there are usually graphics that can be put under the top sheet by printing them out on a special sheet of plastic that goes between the fiberglass and the top sheet. Side walls are the narrow sides between the top sheet and the base on the edges. The strength of this component is very important because if they are punctured, water can enter the core and rot it out. Around the edges is a strip of metal, usually steel, that allow the board a good hold on ice and protection for the board. These strips are called the edges. Between the edge and the bottom of the side wall there is a layer of dampening, often made of rubber, to absorb the shocks and vibrations coming from the edge. The edges can wrap all the way around the board, or they can stop just before the tip and tail. Edges that are not fully wrapped are just becoming popular. Various shapes and components are used for specific styles of riding. There are 4 main styles of riding, with specific boards for each: Alpine/Carving/Race, Freestyle, Freeride, and Big Mountain/Longboard. Racing, Carving, or Alpine boards are very distinguishable from other boards. They are usually thick , skinny, and have very low tails, if they have a tail at all. They can also be noticed by the hard, ski-style boots and the ski-style bindings that are used on this type of board. The board usually has a low, short tip for good performance, without vibrations at high speeds. The tail is usually very low, flat, or sometimes there is just an angled cut-off. A Freeride-Carving model would have a semi-stiff core, and a large side cut, so that the board can go at high speeds as well as make large sweeping carves. A race board would have a little side cut, and it would be very thin, so that it can switch quicker from edge to edge. A Freeriding board would have good performance in all conditions, whether powder, jumps, ice, steeps, halfpipe, and any other conditions that a mountain could have. This board mixes the characteristics of a freestyle board and an alpine board. They are large, but with a moderate sidecut . They are not too stiff, and they don\u0092t have very low or very high tips. The nose would be long and at a moderate height so that it can float in powder, and go off jumps. All models are symmetrical, but some have a distinct tip for powder. The purpose of Freeriding is to use all parts of the mountain to have fun, whether it is in the pipe or off in the trees. Freestyle boards are made for riding in the park and pipe. The boards are usually short and wide. The short length allows for better maneuvers in the air, while the large width allows for lower stance angles so that riding forward and backward can be easily done. The flex is important and with the sidecut, makes the difference between a specific board for the park or a specific board for the halfpipe. A board for the park would be stiff in the center, and soft at the tip and tail to absorb landings. A halfpipe board would have an equally distributed flex, so that the board can contour to the curve of the pipe better. A Big Mountain or Long Board is ridden by experts who do a lot of hiking around in the backcountry of the very large mountains. They are like long, wide, Freestyle boards, so that they can float in. They are usually very long, about 170 to 185 centimeters. Bindings are the mechanisms that keep the rider\u0092s feet on the board. There are three styles of bindings: strap-ins, step-ins, and hard bindings. Strap-ins are the most popular, because they have been around the longest and can be used on all types of boards except Alpine boards. Step-ins are newer, they are more convenient and are beginning to be just as high in performance as strap-ins. Only a few companies make them, and you need special boots to use them, which is why they are in second place. Third popular are hard bindings, which require specific equipment to use; an alpine board and hard boots. Snowboarding has come so far in the last few years. It came from a toy to a high-tech piece of equipment, from a sport for trouble makers to an Olympic event, from a small family owned business to a major business. In recent years we\u0092ve seen huge advances in equipment technology and performance, clothing design and smooth riding styles. This has provided the images necessary to make snowboarding appealing to all kinds of people and to assure it\u0092s growth well into the future. As more and more young people take up snowboarding, together with the increasing adult cross-over from, we can be assured that this is no fad or craze that will soon die out. Snowboarding is an individual, creative, and healthy pastime exercised in the great outdoors, and is different things to different people. Try riding and who knows, you just might enjoy it.
