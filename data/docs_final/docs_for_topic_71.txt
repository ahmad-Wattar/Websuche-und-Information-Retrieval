Using environment friendly gold for your wedding rings makes two statements. First, that you pledge fidelity and love to your spouse forever. And second, that you pledge responsibility and care to the earth, as a couple. Environment friendly gold is all the rage in our generation where global warming threatens to damage our quality of life and \u0093green\u0094 trends are gaining prominence in every arena from home care to couture fashion.\nPost-Consumer Gold\nGold mining causes great destruction to our planet and the amount of ore it takes to harvest enough gold to make one new wedding ring weighs in at around 20 tons. The chemicals used in mining (cyanide and mercury) are known to be hazardous to human health and they are routinely released into nearby water sources during the mining process.\nMany environmentally conscious couples are taking a stand against the mining industry, without having to sacrifice the rich symbolism and beauty of traditional gold wedding rings. Post-consumer gold can be made into recycled gold wedding bands with absolutely no deterioration in the quality of the precious metal itself.\nPost-consumer gold sources are many, including jewelry that is already in existence, electronics components and metals used in industrial settings. The only difference between environment friendly gold and regular gold is the fact that regular gold is mined from rocks and recycled gold is mined from existing gold sources.\nRecycled gold wedding bands are exactly equal in quality to wedding bands that are forged from gold mined directly from the earth.\nHow it Works\nWhen jewelers receive gold items to recycle, the gold is re-refined so that it is pure, just like the gold that comes out of ore and goes through a similar refining process. Then, just like with regular gold, alloys are mixed in to give the gold more strength and scratch resistance.\nAfter recycled gold has been thoroughly purified and alloyed, it is poured into unique jewelers casts and made into gorgeous wedding rings. There is a wide array of stylish designs available to couples who wish to purchase both recycled engagement rings and wedding bands.\nAesthetic Choices\nOnce a couple has decided to purchase recycled gold wedding bands form LoveWeddingBands.com, there are a few key decisions that need to be made. The most important decision the couple should make right off the bat is whether they would like to purchase traditional gold rings or go with a more modern white gold aesthetic.\nWhite gold (both regular and recycled) is typically plated with rhodium in order to enhance the luster of the metal and to protect wedding rings from tarnishing in places where they rub against the skin or they are exposed to the elements.\nAfter you have chosen the type of gold you would like to be used in your wedding rings you can move on to other details such as diamonds (or no diamonds), band type (single or double) and design elements such as engraving, weaving and beveling.

If 4 per cent of platinum is taken, these latter alloys acquire a rose-red color, while a golden-yellow color can be produced by further adding from 1 to 2 per cent (in all 5 to 6 per cent) of platinum. The last-named alloy is extensively used for ornaments, likewise alloy V.\nV.\u00a0 \u0097Ten parts platinum, 60 parts nickel, and 220 parts brass , or 2 parts platinum, 1 part nickel and silver respectively, 2 parts brass, and 5 parts copper; this also gives a golden-yellow color.\nVI\nFor table utensils a favorite alloy is composed of 1 part platinum, 100 parts nickel, and 10 parts tin.

Platinum is generally 95% pure, so platinum jewellery will not fade or tarnish and is kind to the skin. (It is very rare to have an allergic reaction to platinum). Platinum's unequaled durability, density and resistance to\u00a0wear makes it the most secure, protective metal for settings, which means your jewellery will be protected for a lifetime of wear. As platinum is naturally silvery white in appearance, it does not require rhodium plating like white gold. Platinum is purer and rarer than white gold and it retains its whiteness better than white gold. Platinum does not wear away and holds precious stones securely.\nAs it is an extremely hard metai it is an ideal setting for diamonds and gemstones. This does not stop it from scratching when worn as a ring, which will occur with normal wear and tear and like gold, it will eventually acquire its own surface patina.\nThe hardness of platinum whilst being an attribute makes it very difficult to work with from the jewellers perspective, and many more hours go into making and finishing a platinum piece of jewellery than one in any other precious metal.\nHorton stock a wide range of platinum jewellery including engagement and wedding rings and are\u00a0accredited by the International Platinum Guild as a Platinum Recommended Retailer.\nStoring and Cleaning Your Platinum\nStore pieces seperately, in a jewellery box or chamois bag so they don't get scratched by other items of jewellery. Clean your platinum jewellery periodically. This will help ensure its fine appearance and will help it last. We offer a complimentary cleaning service to all our customers and should you wish to have your platinum jewellery polished we can arrange for this to be carried out by our workshop for a small charge. Should you wish to clean your jewellery at home we always recommend to our customers that they use only a soft bristled toothbrush and warm water with washing up liquid, then rinse and gently dry with a soft cloth.\n18ct White Gold\n18ct White Gold has a slight natural yellow tint. It is normal practice to finish white gold items with\u00a0a rhodium plating which renders the piece 'silver' white. Items such as earrings, pendants, bracelets and necklaces do not suffer the wear and tear that rings do and as a consequence rings in white gold will show signs of the underlying yellow tint after a period of wear. This can easily be rectified with a re-polish and new rhodium plating.\nRings with large plain surfaces are more prone to this than others with a detailed surface. We always recommend that rings are removed when gardening or doing work which could cause them to get knocked or scratched. If you have any queries regarding this a member of our staff will gladly be able to offer advice.\nTheir are four main factors that determine quality and value. These are known as the four C's, which stand for colour, clarity, cut and carat.\nThe 4 C's - A Guide to Buying Diamond Jewellery\nColour\nWhile many diamonds appear colourless or white, they may actually have subtle yellow or brown tones that can be detected when comparing diamonds side by side. Colourless diamonds are the rarest and most valuable of all.\nClarity\nClarity is an indication of a diamond's purity, determined by naturally occuring internal characteristics called inclusions.\u00a0 These characteristics are sometimes not visible to the naked eye and they are what make each diamond unique.\nCut\nTo transform the diamond into a beautiful gem, it is cut with precise facets. Well cut diamonds have amazing brilliance and fire. This is caused by light reflecting off the diamond's surfaces. The key to desirable fire and brilliance is proportion. Light striking a shallow cut diamond or a diamond cut too deep is lost through the sides or bottom and is not reflected back to the top. Of all the cuts, the perfectly sparkling round brilliant cut is the most popular diamond shape, but there are many others to choose from, including the classic emerald cut, with its clean lines and sophisticated shape, or the elegant ovals or cushion cuts.\nCarat\nDiamonds are measured in terms of weight, not size. One carat is equal to 100 points. Two diamonds of equal weight can have different values, because the quality is still determined by the colour, clarity and cut.\nOur Diamonds\nGenerally all our diamonds are F-G colour and no less than VS in clarity. We are happy to source diamonds on request for a particular quality and budget or to match an existing piece of jewellery.\nWe also offer certified diamonds. These are stones which are independently assessed by recognised gem laboratories in Europe and America. We are able to supply high quality stones from 0.25 carats upwards.\nYou can be assured that our diamonds come from recognised, reputable sources in line with the Kimberley Process which certifies the source of uncut diamonds from their country of origin.\nWe have a diamond information booklet by the Diamonds Trading Council giving information about the qualities of diamonds. Please email us to request one and we will gladly send you a copy.\nBuying a Bespoke Engagement Ring\nWe offer a bespoke design service for engagement rings. If you are interested in this service, we would arrange a consultation at our shop in Richmond\u00a0to discuss ideas and styles. Sketches can then be drawn up and the perfect, bespoke ring created!\nWe also offer to tailor-make wedding bands to compliment engagement rings (the engagement ring does not need to be a Horton purchase for this service). The bands can then be produced to fit around prominent stones or the antique settings of a family heirloom.\nCare of Diamonds\nWhile diamonds are extremely hard, they can still suffer chips and fractures from sharp blows to the stone. Naturally, you should always try to protect your jewellery from sharp blows. Diamonds are also extremely scratch-resistant, however it is possible to scratch a diamond with another diamond, so care must always be taken to ensure that stones do not knock each other when worn or stored together.\nTo keep your diamond jewellery looking sparkling and brilliant, we advise regular cleaning. We offer a complimentary cleaning service to all our customers. Should you wish to clean your jewellery at home we always recommend to our customers that they use only a soft bristled toothbrush and warm water with washing up liquid, then rinse and gently dry the jewellery with a soft cloth.\nPearls\nWe offer a wide range of fine quality pearls to suit every taste. Our cultured freshwater pearls from China come in different shapes, among them the traditional round ones or the very fashionable baroque pearl. Colours range from\u00a0 the natural such as creamy whites and pearls with pink or apricot hues, through to the stained version like the popular silver, dark grey and black pearls.\nOur range of South Sea pearls from the North Coast of Australia are a very fine quality of pearl, round in shape, always above 10mm with a silver white lustre.

We are happy to source any size or colour pearl, you can then choose the length of a necklace or how you would like the pearls set and we will make a piece of unique pearl jewellery for you!\nTahitian and South Sea Pearls\nCultivation\nThe rarest, most revered and finest pearls are those from Tahiti and the South Seas. In pristine waters around the north coast of Australia where the temperature is gentle and the atmosphere nurturing, the South Sea pearl spends two years within the host oyster. A pearl is born when a foreign particle makes its way into a host oyster. As a defence mechanism against the intruder, the oyster begins to secrete a crystal-like substance called nacre, comprising of organic and inorganic materials from within the living tissue of the oyster. After many layers, and over two to three years, the once small particle transforms into a beautiful glowing pearl. In cultured pearls this process is speeded up by the insertion of a round nucleus which the nacre grows on.\nLustre\nAs in all things, true beauty comes from within, so the one virtue rated above all others in a South Sea pearl is its lustre. Lustre is the result of light reflected from the pearl's surface combined with its deep inner glow (iridescence). The quality and thickness of the nacre gives the pearl both its radiance and deep glow. The combination of light reflecting on the pearl's surface and light refracting between each layer of nacre within the pearl is\u00a0what makes each pearl unique. Lustre has the magic to minimise other perfections and is considered the soul of the pearl.\nColour\nThe species of oyster and the environment in which they grow are the main factors determining a pearl's colour and complexion. South Sea pearls are highly coveted for their rich varied colours. Top quality South Sea pearls are cultured in a different oyster to the traditional Japanese cultured pearl. Pearls from the Pinctada maxima oyster come in shades of white, ivory, silver, blue, yellow and gold.\nPearls from the Pinctada margaritifera oyster (referred to as Tahitian or black pearls) grow in a large oyster similar to that of South Sea pearls, the difference being that these oysters have a shell with a 'black lip' which results in the cultured pearls being formed naturally black, the colour ranging from a silver/pewter colour, through blue, green aubergine to jet black.\nShape and Size\nSouth Sea Pearls come in a variety of shapes and as a product of nature, each pearl is individual and unique. The major categories of South Sea pearls are round, near round, drop, button, baroque and circle. South Sea pearls are renowned for their large sizes and the Pinctada maxima oyster is the largest species of oyster capable of producing a pearl. South Sea pearls are generally more than 9mm in size and tend to average around 12mm to 14mm.\nFreshwater Cultured Pearls\nIn the past few years there have been huge developments in the production of freshwater cultured pearls. What used to be known as 'rice' pearls have now developed through production methods into much larger pearls of even sizes, rivalling the traditional Japanese cultured pearl.\nFreshwater pearls are available in a huge variety of colours, the pinks, pale purples and apricots are usually natural colours; other popular colours, grey and black are dyed. Other shades available include pale blue, green, yellow/gold, copper and red. All in an amazing variery of traditional and original shapes.\nWhen not being worn, pearls are best kept in a chamois, silk or cotton bag. Store pieces seperately so they don't get scratched by other pearls or other items of jewellery. Annual strand restringing is recommended for longetivity for pearls worn regularly.\nShop by\n"}, {"score": 1192.9254, "uuid": "5dd00497-d2d1-5dbc-a5f6-8ba6fbda70b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1017wb-37-03872", "target_hostname": "www.hortonlondon.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.hortonlondon.co.uk/buyers-guide", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Buyers Guide - Diamonds, <em>Platinum</em>, <em>Gold</em>, Pearls", "snippet": "<em>Platinum</em> <em>is</em> generally 95% pure, so <em>platinum</em> jewellery will not fade or tarnish and <em>is</em> kind <em>to</em> the skin.

Platinum is generally 95% pure, so platinum jewellery will not fade or tarnish and is kind to the skin. (It is very rare to have an allergic reaction to platinum). Platinum's unequaled durability, density and resistance to\u00a0wear makes it the most secure, protective metal for settings, which means your jewellery will be protected for a lifetime of wear. As platinum is naturally silvery white in appearance, it does not require rhodium plating like white gold. Platinum is purer and rarer than white gold and it retains its whiteness better than white gold. Platinum does not wear away and holds precious stones securely.\nAs it is an extremely hard metai it is an ideal setting for diamonds and gemstones. This does not stop it from scratching when worn as a ring, which will occur with normal wear and tear and like gold, it will eventually acquire its own surface patina.\nThe hardness of platinum whilst being an attribute makes it very difficult to work with from the jewellers perspective, and many more hours go into making and finishing a platinum piece of jewellery than one in any other precious metal.\nHorton stock a wide range of platinum jewellery including engagement and wedding rings and are\u00a0accredited by the International Platinum Guild as a Platinum Recommended Retailer.\nStoring and Cleaning Your Platinum\nStore pieces seperately, in a jewellery box or chamois bag so they don't get scratched by other items of jewellery. Clean your platinum jewellery periodically. This will help ensure its fine appearance and will help it last. We offer a complimentary cleaning service to all our customers and should you wish to have your platinum jewellery polished we can arrange for this to be carried out by our workshop for a small charge. Should you wish to clean your jewellery at home we always recommend to our customers that they use only a soft bristled toothbrush and warm water with washing up liquid, then rinse and gently dry with a soft cloth.\n18ct White Gold\n18ct White Gold has a slight natural yellow tint. It is normal practice to finish white gold items with\u00a0a rhodium plating which renders the piece 'silver' white. Items such as earrings, pendants, bracelets and necklaces do not suffer the wear and tear that rings do and as a consequence rings in white gold will show signs of the underlying yellow tint after a period of wear. This can easily be rectified with a re-polish and new rhodium plating.\nRings with large plain surfaces are more prone to this than others with a detailed surface. We always recommend that rings are removed when gardening or doing work which could cause them to get knocked or scratched.

As The Wall Street Journal reports, protracted strike action at Impala Platinum Holdings\u2019 Rustenburg mine has spooked the commodity market, with the most actively-traded Comex platinum contract for April delivery gaining $35.90 (2.1%) yesterday, settling at $1,720.80 per troy ounce.\nThis mine is Impala\u2019s second largest platinum deposit; the company accounts for 25% of total world platinum output and estimates that it\u2019s already lost 80,000 ounces of production as a result of the strikes, with 20,000 being lost per week. If these labour disputes continue, platinum will continue closing the gap in terms of its price difference with gold. We could soon see it once again becoming more expensive than the yellow metal. If industrial unrest spreads across the country, gold and palladium prices could also be pushed higher, given South Africa\u2019s status as the second-largest producer in the world of both of these metals.\nImproving global economic sentiment is also helping platinum to outperform gold. In America, headline data continues to show improvements, while in Europe \u2013 though Greece\u2019s problems are nowhere close to being solved \u2013 the can has at least been given another good kick down the road. Thus, in the short-term at least traders are partying like it\u2019s 1999, and trying hard to forget about Portugal, a slowdown in China, Iran, or any of the other potential party-poopers out there.\nWhat applies to platinum and palladium of course applies with equal vigour to silver, which also tends to benefit as sentiment improves and inflation expectations rise. News that Indian silver imports may hit 5,000 tonnes this year as a result of increasing investment demand is another bullish indicator. Last year India imported 4,800 tonnes of silver, with people looking to buy silver as an inflation hedge. However, the latter part of the year \u2013 traditionally a strong period in terms of Indian demand for precious-metal jewellery \u2013 saw unexpectedly weak demand, on account of weakness in the rupee and growing pessimism about the economy.\nYesterday also saw a new record gold price in terms of the British pound, in response to news that the Bank of England may be contemplating even more money printing. Sterling fell by 1.52 cents against the dollar and by 1.02 cents against the euro, resulting in a new record high sterling price for Brent crude oil of \u00a377.77. Yet another indicator that those expecting a substantial fall in UK inflation are destined to be disappointed.\nAuthors: ForexPros\n"}, {"score": 1180.1638, "uuid": "09690272-6961-532c-bc4f-472bafcf4439", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-05-11055", "target_hostname": "www.usrarecoininvestments.com", "target_uri": "http://www.usrarecoininvestments.com/coin_articles/what_is_gold.htm", "page_rank": 1.1714723e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "What <em>is</em> <em>gold</em>? <em>Gold</em>", "snippet": "These are then refined <em>to</em> <em>gold</em> bars by the Miller chlorination process <em>to</em> a purity of 99.5%.

It is a highly sought-after precious metal which, for many centuries, has been used as money, a store of value and in jewelry. The metal occurs as nuggets or grains in rocks, underground \u0093veins\u0094 and in alluvial deposits. It is one of the coinage metals. Gold is dense, soft, shiny and the most malleable and ductile of the known metals. Pure gold has a bright yellow color traditionally considered attractive.\nGold forms the basis for a monetary standard used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The ISO currency code of gold bullion is XAU. Modern industrial uses include dentistry and electronics, where gold has traditionally found use because of its good resistance to oxidative corrosion.\nChemically, gold is a trivalent and univalent transition metal. Gold does not react with most chemicals, but is attacked by chlorine, fluorine, aqua regia and cyanide. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, but does not react with it. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which will dissolve silver and base metals, and this is the basis of the gold refining technique known as \u0093inquartation and parting\u0094. Nitric acid has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items, and this is the origin of the colloquial term \u0093acid test,\u0094 referring to a gold standard test for genuine value.\nWhere does the word gold come from?\nThe word gold appears to be derived from the Indo-European root \u0091yellow\u0092, reflecting one of the most obvious properties of gold. This is reflected in the similarities of the word gold in various languages: Gold (English), Gold(German), Guld (Danish), Gulden (Dutch), Goud (Afrikaans), Gull (Norwegian) and Kulta (Finnish).\nHow much gold is there in the world?\nThe World Gold Council estimates that at the end of 2001, it is estimated that all the gold ever mined amounted to about 145,000 tonnes.\nWho owns most gold?\nIf we take national gold reserves, then most gold is owned by the USA followed by Germany and the IMF. If we include jewellery ownership, then India is the largest repository of gold in terms of total gold within the national boundaries. In terms of personal ownership, it is not known who owns the most, but is possibly a member of a ruling royal family in the East.\nIf gold is laid around the world, how far would it stretch?\nIf we make all the gold ever produced into a thin wire of 5 microns (millionths of a metre) diameter - the finest one can draw a gold wire, then all the gold would stretch around the circumference of the world an astounding 7.2 million times approximately!\nWhy is gold measured in carats?\nThis stems back to ancient times in the Mediterranean /Middle East, when a carat became used as a measure of the purity of gold alloys (see next Question 5). The purity of gold is now measured also in terms if fineness, i.e parts per thousand. Thus 18 carats is 18/24th of 1000 parts = 750 fineness.\nWhat is Carat?\nA Carat (Karat in USA & Germany) was originally a unit of mass (weight) based on the Carob seed or bean used by ancient merchants in the Middle East. The Carob seed is from the Carob or locust bean tree. The carat is still used as such for the weight of gem stones (1 carat is about 200 mg). For gold, it has come to be used for measuring the purity of gold where pure gold is defined as 24 carats.\nHow does a gold mine work?\nThe gold-containing ore has to be dug from the surface or blasted from the rock face underground. This is then hauled to the surface and milled to release the gold. The gold is then separated from the rock (gangue) by techniques such as flotation, smelted to a gold-rich dor\u00e9 and cast into bars. These are then refined to gold bars by the Miller chlorination process to a purity of 99.5%. If higher purity is needed or platinum group metal contaminants are present, this gold is further refined by the Wohlwill electrlytic process to 99.9% purity.\nWhat happens to gold after it is mined?\nThe ore is normally sent to a refinery, which will extract and melt down the gold into a pure 24ct form, normally as bars or ingots.\nHow big is a tonne of gold?\nGold is traditionally weighed in Troy Ounces (31.1035 grammes). With the density of gold at 19.32 g/cm3, a troy ounce of gold would have a volume of 1.61 cm3. A metric tonne (equals 1,000kg = 32,150.72 troy ounces) of gold would therefore have a volume of 51,762 cm3 (i.e. 1.61 x 32,150.72), which would be equivalent to a cube of side 37.27cm (Approx. 1' 3\u0094).\nWhat percentage of gold is used in jewellery, industry and investment?\nAround 70% of gold demand is jewellery, 11% is industrial (dental, electronics) and 13% is investment (institutional and individual, bars & coins). Gold jewellery has strong \u0093investment\u0094 attributes in all countries, and in markets such as India and Middle East is sold by weight at the prevailing daily rate with a supplementary \u0093making charge\u0094 which varies according to the complexity of the piece.\nCoinlink\n"}, {"score": 1152.0292, "uuid": "f5e84b09-da3a-5004-92cb-d5e1c5c211df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-37-20152", "target_hostname": "www.designyourweddingrings.com", "target_uri": "http://www.designyourweddingrings.com/faq.cfm.html", "page_rank": 2.1932176e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Custom Design Wedding Rings <em>Platinum</em> and <em>Gold</em>", "snippet": "In the US, karat refers <em>to</em> the fineness of <em>gold</em> alloys (pure <em>gold</em> <em>is</em> 24 karat; 14 karat <em>is</em> 14 parts <em>gold</em> and 10 parts other metals) and carat refers <em>to</em> gem weights.", "explanation": null, "document": "0 items, $0.00\nHow will my ring order be shipped and when can I expect it to arrive?\nAll orders require 7-14 business days to manufacture.

What is the difference between Karat and Carat? Two terms, carat and karat are often confused. In the US, karat refers to the fineness of gold alloys (pure gold is 24 karat; 14 karat is 14 parts gold and 10 parts other metals) and carat refers to gem weights.\nWhat if my new wedding ring does not fit?\nIf your new wedding ring arrives and initially seems to be a little too large or too small, we suggest you wear it for a few days to get used to it before exchanging it for a different size. Different activities and temperatures throughout the day cause our hands and fingers to constantly change, so it's normal to have a ring feel tight sometimes and loose other times, often in the same day!

LEED is a highly sought-after building energy efficiency and sustainability standard among corporations, notably Proctor & Gamble . It is also esteemed by some U.S. sports teams .\nLEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a building standard created and enforced by the U.S. Green Building Council, or USGBC , a nonprofit vested in sustainable building and environmentally friendly land and energy use.\nThe design principles used by the certification measure site sustainability and feasibility, water use, energy use, sustainable materials use, indoor air quality, and innovation in design, and encourage both awareness of and education regarding \u201cgreen\u201d building initiatives.\nThe 2012 directive is, according to many, the result of a dispute in 2010 between LEED advocates and opponents, the latter arguing that the LEED system favors using steel and concrete over wood, and does not even credit the sustainable use of domestic woods certified by the Forest Stewardship Council in framing and construction, but only in furniture.\nIn fact, the NDAA goes well beyond putting LEED in the backseat. It demands that the DOD prove the cost benefits of all its standards for determining energy efficiency either in new buildings or in retrofits, and may eventually result in the scrapping of at least two (LEED and ASHRAE 2010) and possibly three standards in favor of a hybrid standard which would replace the USGBC\u2019s system.\nCongress is not the first entity to call into question the cost-effectiveness of LEED standards, which add (sometimes considerably) to the final amount for new buildings and building retrofits.\nThis can happen either through misunderstanding or miscommunication about standards and implementation, leading to expensive construction delays or repairs, or through sourcing of sometimes inordinately expensive building materials needed to meet said standards. Not to mention the cost of LEED-savvy architects, engineers, construction superintendents, consultants, and certification experts.\nA classic example would be the ImaginOn building in Charlotte, North Carolina, the city\u2019s first \u201cgreen\u201d building, which ended up using twice as much energy as envisioned based on the building standards applied.\nBut the most notable incident is undoubtedly Henry Gifford\u2019s lawsuit against USGBC, which charged the rating system was a form of false advertising since it did not reliably increase energy efficiency . The lawsuit was dismissed, but highlights an underlying problem; there may be too many systems by which to measure building energy efficiency and sustainability.\nThus, in spite of Senator Henry Wicker\u2019s (R-Miss.) push to include domestic lumber in energy efficiency certification ratings \u2013 which may account in part for the new Congressional guidelines \u2013 it\u00a0may in fact turn out that carbon-sequestering concrete\u00a0and steel are actually more efficient in that respect.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Navy, arguing that the NDAA does not prohibit its using LEED standards to meet simple Certification, has said it will continue using USGBC guidelines and seeking certification. The additional comment, that certification at the Gold or Platinum level does not cost more, may be questionable.\nTags: American National Standards Institute (ANSI) , American Society of Heating , Certified , certified wood , Department of Defense (DOD) , energy efficiency , Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) , Gold , H.R. 1540 , Henry Gifford , ImaginOn Building , Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) , National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) , Platinum , Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) , Silver , sustainable building , U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) , U.S. Navy , American Society , building energy efficiency , building materials , Congress , Department of Defense , energy , Henry Gifford , Henry Wicker , Mississippi , North Carolina , steel , U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , United States Navy\nJeanne Roberts is a freelance writer on environment and sustainability issues.

This makes it the most precious of all precious metals - about 30 times rarer than gold. Annual platinum production is roughly 175 tons, equal to 6% of the annual production of gold. In fact, platinum is so rare that if all the platinum in the world were poured into one Olympic-size swimming pool, it would scarcely be deep enough to cover your ankles. It is so rare that the US government considers it a 'strategic metal' and banned its ownership and use in World War II for non-military purposes. At the same time, unlike gold, platinum has major industrial uses, most notably in automobile catalytic converters.\nDemand\nPlatinum is by far the best metallic catalyst. Since the 1980s, this \"noble metal\" has been used in catalytic converters, which oxidize toxic carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, and toxic hydrocarbon fractions to carbon dioxide and water. Its usage, therefore, is closely tied to automobile demand.\nNeedless to say, the principal market for automobile catalysts today is China, whose automobile market last year leapfrogged its U.S. counterpart to become the largest in the world, and where sales in August were running about 18% ahead of its 2009 totals. Although Chinese automobiles use less fuel than the larger U.S. cars, they use just as much catalyst. In the last year or so, Chinese manufacturers have tended to use palladium catalysts, while Europe uses platinum. But rising global auto demand and the two metals' recent convergence in price has made platinum relatively more attractive.\nInvestment outlook\nTaking all of this into account, investment in this metal looks extremely bright, as we move into the future.\u00a0 The platinum market is much smaller than either gold or silver, and platinum price moves tend to outpace those of its counterparts.\u00a0 The last great precious metals bull market of 1979-1980 saw platinum soar to $1,085 per ounce while gold peaked at $875 per ounce.\u00a0 With strong demand for platinum and the ever-present threat of a supply disruption, the fundamentals are extremely supportive of higher prices.\u00a0 We recommend taking a position in platinum, along with our other metals to maximize the return of your precious metals portfolio.\n"}, {"score": 1121.0956, "uuid": "76d77faa-f0d5-50c0-bbde-2e37da6ea654", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-19-25416", "target_hostname": "www.corrosionsource.com", "target_uri": "http://www.corrosionsource.com/(S(qfqmyonqlmlycm55yphx4say))/PeriodicTable/Platinum", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Platinum</em>", "snippet": "The price of <em>platinum</em> has varied widely.

The metal was used by pre-Columbian Indians.\nSources\nPlatinum occurs native, accompanied by small quantities of iridium, osmium, palladium ruthenium, and rhodium, all belonging to the same group of metals. These are found in the alluvial deposits of the Ural mountains, of Columbia, and of certain western American states. Sperrylite, occurring with the nickel-bearing deposits of Sudbury, Ontario, is the source of a considerable amount of metal.\nThe large production of nickel makes up for the fact that is only one part of the platinum metals in two million parts of ore.\nProperties\nPlatinum is a beautiful silvery-white metal, when pure, and is malleable and ductile.\nIt has a coefficient of expansion almost equal to that of soda-lime-silica glass, and is therefore used to make sealed electrodes in glass systems.\nThe metal does not oxidize in air at any temperature, but is corroded by halogens, cyanides, sulfur, and caustic alkalis.\nIt is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid, but dissolves when they are mixed as aqua regia, forming chloroplatinic acid.\nUses\nThe metal is extensively used in jewelry, wire, and vessels for laboratory use, and in many valuable instruments including therocouple elements.\nIt is also used for electrical contacts, corrosion-resistant apparatus, and in dentistry.\nPlatinum-cobalt alloys have magnetic properties.\nOne such alloy made of 76.7% Pt and 23.3% Co, by weight, is an extremely powerful magnet that offers a B-H (max) almost twice that of Alnico V.\nPlatinum resistance wires are used for constructing high-temperature electric furnaces.\nThe metal is used for coating missile nose cones, jet engine fuel nozzles, etc., which must perform reliably at high temperatures for long periods of time.\nThe metal, like palladium, absorbs large volumes, of hydrogen, retaining it at ordinary temperatures but giving it up when heated.\nIn the finely divided state platinum is an excellent catalyst, having long been used in the contact process for producing sulfuric acid.\nIt is also used as a catalyst in cracking petroleum products.\nMuch interest exists in using platinum as a catalyst in fuel cells and in antipollution devices for automobiles.\nPlatinum anodes are extensively used in cathodic protection systems for large ships and ocean-going vessels, pipelines, steel piers, etc.\nFine platinum wire will glow red hot when placed in the vapor of methyl alcohol.\nIt acts here as a catalyst, converting the alcohol to formaldehyde.\nThe phenomenon has been used commercially to produce cigarette lighters and hand warmers.\nHydrogen and oxygen explode in the presence of platinum.\nCosts\nThe price of platinum has varied widely.

Many gold mines also release cyanide and mercury into nearby water sources and are associated with poor safety standards, inhumane labor practices , and disregard for the rights and interests of indigenous peoples .\nBy using recycled metals, we decrease the global demand for newly mined gold and diminish the environmentally and socially destructive effects of dirty gold and other metal mining practices. Because precious metals can be recycled repeatedly with no degradation in quality, they are a naturally renewable resource.\nBrilliant Earth's reclaimed metals come from numerous post-consumer sources, including existing jewelry, industrial-use metals, and electronics components. Every piece we cast is made with 100% recycled and re-refined precious metals. Because our reclaimed gold, silver, and platinum are re-refined back into their pure elements, they are of identical quality to newly mined metals. Whenever possible, we select findings (pre-fabricated sub-components found in certain pieces of jewelry) made of 100% recycled metals or we cast findings ourselves with recycled precious metals.\nBrilliant Earth also encourages our customers to recycle their own gold and platinum jewelry that they no longer wear. We will gladly accept and recycle any gold or platinum jewelry, and will offer a credit towards any Brilliant Earth purchase of equal or greater value based on current metal prices. Please contact us for more information.\nBrilliant Earth is also offering a limited edition gold pendant made from one of the first sources of independently certified fair trade gold . For this pendant, we have partnered with Oro Verde, which specializes in gold responsibly harvested from cooperatives in the Choc\u00f3\u00a0region in Colombia, South America. In addition to paying a fair wage, the fair trade gold cooperatives ensure the use of environmentally responsible practices. The cooperatives do not use harmful chemicals, they restore ecosystems damaged by other mining companies, and they work to promote the well-being of local communities.\nResponsible Jewelry Production\nRecycled metals are an important component of Brilliant Earth's commitment to the environment, but we also practice environmental responsibility throughout the jewelry production process. For example, we employ a vapor emissions cleaning system and a rigorous process of cleaning liquid emissions to prevent contaminants from being released into the environment.\nAdditionally, we are committed to responsible labor practices. Many jewelers outsource their production to countries where labor and environmental standards are weak or poorly enforced. While this may reduce cost, it often comes at the expense of product quality as well as worker health and safety. All Brilliant Earth jewelry is crafted in the United States with the strictest labor and safety practices.\nAbout Our Eco-friendly Jewelry\nBrilliant Earth's recycled gold, silver, and platinum are re-refined back into pure elements before being remixed into alloys and cast into our own unique pieces.\nA pure metal that has been combined with another metal for structural or aesthetic purposes is called an \u201calloy.\u201d 18K and 14K gold are alloys of pure 24K gold and other metals, such as silver, copper or nickel. Alloyed gold is stronger and less susceptible to scratching or denting than pure gold. 24K gold would make a poor setting for a precious engagement diamond, for example, since it is relatively soft and flexible.\nAll Brilliant Earth recycled yellow and white gold jewelry is made from 18K gold, which is composed of 75% pure gold and 25% other metals. Standard white gold typically contains nickel, to which some people have allergies. Upon request, Brilliant Earth offers a hypoallergenic white gold alloy for a small price premium. Rather than nickel, our hypoallergenic 18K white gold contains palladium, a naturally white member of the platinum family of metals.\nWhenever possible, Brilliant Earth uses 14K gold die-struck heads for setting center gemstones in our 18K gold rings. The added toughness that is achieved by alloying gold to 14K is ideal for setting precious gemstones safely and securely. Upon request, Brilliant Earth offers a platinum head for 18K gold settings for a small price premium.\nBrilliant Earth's recycled platinum is naturally hypoallergenic. Our platinum alloy has been carefully selected to balance hardness and durability with workability for repair and maintenance. All platinum rings are set with platinum heads and prongs.\nRhodium Plating\nFor a beautiful pure-white finish, it is general industry practice to plate white gold with rhodium. While white gold combines yellow gold with other metals to make it appear white, it still tends to retain a slight yellow cast before rhodium plating. Rhodium is a member of the platinum family of metals and has a bright-white appearance that gives Brilliant Earth's recycled white gold jewelry a beautiful white shine. Rhodium plating does wear off over time through contact with other surfaces and the effects of the body's natural oils and therefore does require some easy maintenance. White gold pieces that have lost their outer coating may be re-plated with rhodium for a nominal fee to restore the original bright-white luster.\nAlternative Precious Metals\nUpon request, Brilliant Earth eco-friendly jewelry is also available in alternative metals such as 14K yellow, 14K white gold, 14K rose gold, and 950 palladium. Rose gold is a beautiful choice, composed of yellow gold with the addition of copper for a rose-pink tone. It is only available in 14K to ensure its strength and prevent brittleness. Another precious metal option is 950 palladium. 950 palladium contains 95% pure palladium, which is a member of the platinum family of metals. It has platinum's pure-white color and is less expensive, though somewhat softer and less durable than platinum.\nBrilliant Earth uses recycled gold to reduce destructive practices associated with gold mining.\n"}, {"score": 1117.5756, "uuid": "81faf8f0-a81a-51c0-a6ae-e20d9901e076", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0713wb-65-11864", "target_hostname": "www.usrarecoininvestments.com", "target_uri": "http://www.usrarecoininvestments.com/coin_info/what_is_gold.htm", "page_rank": 1.1752108e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "What <em>is</em> <em>gold</em> - <em>Gold</em> Coins", "snippet": "These are then refined <em>to</em> <em>gold</em> bars by the Miller chlorination process <em>to</em> a purity of 99.5%.

It is a highly sought-after precious metal which, for many centuries, has been used as money, a store of value and in jewelry. The metal occurs as nuggets or grains in rocks, underground \u201cveins\u201d and in alluvial deposits. It is one of the coinage metals. Gold is dense, soft, shiny and the most malleable and ductile of the known metals. Pure gold has a bright yellow color traditionally considered attractive.\nGold forms the basis for a monetary standard used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The ISO currency code of gold bullion is XAU. Modern industrial uses include dentistry and electronics, where gold has traditionally found use because of its good resistance to oxidative corrosion.\nChemically, gold is a trivalent and univalent transition metal. Gold does not react with most chemicals, but is attacked by chlorine, fluorine, aqua regia and cyanide. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, but does not react with it. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which will dissolve silver and base metals, and this is the basis of the gold refining technique known as \u201cinquartation and parting\u201d. Nitric acid has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items, and this is the origin of the colloquial term \u201cacid test,\u201d referring to a gold standard test for genuine value.\nWhere does the word gold come from?\nThe word gold appears to be derived from the Indo-European root \u2018yellow\u2019, reflecting one of the most obvious properties of gold. This is reflected in the similarities of the word gold in various languages: Gold (English), Gold(German), Guld (Danish), Gulden (Dutch), Goud (Afrikaans), Gull (Norwegian) and Kulta (Finnish).\nHow much gold is there in the world?\nThe World Gold Council estimates that at the end of 2001, it is estimated that all the gold ever mined amounted to about 145,000 tonnes.\nWho owns most gold?\nIf we take national gold reserves, then most gold is owned by the USA followed by Germany and the IMF. If we include jewellery ownership, then India is the largest repository of gold in terms of total gold within the national boundaries. In terms of personal ownership, it is not known who owns the most, but is possibly a member of a ruling royal family in the East.\nIf gold is laid around the world, how far would it stretch?\nIf we make all the gold ever produced into a thin wire of 5 microns (millionths of a metre) diameter - the finest one can draw a gold wire, then all the gold would stretch around the circumference of the world an astounding 7.2 million times approximately!\nWhy is gold measured in carats?\nThis stems back to ancient times in the Mediterranean /Middle East, when a carat became used as a measure of the purity of gold alloys (see next Question 5). The purity of gold is now measured also in terms if fineness, i.e parts per thousand. Thus 18 carats is 18/24th of 1000 parts = 750 fineness.\nWhat is Carat?\nA Carat (Karat in USA & Germany) was originally a unit of mass (weight) based on the Carob seed or bean used by ancient merchants in the Middle East. The Carob seed is from the Carob or locust bean tree. The carat is still used as such for the weight of gem stones (1 carat is about 200 mg). For gold, it has come to be used for measuring the purity of gold where pure gold is defined as 24 carats.\nHow does a gold mine work?\nThe gold-containing ore has to be dug from the surface or blasted from the rock face underground. This is then hauled to the surface and milled to release the gold. The gold is then separated from the rock (gangue) by techniques such as flotation, smelted to a gold-rich dor\u00e9 and cast into bars. These are then refined to gold bars by the Miller chlorination process to a purity of 99.5%. If higher purity is needed or platinum group metal contaminants are present, this gold is further refined by the Wohlwill electrlytic process to 99.9% purity.\nWhat happens to gold after it is mined?\nThe ore is normally sent to a refinery, which will extract and melt down the gold into a pure 24ct form, normally as bars or ingots.\nHow big is a tonne of gold?\nGold is traditionally weighed in Troy Ounces (31.1035 grammes). With the density of gold at 19.32 g/cm3, a troy ounce of gold would have a volume of 1.61 cm3. A metric tonne (equals 1,000kg = 32,150.72 troy ounces) of gold would therefore have a volume of 51,762 cm3 (i.e. 1.61 x 32,150.72), which would be equivalent to a cube of side 37.27cm (Approx. 1' 3\u201d).\nWhat percentage of gold is used in jewellery, industry and investment?\nAround 70% of gold demand is jewellery, 11% is industrial (dental, electronics) and 13% is investment (institutional and individual, bars & coins). Gold jewellery has strong \u201cinvestment\u201d attributes in all countries, and in markets such as India and Middle East is sold by weight at the prevailing daily rate with a supplementary \u201cmaking charge\u201d which varies according to the complexity of the piece.\nWhat is gold - Gold Coins\n\u00a9 2003 - 2011 U.S. Rare Coin Investments\nHave a question?

Why different alloys? Can my customers tell the difference? Should I stock one over another? Does my bench jeweler care? Here are some answers.\nQ: Why have different platinum alloys?\nA: The manufacturer/designer selected a particular alloy based on the method of manufacture the piece required. If it was fabricated, perhaps it was a 90% platinum/10% iridium mix. If it was cast recently, it may be a 95% platinum/5% cobalt mix.\nQ: Can my customers tell the difference in alloys?\nA: No. They will just notice how beautiful the white metal is and how wonderful it feels. Q: Should I stock one platinum alloy over another? A: Don't use alloy composition as a criteria to stock platinum jewelry. Concentrate on what's salable in the 95% and 90% range and don't worry about the rest.\nQ: Does my bench jeweler care?\nA: Only if the alloy is cobalt. The 95% or 90% alloys technically are the same. Working with the cobalt mix requires additional knowledge. [Fax PGI on your company letterhead at (714) 760-8780 for details.]\nQ: How do I know the difference?\nA: The accompanying chart offers a quick overview of platinum alloys and markings. Some of the marks are new and some are old, but you should know what they mean and what alloys they represent in case you see them on jewelry a customer brings to you. Post the chart in your store and make sure all of your sales associates understand the differences.\nGuide to Platinum Quality Marking\nThe platinum standard is different from other metals. Gold purity is a familiar subject: 24 karat gold equals 99.99% pure gold, 18 karat is 75% pure and 14 karat is 58.5% pure. In the platinum world, 1,000 parts of platinum equal 100%.

There was a time when the stock market was open to everyone, when the individual had the same access to information and the same opportunity to participate in initial public offerings (IPO) as the biggest traders. But government regulation has seen to it that the IPO market, where the real money is made, is now the exclusive province of Wall Street\u2019s elite.\nIn the Wall Street Journal, Europe, L. Gordon Crovitz states that \u201cFacebook should be a wake- up call about how regulations have undermined public markets.\u201d Rather than give individual investors a chance at their IPO, Facebook sold the entire $500 million offering to Goldman Sachs as private equity. And their reason is clear.\nPublic uproar over debacles the likes of Enron and WorldCom led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, a massively complex set of regulations whose stated aim was corporate and auditing reform in the name of investor protection. What it did, however, was make the IPO undesirable as a means of raising capital for new ventures. Private equity, which is free from Sarbanes-Oxley regulation, is a far more favorable option.\nPrivate equity offerings not only shut out individual investors, they also close off the free flow of information required by public exchange, opening the door to misinformation and creating an ideal climate for bubbles to form.\nCrovitz says that \u201cthe goal of securities regulation should simply be to ensure that accurate information gets to the market as quickly as possible . . .

Platinum shines with the whitest brilliance of any metal in the world. Even 18 karat gold can't compete with platinum's dazzling display. Platinum has had a long and illustrious history.\nIn ancient times, platinum was considered a perfect metal for armor and instruments of war, like swords and shields, because of its hardness. Unlike gold, it is highly inflexible. It maintains its shape through virtually any circumstance. It is for this reason, in addition to its whiter-than-white shine, that platinum is considered the ideal setting for diamond jewelry; not only does it complement a diamond's brilliance perfectly, but once set, that diamond is secure. Platinum does not \"stretch out\" like softer metals might.\nAt Heartsmith, we are deeply proud of our platinum collection. Each platinum locket offered on our site is made-to-order and made-by-hand. Created by master metalworkers, like Charles Green & Sons, these lockets are works of art, which are intended to be treasured generation after generation. We also offer a number of other items made from platinum, such as our Chantal Platinum and Diamond Cross from Charles Green.\nOur platinum lockets are available in styles which run from the sleekly contemporary, to those inspired by the Queens of England. Featuring delicately engraved patterns, single or grouped multi-point diamonds, these wearable works of art become instant family heirlooms.

The coin is stamped from the sheet by two dies coming together under great pressure. Each of these two dies is engraved with a mirror image of the reverse and obverse coin design, as the dies come together the carefully measured pressure applied to the stamps imprints the design to each side of the coin.\nAs the coins are produced they are check and verified using computer control optical technology to verify each coin meets the strict mint standards.\nThe coins are at this point regarded as uncirculated; they are fresh from the mint and free from any wear which can occur from everyday handling. Any marks or scuffs on the coins (sometimes called \u2018bag-scuffs\u2019) are a result of the manufacture and storage process only. Increasingly more commonly, high value coins such as Gold Sovereigns are now packaged into vacuum seal plastic pockets to protect them from any such wear. Proof coins can be distinguished from their standard production counterparts by their more defined edges, crisper profile and highly polished appearance.\nThe manufacture process is significantly more considered, dedicated dies are used to punch the coins, with each die striking the coin several times to ensure the perfect transfer of each contour. Raised features on each die are treated with an acidic coating to give a frosted matt finish on the raised coin features while flat background areas on the die are highly polished to give a clean mirror finish, this process of high contrast features gives the coin very striking appearance known as a cameo finish. Proof coins will undergo close manual inspection to ensure the highest standards for the finished product. Proof coins are regarded for their superior quality finish; generally fetch a higher premium, proof coins are often packaged in a tailored higher quality case to enhance their appeal (and justify the price premium).\nFor an investor, proof coins represent a vanity that cannot realistically be justified by their intrinsic value. Proof coins carry such high premiums over their mass production cousins that any movement in the precious metals price would need to be significant just to break even! Essentially, in years to come the coin will most probably be valued by its metal purity and weight \u2013 not the ornate carved wooden box it came in!\nDiscover more in our gold coin buyers guide.\n"}], [{"score": 1005.3431, "uuid": "cb3458bf-068d-5542-97d6-ae4ecaac07dd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1308wb-06-21892", "target_hostname": "www.angara.com", "target_uri": "http://www.angara.com/engagement-rings/wedding-bands.html", "page_rank": 1.8445631e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Wedding Bands - Diamond Wedding Band, <em>Platinum</em>, <em>Gold</em> Wedding Band | Angara.com", "snippet": "There are two tone matt finish bands, <em>platinum</em> bands, yellow <em>gold</em> wedding bands, white <em>gold</em> wedding bands and classic wedding bands and a host of others <em>to</em> choose from.

Learn More >>>\nPlatinum Futures\nPlatinum Futures contracts are firm commitments to make or accept delivery of a specified quantity and quality of a commodity during a specific month in the future at a price agreed upon at the time the commitment is made. Less than 3% of all metals futures contracts traded each year result in delivery of the underlying commodities. Instead, traders generally offset their futures positions before their contracts mature. The difference between the initial purchase or sale price and the price of the offsetting transaction represents the realized profit or loss.\nPlatinum Options\nBecause of the global nature of the metals markets, their prices can be volatile. The metals industry and other commercial market participants have learned to cope with this price uncertainty by actively hedging against adverse price movements.\nWhile platinum futures are among the primary risk management tools available, options on futures open a host of versatile, economical trading strategies.\nOptions on futures provide:\n\u00b7 A limit on potential loss to the buyer.\n\u00b7 The ability to hedge without foregoing the benefits of favorable price movements.\nNYMEX Division Platinum Futures and Options\nTrading Unit\nPlatinum Futures: 50 troy ounces.\nOptions: One NYMEX Division platinum futures contract.\nTrading Hours\nPlatinum Futures and Options: 8:20A.M.

You might be surprised.\nOctober 26, 2011 \u2013 Determining the fair gold price is critical to investors, yet it is a daunting task. In a recent post on King World News James Turk proposed a very intriguing solution, one which he calls the Gold Money Index (GMI).\nThe GMI \u201cvalues gold based on its historical role as international money,\u201d Turk says. Specifically, Turk defines the fair gold price as the total foreign exchange reserves held by central banks divided by the banks\u2019 total gold reserves.\nUnder the gold standard, growth of wealth alone determines the gold price. Currency is but a convenient way to keep tally. In a fiat system, however, the money supply is free to grow independent of the growth of wealth, and invariably it does so at an ever increasing pace.\nMarkets, however, can take imbalance for just so long. Wealth defined in fiat money is fleeting and illusory while wealth defined in gold has endured throughout history. The fair gold price is simply that at which the value of gold reserves is equal to the money supply.\nTurk calculates gold\u2019s relative valuation by dividing the actual price of gold by the fair price. In 1984, when the two were equal, gold\u2019s valuation was 100%. The all time low valuation, 10.3%, which occurred in 2008. At the end of Q2 2011 the gold price was still only 13% of the fair price.\nTo put that another way, the gold price should be more than 7 1/2 times higher than it is today to balance the money supply with actual wealth. Markets work on wealth, not money. Value is only what two parties agree it to be. The more that wealth is diluted by wanton printing of paper with no promise of exchange, the less that paper is worth.\nMarket forces have encountered the strongest opposition ever, but never doubt that the market will prevail. To say that the gold price should be well over $10,000 per ounce is simply to say that currencies are unsustainably overvalued.\nDebating how high the gold price should be, however, misses the point. Gold has been, and always will be, a standard measure of wealth. The important issue is not the undervaluation of gold, but the overvaluation of currency.\nOne thing is certain. Current gold prices are far, far below where the market wants to take them.\n"}, {"score": 976.72327, "uuid": "dce3630d-e0cd-5bc4-b349-86b54851a47f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1702wb-40-13083", "target_hostname": "www.nutraplanet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nutraplanet.com/product/optimum-nutrition/platinum-hydrowhey-1-75-lbs.html", "page_rank": 1.1867649e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Optimum Nutrition <em>Platinum</em> Hydrowhey (1.75 lbs): Discount <em>Platinum</em> Hydrowhey", "snippet": "In addition <em>to</em> being fast, <em>Platinum</em> Hydrowhey <em>is</em> also ultra-pure.

(PTM-TSX; PLG-NYSE AMEX) (\u0093Platinum Group\u0094 or the \u0093Company\u0094) will be active in platinum exploration on multiple projects in South Africa and Canada for the balance of 2011. Six exploration drilling programs targeting platinum are currently underway or are planned to commence shortly on four properties in South Africa and two properties in Canada.\nIn addition to its platinum mine construction currently underway at the WBJV Project 1, (74% owned, See News Release April 4, 2011) Platinum Group Metals will have exposure to global exploration budgets of approximately $5 million this year including 3 projects to be funded by joint venture partners in South Africa and an initial exploration budget in Canada of $2 million funded by Platinum Group.\nR. Michael Jones, President of Platinum Group Metals said, \u0093We see the balance of 2011 as a pivotal growth period for the company. In addition to building a 275,000 ounce per year Platinum mine we have a very active exploration profile. Exploration at the mine site is also ongoing. The diversification of our platinum exposure and exploration upside are distinguishing features of our company compared to the other North American listed platinum companies. No other North American listed platinum company has large scale mine exposure in South Africa, active exploration in South Africa and an active Canadian exploration program on multiple projects. Our management team has a track record of multiple mine discoveries in precious metals and it is exciting to be on the hunt again for more platinum.\u0094\nCanada\nThe Company has re-activated its Canadian exploration program, near Thunder Bay, Ontario and added 12 new properties covering at total of 532 square kilometers, bringing the company\u0092s holdings to 637 square kilometers. Platinum Group has acquired the majority of its new properties by staking over the past 4 months, utilizing in-house compilation and modeling of geophysics, geochemistry and work completed by the company in the area over the past 10 years.\nAll of the new properties are targeted on a new mineralization type where contained platinum is equal or greater than palladium. Platinum Group continues to hold a large land position targeted on the older intrusion rock type like that at North American Palladium\u0092s Lac des Iles Mine where palladium is the dominant platinum group metal, or \u0093PGM\u0094. Historically, North American deposits have been dominated by palladium rather than rarer and more valuable platinum. Some new exploration in the Thunder Bay area has demonstrated previously unexplored potential for platinum in pipe like intrusions or conduits. Platinum Group Metals plans to be a major participant in exploration for this new deposit type in this area.\nTwo 100% owned properties have advanced to an initial drill testing phase based on a recently completed airborne geophysics survey combined with ongoing geology and geochemistry compilation. In addition, Platinum Group has a 75% option from Benton Resources on the Bark Lake Project where surface samples have found platinum dominant mineralization in boulders. Platinum Group has added to this property area with 100% owned claims and is continuing with surface work to target future drilling in the region for late 2011.\nSouth Africa\nWBJV Project 1\nThe WBJV partners have approved and recently completed approximately $1 million of drilling in and around the mine area for detailed mine planning and the testing of areas that were not accessible prior to the purchase of all of the surface rights over the mine, (now complete). The WBJV P1 mine plan and feasibility study focuses on Merensky Reef for the first 16 years and the UG-2 platinum bearing reef is deferred until the end of the mine plan. The potential of shallow UG-2 outside the Merensky mining areas is being investigated. Assays are pending.\nSable Joint Venture\nThis large land position, acquired by Prospecting Permit Application by Platinum Group, adjoins the position of Xstrata at the Eland Platinum mine at the east end of the Western Limb of the Bushveld Complex. Geological mapping and soil sampling has been completed. Drilling has now advanced to the fourth hole and is continuing. Assays are pending.\nSable Platinum (a private South African company) can earn a 51% interest in the property and if completed Platinum Group would reduce to a 23% interest following 42 million Rand (US $6 million) of exploration expenditures.\nWaterberg Joint Venture \u0096 JOGMEC- JV\nDrilling of the first hole on the Waterberg Project in late 2010 has identified a new extension of the Bushveld Complex northward, under cover rocks, and this first intercept provides a vector for further drilling. The area was targeted for an exploration Prospecting Permit Application by Platinum Group based on geophysics and regional geology. The addition of further areas in the Prospecting Permit was concluded in January 2011 following initial area geochemistry and geophysics by Platinum Group. Platinum Group Metals Ltd will retain a 37% interest if JOGMEC completes their earn-in on this Project by spending US $3.2 million. Platinum Group is the operator for the Waterberg JV.\nWar Springs \u0096 JOGMEC JV\nTo November 30, 2010 JOGMEC had completed work valued at $2.56 million on War Springs. JOGMEC can earn a 35% project interest in War Springs by spending US $10 million for exploration. If completed, Platinum Group would hold a 35% interest and BEE interests 26%.\nDrilling is planned to continue at War Springs. JOGMEC budgets for Q2 2011 are in the planning stage. Platinum Group is the operator of the War Springs joint venture.\nQualified Person Quality Control and Assurance, Verification\nThe non independent qualified person for this news release is the CEO, R. Michael Jones, P.Eng. He has relevant experience over the past 10 years and has verified the data by direct involvement in supervision of the programs and data. Assays have been taken using the Company QA/QC program as previously described.\nAbout Platinum Group Metals Ltd.\nPlatinum Group is based in Vancouver BC, Canada and Johannesburg, South Africa. Platinum Group has a management team in both Canada and South Africa, which have successful track records of more than 20 years each in exploration, mine discovery, mine construction and mine operations. The Company was formed in 2000 and amalgamated in 2002 and is focused on the development of platinum operations. Platinum Group\u0092s main asset is a 74% interest in the WBJV Project 1 Platinum Mine where an initial construction budget of $100 million is in progress, including underground development.\nThe founders of Platinum Group Metals are also the co-founders of MAG Silver and West Timmins Mining (sold to Lakeshore Gold). These companies have discovered silver and gold mines respectively.\nOn behalf of the Board of\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd.\n"}, {"score": 946.68274, "uuid": "aa85f07b-14b7-5928-9768-74359f280842", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1703wb-40-18393", "target_hostname": "www.goldfellow.com", "target_uri": "http://www.goldfellow.com/cash-for-gold.aspx", "page_rank": 2.5705187e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "How <em>To</em> Sell <em>Gold</em> | GoldFellow", "snippet": "So, feel free <em>to</em> keep searching through your home for more unwanted scrap <em>gold</em>, silver and <em>platinum</em>.

After a spell of underperformance in earlier times, however, our selections have regained some ground in the past six months and the list is now more or less level pegging with the market.\nIt is also worth remembering that we have deliberately chosen shares with a relatively low-risk profile, and for these to perform as they have shows some vindication of this cautious policy. Lastly, the 37 per cent return seen in the portfolio over this three-year period represents compound growth of 11 per cent a year. Long-term returns from equities, adjusted for inflation, are reckoned to be about 6.5 per cent a year, so this performance comfortably tops that number.\nThis is no time for complacency, however, and rather like a football manager, we need to make sure we are fielding the best players from those available to us.\nSo which of the current team faces relegation to the \u2018sin bin\u2019? It seems to me that HSBC is the most likely candidate. I have stuck with HSBC through thick and thin over the past three years, and it remains one of the sector\u2019s best capitalised banks. But though the recent mis-selling episode is very minor indeed in the context of the company\u2019s \u00a390 bilion market capitalisation, it does highlight how complex and highly regulated the banking business is in the current climate, and how little investors can really know about these intricate operations.\nI am therefore selling HSBC at the current price of 508p, which raises exactly \u00a33,800 after commission charges and lifts the portfolio\u2019s cash to \u00a35,215. For a new portfolio constituent I am looking in a completely different area, for a share that I think will do well in any economic recovery phase.\nIt may seem early to be looking for opportunities like this, but the market discounts ahead, and the performance of JP Morgan US Smaller Companies shows that there are signs of life in the US economy, which should be a big influence on the shares I have picked.\nThe company in question is Lonmin, which is one of the main global producers of platinum. The reason is that platinum, which is much scarcer than gold, normally sells at a significant premium to the yellow metal.\nCurrently, however, it sells at a slight discount to the gold price, despite higher production costs in South Africa, where Lonmin's operations are located. Higher operating costs tend to put a floor under the price of the metal. Currently, however, these have been offset by a weak rand relative to the dollar. Lonmin\u2019s production costs are currently running just short of $1,000 an ounce.\nAll it will take is a revival in industrial demand for platinum, or some supply-side shocks, for the traditional balance between gold and platinum to be restored. One of the main uses for platinum is in automotive catalytic converters. It also functions as a substitute for gold in jewellery if the price is right.\nSome savvy financial advisers are tipping platinum as the next big mover in the precious metals market, partly because the industry sees shortage of mine supply as a key medium-term issue.\nFor various reasons, it\u2019s hard for UK investors to buy physical platinum directly at a reasonable price, so the next best thing is to buy shares in a mining company that produces it. Lonmin also has the advantage of being a big, well financed producer, extracting around 750,000 ounces of platinum a year. Gearing is relatively low, and the company is generating solid cash flow.\nLonmin\u2019s share price is pretty much an exact reproduction of the price of platinum in dollars, so a recovery back to normality in terms of the ratio against the gold price should see, other things being equal, a big boost in the share price. Nothing is certain, of course, but that is what I am hoping will unfold \u2013 or at least be discounted by the market \u2013 in the course of 2012.\nI am buying 400 shares for the portfolio at the current price of \u00a310.50, leaving the portfolio with just short of \u00a31,000 in cash. No other changes in the portfolio are contemplated for the moment.\nKeep up-to-date with the share spotlight portfolio here.\n"}], [{"score": 936.4812, "uuid": "595415f5-47ec-561a-835e-c9d47b866461", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-51-10741", "target_hostname": "www.cheapbodybuildingsupplements.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.cheapbodybuildingsupplements.co.uk/on-platinum-hydrowhey---795g-4231-p.asp", "page_rank": 1.1825906e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "ON <em>Platinum</em> Hydrowhey - 795g", "snippet": "In addition <em>to</em> being fast, <em>Platinum</em> Hydrowhey <em>is</em> also ultra-pure.

Investors soon become shell-shocked with negative market analysis that looks at a half-full glass of water and refers to is as \u2018half empty\u2019.\nThey read about a member of the Federal Reserve Board who is quoted as saying that he is worried about inflation, and they interpret this to mean that the dollar is going to rise, and gold might fall, just because of that single comment. If the man was serious about his worry, he and his pals would be raising rates, not lowering them! Of course we know that their hands are tied, as the Fed cannot raise rates until the economy, especially the housing market, can handle higher rates.\nThe fact of the matter is that gold and silver are becoming more of a bargain on a daily basis. The reason is very simple: Every day, the central bank money spigots are spewing out at least ten times as much money, as miners are able to produce gold and silver! Until this situation is reversed, the fundamentals will support higher prices. Pull-backs or corrections usually swing too far in the opposite direction to the main trend, thereby providing opportunities for us to \u2018buy the bargains\u2019. This is the situation today.\nFor some examples of price increases:\nPlatinum has gone from 400.00 to 2,000.00, an increase of 400%\nCopper from 0.75 to 4.00, an increase of 470%\nLead from 0.20c to 1.20, an increase of 500%\nUranium from 0.63 to 63.00, an increase of 530%\nCrude oil from 12.00 to 124.00, an increase of 900%\nMolybdenum from 2.50 to 32.50, an increase of 1300%\nRhodium from 400.00 to 9,400.00, an increase of 2200%\nMany of these commodities are trading at all-time high prices!\nBy comparison, gold has crawled, from 260.00 to 880.00, for an increase of 338%. Gold is currently trading at 1/3rd of its inflation adjusted previous high price.\nSilver from 4.00 \u2013 18.00 has increased by 350%\nSilver is currently trading at 1/8th of its inflation adjusted previous high price. That\u2019s right, silver has to increase by a factor of 8 times to reach 135.00, which is its 1980 price, when adjusted for inflation. And that\u2019s if you use the official CPI numbers. By using actual inflation data, the number is even higher. Gold and silver are still bargains!\nCharts courtesy www.stockcharts.com\nFeatured is the daily gold chart. The correction that started in mid-March ended at the Fibonacci 50% level. Price today broke out above the current downtrend line (blue arrow), and is now headed for higher levels. The 3 supporting indicators are turning positive (green lines). The 50DMA is in positive alignment to the 200DMA (green arrow), the sign of a bull market. THE FUSE IS LIT!\nFeatured is the weekly gold chart. The blue arrow points to the bottoming of the 7 \u2013 8 week gold cycle. \u2018X\u2019 marks the spot where the cycle missed, due to excessive bullishness. The cycle returned to normal on Friday May 2nd. The green arrow points to confirmation of the cycle. Unless gold closes below the thin purple line tomorrow, the upside breakout (green arrow), coming from beneath 8 weeks of resistance, will confirm the cycle bottom. (The thin dashed purple line connects the Friday closing prices). The RSI is beginning to rise up from its support line (black arrow). THE FUSE IS LIT!\nFeatured is the index that compares gold to oil. Since the mid 1960\u2019s the historical average has been 15.4 barrels of oil equals an ounce of gold. Today this index touched 7, indicating that 7 barrels will buy an ounce of gold. GOLD IS HALF PRICE COMPARED TO OIL! The blue arrow points to a positive closing price today. This may indicate that the trend is about to change. The index at 7.14 is 26% below the 200DMA, which is extreme. The RSI and MACD are deeply oversold (green lines). THE FUSE IS LIT!\nFeatured is the daily silver chart. The correction which began in mid-March ended right at the Fibonacci 50% level. Confirmation will come at this Friday\u2019s close, providing silver closes somewhere near the green arrow, above the thin purple downtrend line, which connects the Friday closing prices for the past 9 weeks. The RSI is positive, and rising up from its support line (green line). THE FUSE IS LIT!\nFeatured is the CDNX index. The Juniors are ready to join the party! The index had its best day in over a month (green arrow), and is bouncing off a triple bottom (green lines). The 3 supporting indicators are positive (blue lines). THE FUSE IS LIT!\nSummary:\nWhen you read a comment that is negative to a rising gold price, remember Gibson\u2019s Paradox: \u201cWhen real interest rates (T-bills less CPI) are negative, gold will rise.\u201d This will keep you invested, while the bull rises in saw-tooth manner, \u2018up two and down one\u2019.

(PTM-TSXV) is pleased to announce that early exploration work at the company''s Tweespalk Property in the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex has been encouraging. The next step in the exploration program is detailed trench sampling and that work is expected to commence immediately. The initial sampling work in rock and soil has identified elevated platinum, palladium, nickel and copper values in the area near where ground mapping and airborne geophysical surveys have identified the target Platreef contact area.\nGrab rock samples taken from the first mapping efforts include assays from background to 0.62 g/t platinum, palladium and gold (0.193 g/t Pt, 0.378 Pd, 0.049 g/t Au). The outcrop sampled is likely more than 100 meters west or above the target basal contact of the Bushveld intrusive. Soil sampling has identified areas on three lines with anomalous platinum, palladium, nickel and copper values (more than 20 ppb Pt+Pd, more than 50 ppm nickel and more than 100 ppm copper). Grid lines were spaced 400 metres apart. Some areas of the property could not be well tested with soil sampling as a result of transported overburden cover. As a result the anomalous areas remain open for testing with drilling and trenching techniques.\nThe Tweespalk Property is in between three known platinum deposits along the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex. Tweespalk is 25 kilometres north along trend from the Anglo Platinum PPRust open pit platinum mine. PPRust reports open pit reserves of 332 million tonnes grading 2.67 g/t 4 PGE''s (platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold) (equal to approximately 28 million ounces at .08 ounces per tonne) and resources of 718 million tonnes grading 2.79 g/t (0.08 ounces per tonne, Source: Anglo Platinum Annual Report 2002). The Tweespalk Property is located about 17 kilometres north of Anooraq''s Drenthe Farm, which is reported to have an inferred mineral resource of 99.4 million tonnes 1.31 g/t 4 PGE''s and 0.16% nickel, 0.10% copper. Tweespalk is located 23 kilometres south of the Nonnenwerth Deposit previously drilled by Genmin (Impala Platinum) of 50 million tonnes of 1.19 g/t 4 platinum and palladium and 0.07% nickel and 0.21% copper.\nThe Tweespalk property covers 2,177 hectares over approximately 3 kilometres of the Platreef trend. The northern limb of the Bushveld Complex has seen a dramatic increase in exploration activity and interest over the past year with the recognition of the potential for bulk minable platinum by open pit methods along the trend. African Minerals Ltd., a private company controlled by Robert Friedland, has focused further attention in the area as a result of large scale drilling programs. Anooraq Resources Corp, another Canadian based public company, has also conducted large drilling programs in the area. The Anooraq -- Anglo Platinum joint venture property, surrounds PTM''s Tweespalk property.\nPTM can acquire up to a 100% interest in the Tweespalk property under terms announced June 3, 2002.\nPTM also holds an option to purchase the War Springs Property located on trend approximately 7 kilometres south of the African Minerals'' project.\nPTM RSA has entered into a joint venture agreement with a black empowerment company, Africa Wide Mining -- a subsidiary of Africa Wide Investments Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement Africa Wide can participate for up to 30% in the Tweespalk and War Spring projects through an industry standard participating joint venture agreement. The joint venture with Africa Wide immediately exceeds the participation targets of the new Mining Charter of \"26% in ten years time\". Africa Wide brings significant legal and community consultation expertise to the joint venture.\nQualified Person\nR. Michael Jones, P.Eng is acting as the Qualified Person, \"QP\" for Platinum Group Metals RSA Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of PTM, for this and following releases on the Tweespalk Project, until a project geologist has been assigned. He is registered with the Professional Engineers of Ontario. Information on regional deposits has been acquired from public information and is believed to be reliable.\nABOUT PTM\nPTM is based in Vancouver BC, Canada and has active exploration programs in Canada and South Africa. The Company was founded in 2000 with the vision of tight physical markets for platinum group elements and the corresponding anticipated increase the value of platinum mineral rights and resources by 2005.\nPTM holds significant mineral rights in the northern and western Bushveld and is planning to continue its acquisition of mineral rights in South Africa and the Bushveld Complex. The Company''s activity in the western Bushveld has also been in the news recently. The Company is supportive of the new initiatives of the government of South Africa in the Mineral Bill and Mining Charter.\nPTM is the largest mineral rights holders in the area surrounding Canada''s only primary platinum and palladium mine near Thunder Bay, Ontario and PTM has a separate active joint venture with Anglo Platinum, the world''s largest producer of platinum, near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.\nOn behalf of the Board of\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd.\n"}, {"score": 925.86786, "uuid": "cb815757-1146-5a93-9e50-5e9559196cdb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-80-07769", "target_hostname": "www.purejewels.com", "target_uri": "http://www.purejewels.com/article-Guarantees-and-Returns-Policy-returns.htm", "page_rank": 1.1787317e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Platinum</em> wedding rings | <em>Platinum</em> engagement rings | White <em>gold</em> wedding", "snippet": "made a mistake, when we will either refund or replace the same product or a product of <em>equal</em> value.", "explanation": null, "document": "Customer Testimonials\nGuarantees and Returns Policy\nWe know you will enjoy receiving your order every bit as much as we have enjoyed sending your carefully chosen items.

The process by which they have accumulated so many dollars is that when a Chinese business makes money by selling their goods across the seas, it is stipulated by their government that they give the earnings to the country\u2019s central bank which is the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). They, in turn, receive the Yuan at a fixed rate.\nThe two countries didn\u2019t trade much at the beginning, for example, in 1980, China\u2019s foreign currency reserves were roughly $2.5 billion. And, now, the amount of foreign currency reserves that are stored by the Chinese government is a whopping $3.2 trillion, translating into a gain of 127,900%.\nIt is the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) in China that manages those foreign reserves. They are currently in an all out currency feud with the United States. Their purpose, for the moment, is to produce a novel leading world currency and remove the US dollar from its current reserve position. But they have a very big obstacle confronting them which is how to rid themselves of all the dollars they have. So they are purchasing US government securities and, because of this, have now accrued an enormous heap of US government debt. Indeed, about two-thirds of China\u2019s reserves continue to be invested in US Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with the next largest block in the euro. And because of the Fed\u2019s near to zero rates, all this money is essentially earning nothing in terms of interest rates.\nIn reality, the Chinese are now in a jam with all their US dollars. They are very aware that if they begin selling their US government bonds, it would push their value much lower. Then they experimented with the US stock market and their result was less than worthy with the great amounts of US equities they purchased just before the market commenced its downward spiral at the end of 2007. Morgan Stanley and Blackstone Group were firms in which the Chinese went into at about 10% and they have lost 70% and 46%, respectively. The US stock market is no longer appealing to the Chinese. Inflation is now their only worry and SAFE has made it clear that they will never be a speculator again while their only function from now on will be to guard the security of China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and guarantee a steady investment profit.\nNow that they are not buying stocks and their only apprehension is inflation, how will they hedge that risk? Their answer is to dive into the gold market and take over. And with this action they are on their way to accruing massive amounts of gold that in the near future, they will have enough to re-establish the convertibility of their currency into a precious metal. They were on a silver standard in the early 1900s.\nThings were different back then. They weren\u2019t as respected as they are now. They are presently growing at an accelerated speed and are also in possession of the biggest cash reserves in the world. So it only corresponds that they will also have a currency sustained by the safest and most secure asset, gold. China would very much like to be one of the world\u2019s most transcendent nations along with having the greatest currency as their own.\nToday\u2019s central banks rely on the printing press which is why China stands out amongst them because their way of achieving greatness will be by backing its currency with something much better than forsaken pledges. The Chinese know the power of gold bullion\u2026do you?\nTags: Buying Gold Bullion , Gold Bullion Prices , How To Buy Gold Bullion\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, February 28th, 2012 at 10:15 am and is filed under Buy Gold Bullion .

But it is very important to understand gold, and differences that affect price, in order to avoid confusion about the wide range of prices that seems to pervade the market for what may appear to be the \u0093same thing.\u0094\u00a0 As with gems, wherever there are significant price differences there are usually quality differences.\u00a0 The key to getting value in gold is understanding what accounts for differences in quality and price.\nWhat is gold?\nGold is one of the world\u0092s most precious metals.\u00a0 It is so soft and workable that one ounce can be stretched into a five mile long wire, or hammered into a sheet so thin that it could cover a hundred square feet.\u00a0 It is one of our rarest metals, and since pure gold doesn\u0092t rust or corrode, it can last forever. Interestingly, gold is present almost everywhere around us; in the earth\u0092s crust, in seas and rivers, and in plants, but it is very difficult and expensive to extract. Approximately two and a half to three tons of ore are needed to extract one ounce of gold.\nMost gold used in jewelry is an alloy\nGold is the most popular metal used for jewelry today.\u00a0 The simple gold wedding band probably accounts for more of the world\u0092s gold than any other single type of jewelry.\u00a0 But pure gold is very soft so it is usually mixed with other metals to make it stronger and prevent it from bending too easily.\u00a0 When two or more metals are mixed together, we call the resulting product an alloy. Most gold used in jewelry is an alloy; and the metals added to the gold are also called \u0093alloys.\u0094\nWhat is a Karat? Or is it Carat?\nIn jewelry, the term carat (or, Karat) has a double meaning: carat is used as a measurement of weight for gemstones, with one carat weighing 1/5 gram; carat is also used in countries around the word to indicate the amount of pure gold in a piece of gold jewelry.\u00a0 In the United States, however, when using the word to indicate gold content rather gemstone weight, it is spelled with a \u0093K;\u0094 hence \u0093karat,\u0094 to avoid confusion.\u00a0 Jewelry should always be marked to indicate how much pure gold it contains.\nIn the united States a karat mark, abbreviated to K or KT, indicates the amount of pure gold present in the metal. The word karat (carat) is derived from the word for fruit of the carob tree: in Italian, carato; in Arabic, qirat; in Greek, keration.\u00a0 The seeds of the fruit were used in ancient times for weighing gems.\u00a0 Also, the pure gold Byzantine coin cald the solidus weighed 24 karats. therefore, a 24 karat mark (24K or 24KT) became the mark used to indicate that something was pure gold.\nTo understand the concept as applied to gold, imagine that, \u0093pure gold\u0094 is a pie into 24 equal \u0093slices\u0094 or parts.\u00a0 Each karat equals one part of the pie. So, 24 KT would mean that 24 parts (out of a total of 24) are gold. In other words, 24 KT would be 100% gold; or, pure gold.\u00a0 In the 18 karat gold jewelry, 18 parts are pure gold and six are another metal (or, 18/24 = 3/4 = 75% pure gold); in 12 karat, 12 parts are pure gold, 12 parts another metal (12/24 = 1/2 = 50% pure gold).\u00a0 And so on.\nI some cultures, 24 karat gold jewelry is required for certain jewelry pieces, but it\u0092s generally agreed that 24 karat, or pure gold, is too soft for jewelry use. In some parts of the world, 18 KT 0r 20 karat is preferred because of its brighter yellow color and because it is considered \u0093purer\u0094 and more precious.\u00a0 In the United States, we prefer 14 or 18 karat gold because it is more durable than higher karat gold.\u00a0 We caution clients about the risk of high karat gold (20 KT, 22 KT, or 24 KT) for a gem-studded setting because prongs can be too easily bent open accidentally, resulting in the loss of the stones.\nIn some countries such as Italy, the percentage of pure gold is indicated by a number representing how many parts; out of a total of 1,000 parts, are pure gold. One thousand parts would be the equivalent or 24 karat; 750 means 750 parts of 1,000: 750/1000 = 75/100 = 75% pure gold. This corresponds to 18 KT.\nThe following chart shows how different international gold markings correspond to one another:\nGold marks\n375\nA word about Russian marks\nOld time pieces made in Russia were marked to indicate the content on its equivalent to a \u0093zolotnik.\u0094\u00a0 A piece marked 96 contained as much gold as 96 zolotniks, which equals pure gold; 72 equals 18 KT (750); 56 equals 14 KT (585).\nTo be called gold, what is the minimum gold content?\nMany countries have established minimum standards that must be met for items to be legally called \u0093gold.\u0094\u00a0 The laws governing the actual content of gold required in piece of jewelry, however, vary.\u00a0 In the United States, to be called \u0093gold,\u0094 the item must be at least 10 KT; in England and Canada, 9 KT; in Italy and France, 18 KT.\nThe many colors of gold\nPure gold is always yellow.\u00a0 But because pure gold is too soft for most jewelry use, and must be mixed with other metals (alloys) to increase its hardness, the color can also be modified by adding varying amounts of these other metals.\u00a0 Those usually added to gold for jewelry use include copper, zinc, silver, nickel, platinum, and palladium (a metal in the platinum family).\u00a0 Depending upon which alloys are used, a variety of colors can be produced. Another practice is to plate 14 KT gold jewelry with 18 KT for an 18 KT look, that is, a stronger yellow color. White gold is also frequently plated with rhodium, a rare and more expensive metal from the platinum family, to create a whiter, brighter finish.\nUsing some combination of one or more of the metals shown below will result in various colors.\nColor\nGold, Nickel, * Zinc, Silver, Platinum, Palladium\nGreen Gold\nGold, Silver (much more than yellow gold), Copper, Zinc\nPink (Red) Gold\nGold, Copper (sometimes a small amount of silver is used)\n* Note:\u00a0 Some people are allergic to nickel and should not wear white gold containing nickel.\u00a0 For this reason, a white gold alloyed with palladium is being used by some manufacturers.\u00a0 White gold that contains palladium will be more expensive than yellow gold or white gold containing another alloy.\u00a0 But it is still less expensive than platinum.\nWhat causes skin discoloration with some gold jewelry?\nPure gold doesn\u0092t tarnish and won\u0092t discolor the skin, but alloys in the gold can corrode and produce discoloration to the skin in contact with the gold, especially under moist or damp conditions.\u00a0 Fats and fatty acids present in perspiration can set up a corrosive reaction, and the problem can be worse in warm, humid areas, especially where chloride (salt) is in the air.\nSmog can also be a problem.\u00a0 Smog fumes can introduce chemicals that cause the alloys in gold to tarnish.\u00a0 The tarnish then rubs off, discoloring skin or clothing.\nCosmetics may be culprit.\nAnother common cause of discoloration is metallic abrasion caused by some makeup.\u00a0 Some makeup contains compounds that are actually harder than the jewelry with which it comes into contact. As the harder compounds rub against the jewelry, they cause tiny particles of metal to flake off, forming a darkish looking dust.\u00a0 When this dust makes contact with a soft, absorbent surface such as skin or clothing, it forms a black smudge.\nThere are several possible solutions to the problem of skin discoloration. First, get into the habit of removing jewelry often and cleaning the skin that has been in contact with it with soap and water.\u00a0 Keep your jewelry clean as well, and wipe it periodically with a soft cloth to remove tarnish. Next, try using an absorbent body powder, one free of abrasives, on all areas of your skin that are in contact with jewelry.\nPay attention to the design of jewelry you select if skin discoloration seems to be a problem; wide shanks can cause perspiration, and rings with an inner concave surface can cause moisture and contaminants to collect, causing both discoloration and dermatitis.\nfinally, try switching to a higher gold content or to a different manufacturer.\u00a0 The higher the gold content, the less likely it is that discoloration will occur because in the higher karat gold there is less of the alloy, such as copper, silver, nickel, that might corrode. People who have a problem wearing 14 KT gold jewelry may find that the problem disappears with 18 KT gold.\nSometimes simply changing to a similar product by a different manufacturer may solve the problem.\u00a0 This does not mean that one product is inferior to the other.\u00a0 Manufacturers often use different combinations of alloys, or different percentages or ratios of alloys.\u00a0 They may look the same, but you might find you can wear one manufacturer\u0092s line better than that of another.\nSince different metals, and different ratios, are used to produce different colors, discoloration may result when wearing one particular color or gold, but not when wearing other colors. If there seems to be a problem when wearing white gold, try white gold alloyed with platinum rather than nickel, since platinum won\u0092t corrode.\nDetermining value requires more than scale!\nWeight is one factor that goes into determining the value of a piece of gold jewelry .\u00a0 Gold usually sold by weight, in grams or pennyweights. There are 20 pennyweights to one ounce; if you multiply grams by 0.643, you will have the number of pennyweights.\u00a0 Weight is important because it is an indication of the actual amount of pure gold in the piece. However, it is only one factor only to consider. When buying gold from a gold manufacturer, for example, factored into the price per gram is the cost of gold PLUS the cost for labor and workmanship.\u00a0 The price always takes into consideration:\n1) The type of construction,\n2) The means of production, and\n3) How the piece is finished.\nDesign and construction is important not only because of the piece\u0092s finished look, but also because specific details in the overall design and construction affect comfort, wear-ability, and ease in putting the piece on or taking it off. Good design requires excellent designers, and extra care and attention to small mechanical details. This adds to the cost of any piece of jewelry.\nIn addition, jewelry design is also becoming recognized as an \u0093art,\u0094 and jewelry designers as \u0093artists.\u0094 some award winning designers command top dollar, as do top painters, sculptors, and other artists.\u00a0 A piece of gold jewelry made by a fine designer, especially if it is a one-of-kind or limited edition piece, will sometimes sell for much more than another piece of mass produced gold jewelry of the same weight and gold content.\nIn looking at a piece of gold jewelry, you must also consider the type of construction necessary to create a particular design or look. Is the construction simple or complex? Did the piece require extensive labor or minimal labor?\u00a0 Did it require special skill, talent, or equipment?\nTo ignore the design and construction factors and assign a value to apiece of gold jewelry based on gold content (i. e. 14 KT, 18 KT, etc.) and weight alone would be equivalent to placing a value on a painting based on the cost of paint and canvas alone.\nProduction can affect price significantly. Is the piece produced by machine or by hand?\u00a0 The type of construction required to create a particular design may require that it be made entirely, or in part, by hand, while others can be completely made by machine.\u00a0 Some designs may be produced either way, but those done by hand will have a different look, and cost.\nFinish is where we take into account the care and labor costs associated with the actual finishing of the piece. For example, are there any special skills or techniques required to put on the final touches that make the piece distinctive, such as engraving, milgraining, hammering, or granulation?\u00a0 here we also need to note whether or not the piece has been carefully polished to remove any scratches that might diminish its beauty, or rough edges that might be abrasive or catch or snag on fabric.\u00a0 Consider whether the item was hand polished or machine polished; some pieces are machine made, but finished by hand.\u00a0 We must also take into consideration any special finishes to the metal itself, such as a florentine, matte, or sand blasted finish.\u00a0 Each step in the process, and each special step or skill required, adds; sometimes dramatically, to the cost.\nAdding it all up\nMany pieces of gold jewelry look alike at first glance.\u00a0 When examined carefully, however, if often becomes clear where the difference lie, both in quality and cost.\u00a0 Ask your jeweler to help you understand these differences by comparing different qualities for you. Only after carefully evaluating all these factors can you appreciate gold jewelry and recognize cost differences and real value.\nIs that \u0093Bargain\u0094 really a bargain?\nBeware of underkarating, which is a serious problem around the world.\u00a0 If a piece of gold jewelry is underkarated, it means that the jewelry is marked to indicate a certain gold content, but actually contains less than is indicated.\u00a0 Needless to say, retailers who knowingly sell underkarated gold jewelry create the impression that they are giving you\u00a0 a bargain because their prices are so low, but if there is actually less gold ( and more alloy, so the piece would have a comparable weight to the others you might be considering), you aren\u0092t getting any bargain.\u00a0 Unfortunately, most people never learn that they have bought underkarated gold. Thus, it is very important to buy gold jewelry from a reputable source, one that makes the effort to check its gold shipments carefully.\nLook for a manufacturer\u0092s registered trademark. Being sure gold is properly represented in terms of its value is what really matters; you should get what you pay for. Buying from a reliable source is the first step. In addition, be sure to look for a manufacturer\u0092s registered trademark, a mark stamped near the karat mark. To avoid being held liable themselves, more and more jewelers are buying only from manufacturers willing to stamp what they make with their own mark, a mark registered with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. Buying gold with a \u0093manufacturer\u0092s trademark\u0094 is one way to help assure you get what you pay for, since the product can be traced to a specific manufacturer, whose name and reputation are on the line.\nFine, expensive gold jewelry should always be tested.\u00a0 While testing for exact gold content requires assaying, it is usually relatively easy to detect any underkarating that is serius enough to affect the value of a specific piece of jewelry and the price paid.\u00a0 Any jeweler or gemologist appraiser can make such determination, in most cases, quickly and easily with only a gold tester or by using the streak test. You should be aware that an electronic gold tester, some very heavily plated pieces might give a false reading indicating gold when the piece is only base metal. For this reason the streak test is better but the person doing the test must be sure to take a file or carbide scriber and make a very deep scratch in order to penetrate the plating for an accurate test.\nThere are strict laws pertaining to gold content and marks used to indicate it.\u00a0 Take the time to understand what you are buying, buy only from a reputable source, and be sure to have it tested. If you do, your gold jewelry will give you a lifetime of pleasure.\nPlatinum: cool, classic, and contemporary\nPlatinum, which has been used in jewelry since the turn of the century, became especially popular during the Edwardian period because its malleable character made it a natural for the intricate and lacy work style of the day.\nPlatinum is frequently used in finest jewelry and to set the most valuable gems because it\u0092s more \u0093workable\u0094 and easier to move the prongs or setting around the stone, thereby reducing the risk of accidentally damaging it. Long a favorite for classic looks and for the finest diamond settings, platinum is now evolving as the metal of choice for design trends; sleek, bold, contemporary looks for brooches, necklaces, chains, and earrings. Sometimes platinum is alloyed with another metal to create an interesting color, or used alongside gold to create an innovative look.\nNothing is purer than platinum\nPlatinum is even more rare and valuable than gold.\u00a0 The platinum family is composed of six elements; platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium. These six silvery white metals are generally found together in nature, with platinum and palladium the most abundant, and osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium the rarest.\nPlatinum is rarest and heavier than other precious metals and as the purest, it\u0092s sometimes referred to as the \u0093noblest.\u0094\u00a0 Most platinum jewelry also contains small amounts of the rarer and more expensive elements iridium or ruthenium for added strength.\nBecause platinum is so pure, it rarely causes allergic reactions.\u00a0 This is greatly appreciated by those sensitive people who experience reactions to or skin discoloration from jewelry containing base metals. In addition, platinum is somewhat stronger than other precious metals.\nPlatinum is identified by karat marks. In the United States, the abbreviations PT or plat indicate platinum.\u00a0 In Europe the numerical marks 950 or PT950 indicate platinum.\u00a0 The finest jewelry often uses platinum mixed with 10% iridium or ruthenium for added strength.\u00a0 This cost more since these are rarer and costlier metals.\nRhodium plating\nRhodium, another member of platinum family, is the brightest and most reflective of all the platinum metals.\u00a0 Rhodium is also harder and whiter than platinum and, because it is so durable, doesn\u0092t wear off quickly, as does gold plating. A a result, it is often used to coat gold and platinum jewelry.\nRhodium plating should be considered especially for people who have allergic reactions to 10 KT or 14 KT gold, since it can help eliminate reaction to the alloys.\nYellow gold, white gold, or platinum:\u00a0 Which one?\nTo decide whether or not you want yellow gold, white gold, or platinum, you must first decide which color metal you prefer.\u00a0 This selection usually depends on personal preference, skin tone, and the color of other jewelry you may own. If your choice is yellow gold, keep in mind that it is available in several different shades, including a pure yellow, a pinkish yellow, and greenish yellow.\nIf you decide yellow is the color you want, then you must decide whether to get 14 Karat or 18 Karat.\u00a0 Certainly, 14 KT is more affordable than 18 KT; it is also harder.\u00a0 But the yellow won\u0092t be as bright.\u00a0 If you refer a brighter yellow, we recommend that you ask your jeweler for a 14 KT gold with an 18 KT finish, that is, an 18 KT coating over the 14 KT.\u00a0 After several years the finish may wear off, but it can be re-plated foe a minimal charge.\nIf you prefer a white metal, your choice may be more difficult.\u00a0 Even though white gold and platinum may be similar in appearance, they are very different metals.\u00a0 As we mentioned, platinum is much more expensive, so if you\u0092re on a limited budget, white gold may be the sensible choice. White gold is very hard and very resistant to scratching but exhibit a brownish or yellowish cast which must be covered by rhodium plating. As we mentioned, this plating will eventually wear off, although it can easily be re-plated.\nOne significant disadvantage of white gold is that it is more brittle than platinum or yellow gold.\u00a0 So if you decide on white gold, be sure to have your jeweler check the setting; especially prongs, at least once a year.\nPlatinum is somewhat softer and more malleable than white gold, making it an ideal choice for very intricate settings that require intensive labor. It is much easier to use platinum for pave work, that is, designs in which the stones are set as closely together as possible, With platinum, the jeweler can also make a safer setting because a larger prong can be used, since platinum conforms so easily to the shape of the stone, reducing risk of damage. Over time, platinum also holds up better than gold\nOne disadvantage of platinum is that many jewelers do not have proper equipment to work with it. This, combined with platinum\u0092s cost, results in more limited variety of styles from which to choose. If you like basic classic design, you shouldn\u0092t have a problem finding a setting you like.\u00a0 But if you need custom work to get the look you want, it can add substantially to the cost of the finished piece.\nIn final analysis, it is up to the individual to weight the relative advantage and disadvantage of gold or platinum. Whichever precious metal you select, there are many beautiful styles and designs from which to choose. And if you are having something custom made, many fine jewelers and designers will work in both metals.\nCustomer Satisfaction is of paramount important to The Jewelry Hut.\nBuy with confidence at The Jewelry Hut.\nTo Web Masters:\nThe article above can be used on your web site or newsletter.\nWhen it is published, May I request that you include my name and resource box (the bio., contact and copyright information that follows the article.\u00a0 I would also appreciate if you could send me an e-mail of notification along with a complimentary copy of publication.\nBijan Aziz is the owner and Web Master for The Jewelry Hut.\n<a Href=http://www.thejewelryhut.com></a>\n"}, {"score": 905.7517, "uuid": "d85ac74e-7e05-54a5-a4e1-e6c0e259e0c4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1003wb-73-05859", "target_hostname": "www.platinumgroupmetals.net", "target_uri": "http://www.platinumgroupmetals.net/news_releases/2003/index.php?&content_id=140", "page_rank": 1.1828244e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "2003 | <em>Platinum</em> Group Metals", "snippet": "Tweespalk <em>is</em> 25 kilometres (16 miles) north along trend from the Anglo <em>Platinum</em> PPRust open pit <em>platinum</em> mine (reserves of 332 million tonnes grading 2.67 g&#x2F;t 4 PGE&#x27;&#x27;s <em>platinum</em>, palladium, rhodium and <em>gold</em> - <em>equal</em> <em>to</em> approximately 28 million ounces), 17 kilometres (10 miles) north of Anooraq&#x27;&#x27;s Drenthe", "explanation": null, "document": "Northern Limb Bushveld Complex Update\nOctober 14, 2003\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd.

All these figures are from publicly published data as referenced in previous new releases.\nThe Tweespalk property consists of 2,177 hectares (8.4 sq miles) covering 3 kilometres (1.8 miles) of the Platreef trend. PTM can acquire up to 100% interest in the Tweespalk property for US$ 1.4M three years from the grant of the prospecting permit. PTM RSA has also entered into a joint venture agreement with a black economic empowerment company, Africa Wide Mining -- a subsidiary of Africa Wide Investments Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement Africa Wide can participate for up to 30% in the Tweespalk property. The arrangement exceeds the 10-year target under the Mining Charter of South Africa, indicating PTM''s strong endorsement of the Charter.\nThe War Springs Platinum Project covers an area of 2,396 hectares (9.2 square miles) hosting approximately 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) of the important Platreef lower contact of the Bushveld Complex. War Springs is just 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) south on trend along the Platreef contact from African Minerals'' and approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) northeast of Anoraaq''s South Block Project.\nQUALIFIED PERSON\nR.

(PTM-TSX; PLG-NYSE AMEX) (\u0093Platinum Group\u0094 or the \u0093Company\u0094) will be active in platinum exploration on multiple projects in South Africa and Canada for the balance of 2011. Six exploration drilling programs targeting platinum are currently underway or are planned to commence shortly on four properties in South Africa and two properties in Canada.\nIn addition to its platinum mine construction currently underway at the WBJV Project 1, (74% owned, See News Release April 4, 2011) Platinum Group Metals will have exposure to global exploration budgets of approximately $5 million this year including 3 projects to be funded by joint venture partners in South Africa and an initial exploration budget in Canada of $2 million funded by Platinum Group.\nR. Michael Jones, President of Platinum Group Metals said, \u0093We see the balance of 2011 as a pivotal growth period for the company. In addition to building a 275,000 ounce per year Platinum mine we have a very active exploration profile. Exploration at the mine site is also ongoing. The diversification of our platinum exposure and exploration upside are distinguishing features of our company compared to the other North American listed platinum companies. No other North American listed platinum company has large scale mine exposure in South Africa, active exploration in South Africa and an active Canadian exploration program on multiple projects. Our management team has a track record of multiple mine discoveries in precious metals and it is exciting to be on the hunt again for more platinum.\u0094\nCanada\nThe Company has re-activated its Canadian exploration program, near Thunder Bay, Ontario and added 12 new properties covering at total of 532 square kilometers, bringing the company\u0092s holdings to 637 square kilometers. Platinum Group has acquired the majority of its new properties by staking over the past 4 months, utilizing in-house compilation and modeling of geophysics, geochemistry and work completed by the company in the area over the past 10 years.\nAll of the new properties are targeted on a new mineralization type where contained platinum is equal or greater than palladium. Platinum Group continues to hold a large land position targeted on the older intrusion rock type like that at North American Palladium\u0092s Lac des Iles Mine where palladium is the dominant platinum group metal, or \u0093PGM\u0094. Historically, North American deposits have been dominated by palladium rather than rarer and more valuable platinum. Some new exploration in the Thunder Bay area has demonstrated previously unexplored potential for platinum in pipe like intrusions or conduits. Platinum Group Metals plans to be a major participant in exploration for this new deposit type in this area.\nTwo 100% owned properties have advanced to an initial drill testing phase based on a recently completed airborne geophysics survey combined with ongoing geology and geochemistry compilation. In addition, Platinum Group has a 75% option from Benton Resources on the Bark Lake Project where surface samples have found platinum dominant mineralization in boulders. Platinum Group has added to this property area with 100% owned claims and is continuing with surface work to target future drilling in the region for late 2011.\nSouth Africa\nWBJV Project 1\nThe WBJV partners have approved and recently completed approximately $1 million of drilling in and around the mine area for detailed mine planning and the testing of areas that were not accessible prior to the purchase of all of the surface rights over the mine, (now complete). The WBJV P1 mine plan and feasibility study focuses on Merensky Reef for the first 16 years and the UG-2 platinum bearing reef is deferred until the end of the mine plan. The potential of shallow UG-2 outside the Merensky mining areas is being investigated. Assays are pending.\nSable Joint Venture\nThis large land position, acquired by Prospecting Permit Application by Platinum Group, adjoins the position of Xstrata at the Eland Platinum mine at the east end of the Western Limb of the Bushveld Complex. Geological mapping and soil sampling has been completed. Drilling has now advanced to the fourth hole and is continuing. Assays are pending.\nSable Platinum (a private South African company) can earn a 51% interest in the property and if completed Platinum Group would reduce to a 23% interest following 42 million Rand (US $6 million) of exploration expenditures.\nWaterberg Joint Venture \u0096 JOGMEC- JV\nDrilling of the first hole on the Waterberg Project in late 2010 has identified a new extension of the Bushveld Complex northward, under cover rocks, and this first intercept provides a vector for further drilling. The area was targeted for an exploration Prospecting Permit Application by Platinum Group based on geophysics and regional geology. The addition of further areas in the Prospecting Permit was concluded in January 2011 following initial area geochemistry and geophysics by Platinum Group. Platinum Group Metals Ltd will retain a 37% interest if JOGMEC completes their earn-in on this Project by spending US $3.2 million. Platinum Group is the operator for the Waterberg JV.\nWar Springs \u0096 JOGMEC JV\nTo November 30, 2010 JOGMEC had completed work valued at $2.56 million on War Springs. JOGMEC can earn a 35% project interest in War Springs by spending US $10 million for exploration. If completed, Platinum Group would hold a 35% interest and BEE interests 26%.\nDrilling is planned to continue at War Springs. JOGMEC budgets for Q2 2011 are in the planning stage. Platinum Group is the operator of the War Springs joint venture.\nQualified Person Quality Control and Assurance, Verification\nThe non independent qualified person for this news release is the CEO, R. Michael Jones, P.Eng. He has relevant experience over the past 10 years and has verified the data by direct involvement in supervision of the programs and data. Assays have been taken using the Company QA/QC program as previously described.\nAbout Platinum Group Metals Ltd.\nPlatinum Group is based in Vancouver BC, Canada and Johannesburg, South Africa. Platinum Group has a management team in both Canada and South Africa, which have successful track records of more than 20 years each in exploration, mine discovery, mine construction and mine operations. The Company was formed in 2000 and amalgamated in 2002 and is focused on the development of platinum operations. Platinum Group\u0092s main asset is a 74% interest in the WBJV Project 1 Platinum Mine where an initial construction budget of $100 million is in progress, including underground development.\nThe founders of Platinum Group Metals are also the co-founders of MAG Silver and West Timmins Mining (sold to Lakeshore Gold). These companies have discovered silver and gold mines respectively.\nOn behalf of the Board of\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd.\n"}, {"score": 901.12, "uuid": "0f5e2e60-094b-57f0-ba93-de0fe5aea8d6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-41-06209", "target_hostname": "www.ucu.org", "target_uri": "https://www.ucu.org/loans_extras.htm", "page_rank": 1.205273e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>Platinum</em> and <em>Gold</em> MasterCard Extras - University Credit Union, Los Angeles", "snippet": "UCU&#x27;s <em>Platinum</em> and <em>Gold</em> MasterCard comes with the following features.

We often have to quarantine them in a well ventilated room for weeks or months before the stench wears off, and we can handle them with our eyes watering, and nose running. This helps to create a mental image of the typical LMO customer as a male septuagenarian armchair bound smoker, with too much money, and nothing worthwhile to spend it on. When he dies of lung cancer, or COPD, or some other smoking related disease, his family flogs all his coins, stamps, and other ephemera to the nearest dealer. Most people now realise that smoking is not a very sensible thing to do, to understate the case somewhat, but this seems to typify LMO's target audience.\nBuying Coins\nWe also buy coins, please see our We Buy Coins page.\nWe even buy crap like this, even if it is just for the laugh, although we do also find it educational.\n...at the Lowest Possible Price\n521 Lytham Road, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY4 1RJ, England.\nTelephone (44) - (0) 1253 - 343081 & 316238; Fax 408058; E-mail:\nThe URL for our main page is: http://www.24carat.co.uk/index.html\n"}, {"score": 894.5814, "uuid": "ebd6e88f-28fc-5081-94f1-a2d8262a6c1d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1007wb-16-20726", "target_hostname": "www.bullion.org.za", "target_uri": "http://www.bullion.org.za/content/?pid=86&pagename=Platinum", "page_rank": 1.2532851e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>Platinum</em> - Education | Chamber Of Mines", "snippet": "Whereas the <em>platinum</em> palladium ratio in the Merensky and UG2 reefs <em>is</em> close <em>to</em> three <em>to</em> one, the two metals are found in <em>equal</em> measure in the Platreef deposits. The mining of <em>platinum</em> ores <em>is</em> similar <em>to</em> <em>gold</em> mining inasmuch as the orebody <em>is</em> a thin, tabular reef covering an extensive area.", "explanation": null, "document": "Platinum group metals in South Africa\nGeology\nThe Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), which extends for 400 kilometres in the Northern Province, contains the world\u2019s largest known deposits of platinum group metals (PGMs) - platinum, palladium, rhodium. ruthenium. iridium and osmium. It is a large igneous (volcanic) intrusion through the earth\u2019s crust which having been tilted and eroded new outcrops to surface around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin.\nThe BIC system is divided into an eastern and western lobe with a further northern extension: it is believed that all three sections of the system were formed around the same time - about 2 billion years ago -- and are remarkably similar. Vast quantities of molten rock from the earth\u2019s mantle were brought to surface through long vertical cracks in the earth\u2019s crust creating the geological intrusion known as the BIC. The effects of these injections of molten rock over time, combined with the crystallisation of different minerals at different temperatures, resulted in the formation of a structure rather like a layered cake consisting of distinct mineral strata, including three PGM-bearing reefs.\nReserves\nThe unique BIC contains estimated PGM reserves of 62 816 tons, about 55,7 per cent of the world total. So far, the Merensky Reef has been the source of most of South Africa\u2019s PGMs. It is estimated to contain some 17 000 tons of PGM, reserves. In the western BIC, where the major platinum mines are situated, the reef occurs in a narrow, 25- centimetre-wide PGM rich band bounded by two thin chromite layers. This pattern falls away in other areas resulting in the reefs diverging between the chromite bands until it is many metres wide The Merensky Reef is characterised by its high PGM grades and the high ratio of platinum to the other PGMs, especially those of major importance like palladium and rhodium.\nThe UG2 Reef, which is more consistent throughout the BIC, is rich in chrornite, but lacks the Merensky\u2019s gold, copper and nickel by-products, though its PGM reserves may be almost twice as large as those of the Merensky Reef. It is estimated that increasing exploitation of the UG2 Reef will lift its contribution to South Africa\u2019s platinum output. The Crocodile River mine was the first devoted entirely to exploiting UG2 ore.\nIn the northern extension of the BIC the Platreef is found. Whereas the platinum palladium ratio in the Merensky and UG2 reefs is close to three to one, the two metals are found in equal measure in the Platreef deposits.\nMining platinum\nThe mining of platinum ores is similar to gold mining inasmuch as the orebody is a thin, tabular reef covering an extensive area. This enables a progressive method of mining - the reef is drilled and blasted to advance the face, support being installed for local control of the hanging wall. As in gold mines, platinum mining is incorporating the increased use of mechanisation and trackless-mining methods in stopes little more than one metre high.\nPlatinum mining, however, differs from gold mining in several ways. Unlike gold reefs, which are sedimentary deposits resulting from the settling of granular particles on the bed of an inland lake and subjected to great pressure, platinum reefs are igneous rocks. They were intruded into the Bushveld area as molten volcanic magmata rising from below the earth\u2019s crust, later cooling and solidifying. This phenomenon created a strata control environment differing markedly from that of gold mines.\nPlatinum mining is also affected by a further geological feature - the occurrence of parboils in the plane of the reef. Varying in diameter from some 30 to 500 metres, and causing rapid sinking or rising of the reef, these potholes disrupt stoning operations, often requiring the re-establishment of\nOccurence of platinum group metals\nThe Merensky Reef is the source of over 80 per cent of the platinum mined in South Africa This has been successfully exploited since the late \u201920s.\nMore PGMs are found in the chromatite reefs of the BIC. The highest PGM values are associated with the UG2 Reef which lies about 200 metres below the Merensky. Since the mid \u201970s increasing tonnages of UG2 ore have been mined and treated by the established producers.\nSmaller quantities of PGMs are found in the middle and lower group chrome seams which are mined for their chrome content. Recently, some of these PGMs have been recovered by re-treatment of chrome mine railings. Other similar schemes are planned, though the quantities of precious metals from this source will never be very large.\nThe PGM-bearing Platreef occurs in the northern portion of the BIC. Mining of this reef was discontinued in the early \u201930s owing to treatment difficulties and patchy values. Exploration and test-work have continued and at least one new mine is now planned for the Platreef.\nMinerology\nThe pattern of values in different ore samples can vary widely. The precious metals occur in a variety of forms. One or more of the metals may be present in combination with sulphur, arsenic, selenium or tellurium metallic particles of PGMs or of PGMs alloyed with base metals are also found. Additional PGMs are found in solid solution in base metal sniphide particles.\nChromite crystals form a large part of the volume of UG2 and other chrome ores. Base-metal sulphides are much more prevalent in Merensky and Platreef ores than in the UG2 or chrome ores. The grain size of mineral particles varies widely but is coarsest in Merensky ores.\nThe difficulty in recovering PGMs from any particular ore is determined by the ore\u2019s mineralogy. Although Merensky ores are often easier to treat, it is not easy to generalise. Ore from different areas of the same mine can have quite different characteristics.\nRecovery process\nPGM recovery processes for UG2 and Merensky ores are generally similar. However, the disparity in base metal contents is responsible for differences in the relative scale of some unit operations. Processes can be grouped into the four stages of concentration, smelting, base metals removal, and precious metals refining.\nConcentration\nIn concentration. the ore is ground to liberate mineral particles. These are then recovered in the form of a concentrate by froth flotation. The ore mineralogy dictates both the fineness of grind required for liberation and the ideal flotation conditions. Very fine particles are difficult to recover, so two or even three milling and flotation stages may be used to minimise losses caused by over-grinding.\nThere are minor differences in the details of the equipment and operations employed by the various producers. In Merensky processing a metallic concentrate rich in PGMs is sometimes produced in addition to the flotation concentrate. This concentrate can be sufficiently rich to by-pass the smelter and be sent straight to base metal removal.\nIn UG2 processing there are a number of options regarding by product chromite recovery and blending with the Merensky ore before milling. At present, though, only one South African producer is recovering chromite: this is done after primary milling, with the chromite crystals being liberated at their natural grain size. UG2 ores require finer grinding than Merensky are for optimum PGM recovery. Blending of the two before milling therefore gives lower recoveries and is to be avoided where possible.\nSmelting\nThe concentrate is melted in an electric furnace. Large units with six electrodes in line are used for smelting Merensky or mixtures of Merensky and UG2 concentrates. Smaller circular furnaces are used to smelt unblended UG2 concentrate. On melting, the concentrate separates into two layers. The upper layer is a silicate/oxide slag which is tapped off and then either discarded or returned to concentration. The lower layer is a sulphide motto which is sent for converting.\nThe flotation-concentrate composition must be suitable for smelting. its rock mineral content should produce a fluid slag at the desired temperature. At the same time, it must contain enough sulphides to form a reasonable quantity of matter. To compensate for minor problems with chemical composition, various fluxes are added. Typically, the main addition is burnt lime or limestone but other materials such as carbonaceous reductants, sulphides, oxides or silicates are used as necessary.\nHigher temperatures are required to melt UG2 concentrates owing to higher contents of chromium and magnesium oxides. More turbulent smelting conditions are also preferred to avoid build-up of chrome spinel in the furnace hearth. Crocodile River Mine was the first operation to be dependent on smelting unblended UG2 concentrates. Other operators have been able to feed their furnaces with a blend that includes Merensky concentrate.\nThe furnace matte is further processed by converting. Excess sulphur and iron are oxidised in a refractory lined vessel. Fluxing agents are added to form an iron-rich slag that is skimmed off and returned to the furnaces. The converter motto is then sent for base-metal removal.\nBase metal removal\nBase metals are removed from the converter matte either by leaching or by a combination of magnetic separation and leaching processes. Problem elements such as selenium, arsenic and tellurium are also removed. The concentrate which results is sent for further processing into refined precious metals. Base metals are a valuable by-product of PGM extraction. Their further refining by the various producers is largely dictated by economies of scale.\nRefining\nPrecious metals refining processes have developed considerably in recent years. The older or \u2019classical\u2019 process involved first roasting the PGM concentrate. This made the rhodium, iridium and ruthenium insoluble in aqua regia. The platinum, palladium and gold were then dissolved and separated by a series of sequential precipitations, The remaining residue was then upgraded by pyro-metallurgical and leaching processes before being separated into individual metals. Final purification of all metals was by repeated dissolution and precipitation.\nImproved separation and refining procedures have become available for all of the precious metals. These commonly involve operations such as solvent extraction or ion exchange. They are being introduced either to replace procedures in the classical process or as part of completely new refining processes. Advantages such as improved precious metals recovery, lower refining costs and shorter processing times are being claimed.\nBeneficiation\nThe extraordinary physical properties of the platinum group make its metals almost indispensable in a wide range of industrial applications.\nAutocatalysts\nMotor vehicle exhaust systems are fitted with catalytic converters to reduce the polluting effects of exhaust emissions. The converter\u2019s main component is a ceramic honeycomb, the surface of which is coated with platinum and rhodium, to which palladium is sometimes added. The main form of autocatalyst is a three way converter, so called because as engine exhausts pass through the converter at around 300\u00b0C, these precious metals convert nitrogen oxide, unburnt hydrocarbons and deadly carbon monoxide into harmless nitrogen, water and carbon dioxide.\nAutocatalysts, which account for more than 40 per cent of total demand for platinum alone, are the major demand sector for PGMs - and for the next few years this market is unlikely to see any economically viable substitutes for these metals. It is believed that total autocatalyst demand for platinum was some 1.5 million ounces in 1989. Palladium supplies to the industry in 1989 amounted to 265 000 ounces. In the same year record amounts of rhodium, a rare metal, far more expensive than platinum, were used in autocatalyst manufacture: autocatalysts accounted for 79 per cent of total rhodium demand of 330 000 ounces, around 56 per cent being supplied by South Africa.\nThe major industrialised countries of the world - spearheaded by the United States, Japan and, most recently, the European Community member states are enacting legislation to apply increasingly stringent auto emission standards, in spite of developments like lean-burn engine technology (which aims at complete petrol combustion), and Ford\u2019s claims (subsequently shown to be exaggerated) regarding a new type of platinum-free, palladium oxidation catalyst, for the foreseeable future platinum/palladium/rhodium catalysts are likely to be the overwhelming choice of motor manufacturers worldwide. Autocatalyst demand, and especially that for the three way converters with their higher unit loadings of precious metal, continues to be encouraging. As a result of the European Parliament\u2019s series of votes in favour of tighter emission controls, 80 per cent of European cars were required to carry three way catalytic converters by 1993.\nJewellery\nToday, around 38 per cent of the world\u2019s platinum finds its way into jewellery. Japan, which accounts for almost half of total free market demand for the metal, is by far the world\u2019s largest consumer of platinum for jewellery fabrication. Japan has traditionally favoured the metal over gold or silver. Elsewhere sales of platinum appear to have improved in other countries in the Far East and climbed steadily in the two major European markets, Italy and Germany.\nInvestment\nPlatinum has established a recognition for itself as a legitimate, complementary holding to gold and silver, primarily in that country, and also the United States and Western Europe. As growing evidence of this Johnson Matthey (UK marketing agents), as well as the Chinese, Australian, Canadian and former USSR governments, all launched platinum coins and medallions on to the market, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the Isle of Man Noble and the Australian Koala dominating the legal tender coin investment sector.\nIndustry\nIn this sector, demand essentially arises out of the servicing of platinum requirements to make up losses incurred in use and through recycling. Any growth, therefore, is largely dependent on the establishment of new capacity, although new applications for PGMs continue to be discovered in a widening range of industries.\nPGMs continue to maintain their long association with the electrical and electronics industry, which accounts for 50 per cent of annual palladium and ruthenium demands. Although traditional usage of PGMs in electrical contacts has declined, the \u2019micro-chip\u2019 era opened up a wide range of novel electronic applications. The use of iridium crucibles at very high temperatures for growing single crystals of specialised electronics materials is but one example demonstrating that PGMs are proving indispensable in many facets of electronics technology.\nIn the chemicals industry, the most important area of application for PGMs is in the production of nitric acid, essential for fertilizer and explosives manufacture and a host of other chemical uses. In the electro-chemical sector, ruthenium and iridium are used to coat electrodes for the production of chlorine, while iridium is employed in petroleum refining and other catalysts.\nPlatinum is essential to the petro-chemical industry. It is used as a reforming catalyst in the production of higher-octane fuels and the more complete exploitation of the various fractions of crude oil World demand for oil is recovering. which is resulting in more platinum and other PGMs such as iridium being needed to top up considerable stocks of reforming and isomerisation catalysts, while upgrading of refining capacity and construction of new isomerisation capacity will lead to greater demand. In addition, as the petroleum industry has pruned much excess capacity, the resultant sale back to the market of platinum recycled from spent catalyst has slowed down.\nPGMs are used in the glass industry in two principal fields - glass fibre, and other optical and high-performance glass. in glass-fibre product/on, the fibres formed as molten glass are extruded through fine bushings. These are invariably made of rhodium/platinum alloys [n the case of optical and high-performance glass used in camera and instrumentation manufacturing, video equipment and television, there is still no substitute for platinum. Other areas of growth for platinum include catalysts for air pollution control, water purification and electrodes for cathodic protection against erosion.\nFinally, motor manufacturers are introducing platinum-tipped spark plugs that offer longer life and improved combustion and fuel efficiency.\nMedicine\nPalladium is rapidly supplanting gold in dentistry. Platinum is used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. In the future PGMs may play a role in fighting viral. bacterial and parasitic infections: they may also come to be used as diagnostic tools.\nFuel cells\nThe clean and efficient fuel cell of the future, in which platinum catalysts are used to convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy, has for some time been seen as the next new major demand sector in the industrial area. Two problems plague further moves to achieve wide commercialisation of fuel-cell systems which utilise a platinum catalyst. Firstly, the current high capital cost of the pro-production units makes them uncompetitive: secondly, proof of reliability can only be achieved through demonstration of the generating plants. It is forecast that there will be an increasing call for these types of cell in specialist applications, such as in the aerospace, defence and leisure industries.\ncopyright 2008\n"}, {"score": 883.8348, "uuid": "80c4250b-2ce9-5268-93bf-4ce46852716d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1608wb-60-21457", "target_hostname": "www.parknationalbank.com", "target_uri": "https://www.parknationalbank.com/Personal/CreditCards/VisaPlatinum/Pages/default.aspx", "page_rank": 1.259558e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Visa <em>Platinum</em>", "snippet": "Please select the service you wish <em>to</em> access.

Never one to whitewash his opinions, Bob confirms that \"when my theories don't match the facts, I revise my theories...\"\nThe Gold Report: When you talked to us in early August, you correctly predicted the market crashing in October. But we've also seen gold go lower since then. When do you think Gold Prices and the market will turn around?\nBob Moriarty, founder of 321gold.com: In terms of the Australian Dollar, the British Pound and the Canadian Dollar, gold has been hitting new record highs, so gold still has its function as the security of last resort. We've had so much deleveraging, with giant hedge funds selling everything they could sell and the only thing left was gold. But the next move in gold is going to be a major move and it's going to be up.\nTGR: When do you see that happening?\nBob Moriarty: October is always a really disastrous month for the market, but I think we've seen the bottom in the general stock market, in gold and in gold shares.\nTGR: Are you saying that we're going to see physical gold, gold shares and the market all increase simultaneously?\nBob Moriarty: Correct.\nTGR: At the same rate?\nBob Moriarty: I don't think so. There's been something like $3.2 trillion poured into the system. When people think back...I mean, this is an absolute disaster. We have taken the entire banking system, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and AIG, out of the hands of the fools on Wall Street who were running them and handed control over to the fools in Washington. That's the scariest thing I've ever heard. If Wall Street couldn't run Fannie Mae, why does Washington, DC think it can?\nTGR: Given that sentiment, why would you expect the stock market to increase?\nBob Moriarty: You constantly run from one extreme to another. You have extremes of emotion on both the bull side and the bear side. If you look back to 1929, there was a giant crash at the end of October. The market recovered 50% of what it lost, but then continued down through 1932. The market goes up and it goes down. From the gold and Gold Mining point of view, the decline is entirely artificial. There are probably 100 gold juniors selling for less than the cash they have on hand. They could close the doors and you'd make a profit.\nTGR: One of the things we're reading as part of the reason gold has fallen is that, amazingly enough, the US Dollar has actually been the currency of choice.\nBob Moriarty: It has been, but you have to understand why the Dollar is going up. I'll go back to my favorite figure \u2013 the $596 trillion outstanding in derivative positions. Maybe 9,000 hedge funds were operating in derivatives as if it was a giant casino and they were using Monopoly money. Once things turned south and interest rates started going up and mortgages started defaulting, they had to deleverage. This meant selling all of the positions they could and paying off the loans. But to do that, they need dollars. So it's entirely artificial.\nIf you look at the rise in the Dollar since September 27, it increased 12% or 13% in one month. Nobody can conduct business when the currency you use goes either up or down that much in a month's time. That's disastrous to business.\nTGR: But it made a fairly rapid downturn earlier in the year. Is going back up now a correction?\nBob Moriarty: The correction is going to be that it will go back down, and I think it's going to be a catastrophic decline. Barron's had a piece recently talking about Taiwan now selling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds and Treasury bonds. If that continues or if other countries start doing it, it will be catastrophic for the Dollar. I think the United States is going to default entirely within the next nine to ten months.\nHere's the situation. The US is bankrupt. As anybody who looks at our debts and obligations should be aware, sooner or later we're going to have to declare bankruptcy.\nTGR: Why wouldn't we just print more money to pay our way out of it?\nBob Moriarty: If you go into a store and put down $100 bill and the guy says, \"We don't take $100 bills,\" what do you do?\nTGR: You pull out your credit card.\nBob Moriarty: What if he doesn't take your credit card? Here's the flaw and there's some really scary things going on that nobody thinks about. The US government incurred about $3.2 trillion worth of obligations in the last month and to my knowledge, not a single person asked the really simple question, \"Where's the money going to come from?\"\nThere are only three choices. You take it from the taxpayer in taxes and that's not an alternative. Or you borrow it from the Chinese and that's not an alternative. Or you print it \u2013 but you can only print it as long as people are willing to accept it. The Middle East has already started to talk about not wanting to use the US Dollar anymore in currency transactions. It's too dangerous. So we're a lot closer to a default than anybody in government wants to admit.\nTGR: If we default, what's the impact on the worldwide market?\nBob Moriarty: Strangely enough, the worldwide market's going to be fine. The US can become a third-world nation. Everybody acts as if US consumers are the only consumers in the world. Well, the Chinese can consume and the Japanese can consume and the Europeans can consume. For the last 60 years, since Bretton Woods, we in the US have been able to consume by writing checks that we had no intention whatsoever of paying and the rest of the world has woken up to the fact that they're paying for our excess. We're waging a $3 trillion war in Iraq; we don't pay for it; the rest of the world does. We borrowed every cent. And will never pay it back.\nTGR: If the US defaults, though, and so many of our bonds are held offshore, those then become illiquid or worth nothing. Wouldn't that have an impact on the worldwide economy?\nBob Moriarty: Yes, but it will only be a temporary thing. If your brother-in-law is a crack addict, he doesn't have a job, and his home goes into foreclosure, it's bad. But it happens. Businesses go bankrupt and countries go bankrupt. Essentially, Iceland went bankrupt a few weeks ago.\nTGR: And some of the South American countries have waived their debt entirely...\nBob Moriarty: Argentina did it in 2002. They're on the verge of doing it again. Believe it or not, Kuwait is on the verge of going bankrupt. It is really bizarre. And it all goes back to derivatives being totally out of control and everyone believing that it was $596 trillion worth of value when, in fact, it was a giant shell game.\nTGR: Given your prediction, how does that jibe with the stock market increasing? Are we going to rise through the next nine months until we go bankrupt or what?\nBob Moriarty: Yes. Bonds are paper assets, nothing but a promise of payment. Stocks are not paper assets; when you own a stock, you own a real percentage of a company that hopefully is doing something productive.\nInflation is not prices increasing, which is what we've been led to believe for many years. Inflation is actually an increase in the money supply. When you start increasing money supply the way the US government has over the last month, it results in higher prices for real goods. So you can have this situation where the stock market is increasing in nominal terms but could actually be losing in real terms.\nGovernments always have two different ways to destroy their currency. They can do it through deflation, which is what we're going through right now, or they can do it through inflation. The government's doing their best to inflate the Dollar and it will go into hyper-inflation. That is just bizarre to me. An increase of $3.2 trillion in the money supply inside a month...? That's a lot.\nYou have to deal with a real currency under real rules and real management and provide real products to people who really intend to pay for them. When you get away from that, you create maladjustments or 'mal-investments'. There was an enormous investment in US real estate because real interest rates were actually negative. You could borrow 100% of the value of a home.\nEverybody in the system encouraged people to do this, so they did it. Then instead of getting rid of some of that mal-investment, the US government comes in and says, \"We'll take the very worst cases of management, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and AIG, and reward them for doing stupid things.\" Well, that doesn't make any sense; it just makes it worse. Everybody on Wall Street's still going to be getting their Christmas bonus this year, but now it's courtesy of the American taxpayer.\nTGR: If you have anything left in your portfolio, how do you begin to prepare for the scenario you're laying out, a potential default by the US government?\nBob Moriarty: You stay away from US obligations entirely. A lot of people like Richard Russell [of the Dow Theory Letters] have recommended for years that in times of calamity you go for T-bills and gold. T-bills will be totally worthless someday. No fiat currency lasts forever. They're not real. I'm suggesting that the financial chaos we're in now is far worse than anybody can anticipate, even me. And a default by the US government actually would be a good thing because then we could and sit down and say, \"Okay, what caused this in the first place? And secondly, what do we need to prevent it from happening again?\"\nThe solution is quite simple. That's to go back to a Gold Standard. But if you go back to a gold standard, you have to have much less government. That would be a really good thing.\nTGR: Given that we're already on a fiat currency and can print more, will our ship just go down with the presses rolling or will it extend itself longer \u2013 a slow sinking as opposed to diving straight to the bottom?\nBob Moriarty: There's a really good chance of a catastrophic failure with some of the things that are happening in the Middle East now. There could be a catastrophic freeze-up of the banking system, and they could just close the banks worldwide and say, \"Okay, we'll shut everything down for two weeks and sort it out.\" There's a lot of pressure from France and China to fix the problem. I find it very encouraging that people are calling for a new Bretton Woods, because that is the solution \u2013 to go back and fix what Bretton Woods didn't do correctly in the first place. And that was to provide an honest gold system.\nTGR: Refresh us a bit on Bretton Woods...\nBob Moriarty: In 1944, representatives of the 44 free countries in the Allies sat down to establish a financial system for economic post-war rebuilding. They met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Their agreement tied the supply of US Dollars to gold, and all of the other currencies when then tied to the Dollar in fixed exchange rates. It made the Dollar literally as good as gold, so all of the other currencies were as good as gold as long as the Dollar was good.\nBut then we started inflating the currency because we could. We also exported our inflation to other countries. And then the Vietnam War came along and in 1971 Richard Nixon told foreign governments they could no longer exchange dollars for gold. What they should have done at Bretton Woods was to have everybody go to a gold currency \u2013 and instead of issuing pesos or francs or reals or dollars, issue units in terms of gold. That way, everybody's one bank-notes would be equal to a fixed quantity of gold, and you would have had total interchangeability among currencies.\n1\n"}, {"score": 880.2368, "uuid": "e6769197-7f9a-5204-87a3-bc6c8938b771", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000wb-04-14889", "target_hostname": "www.banknewport.com", "target_uri": "https://www.banknewport.com/mortgages/equal-housing-lender/", "page_rank": 1.6646912e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Equal</em> Housing Lender - BankNewport", "snippet": "We do Business in Accordance with Federal Fair Lending Laws UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT, IT <em>IS</em> ILLEGAL, ON THE BASIS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, HANDICAP, OR FAMILIAL STATUS (Having Children Under The Age of 18), <em>TO</em>: * Deny a loan for the purpose of purchasing, constructing", "explanation": null, "document": "Equal Housing Lender\nWe do Business in Accordance with Federal Fair Lending Laws\nUNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT, IT IS ILLEGAL, ON THE BASIS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, HANDICAP, OR FAMILIAL STATUS (Having Children Under The Age of 18), TO:\nDeny a loan for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or deny any loan secured by a dwelling: or\nDiscriminate in fixing the amount, interest rate, duration, application procedure or other terms or conditions of such a loan, or in appraising property.\nIF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, YOU SHOULD SEND A COMPLAINT TO:\nAssistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\nWashington, DC 20410\nFor processing under the Federal Fair Housing Act\nAND TO:\n1100 Walnut St, Box #11\nKansas City, Missouri 64106\nFor processing under FDIC Regulations\nUNDER THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT, IT IS ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE IN ANY CREDIT TRANSACTION:\nOn the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, or age;\nBecause income is from public assistance, or\nBecause a right was exercised under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\nIF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, YOU SHOULD SEND A COMPLAINT TO:\nFDIC Consumer Response Center\n1100 Walnut St, Box #11\nKansas City, Missouri 64106\n\u00a9 2011-2012 BankNewport.

Wesbury\nIt was a Fed-watchers delight when Ben Bernanke told the US Congress that there would be no QE3 and that the next move by the Fed would be to tighten monetary policy.\nOops!\u00a0That\u2019s not what he said.\u00a0There were no quotable quotes to that effect.\u00a0In fact, lots of people thought he said the opposite.\u00a0A Wall Street Journal headline read Recovery Worries Weigh on Stocks, as \u201cBernanke took a cautious view of the U.S. recovery.\u201d\u00a0The Washington Post said \u201cBernanke Strikes Cautious Tone\u2026.\u201d\u00a0If you take these headlines at face value, Bernanke was dour and his testimony was about a weak economy and the potential for more ease.\nBut the gold market did not miss the message \u2013 gold futures fell $77 yesterday.\u00a0And stocks were down on disappointment about the potential for more quantitative easing (QE3).\u00a0We agree with gold and read the testimony in the opposite way of the popular press.\nBernanke\u2019s testimony actually showed incredulity at the strength of the economy.\u00a0He explained that job growth has been strong, but then said that the \u201cdecline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been somewhat more rapid than might have been expected.\u201d\u00a0The Fed is still stuck in the potential GDP trap.\u00a0It believes the economy is well below its potential and not growing at its trend.\u00a0As a result, the Fed is surprised that inflation remains above its forecasts, and it is incredulous that job growth has been strong.\nMany look to the Fed for the final word on the economy and, therefore, this incredulity is interpreted as a dour outlook.\u00a0In fact, the Fed, along with many forecasters, has been way too pessimistic on the US economy.\u00a0But the data keeps coming in more strongly than the Fed thinks it should and it can no longer deny it.\nWhat this means is that Bernanke cannot possibly justify QE3.\u00a0He wants to justify it, but he can\u2019t.\u00a0This can be understood clearly by analyzing an answer to a question in the House Financial Services Committee, when Bernanke said \u201cit is arguable that interest rates are too high, that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates can\u2019t go below zero.\u201d\nWhat he is talking about here is that some Taylor Rule-type-estimates say that the federal funds rate should be negative.\u00a0These models use GDP relative to potential, unemployment relative to the natural rate and a target inflation rate, to estimate the correct target for short-term interest rates.\u00a0But because rates can\u2019t go below zero, the Fed wants to do more quantitative easing.\nThis raises an important dilemma for anyone who does not view the world through models alone.\u00a0If the necessary interest rate really is negative, but rates cannot go below zero, then how is the economy growing?\u00a0The Fed says it is growing because of QE1 and QE2.\u00a0We seriously doubt this proposition because there has been no QE3 and the economy and stock market are both doing better.\u00a0Moreover, even though the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has grown, M2 has not accelerated.\u00a0Please see charts above, which show the monetary base and M2 relative to a 6% growth line.\u00a0 We borrow these charts from our good friend Scott Grannis, the Calafia Beach Pundit .\u00a0 They show that QE, which has boosted the monetary base, has not created a surge in M2.\u00a0The monetary base has exploded, but M2 has not, and if M2 is not rapidly expanding, then QE has not boosted the money supply.\nThe bottom line is that even though Bernanke wants to make the case for QE3, he can\u2019t.\u00a0In fact, better news on the economy has cut the Fed off from doing more massive easing projects.\u00a0In the end, we believe the Fed has finally run out of justification for its excessively easy monetary policy.\u00a0As the quarters ahead unfold, the prospects of more ease will continue to wane.\u00a0This is good news for stocks \u2013 which do not do well with accelerating inflation \u2013 but, it is bad news for gold.\u00a0Gold is done\u2026.and so is the Fed.\nClick here for a printable version.\nPosted on Thursday, March 01, 2012 @ 3:34 PM \u2022 Post Link\nShare:\nThese posts were prepared by First Trust Advisors L.

To be sure, there is a dizzying array of options from owning and storing the physical metal yourself to buying junior mining stocks. But the current crisis of confidence, brought on by the collapse of institutions that nobody thought could fail and the most recent $50 billion Ponzi scheme , has investors looking at safety and wealth preservation more than ever.\nBuying physical gold and silver gives the owner definite possession, but comes with high premiums and the necessity to store and protect the metal. This can be done via a bank safe deposit box, but adds to the cost of owning the metal and doesn\u2019t provide total peace of mind for many investors that have lost trust in the banking system. Others might prefer to store the gold on their property, hiding it in the floorboards or purchasing a safe. But this potentially puts you and your family members in harm\u2019s way and again does not offer 100% security.\nFor investors that prefer not to hold the physical gold, yet place a high value on the safety of their investment vehicle not to default, I recommend the Central Trust of Canada ( CEF ) or its all-gold counterpart, the Central Gold Trust ( GTU ). Unlike the popular ETFs such as GLD and SLV , these funds do not lease out your gold and they always maintain 90% or more of assets in unencumbered, segregated and insured, passive long-term holdings of gold and silver bullion. Trace Mayer of Runtogold.com, recently published an article detailing the risk of investing in GLD and SLV . James Turk and others have also covered the unanswered questions about these ETFs in earlier articles .\nSetting itself apart from the competition, the stated investment policy of the Board of Directors requires Central Fund to maintain a minimum of 90% of its net assets in gold and silver bullion of which at least 85% must be in physical form. On July 31, 2008, 97.6% of Central Fund\u2019s net assets were invested in gold and silver bullion. Of this bullion, 99.3% was in physical form and 0.7% was in certificate form.\nCentral Fund\u2019s bullion is stored on an allocated and fully segregated basis in the underground vaults of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, one of the major Canadian banks, which insures its safekeeping. Bullion holdings and bank vault security are inspected twice annually by directors and/or officers of Central Fund. On every occasion, inspections are required to be performed in the presence of both Central Fund\u2019s external auditors and bank personnel. Central Fund\u2019s chief executive comments:\n\u201cOur bullion is stored in separate cages, with the name of the owner printed on the cage, and on top of each pallet of bullion it states Central Fund or Central Gold-Trust. This disables the bank from using the asset from any of their purposes. We also pay Lloyds of London for coverage of any possible loss.\u201d\nAdding to investor peace of mind, CEF has been around since 1961, is based outside of the U.S. (Calgary, Canada) and is run by a board that is respected in the precious metals community, not a bunch of corrupt Wall Street cronies. Demonstrating transparency that is much needed in today\u2019s investment climate, Central Fund makes regular trips to visit the assets and takes their auditors with them. And you get the sense that you are dealing with honest gold investors and not slick marketing or public relations specialists by taking a quick perusal of the CEF website . While they aren\u2019t going to win any design awards, the website is packed with all of the investor information necessary for due diligence.\nOn the downside, CEF does come with a hefty premium (currently at 16% to NAV). But this premium is less than the premium you are likely to pay on physical bullion, so it is a non-issue for me. And while it is a greater premium than GLD or SLV, I am willing to pay it since I have about as much faith in those ETFs as I do in the Comex.\nTax implications are another deciding factor. When filing your taxes , Ian McAvity, founding director and advisor to CEF, said there are definite advantages to CEF as opposed to an open-ended ETF. Long term gains in the gold ETFs (and presumably Barclays\u2019 silver ETF) would be taxed as collectibles at 28%, according to the Gold ETF prospectus. As a passive foreign investment company with shares not convertible into bullion, CEF is believed to qualify as a PFIC to enable the 15% capital gains tax treatment, which can be an important factor for investors with long-term ambitions and taxable accounts, said McAvity.\nLastly, we should consider the performance of the various investment options. Year-to-date CEF underperformed by 3 points versus GLD, but this is largely due to the silver exposure. A more fair comparison would be to use Central Gold Trust ( GTU ). GTU significantly outperformed GLD (14 point gap), which should ease any concerns investors have about a higher premium. CEF and GTU offer not only more peace of mind, but better returns compared to the \u201ctrust us, the gold/silver is there\u201d approach from iShares (SLV) or SPDR (GLD). It is also interesting to note that the Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is the worst performer year-to-date. This could change as precious metals prices take off in 2009, but I am inclined to park at least half of my gold/silver investments in a safer place than stocks or funds that can\u2019t prove that they actually have physical gold to back my investment dollars. Year-to-date returns are as follows:\nWhile GTU has outperformed CEF during 2008, I expect silver to outperform gold during the next upleg and thus I own and favor CEF for 2009. Regardless, both of these funds represent sound investment choices during a time when there are fewer and fewer safe places to park your assets.

The Bushveld Complex is a geological wonder of the world and accounts for 79% of the world's platinum production. Two layers or \"reefs\" are mined for platinum around the rim of the large (350 kilometres across) salad bowl shaped body. The two layers are known as the Merensky reef, named after Hans Merensky who discovered the extraordinary layered properties in 1926, and UG2 reef named for the Upper Group Two layer. These two layers are mined over approximately one metre thickness around the Bushveld Complex. The layers typically dip 10-20 degrees towards the centre of the bowl and are mined up to approximately 2,000 metres vertically below the surface. The edges of the intrusion are broken into three limbs; the North Limb, the East Limb, and the West Limb. The West Limb contains twelve mines producing 4.5 million ounces of platinum, or 70% of the world's total production, in 2004.\ncapital costs - the costs to set up and build a project, usually ending with the achievement of a specific set of startup milestones in the case of a mine.\nchalcopyrite - a copper sulfide mineral\nchannel sample is a surface sample which has been collected by continuous sampling across a measured interval, and is considered to be representative of the area sampled\nchargeability - a measure of electrical capacitance of a rock that may indicate the presence of disseminated sulfide minerals.

A joint venture is usually governed by a management committee composed of all of the parties. One of the parties is nominated as the operator and is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the joint venture and reporting to the management committee. Commonly the joint venture is governed by a vote of management committee where the votes cast are a proportion of their percentage interest in the joint venture. Joint ventures also usually provide for the dilution, or reduction in interest, of one of the parties should it elect not to contribute to the ongoing business of the joint venture.\nkm - kilometre\nlayered intrusive - an intrusive rock that has cooled slowly enough and in such a way that the minerals contained in the intrusive crystallize, settle, and harden into layers of different mineralogical and chemical compositions. This process is important in the formation of some of the world's key platinum group element deposits, however there are many layered intrusives that contain no significant platinum group elements\nlode mining - mining in solid rock\nm - metres\nmafic - rock type consisting of predominantly iron and magnesium silicate minerals with little quartz or feldspar minerals\nmagmatic - pertaining to magma, a naturally occurring silicate melt, which may contain suspended silicate crystals, dissolved gases, or both; magmatic processes are at work under the earth's crust\nMerensky Reef - the key platinum producing layer of the Bushveld intrusive complex identified by Hans Merensky in the 1920's.\nmid-stage exploration property - one hosting a known zone of mineralization, which has been subjected to a limited amount of physical testing and systematic exploration work\nmineralization - the minerals of value occurring in rocks.\nmineral reserves - classified as probable and proven, the classifications are as set out by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. Mineral reserves are supported by an economic assessment and a feasibility study that demonstrate they can be mined profitably.\nmineral resources - classified as inferred, indicated, and measured, the definitions of the classifications are as used by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. Inferred to measured resources have increasing degrees of competence and in order to be a resource mineralized material must have a reasonable expectation of potentially being mined profitably, although at the resource stage this is not supported by a feasibility study.\nMo - molybdenum, a hard, silver-white metal.\nnet present value or \"NPV\" - a future stream of benefits and costs converted into equivalent values today. This is done by assigning monetary values to the benefits and costs discounting future benefits and costs using appropriate discount rate and subtracting a sum total of discounted costs from the total at discounted benefits.\nNi - nickel\nNSR - Net Smelter Royalty\noperating costs - the costs of operating a mine, usually including all onsite costs of mining, milling, storing concentrate, and administration. Typically quoted in Rand per tonne or $/tonne. Major sustaining capital items such as mill expansion or large underground development during the life of a project are excluded.\nore - a natural occurrence of one or more minerals that may be mined and sold at a profit, or from which some part may be profitably separated. The word ore should only be used in situations where: an extensive study of the deposit resources is complete, commercial processes to extract the minerals have been designed for the specific deposit, all of the capital and operating cost and environmental issues have been estimated by qualified persons\noutcrop - an exposure of rock at the earth's surface\noverburden - any material covering or obscuring rocks from view\nPd - palladium\nPGE - mineralization containing platinum group elements, i.e. platinum and palladium\nPGM - platinum group metals, i.e. platinum, palladium, rhoduim, ruthenium, osmium, iridium.\nPilanesberg Complex - a specific intrusive body of rock approximately 30 kilometres across that is younger than and crosscuts the Bushveld Complex.\nplacer mining - the mining of unconsolidated material which overlies solid rock (bedrock)\nplatinum group metals or PGMs include platinum, palladium, rhodium, osmium, ruthenium, and iridium, which are also known as the platinum group elements or PGEs.

The pre-feasibility study is usually completed by an independent engineering group and makes a forecast of potential capital, operating, sustaining capital, and reclamation costs for the project. The pre-feasibility study also includes a projected cash flow from the project using recovery rates for the metal from the metallurgical test work concluded and assumptions on future metal prices, exchange rates and economic conditions.\nPt - platinum\npyrite - an iron sulfide mineral\npyroxenite - a relatively uncommon dark-coloured rock consisting chiefly of pyroxene; pyroxene is a type of rock containing sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, titanium and aluminum combined with oxygen\nquartz - a common rock-forming mineral (SiO2)\nreclamation - the process of environmental remediation during and after mining and milling takes place.\nrecovery rates - the percentage of valuable minerals that are recovered in the milling and processing and captured for potential payment, after shipment to the smelter.\nreef - a mineral layer containing economic mineralization of interest; usually flat and tabular.\nRh - rhodium, a platinum metal. Rhodium shares some of the notable properties of platinum, including its resistance to corrosion, its hardness and ductility. Wherever there is platinum in the earth, there is rhodium as well.

The precious metals, such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium, are usually quoted in troy ounces while most of our measurements (in the U.S.) are in the avoirdupois system.\nIn the troy system, the grain is the same as in the avoirdupois system and the pound contains 12 ounces, 240 pennyweights, or 5,760 grains. In the avoirdupois system, the pound contains 16 ounces or 7,000 grains. Note that while an avoirdupois pound weighs more than a troy pound, a troy ounce weighs more than an avoirdupois ounce.

This is helpful when reading old reports which give dollar amounts for how much gold was found but not weights. Many times an average amount found per miner is given in dollars and cents which is not meaningful unless one knows the prices at that time. The following data is summarized from What Was the Price of Gold Then? by Lawrence H. Officer, Economic History Resources, EH.Net, 2002. The following only gives the official U.S. prices and not the free market prices since this is only for historical information and until recent years, the prices quoted in documents were usually the official price. The link noted above also gives free market prices as well as background information.\nU.S. Gold Prices 1786 - 2001\nYears\n(dollars per fine ounce Troy)\n(end of year)\n"}, {"score": 871.43835, "uuid": "eae64357-d4f6-5041-9fbb-228994e36904", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000wb-33-13070", "target_hostname": "www.platinumgroupmetals.net", "target_uri": "http://www.platinumgroupmetals.net/news_releases/index.php?&content_id=142", "page_rank": 1.1744384e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "News Releases | <em>Platinum</em> Group Metals", "snippet": "PPRust reports open pit reserves of 332 million tonnes grading 2.67 g&#x2F;t 4 PGE&#x27;&#x27;s (<em>platinum</em>, palladium, rhodium and <em>gold</em>) (<em>equal</em> <em>to</em> approximately 28 million ounces at .08 ounces per tonne) and resources of 718 million tonnes grading 2.79 g&#x2F;t (0.08 ounces per tonne, Source: Anglo <em>Platinum</em> Annual Report", "explanation": null, "document": "Exploration Encouraging On The Northern Limb\nSeptember 17, 2003\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd. (PTM-TSXV) is pleased to announce that early exploration work at the company''s Tweespalk Property in the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex has been encouraging. The next step in the exploration program is detailed trench sampling and that work is expected to commence immediately. The initial sampling work in rock and soil has identified elevated platinum, palladium, nickel and copper values in the area near where ground mapping and airborne geophysical surveys have identified the target Platreef contact area.\nGrab rock samples taken from the first mapping efforts include assays from background to 0.62 g/t platinum, palladium and gold (0.193 g/t Pt, 0.378 Pd, 0.049 g/t Au). The outcrop sampled is likely more than 100 meters west or above the target basal contact of the Bushveld intrusive. Soil sampling has identified areas on three lines with anomalous platinum, palladium, nickel and copper values (more than 20 ppb Pt+Pd, more than 50 ppm nickel and more than 100 ppm copper). Grid lines were spaced 400 metres apart. Some areas of the property could not be well tested with soil sampling as a result of transported overburden cover. As a result the anomalous areas remain open for testing with drilling and trenching techniques.\nThe Tweespalk Property is in between three known platinum deposits along the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex. Tweespalk is 25 kilometres north along trend from the Anglo Platinum PPRust open pit platinum mine. PPRust reports open pit reserves of 332 million tonnes grading 2.67 g/t 4 PGE''s (platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold) (equal to approximately 28 million ounces at .08 ounces per tonne) and resources of 718 million tonnes grading 2.79 g/t (0.08 ounces per tonne, Source: Anglo Platinum Annual Report 2002). The Tweespalk Property is located about 17 kilometres north of Anooraq''s Drenthe Farm, which is reported to have an inferred mineral resource of 99.4 million tonnes 1.31 g/t 4 PGE''s and 0.16% nickel, 0.10% copper. Tweespalk is located 23 kilometres south of the Nonnenwerth Deposit previously drilled by Genmin (Impala Platinum) of 50 million tonnes of 1.19 g/t 4 platinum and palladium and 0.07% nickel and 0.21% copper.\nThe Tweespalk property covers 2,177 hectares over approximately 3 kilometres of the Platreef trend. The northern limb of the Bushveld Complex has seen a dramatic increase in exploration activity and interest over the past year with the recognition of the potential for bulk minable platinum by open pit methods along the trend. African Minerals Ltd., a private company controlled by Robert Friedland, has focused further attention in the area as a result of large scale drilling programs. Anooraq Resources Corp, another Canadian based public company, has also conducted large drilling programs in the area. The Anooraq -- Anglo Platinum joint venture property, surrounds PTM''s Tweespalk property.\nPTM can acquire up to a 100% interest in the Tweespalk property under terms announced June 3, 2002.\nPTM also holds an option to purchase the War Springs Property located on trend approximately 7 kilometres south of the African Minerals'' project.\nPTM RSA has entered into a joint venture agreement with a black empowerment company, Africa Wide Mining -- a subsidiary of Africa Wide Investments Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement Africa Wide can participate for up to 30% in the Tweespalk and War Spring projects through an industry standard participating joint venture agreement. The joint venture with Africa Wide immediately exceeds the participation targets of the new Mining Charter of \"26% in ten years time\". Africa Wide brings significant legal and community consultation expertise to the joint venture.\nQualified Person\nR. Michael Jones, P.Eng is acting as the Qualified Person, \"QP\" for Platinum Group Metals RSA Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of PTM, for this and following releases on the Tweespalk Project, until a project geologist has been assigned. He is registered with the Professional Engineers of Ontario. Information on regional deposits has been acquired from public information and is believed to be reliable.\nABOUT PTM\nPTM is based in Vancouver BC, Canada and has active exploration programs in Canada and South Africa. The Company was founded in 2000 with the vision of tight physical markets for platinum group elements and the corresponding anticipated increase the value of platinum mineral rights and resources by 2005.\nPTM holds significant mineral rights in the northern and western Bushveld and is planning to continue its acquisition of mineral rights in South Africa and the Bushveld Complex. The Company''s activity in the western Bushveld has also been in the news recently. The Company is supportive of the new initiatives of the government of South Africa in the Mineral Bill and Mining Charter.\nPTM is the largest mineral rights holders in the area surrounding Canada''s only primary platinum and palladium mine near Thunder Bay, Ontario and PTM has a separate active joint venture with Anglo Platinum, the world''s largest producer of platinum, near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.\nOn behalf of the Board of\nPlatinum Group Metals Ltd.\n"}, {"score": 868.2374, "uuid": "f80d66f8-e96b-5d55-9a48-8204a63039de", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-99-22158", "target_hostname": "www.inchem.org", "target_uri": "http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc125.htm", "page_rank": 1.1719263e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Platinum</em> (EHC 125, 1991)", "snippet": "lustre on In dentistry, <em>platinum</em> <em>is</em> used in <em>gold</em>-<em>platinum</em>-palladium alloys <em>to</em> raise the melting-point range and increase the strength.", "explanation": null, "document": "INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMME ON CHEMICAL SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 125 Platinum This report contains the collective views of an international group of\r\n    experts and does not necessarily represent the decisions or the stated\r\n    policy of the United Nations Environment Programme, the International\r\n    Labour Organisation, or the World Health Organization.\r\n\r\n    Published under the joint sponsorship of\r\n    the United Nations Environment Programme,\r\n    the International Labour Organisation,\r\n    and the World Health Organization\r\n\r\n    First draft prepared by Dr. G.

SUMMARY 1.1  Identity, physical and chemical properties, analytical methods Platinum (Pt) is a malleable, ductile, silvery-white noble\r\n    metal with the atomic number 78 and an atomic weight of 195.09. It\r\n    occurs naturally mainly as the isotopes 194Pt (32.9%), 195Pt\r\n    (33.8%), and 196Pt (25.3%). In platinum compounds the maximum\r\n    oxidation state is +6, while the states +2 and +4 are the most\r\n    stable.\r\n\r\n         The metal does not corrode in air at any temperature, but can\r\n    be affected by halogens, cyanides, sulfur, molten sulfur compounds,\r\n    heavy metals, and hydroxides. Digestion with aqua regia or Cl2/HCl\r\n    (concentrated hydrochloric acid through which chlorine is bubbled)\r\n    produces hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6], an important\r\n    platinum complex. When heated the ammonium salt of\r\n    hexachloroplatinic acid produces a grey platinum sponge. A\r\n    dispersive, black powder (\"platinum black\") results from reduction\r\n    in aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n         The chemistry of platinum compounds in aqueous solution is\r\n    dominated by the complex compounds. Many of the salts, particularly\r\n    those with halogen- or nitrogen-donor ligands, are water-soluble.\r\n    Platinum, like the other platinum-group metals, has a pronounced\r\n    tendency to react with carbon compounds, especially alkenes and\r\n    alkynes, forming Pt(II) coordination complexes.\r\n\r\n         There are various analytical methods for the determination of\r\n    platinum. Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and plasma emission\r\n    spectroscopy provide high selectivity and specificity and are the\r\n    method of choice for analysing platinum in biotic and environmental\r\n    samples. With these methods detection limits of a few \u00b5g/kg or\r\n    \u00b5g/litre have been obtained for various media.\r\n\r\n         Inductively coupled argon plasma atomic emission spectroscopy\r\n    is superior to electrothermal AAS because of lower matrix effects\r\n    and the possibility of simultaneous multi-element analysis. 1.2  Sources of human and environmental exposure The average concentration of platinum in the lithosphere or\r\n    rocky crust of the earth is estimated to be in the region of\r\n    0.001-0.005 mg/kg. Platinum is found either in the metallic form or\r\n    in a number of mineral forms. Economically important sources exist\r\n    in the Republic of South Africa and in the USSR. The platinum\r\n    content of these deposits is 1-500 mg/kg. In Canada, platinum-group\r\n    metals (platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, ruthenium)\r\n    are found in copper-nickel sulfide ores at an average concentration\r\n    of 0.3 mg/kg, but are concentrated to above 50 mg/kg during the\r\n\r\n    refining of copper and nickel. Small amounts are mined in the USA,\r\n    Ethiopia, the Philippines, and in Colombia.\r\n\r\n         World mine production of platinum-group metals, of which 40-50%\r\n    is platinum, has steadily increased during the last two decades. In\r\n    1971, production was 127 tonnes (51-64 tonnes of platinum).\r\n    Following the introduction of the automobile exhaust gas catalyst,\r\n    world mine production of platinum-group metals increased to\r\n    approximately 270 tonnes (108-135 tonnes of platinum) in 1987. In\r\n    1989, total platinum demand in the western world was approximately\r\n    97 tonnes.\r\n\r\n         The principal use of platinum derives from its exceptional\r\n    catalytic properties. Further industrial applications relate to\r\n    other outstanding properties, particularly resistance to chemical\r\n    corrosion over a wide temperature range, high melting point, high\r\n    mechanical strength, and good ductility. Platinum is also used in\r\n    jewellery and dentistry.\r\n\r\n         Specific complexes of platinum, particularly cis- diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin), are used\r\n    therapeutically.a Data on emissions of platinum to the environment from\r\n    industrial sources are not available. During the use of platinum-\r\n    containing catalysts, some platinum may escape into the environment,\r\n    depending on the type of catalyst. Of the stationary catalysts used\r\n    in industry, only those used for ammonia oxidation emit significant\r\n    amounts of platinum.\r\n\r\n         Automobile catalysts are mobile sources of platinum. According\r\n    to limited data, platinum attrition from the old pellet-type\r\n    catalyst is between 0.8 and 1.9 \u00b5g per km travelled. About 10% of\r\n    the platinum is water-soluble. a This monograph is specifically concerned with platinum and\r\n         selected platinum compounds of occupational and/or\r\n         environmental importance. A detailed discussion of the toxic\r\n         effects of the anticancer drug cisplatin and its analogues in\r\n         humans and animals is beyond the selected scope of the\r\n         Environmental Health Criteria series as these substances are\r\n         used primarily as therapeutic agents. In addition, their toxic\r\n         properties are exceptional compared to those of other platinum\r\n         compounds.\r\n\r\n         With the new generation of monolith-type catalyst, results from\r\n    engine test stand experiments with a three-way catalyst indicate\r\n    that total platinum emission is lower by a factor of 100-1000 than\r\n    in the case of pellet-type catalysts. At simulated speeds of 60,\r\n    100, and 140 km/h, total platinum emission was found to be between 3\r\n    and 39 ng/m3 in the exhaust gas, corresponding to about 2-39 ng\r\n    per km travelled. The mean aerodynamic diameter of emitted particles\r\n    was between 4 and 9 \u00b5m in different test runs. There is limited\r\n    evidence that most of the platinum emitted is in the form of the\r\n    metal or surface-oxidized particles. 1.3  Environmental transport, distribution, and transformation Platinum-group metals are rare in the environment, in\r\n    comparison with other elements. In highly industrialized areas,\r\n    elevated amounts of platinum can be found in river sediments. It is\r\n    assumed that organic matter, e.g., humic and fulvic acids, binds\r\n    platinum, aided perhaps by appropriate pH and redox potential\r\n    conditions in the aquatic environment.\r\n\r\n         In soil, the mobility of platinum depends on the pH, redox\r\n    potential, chloride concentrations of soil water, and the mode of\r\n    occurrence of platinum in the primary rock. It is considered that\r\n    platinum will be mobile only in extremely acid conditions or in soil\r\n    water with a high chloride content.\r\n\r\n         In in vitro test systems it has been demonstrated that some\r\n    platinum(IV) complexes, in the presence of platinum(II), can be\r\n    methylated by bacterial methylcobalamin under abiotic conditions. 1.4  Environmental levels and human exposure The data base concerning environmental concentrations is\r\n    extremely limited due to the very low levels of platinum in the\r\n    environment and the associated analytical problems.\r\n\r\n         Concentrations in ambient air samples taken near freeways in\r\n    the USA before the introduction of the automobile catalyst were\r\n    below the detection limit of 0.05 pg/m3. Some recent data from\r\n    Germany indicate that close to roads the platinum air concentrations\r\n    (particulate samples) range from < 1 pg/m3 to 13 pg/m3. In\r\n    rural areas the concentrations were of a similar order of magnitude\r\n    (< 0.6 to 1.8 pg/m3).\r\n\r\n         Ambient air concentrations of platinum close to roads resulting\r\n    from the introduction of pellet-type automobile catalysts have been\r\n    estimated on the basis of dispersion models and experimental\r\n    emission data. Estimated platinum concentrations near and on roads\r\n    ranged from 0.005 to 9 ng per m3 for total platinum. As the total\r\n    platinum emission from a monolith-type catalyst is lower, probably\r\n    by a factor of 100 to 1000, than that of a pellet-type catalyst, the\r\n\r\n    platinum concentrations for this type of catalyst would be in the\r\n    picogram to femtogram per m3 range.\r\n\r\n         In roadside dust deposited on broad-leaved plants at various\r\n    sites in California, concentrations of 37-680 \u00b5g per kg dry weight\r\n    were detected. Although the number of samples was limited, the\r\n    results indicate that automotive catalysts release platinum to the\r\n    roadside environment. \r\n\r\n         In plant chamber experiments, grass cultures exposed for four\r\n    weeks to slightly diluted exhaust gas from an engine equipped with a\r\n    three-way catalyst (simulated speed: 100 km/h) contained no platinum\r\n    at a detection limit of 2 ng/g dry weight.\r\n\r\n         Investigations of the platinum concentrations in Lake Michigan\r\n    sediments led to the conclusion that platinum has been deposited\r\n    there over the past 50 years at a fairly uniform rate.\r\n    Concentrations in sediment cores of 1 to 20 cm varied only between\r\n    0.3 and 0.43 \u00b5g/kg dry weight. \r\n\r\n         While no platinum levels have been reported for fresh waters,\r\n    high concentrations (730 to 31 220 \u00b5g/kg dry weight) have been found\r\n    in the sediments of a highly polluted cut-off channel of the Rhine\r\n    river, Germany.\r\n\r\n         Samples of limber pines contained platinum levels ranging\r\n    between non-detectable and 56 \u00b5g/kg (ash weight). However, the\r\n    content of the adjacent soils was in the same range, and no\r\n    accumulation tendency was indicated by these limited data.\r\n\r\n         In isolated samples of plants from an ultrabasic soil, platinum\r\n    levels of 100-830 \u00b5g/kg (dry weight) were found.\r\n\r\n         Sea-water samples have been found to contain between 37 and 332\r\n    pg/litre. In sediment cores from the Eastern Pacific, platinum\r\n    concentrations varied between 1.1 and 3 \u00b5g/kg (dry weight). The\r\n    highest concentration (21.9 \u00b5g per kg) was found in offshore ocean\r\n    sediments. In marine macroalgae, platinum concentrations of between\r\n    0.08 and 0.32 \u00b5g/kg dry weight have been found.\r\n\r\n         Blood platinum levels of 0.1 to 2.8 \u00b5g/litre have been found in\r\n    the general population. In sera from occupationally exposed workers,\r\n    levels of 150 to 440 \u00b5g per litre have been reported.\r\n\r\n         The data base for platinum concentrations at the workplace is\r\n    limited. Due to analytical shortcomings, older data (0.9 to 1700\r\n    \u00b5g/m3) are probably not reliable. However, from these data it can\r\n    be assumed that exposure to platinum salts was higher than the\r\n    occupational exposure limit of 2 \u00b5g/m3 currently adopted by most\r\n    countries. In recent workplace studies, concentrations either below\r\n\r\n    the detection limit of 0.05 \u00b5g/m3 or between 0.08 and 0.1 \u00b5g/m3 have been measured. 1.5  Kinetics and metabolism Following a single inhalation exposure (48 min) to different\r\n    chemical forms of platinum (5-8 mg/m3), most of the inhaled 191Pt was rapidly cleared from the body. This was followed by a\r\n    slower clearance phase during the remaining post-exposure period.\r\n    Ten days after exposure to 191PtCl4, 191Pt(SO4)2, 191PtO2, and 191Pt metal, whole body retention of 191Pt was\r\n    approximately 1, 5, 8, and 6%, respectively, of the initial body\r\n    burden. Most of the 191Pt that was cleared from the lungs by\r\n    mucociliary action and swallowed was excreted via the faeces (half-\r\n    time, 24 h). A small fraction of the 191Pt was detected in the\r\n    urine, indicating that very little was absorbed in the lungs and the\r\n    gastrointestinal tract.\r\n\r\n         In a comparative study on the fate of 191PtCl4 in rats (25\r\n    \u00b5Ci/animal) following different routes of exposure, retention was\r\n    highest after intravenous administration, followed by intratracheal\r\n    exposure. It was lowest after oral administration. Since only a\r\n    minute amount of the 191PtCl4 given orally was absorbed, most of\r\n    it passed through the gastrointestinal tract and was excreted via\r\n    the faeces. After 3 days, less than 1% of the initial dose was\r\n    detected in the whole body. Following intravenous administration, 191Pt was excreted in almost equal quantities in both faeces and\r\n    urine. Elimination was slower than after oral dosing. After 3 days\r\n    whole body retention was about 65%, and after 28 days it was still\r\n    14% of the initial dose. For comparison, after these periods about\r\n    22% and 8%, respectively, were retained by the body following\r\n    intratracheal administration.\r\n\r\n         Principal deposition sites are the kidneys, liver, spleen, and\r\n    adrenals. The high amount of 191Pt found in the kidney shows that\r\n    once platinum is absorbed most of it accumulates in the kidney and\r\n    is excreted in the urine. The lower level in the brain suggests that\r\n    platinum ions cross the blood-brain barrier only to a limited\r\n    extent. \r\n\r\n         In contrast to the water-soluble salts, the insoluble PtO2 was only taken up in minute amounts even though the salt was\r\n    administered in the diet at an extremely high level, which resulted\r\n    in a total platinum consumption of 4308 mg per rat over the 4-week\r\n    period.\r\n\r\n         For both the simple platinum salts and cisplatin, it has been\r\n    established that there is an initial rapid clearance followed by a\r\n    prolonged clearance phase during the remaining post-exposure period,\r\n    and that there is no evidence for markedly different retention\r\n    profiles. However, cisplatin is, due to high chloride concentrations\r\n\r\n    suppressing hydration, very stable in extracellular fluids. This\r\n    explains why it is excreted mainly in the unchanged form. Its\r\n    excretion, in contrast to that of the simple platinum salts, is\r\n    primarily via the urine. 1.6  Effects on laboratory mammals and in vitro test systems The acute toxicity of platinum depends mainly on the platinum\r\n    species. Soluble platinum compounds are much more toxic than\r\n    insoluble ones. For example, oral toxicity to rats (LD50 values)\r\n    decreased in the following order: Na2[PtCl6] (25-50 mg/kg) >\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6] (195-200 mg/kg) > PtCl4 (240 mg/kg) >\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (1010 mg/kg) > PtCl2 (> 2000 mg/kg) >\r\n    PtO2 (> 8000 mg/kg). For the two latter compounds no LD50 could\r\n    be calculated.\r\n\r\n         In skin testing of albino rabbits, PtO2, PtCl2,\r\n    K2[PtCl4], [Pt(NO2)2(NH3)2], Pt(C5H7O2)2 and trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] were graded as non-irritant.\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], (NH4)2[PtCl4], Na2[PtCl6],\r\n    Na2[Pt(OH)6], K2[Pt(CN)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, and cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] appeared to be irritant, but to various\r\n    degrees.\r\n\r\n         In eye irritation tests all tested platinum compounds showed\r\n    irritating effects. Trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] and\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4] were found to be corrosive.\r\n\r\n         Intense breathing difficulties were observed after the\r\n    intravenous injection of chloro-platinum complexes into guinea-pigs\r\n    and rats, presumably due to non-allergic histamine release. This\r\n    nonspecific histamine release has complicated the interpretation of\r\n    both animal and human studies with respect to the diagnosis of\r\n    allergic sensitization.\r\n\r\n         After subcutaneous and intravenous injection of Pt(SO4)2 three times a week for 4 weeks, there was no induction of an\r\n    allergic state, as measured by skin tests (guinea-pigs and rabbits),\r\n    passive transfer, and footpad tests (mice). Administration of\r\n    platinum-egg-albumin complex also failed to sensitize the\r\n    experimental animals. \r\n\r\n         Attempted sensitization of female hooded Lister rats with the\r\n    free salt of ammonium tetrachloroplatinate, (NH4)2[PtCl4],\r\n    applied via the intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intradermal,\r\n    subcutaneous, intratracheal, and footpad routes, together with Bordetella pertussis adjuvant, was unsuccessful, as shown by the\r\n    direct skin test, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) test or a\r\n    radio-allergosorbent test (RAST). However, with platinum-protein\r\n    conjugates positive PCA results have been reported.\r\n\r\n         In Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis) exposed to sodium\r\n    hexachloroplatinate, Na2[PtCl6], by nose-only inhalation at a\r\n    level of 200 \u00b5g/m3, 4 h/day, biweekly for 12 weeks, significantly\r\n    greater pulmonary deficits were observed by comparison with control\r\n    animals. With exposure to ammonium hexachloroplatinate,\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], only concomitant exposure to ozone (2000\r\n    \u00b5g/m3) produced significant skin hypersensitivity and pulmonary\r\n    hyper-reactivity.\r\n\r\n         In oral studies with male Sprague-Dawley rats, the salts\r\n    PtCl4 (182 mg/litre drinking-water) and Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (248\r\n    mg/litre) did not affect normal weight gain within the observation\r\n    period of 4 weeks. With a 3-fold increase in platinum concentration,\r\n    weight gain was reduced by about 20% only during the first week,\r\n    paralleling a 20% decrease in feed and water consumption.\r\n\r\n         Only limited experimental data are available for platinum\r\n    effects on reproduction, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity.\r\n    Pt(SO4)2 (200 mg Pt/kg) caused reduced offspring weight in Swiss\r\n    ICR mice from day 8 to 45 post-partum. The main effect of\r\n    Na2[PtCl6] (20 mg Pt/kg) was a reduced activity level of the\r\n    offspring of mothers exposed on the 12th day of gestation. Solid\r\n    platinum wire or foil is considered to be biologically inert and\r\n    adverse effects following implantation into the uterus of rats and\r\n    rabbits were probably due to the physical presence of a foreign\r\n    object.\r\n\r\n         After intravenous administration of 191PtCl4 to pregnant\r\n    rats (25 \u00b5Ci/animal) on day 18 of gestation, the placental barrier\r\n    was crossed to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n         Several platinum compounds have been found to be mutagenic in a\r\n    number of bacterial systems. In comparative studies cisplatin was\r\n    several times more mutagenic than other tested platinum salts. In in vitro studies with mammalian cells (CHO-HGPT-system), the\r\n    relative mutagenic activity of cis-PtCl2(NH3)2],\r\n    K[PtCl3(NH3)], and [Pt(NH3)3Cl]Cl was 100:9:0.3. The\r\n    mutagenicity of K2[PtCl4] and trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] was\r\n    marginal, whereas [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 was not mutagenic. No\r\n    mutagenic activity was observed for the compounds K2[PtCl4] and\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 in the Drosophila melanogaster sex-linked\r\n    recessive lethal test, a mouse micronucleus test, and the Chinese\r\n    hamster bone marrow test.\r\n\r\n         Except for cisplatin, no experimental data are available for\r\n    the carcinogenicity of platinum and platinum compounds. For\r\n    cisplatin there is sufficient evidence for carcinogenic effects on\r\n    animals. However, cisplatin and its analogues are rather exceptional\r\n    by comparison with other platinum compounds. This is reflected in\r\n    the unique mechanism for their anti-tumour activity. Intrastrand DNA\r\n    cross-links, formed only by the cis isomer at a certain position of\r\n\r\n    guanine, are regarded as reasons for this anti-tumour activity. It\r\n    appears that replication of DNA in cancer cells is impaired, while\r\n    in normal cells the cisplatin lesions on guanine are repaired before\r\n    replication. 1.7  Effects on humans Exposure to platinum salts is mainly confined to occupational\r\n    environments, primarily to platinum metal refineries and catalyst\r\n    manufacture plants.\r\n\r\n         The compounds mainly responsible for platinum salt\r\n    hypersensitivitya are hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6], and\r\n    some chlorinated salts such as ammonium hexachloroplatinate,\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], potassium tetrachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl4],\r\n    potassium hexachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl6], and sodium\r\n    tetrachloroplatinate, Na2[PtCl4]. Complexes where there are no\r\n    halogen ligands coordinated to platinum (\"non-halogenated\r\n    complexes\"), such as K2[Pt(NO2)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 and\r\n    [Pt{(NH2)2CS}4]Cl2, and neutral complexes such as cis- [PtCl2(NH3)2], are not allergenic, since they probably do not\r\n    react with proteins to form a complete antigen.\r\n\r\n         The signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include urticaria,\r\n    contact dermatitis of the skin, and respiratory disorders ranging\r\n    from sneezing, shortness of breath, and cyanosis to severe asthma.\r\n    The latency period from the first contact with platinum to the\r\n    occurrence of the first symptoms varies from a few weeks to several\r\n    years. Once sensitization is established, symptoms tend to become\r\n    worse as long as the workers are exposed in the workplace but\r\n    usually disappear on removal from exposure. However, if long-\r\n    duration exposure occurs after sensitization, individuals may never\r\n    become completely free of symptoms. \r\n\r\n         Although no unequivocal exposure concentration-effect\r\n    relationship can be deduced from the available literature, the risk\r\n    of developing platinum salt sensitivity seems to be correlated with\r\n    exposure intensity. Metallic platinum seems to be non-allergenic.\r\n    With the exception of one single reported case of an alleged contact\r\n    dermatitis from a \"platinum\" ring, no allergic reactions have been\r\n    reported. a The term \"platinosis\" is no longer used for platinum-salt-\r\n         related disease, as it implies a chronic fibrosing lung disease\r\n         such as silicosis. Instead, \"platinum salt allergy\", \"allergy\r\n         to platinum compounds containing reactive halogen ligands\", and\r\n         \"platinum salt hypersensitivity\" (PSH) have been used, the last\r\n         being preferred.\r\n\r\n         The clinical manifestations of platinum salt hypersensitivity\r\n    reflect a true allergic response. The mechanism appears to be a type\r\n    I (IgE mediated) response. The possibility of IgE antibodies to\r\n    platinum chloride complexes developing in sensitive people has been\r\n    assumed on the grounds of in vivo and in vitro tests. It is\r\n    believed that the platinum salts of low relative molecular mass act\r\n    as haptens that combine with serum proteins to form the complete\r\n    antigen.\r\n\r\n         Skin prick tests with dilute concentrations of soluble platinum\r\n    complexes appear to provide reproducible, reliable, reasonably\r\n    sensitive, and highly specific biological monitors of allergenicity.\r\n    The compounds used for routine screening of exposed workers are\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], Na2[PtCl6], and Na2[PtCl4]. The\r\n    sensitivity and reliability of the skin prick test has not been\r\n    achieved by any in vitro test available. In enzyme immunoassays\r\n    and in radioallergosorbent tests (RAST), IgE antibodies specific to\r\n    platinum chloride complexes have been found. Although a correlation\r\n    with the results of prick tests was reported, the applicability of\r\n    RAST for screening purposes was questioned because of its\r\n    nonspecificity.\r\n\r\n         Only limited cross-reactivity between platinum and palladium\r\n    salts has been found in skin testing and RAST. Reactions to the\r\n    platinum-group metals other than platinum have only been seen in\r\n    individuals sensitive to platinum salts.\r\n\r\n         Smoking, atopy, and nonspecific pulmonary hyper-reactivity have\r\n    been associated with platinum salt hypersensitivity and could be\r\n    predisposing factors.\r\n\r\n         For the general population, there is a lack of data on the\r\n    actual exposure situation in countries where the automobile catalyst\r\n    has been introduced. The possible ambient air concentrations,\r\n    estimated on the basis of a few emission data and dispersion models,\r\n    are at least a factor of 10 000 lower than the occupational exposure\r\n    limit value of 1 mg/m3 adopted by some countries for platinum\r\n    metal as total inhalable dust. Since the emitted platinum is most\r\n    probably in the metallic form, the sensitizing potential of platinum\r\n    emissions from automotive catalysts is probably very low. Even if\r\n    part of the platinum emitted was soluble and potentially allergenic,\r\n    the safety margin to the occupational exposure limit for soluble\r\n    platinum salts (2 \u00b5g/m3) would be at least 2000.\r\n\r\n         In a preliminary immunological study, extracts of particulate\r\n    automobile exhaust samples were tested on three human volunteer\r\n    subjects using a skin prick test. No positive response was elicited.\r\n\r\n         No data are available to assess the carcinogenic risk of\r\n    platinum or its salts to humans. With regard to cisplatin, evidence\r\n    for human carcinogenicity is considered inadequate. 1.8  Effects on other organisms in the laboratory and field Simple complexes of platinum have bactericidal effects. The\r\n    discovery that neutral complexes such as cisplatin selectively\r\n    inhibit cell division without reducing cell growth of a variety of\r\n    gram-positive, and especially, of gram-negative bacteria has led to\r\n    their application in medicine as anti-tumour agents.\r\n\r\n         Growth and yield of the green alga Euglena gracilis were\r\n    inhibited by the soluble hexachloroplatinic acid (250, 500, and 750\r\n    \u00b5g/litre) in a laboratory \"microcosm\". Cisplatin caused chlorosis\r\n    and stunted growth in the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes at a\r\n    concentration of 2.5 mg/litre.\r\n\r\n         A 3-week exposure to hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6],\r\n    resulted in an LC50 value of 520 \u00b5g Pt per litre in the\r\n    invertebrate Daphnia magna. At concentrations of 14 and 82\r\n    \u00b5g/litre, reproduction, measured as total number of young, was\r\n    impaired by 16 and 50%, respectively.\r\n\r\n         After short-term exposure to tetrachloroplatinic acid,\r\n    H2[PtCl4], in a static bioassay, 24-, 48-, and 96-h LC50 values of 15.5, 5.2, and 2.5 mg Pt/litre, respectively, were found\r\n    for the coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). General swimming\r\n    activity and opercular movement were affected at 0.3 mg/litre.\r\n    Lesions in the gills and the olfactory organ were noted at 0.3\r\n    mg/litre or more. Concentrations of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/litre had no\r\n    effect. \r\n\r\n         There have been studies on the effects of platinum on\r\n    terrestrial plants, all conducted with soluble platinum chlorides.\r\n    The growth of beans and tomato plants in sand culture was inhibited\r\n    by hexachloroplatinic acid at concentrations of 3 x 10-5 to 15 x\r\n    10-5 mol/kg (5.9-29.3 mg/kg). Of nine horticultural crops grown in\r\n    hydroponic solution with platinum tetrachloride, PtCl4 (0.057,\r\n    0.57, and 5.7 mg Pt/litre), dry weights were significantly reduced\r\n    in tomato, bell pepper, and turnip tops, and in radish roots at the\r\n    highest concentration. At this level, the buds and immature leaves\r\n    of most species became chlorotic. In some of the species the low\r\n    levels of PtCl4 had a stimulatory effect on growth. In addition,\r\n    transpiration was suppressed at the highest platinum concentration,\r\n    probably due to increased stomatal resistance. Growth stimulation\r\n    was also observed at low levels of platinum (0.5 mg Pt/litre),\r\n    administered as potassium tetrachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl4], in\r\n    seedlings of the South African grass species Setaria verticillata grown in nutrient solution. After two weeks, the length of the\r\n    longest roots had increased by 65%. At the highest concentration\r\n    applied, i.e. 2.5 mg Pt/litre, phytotoxic effects were seen in the\r\n    form of stunted root growth and chlorosis of the leaves. 2.  IDENTITY, PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, ANALYTICAL METHODS 2.1  Identity Platinum is a malleable, ductile, silvery-white noble metal\r\n    with the atomic number 78 and an atomic weight of 195.09. It occurs\r\n    naturally mainly as the isotopes 194Pt (32.9%), 195Pt (33.8%),\r\n    and 196Pt (25.3%). In platinum compounds, the maximum oxidation\r\n    state is +6, while the states +2 and +4 are the most stable.\r\n\r\n         The most important platinum compounds are listed in Table 1. 2.2  Physical and chemical properties 2.2.1  Platinum metal\r\n\r\n         The metal does not corrode in air at any temperature, but can\r\n    be affected by halogens, cyanides, sulfur, molten sulfur compounds,\r\n    heavy metals, and hydroxides. Digestion with aqua regia or Cl2/HCl\r\n    (concentrated hydrochloric acid through which chlorine gas is\r\n    bubbled) leads to hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6], an\r\n    important platinum complex.\r\n\r\n         Platinum has a coefficient of expansion almost equal to that of\r\n    sodium-calcium-silicate glass and the two materials can be used in\r\n    combination, e.g., in electrodes. \r\n\r\n         Some chemical and physical data on platinum and selected\r\n    compounds are listed in Table 2. 2.2.2  Platinum compounds\r\n\r\n         The chemistry of platinum compounds in aqueous solution is\r\n    dominated by the complex compounds. Many of the salts, particularly\r\n    those with halogen- or nitrogen-donor ligands, are water-soluble. In\r\n    biochemical processes, cis-trans effects in the quadratic\r\n    coordination of platinum play an important role. Platinum, like the\r\n    other platinum-group metals (PGM), has a marked tendency to react\r\n    with carbon compounds, especially alkenes and alkynes, forming\r\n    Pt(II) coordination complexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Table 1.

When\r\n    heated, the ammonium salt of this acid produces a grey platinum\r\n    sponge. A black powder (\"platinum black\") is produced by reduction\r\n    in aqueous solution. Depending on the pH value, hydroxides exchange\r\n    the halogen ligands with OH- in a stepwise manner, leading to\r\n    PtO2.nH2O after dehydration (n = 1, 2, 3, 4). Further heating\r\n    gives rise to PtO at 400 \u00b0C, which decomposes to platinum and O2 at 560 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\n         By heating hexachloroplatinic acid at 240 \u00b0C, PtCl2 can be\r\n    obtained. It has a hexameric structure (Pt6Cl12) in the solid\r\n    state and is soluble in benzene. This compound forms H2[PtCl4]\r\n    in HCl.\r\n\r\n         Platinum forms a large number of Pt(II) and Pt(IV) complexes\r\n    with the formulae: \r\n\r\n    Pt(IV):  [PtX6-n(NH3)n]n-2 where n = 0-6; X = halogen ligand\r\n    Pt(II):  [PtX4-n(NH3)n]n-2 where n = 0-4; X = halogen ligand\r\n\r\n         The chemical structures of two of the more important platinum\r\n    complexes are shown below.\n2.3  Conversion factors Platinum  1 ppm = 7.98 mg/m3 1 mg/m3 = 0.13 ppm 2.4  Analytical methods 2.4.1  Sampling\r\n\r\n         Samples of ores, minerals, and preconcentrated technical\r\n    products can be obtained in a ground or powdered form. Metals and\r\n    alloys can be collected as chips and shavings. Platinum on alumina\r\n    pellets or monolithic supports must be comminuted before fusing or\r\n    digesting (Potter & Lange, 1981). Electronic scrap may contain\r\n    alloyed copper, nickel or lead. Melting with aluminium leads to a\r\n    brittle alloy, which can be easily crushed to a powder.\r\n\r\n         Blood samples may be frozen and lyophilized (Pera & Harder,\r\n    1977), homogenized with substances like TRITON-X 100(R) (Priesner\r\n    et al., 1981), and separated into plasma ultrafiltrate and proteins\r\n    (Bannister et al., 1978) or, if appropriate, analysed directly\r\n    without pretreatment.\r\n\r\n         With biological materials, homogeneous sampling is difficult\r\n    and often requires destructive methods resulting in the loss of all\r\n    information about the platinum species. Only the total content of\r\n    platinum and its isotopes can be determined.\r\n\r\n         For the analysis of platinum in urine, the untreated original\r\n    sample is usually unsuitable. Freeze-drying or a wet ashing\r\n    procedure with subsequent reduction of volume is necessary for most\r\n    analytical methods.\r\n\r\n         Other biological and environmental materials being investigated\r\n    for very low levels of platinum need to be sampled in large amounts,\r\n    with possible difficulty in homogenisation, digestion, storage, and\r\n    matrix effects. 2.4.2  Sample pretreatment\r\n\r\n         Determination of total platinum content in some materials\r\n    requires a digestion step, which is the pre-requisite for enrichment\r\n    and separation from other elements and organic substances. A modern\r\n    wet digestion procedure (Knapp, 1985) avoids contact with materials\r\n    other than quartz in order to reduce adsorption losses. In this way,\r\n    organic matter is destroyed most effectively and contamination with\r\n    platinum from other sources is minimized (W\u00fcrfels et al., 1987).\r\n\r\n         In general, separation involves volatilization, distillation,\r\n    lyophilization, extraction, coprecipitation, flotation, sorption,\r\n    and other instrumental methods, such as electro-deposition,\r\n\r\n    chromatographic separations, and thermal pre-treatment in atomic\r\n    absorption spectroscopy (AAS) procedures (Knapp, 1984).\r\n\r\n         A selection of extraction and sorption techniques is shown in\r\n    Tables 3 and 4, respectively. For coprecipitation procedures,\r\n    details can be found in the reports of Fryer & Kerrich (1978),\r\n    Stockman (1983), Sighinolfi et al. (1984), Skogerboe et al. (1985),\r\n    Amosse et al. (1986), and Bankovsky et al. (1987). 2.4.3  Detection and measurement\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.1  Spectrophotometry\r\n\r\n         Unless the native soluble platinum compounds have an inherent\r\n    absorption spectrum, they can be treated with inorganic and organic\r\n    reagents to form coloured, soluble complexes that can be measured by\r\n    absorption spectrophotometry. Careful separation from other elements\r\n    is important (see section 2.4.2). The detection limits achieved are\r\n    in the low mg/kg (ppm) range (Jones et al., 1977; Brajter & Kozicka,\r\n    1979; Mojski & Kalinowski, 1980; Marone et al., 1981; Aneva et al.,\r\n    1986; Puri et al., 1986).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.2  Radiochemical methods\r\n\r\n         Neutron-activation analysis is a very sensitive method for\r\n    determining submicrogram traces of platinum. It is at least one to\r\n    several orders of magnitude more sensitive than the best of the\r\n    spectrophotometric methods. For the determination of platinum a\r\n    sensitivity of 1 ng absolute was estimated on irradiation of a\r\n    sample for 1 month at a neutron flux of 10-2cm-2-second,\r\n    followed by a 2-h decay (NAS, 1977).\r\n\r\n         Radiochemical methods have been applied to the analysis of\r\n    platinum in various matrices. The detection limits are 1-2 \u00b5g/kg in\r\n    rock samples (Stockman, 1983), 30 \u00b5g per kg dry weight in plant\r\n    material (Valente et al., 1982), 1-3 \u00b5g/kg dry weight (0.3 ng\r\n    absolute) in plant material and animal tissue (Tjioe et al., 1984),\r\n    and 100 \u00b5g/kg in airborne particulate matter (Schutyser et al.,\r\n    1977).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.3  X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy\r\n\r\n         This method permits the highly selective, sensitive, rapid, and\r\n    non-destructive analysis of platinum. Zolotov et al. (1983) obtained\r\n    a detection limit of 32 \u00b5g Pt per litre in aqueous solutions.\r\n\r\n         A new variant, total-reflection X-ray fluorescence\r\n    spectrometry, has the advantage of small sample size (5 to 40 \u00b5g)\r\n    with low absolute detection limits (Von Bohlen et al. 1987).\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Table 3.

This technique is\r\n    used for special purposes; for instance, Schl\u00f6gl et al. (1987)\r\n    analysed microparticles from automotive exhaust gas catalysts (see\r\n    section 3.2.1.4).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.5  Electrochemical analysis\r\n\r\n         Of the voltametric techniques available for element analysis,\r\n    polarography, in particular, has been applied for the determination\r\n    of platinum. Alexander et al. (1977a,b) described a pulse\r\n    polarography method for the analysis of platinum in ores after fire-\r\n    assay separation and preconcentration. By measuring the sensitive\r\n    catalytic polarographic wave generated by the Pt(II)-ethylenediamine\r\n    complex in alkali solutions a detection limit of 0.025 \u00b5g per kg was\r\n    obtained. A similar technique was applied to the analysis of urine\r\n    by Vrana et al. (1983), and the detection limit was 10 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         However, these methods do not allow the direct determination of\r\n    platinum in complex solutions due to interferences from some heavy\r\n    metals and precipitation of platinum with other metals in the form\r\n    of their hydroxides. In this respect, inverse voltametry is\r\n    superior. Kritsotakis & Tobschall (1985) used the glassy carbon\r\n    electrode for the determination of platinum traces in synthetic\r\n    solutions. After preconcentration, 0.04 mg Pt/litre could be\r\n    determined. This detection limit is sufficient for determining\r\n    platinum in ores.\r\n\r\n         Using adsorptive cathodic stripping voltametry, Van den Berg &\r\n    Jacinto (1988) analysed sea-water samples (see section 5.1.2). The\r\n    detection limit was 7.8 pg Pt/litre. \r\n\r\n         Hoppstock et al. (1989) developed a sensitive volta-metric\r\n    method for determining platinum in the ng/kg range in biotic and\r\n    environmental materials. The overall recovery of platinum was\r\n    reported to be 97% or more.\r\n\r\n         Nygren et al. (1990) described an adsorptive volta-metric\r\n    method for the measurement of platinum in blood. The detection limit\r\n    for a 100-\u00b5l sample was 0.017 \u00b5g per litre.\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.6  Proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE)\r\n\r\n         PIXE requires only small sample sizes (1-10 mg), but is a time-\r\n    consuming and labour-intensive method. Owing to the substantially\r\n    lower background, the detection limits are lower by a factor of 1000\r\n    than for X-ray fluorescence methods. Methods for analysing water\r\n    samples, air, and biological tissues have been described by Rickey\r\n    et al. (1979), Wolfe (1979), and Thompson et al. (1981).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.7  Liquid chromatography (LC)\r\n\r\n         Marsh et al. (1984) published an adsorption chromatography\r\n    method in which the analyte was first separated with an ODS\r\n    Hypersil(R) column, reacted with NaHSO3, and then detected by UV\r\n    absorption. The detection limit for cisplatin was 40-60 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n    For the malonate derivates, Van der Vijgh et al. (1984) reported a\r\n    detection limit of 300-1200 \u00b5g/litre for human body fluids.\r\n\r\n         Ebina et al. (1983) analysed Pt(II) in aqueous solutions that\r\n    were modified with EDTA, ethanoic acid, and maleonitriledithiol. The\r\n    spectrophotometric detection limit for this partition ion-pair\r\n    method was 0.2 ng per litre.\r\n\r\n         Using an ion exchange chromatography method, Rocklin (1984)\r\n    separated Pt(IV) as the hexachlorocomplex on a polar anion exchange\r\n    column and determined the complex by UV. For samples digested in\r\n    aqua regia, a detection limit of 30 \u00b5g/litre can be obtained without\r\n    preconcentration and < 1 \u00b5g/litre after preconcentration.\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.8  Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)\r\n\r\n         AAS is a method of high selectivity and specificity and is\r\n    often the method of choice in analysing platinum in biological and\r\n    environmental samples. However, there are problems with background\r\n    radiation deriving from molecules and radicals, especially from\r\n    unseparated matrix. These interferences can be partly overcome by\r\n    background compensation through a radiation continuum or by the\r\n    application of the \"Zeeman\" effect. To determine platinum in the\r\n    range of the detection limit, an accurate separation from matrix is\r\n    essential.\r\n\r\n         For platinum determinations in biological materials, Farago &\r\n    Parsons (1982) recommended wet digestion in nitric acid and the\r\n    removal of residual nitrates by hydrochloric acid. Brown & Lee\r\n    (1986) proposed totally pyrolytic cuvettes for graphite furnace AAS,\r\n    thus achieving a greater sensitivity for refractory metals. These\r\n    results were confirmed by Schlemmer & Welz (1986). Although platinum\r\n    does not form a stable carbide, there was an effect on the wall\r\n    material of the carbon rod. Electro-graphite tubes coated with\r\n    pyrolytic graphite were found to be superior to glassy carbon tubes\r\n    (Welz & Schlemmer, 1987).\r\n\r\n         LeRoy et al. (1977) described a method for the detection of\r\n    platinum in biological samples that used controlled dehydration and\r\n    ashing with rapid sample evaporation to detect low levels of\r\n    platinum. This method did not suffer as much from matrix\r\n    interference as other AAS graphite furnace methods. The method can\r\n    be used to detect platinum down to approximately 30 \u00b5g/kg (30 ppb). \r\n\r\n         Hodge et al. (1986) determined platinum down to pg per litre\r\n    levels in marine waters, sediments, and organisms. Sea water was\r\n    extracted with an anion exchanger (Table 4), eluted, and purified by\r\n    acid digestion. In a second step, platinum was obtained from the\r\n    solution with an anion exchanger, stripped again from the bead, and\r\n    injected. Using a similar technique, Hodge & Stallard (1986)\r\n    determined platinum in roadside dust.\r\n\r\n         Jones (1976) digested urine and blood samples with nitric and\r\n    perchloric acids. The samples were diluted after cooling and\r\n    injected onto carbon rods. The minimum detectable platinum\r\n    concentration in 5-g samples was 30 \u00b5g per litre.\r\n\r\n         McGahan & Tyczkowska (1987) dried and ashed tissues and fluids\r\n    and diluted the residue with different acids before direct\r\n    injection. The detection limits were 6 \u00b5g per kg or 6 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         Bannister et al. (1978) separated protein-bound platinum and\r\n    free circulating compounds by centrifugal ultra-filtration. In the\r\n    ultrafiltrate, platinum compounds were chelated with\r\n    ethylenediamine, extracted on a cation exchange paper disc, eluted,\r\n    and injected. The minimum working concentration was 35 \u00b5g/litre of\r\n    plasma.\r\n\r\n         Alt et al. (1988) described a simple and reliable method which\r\n    included high-pressure ashing (cf. Knapp, 1984), separation by\r\n    extraction, and detection by graphite furnace AAS. This method was\r\n    recommended for analysing biological and other materials down to the\r\n    \u00b5g/kg range. \r\n\r\n         K\u00f6nig et al. (1989) determined platinum in the particulate\r\n    emissions in engine test-stand experiments (see section 3.2.1.4)\r\n    using a high-pressure digestion without a separation. The authors\r\n    studied the matrix influences with respect to the concomitant\r\n    elements and found interferences from A1, Pb, Ca, Zn, P and, most\r\n    severely, from Si, but under the controlled test conditions no\r\n    interference effects were observed. In particle-free condensates of\r\n    automotive exhaust gas, a detection limit of 0.1 ng/ml was achieved\r\n    by the method of signal addition described by Berndt et al. (1987).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.9  Inductively coupled plasma (ICP)\r\n\r\n         The generation of plasmas is a further development of chemical\r\n    flame methods. They have a wide temperature range, a transparency\r\n    for the UV spectral lines, and are predominantly insensitive against\r\n    interfering chemical reactions in the excitation zone that occur\r\n    with chemical flames. Plasma excitation allows the determination of\r\n    several elements simultaneously and is, because of minor matrix\r\n    effects, easy to calibrate over many orders of magnitude. Two\r\n    methods of generating a plasma are currently used: firstly with\r\n\r\n    direct current (DC) and secondly with a high frequency current\r\n    (20-80 MHz, inductively coupled plasma, ICP). The ICP method works\r\n    with an argon plasma and temperatures of 4000-8000 K. Due to the\r\n    increasing ionization effects, the aerosol feeding is controlled by\r\n    cooling devices.\r\n\r\n         Boumans & Vrakking (1987) discussed standard values for a 50-\r\n    MHz ICP, considering effects of source characteristics, noise, and\r\n    spectral band-width, and obtained a detection limit for the platinum\r\n    spectral line at 214.42 nm of 7.2 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         Maessen et al. (1986) studied the influence of chloroform on\r\n    the platinum signal at 203.65 nm. The detection limits by this\r\n    method were affected by chloroform and ranged from 30-400 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         Wemyss & Scott (1978) determined platinum-group metals and gold\r\n    in ores after three different digestions. The method allowed\r\n    determination down to 0.13 mg/litre for the 299.8-nm line.\r\n\r\n         Fox (1984) reported interferences from aluminium and magnesium\r\n    in direct current methods. A buffer of lithium and lanthanum\r\n    compounds suppressed this effect.\r\n\r\n         Lo et al. (1987) described a simple method for determining\r\n    platinum in urine with a working range down to 50 \u00b5g/litre (50 ppb)\r\n    under direct application of acidified samples. Electrothermal\r\n    vaporization (ETV) was used for generating plasma-suitable aerosols\r\n    by Matusiewicz & Barnes (1983). They determined platinum at the\r\n    mg/litre level in human body fluids directly. A similar procedure\r\n    was used by Belliveau et al. (1986).\r\n\r\n    2.4.3.10  Inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\r\n\r\n         Combining ICP with a mass spectrometer has new advantages in\r\n    analytical spectroscopy. Elemental ions generated from an aerosol or\r\n    an electrothermal vaporization unit are separated by a quadrupole\r\n    and detected as isotopes at low level. The ETV device allows\r\n    determination down to the pg/ml range.\r\n\r\n         Thompson & Houk (1986) used an ion-pair reversed-phase liquid\r\n    chromatography assay via a continuous flow ultrasonic nebulizer and\r\n    an ICP torch with a mass spectrometer. In synthetic solutions\r\n    detection limits of 7 \u00b5g/litre (7 ppb) were obtained.\r\n\r\n         Gregoire (1988) compared the results from the ICP-MS-ETV with\r\n    neutron activation analysis and the ICP-MS solution nebulization\r\n    method in the ng/ml concentration range and found good agreement.\r\n\r\n         For the analysis of air samples, the NIOSH Manual of Analytical\r\n    Methods (Eller, 1984a) describes a method based on inductively\r\n    coupled argon plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The working range\r\n\r\n    is 0.005-2.0 mg/m3 with a 500-litre air sample. However, long\r\n    sampling periods are required for measuring soluble platinum\r\n    compounds in the workplace and the method does not distinguish\r\n    between soluble and insoluble platinum. Similar methods are\r\n    recommended for the analysis of platinum in blood and tissues\r\n    (Eller, 1984b) and in urine (Eller, 1984c).\r\n\r\n         The method recommended by the United Kingdom Health and Safety\r\n    Executive (1985) has a precision better than 8%, measured as a\r\n    coefficient of variation, for samples of a minimum of 120 litres in\r\n    the range 1-15 \u00b5g Pt/m3. The sensitivity of this method can be\r\n    improved by 100-1000 fold by using ICP-MS instead of carbon furnace\r\n    atomic absorption spectrometry. 3.  SOURCES OF HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE 3.1  Natural occurrence The six platinum-group metals, platinum, palladium, rhodium,\r\n    ruthenium, iridium, and osmium, were probably concentrated mainly in\r\n    the iron-nickel core during the earth's formation. This explains\r\n    their relatively low presence in the lithosphere (rocky crust) of\r\n    the earth (Goldschmidt, 1954) where the average concentration of\r\n    platinum ranges between 0.001 and 0.005 mg/kg (Mason, 1966, Bowen,\r\n    1979).\r\n\r\n         Platinum is found both in its metallic form and in a number of\r\n    minerals. The principal minerals are: sperrylite, PtAs2;\r\n    cooperite, (Pt,Pd)S; and braggite, (Pt,Pd,Ni)S. Primary deposits are\r\n    associated with ultrabasic, rather than silicic, rock formations.\r\n    Economically important sources exist in the Bushveld Igneous Rock\r\n    Complex in Transvaal, Republic of South Africa, and in the Noril'sk\r\n    region of Siberia, the Kola Peninsula, and in the Nishnij Tagil\r\n    region of the Urals, USSR. The platinum content in these deposits is\r\n    between 1 and 500 mg/kg. In the Sudbury district of Canada, platinum\r\n    metal is contained in copper-nickel sulfide ores at an average\r\n    concentration of 0.3 mg/kg but is concentrated to more than 50 mg/kg\r\n    during the refining of copper and nickel. In the USA, there is a\r\n    platinum-palladium mine in the Stillwater Complex area, Montana\r\n    (NAS, 1977; Renner, 1979).\r\n\r\n         Small amounts of platinum are also mined from secondary or\r\n    placer deposits in the USSR (Ural Mountains), Colombia, USA\r\n    (Alaska), Ethiopia, and the Philippines. In these deposits platinum\r\n    is present in the form of metallic alloys of varied composition\r\n    (NAS, 1977). 3.2  Anthropogenic sources 3.2.1  Production levels and processes\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.1  World production figures\r\n\r\n         World mine production of platinum-group metals, 40-50% of which\r\n    is platinum, has steadily increased during the last two decades. In\r\n    1971 production was 127 tonnes (51-64 tonnes platinum) and in 1972\r\n    it was 132 tonnes (53-66 tonnes platinum) (Butterman, 1975). In\r\n    1975, automobile exhaust gas catalysts were introduced in the USA in\r\n    order to meet the stringent emission limits for carbon monoxide,\r\n    hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides set by the Federal Clean Air Act.\r\n    In Japan, the automobile catalyst was introduced at the same time.\r\n    As a consequence, world production of PGM increased to 179 tonnes\r\n    (72-90 tonnes platinum) in 1975, reaching a plateau of between 200\r\n    and 203 tonnes per year (80-102 tonnes platinum) during the period\r\n    1977-1983 (Loebenstein, 1982, 1988).\r\n\r\n         From 1984 onwards world production increased, apparently in\r\n    response to the anticipated demand in Western Europe where\r\n    automobiles are being increasingly fitted with catalytic converters.\r\n    In 1987, world mine production of PGM amounted to about 270 tonnes\r\n    (108-135 tonnes platinum) (Loebenstein, 1988).\r\n\r\n         The future demand for platinum depends on improvements in\r\n    engine technology and emission control, but can be expected to\r\n    increase further during the coming years. Data on platinum demand\r\n    are presented in section 3.2.2.\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.2  Manufacturing processes\r\n\r\n         Most native placer platinum is recovered by dredging and, in\r\n    less developed areas, by small hand operations. The copper and\r\n    nickel sulfide ores are mined by large-scale underground methods and\r\n    concentrated by flotation (Stokinger, 1981).\r\n\r\n         The isolation of pure platinum metal from raw materials\r\n    involves two principal stages: (i) extraction of a concentrate of\r\n    precious metals from the ore; (ii) refining the concentrate to\r\n    separate the platinum-group metals from each other and purify them.\r\n    These processes require sophisticated chemical technology and\r\n    include precipitating crystallization and liquid-liquid extraction,\r\n    often combined with redox reactions to change the oxidation state of\r\n    the metals. Further processes involve halogenation and reduction\r\n    reactions at annealing temperatures and special distillations\r\n    (Renner, 1984).\r\n\r\n         Potential health hazards of exposure to soluble platinum salts\r\n    are encountered during the later stages of the refining process.\r\n    After dissolving platinum, palladium, and gold with aqua regia or\r\n    Cl2/HCl and the subsequent precipitation of gold by addition of\r\n    ferrous salts, ammonium chloride is added to precipitate ammonium\r\n    hexachloroplatinate, (NH4)2[PtCl6]. After several purification\r\n    processes there is a second precipitation of this complex salt,\r\n    which is then filtered off, dried and finally calcined to yield a\r\n    spongy mass of platinum metal having purity of 99.95-99.99%. This\r\n    can be further purified by a cationic exchange technique (NAS, 1977;\r\n    Stokinger, 1981).\r\n\r\n         Secondary sources in substantial quantities come from the\r\n    reclamation of scrap and used equipment, particularly industrial\r\n    catalysts. The recycling of platinum-group metals from automobile\r\n    catalysts is also increasing (see section 4.3). In principle, the\r\n    recycling of platinum involves the same wet-chemical and melting\r\n    processes that are applied to its production from ores (Renner,\r\n    1984). \r\n\r\n    3.2.1.3  Emissions from stationary sources\r\n\r\n    a)  Production\r\n\r\n         Data on emissions of platinum during production are not\r\n    available.\r\n\r\n    b)  Stationary catalysts\r\n\r\n         During the use of platinum-containing catalysts, platinum can\r\n    escape into the environment in variable amounts, depending on the\r\n    type of catalyst. Of the stationary catalysts used in industry, only\r\n    those employed for ammonia oxidation emit major amounts.\r\n\r\n         The loss of platinum from ammonia oxidation gauzes during\r\n    nitric acid production depends on the operating pressure. An average\r\n    figure is 0.15 g/tonne of nitric acid (Sperner & Hohmann, 1976). Of\r\n    this apparent loss, 70-85% is recovered on gold-palladium catchment\r\n    gauzes, reducing the loss to 0.03 g/tonne (Anon., 1990a). The\r\n    production of nitric acid in the USA in 1989 was 7 247 837 tonnes\r\n    (Anon., 1990b). Thus the amount of platinum \"lost\" in 1989 in the\r\n    USA is calcu-lated to be 217 kg. This is the maximum amount that\r\n    could be dissolved or suspended as a colloid in the nitric acid and,\r\n    thus, could be introduced into the environment if the nitric acid is\r\n    used in fertilizer production.\r\n\r\n    3.2.1.4  Emissions from automobile catalysts\r\n\r\n         Automobile catalysts are mobile sources of platinum. Although\r\n    these catalysts are designed to function for 80 000 km or more\r\n    (Koberstein, 1984), some loss of platinum can occur due to\r\n    mechanical and thermal impact. The data on platinum emissions from\r\n    automobile catalysts are very limited.\r\n\r\n         In the mid 1970s unrealistically high assumptions were made for\r\n    platinum loss. Brubaker et al. (1975) estimated the loss to be about\r\n    12 \u00b5g Pt/km, which would mean a total loss of approximately 1 g\r\n    after 80 000 km.\r\n\r\n         Experimental data show much lower emission rates. Malanchuk et\r\n    al. (1974) found a platinum concentration of 0.029 \u00b5g/m3 in an\r\n    inhalation chamber that was fed by catalysed engine exhaust. On the\r\n    basis of the chamber volume, flow rate, and the speed simulated on\r\n    the engine test stand, an emission rate of 0.39 \u00b5g/km was\r\n    calculated. In another US EPA study, Sigsby (1976) did not detect\r\n    platinum in particulate exhaust emissions (< 5 \u00b5m) at a detection\r\n    limit of 0.06 \u00b5g/g. In exhaust dilution tunnels, platinum was\r\n    detected in larger particles in the range of 0.034 to 635 \u00b5g/g\r\n    sample; whole or fragmented pellets contained the highest\r\n    concentrations.\r\n\r\n         Reliable emission data for the pellet-type catalyst come from a\r\n    study conducted by the General Motors Corporation (Hill & Mayer,\r\n    1977), in which emission rates as well as the soluble fraction were\r\n    determined by a radio-metric method. Platinum emission was found to\r\n    be 0.8 to 1.2 \u00b5g per km travelled in low-speed runs (starts and\r\n    stops, maximum speed 48 km/h) and 1.9 \u00b5g per kilometre travelled in\r\n    high-speed runs (96 km/h). It should be noted that these results\r\n    relate to the first 250 km of catalyst life. Lower loss rates would\r\n    be expected with increasing age of the catalyst. Of the particles\r\n    collected, 80% had particle diameters greater than 125 \u00b5m.\r\n    Experiments with an engine test stand using laboratory prepared\r\n    catalysts indicated that about 10% of the platinum emitted is water\r\n    soluble. However, the statistical significance of these results was\r\n    not reported. Even so, these emission data provide the best basis\r\n    for the estimation of expected ambient air concentrations resulting\r\n    from the introduction of pellet catalysts (see section 5.1.1).\r\n    However, this type of automobile catalyst is no longer used on new\r\n    cars in the USA, and has never been used in Europe where only\r\n    monolithic catalysts are on the market.\r\n\r\n         Emission data are available concerning the new generation\r\n    monolith-type catalyst. In Germany the Fraunhofer Institute of\r\n    Toxicology and Aerosol Research (K\u00f6nig et al., 1989, K\u00f6nig & Hertel,\r\n    1990) has conducted engine test stand experiments as part of a\r\n    programme of the Ministry of Research and Technology for assessing\r\n    the relative risk of this new man-made environmental source (GSF,\r\n    1990). First results indicated that platinum emission is lower by a\r\n    factor of 100 than in the case of pelleted catalysts: at a simulated\r\n    speed of 100 km/h, total loss from a three-way catalyst was\r\n    measured, using the AAS method, to be on average about 17 ng/m3 in\r\n    the exhaust gas (K\u00f6nig et al., 1989). In further experiments this\r\n    value was validated (K\u00f6nig & Hertel, 1990): the mean platinum\r\n    emission from two catalysts was found to be 12 and 8 ng/m3,\r\n    respectively. As shown in Table 5, platinum emission seems to be\r\n    temperature dependent. At an exhaust gas temperature of 690\u00b0 C and a\r\n    simulated speed of 140 km/h, about 35-39 ng/m3 was found in the\r\n    exhaust gas. The mean aerodynamic diameter of the particles\r\n    collected after the muffler (silencer) on a Berner impactor varied\r\n    between 4 and 9 \u00b5m. Preliminary results indicated that approximately\r\n    10% of the total platinum penetrated a depth-type filter to be\r\n    trapped in the condensate (K\u00f6nig et al., 1989), but this single\r\n    measurement could not be confirmed by subsequent determinations\r\n    where the platinum content in the condensate was below the detection\r\n    limit (0.1 ng/ml) (K\u00f6nig & Hertel, 1990).\r\n\r\n         Schl\u00f6gl et al. (1987) analysed microparticles emitted from\r\n    automobile exhaust and collected on several conducting surfaces. In\r\n    experiments with diesel and gasoline engines equipped with\r\n    catalysts, they found detectable traces of platinum. In diesel\r\n    engine exhaust it was presumed that most platinum would be in the\r\n    oxidation state 0 (platinum black). A small part was found to be\r\n\r\n    Pt(IV), probably in the oxide form. The platinum emission from\r\n    gasoline engines showed a photoemission spectrum indicating that\r\n    platinum is probably emitted mostly in the form of surface oxidized\r\n    particles.\r\n        Table 5.

Further applications in industry are related\r\n    to other outstanding properties, particularly resistance to chemical\r\n    corrosion over a wide temperature range, high melting point, high\r\n    mechanical strength, and good ductility. Platinum has long been\r\n    known to have excellent catalytic properties. Before the\r\n    introduction of catalytic converters in automobiles, most of the\r\n    platinum was used as a catalyst in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation,\r\n    isomerization, cyclization, dehydration, dehalogenation, and\r\n    oxidation reactions. One of its major industrial uses is for\r\n    naphtha-reforming to upgrade catalytically the octane rating of\r\n    gasoline. Other catalytic uses are in ammonia oxidation to produce\r\n    nitric acid, hydrogen cyanide manufacture, the reduction of nitro\r\n    groups and, in the automobile catalyst application, the conversion\r\n    of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide to nitrogen\r\n    and water (NAS, 1977; Stokinger, 1981).\r\n\r\n         As shown in Table 6, in the USA in 1973, before the\r\n    introduction of the automobile catalyst, most of the platinum was\r\n    used for catalytic purposes in the chemical and petroleum industry.\r\n    In 1987 the use pattern had completely changed and 71% of the\r\n    platinum sold was used by the automobile industry. In 1987, a\r\n    typical USA car catalyst contained about 1.77 g of platinum and 10.6\r\n\r\n    million vehicles with catalysts were produced (Loebenstein, 1988);\r\n    this accounts for the 18.8 tonnes shown in Table 6.\r\n\r\n    Table 6.

Thermo-electrical applications arise from the simple and\r\n    stable relationship between resistance and temperature that platinum\r\n    exhibits over a wide temperature range. This explains its use in\r\n    platinum resistance thermometers, thermocouples, and strain gauges.\r\n    The high melting point of platinum and its resistance to oxidation\r\n    and many chemicals has led to its use in vessels in the glass-making\r\n    industry and in the fabrication of spinning jets and bushings for\r\n    the production of viscose rayon and fibreglass, respectively. It is\r\n    also used for laboratory ware, such as crucibles, combustion boats,\r\n    and the tips of tongs. Ships' hulls, propellers, and rudders are\r\n    protected against corrosion by \"cathodic protection\" using platinum-\r\n    clad anodes (NAS, 1977).\r\n\r\n         Platinum and/or its alloys have been used in electric contacts\r\n    for relays and switchgears for a variety of reasons, including\r\n    hardness and good conductivity. Many printed circuits are made using\r\n    preparations that contain platinum. Electrochemical platinum\r\n    electrodes have been used in preparative chemistry, since they\r\n    support many oxidative reactions although they resist oxidation\r\n    themselves (NAS, 1977).\r\n\r\n         A major use of platinum is in jewellery for making rings and\r\n    settings. Platinum is also used to produce a silvery lustre on\r\n    ceramic glazes (NAS, 1977).\r\n\r\n         In dentistry, platinum is used in gold-platinum-palladium\r\n    alloys to raise the melting-point range and increase the strength.\r\n    However, this use is decreasing, since platinum is being replaced by\r\n    other materials including palladium (Anusavice, 1985; NAS, 1977).\r\n\r\n         Platinum has an important role in neurological prostheses, i.e.\r\n    surgically implanted microelectronic devices, such as implants for\r\n    treating incontinence, or for recovering some use of paralysed limbs\r\n    following spinal accidents (Donaldson, 1987).\r\n\r\n         Platinum-iridium electrodes are used for long-term electrode\r\n    implantation for recording electrical activity and for stimulation\r\n    in human tissues and organs, e.g., pacemakers (Theopold et al.,\r\n    1981).\r\n\r\n         All these applications use platinum as a pure metal or in the\r\n    form of alloys, but soluble platinum salts are also used in the\r\n    manufacture of these products; e.g., hexachloroplatinic acid may be\r\n    used in platinizing alumina or charcoal in catalyst production. A\r\n    number of salts can be used in the electrodeposition of platinum,\r\n    e.g., sodium hexahydroxyplatinate(IV), Na2[Pt(OH)6].2H2O,\r\n    diamminedinitroplatinum(II), [Pt(NO2)2(NH3)2], hydrogen\r\n    dinitrosulfatoplatinate(II), H2[Pt(NO2)2SO4], and\r\n\r\n    tetraammineplatinum(II) compounds such as the hydrogenphosphate,\r\n    sulfamate, citrate, and tartrate (Baumg\u00e4rtner & Raub, 1988; Skinner,\r\n    1989).\r\n\r\n         Complexes of platinum, particularly cis- diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) (see footnote in section\r\n    1.2), have been used to treat cancer. In patients with testicular\r\n    cancers, remissions rates of more than 90% have been achieved\r\n    (Lippert & Beck, 1983). 4.  ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT, DISTRIBUTION, AND TRANSFORMATION 4.1  Transport and distribution between media By comparison with other elements, platinum-group metals are\r\n    distributed sparsely in the environment. Since platinum is so\r\n    valuable, great care is taken to avoid significant loss during\r\n    mining and refining processes, and during use and disposal of used\r\n    platinum-containing objects. Up to 1984, about 1050 tonnes of\r\n    platinum had been refined. Most of this has been used in the form of\r\n    the metal and platinum oxides, which are practically insoluble in\r\n    water, resistant to most chemical reactions in the biosphere, and do\r\n    not volatilize into air (Renner, 1984).\r\n\r\n         Part of the platinum released into the air from automobile\r\n    emissions (section 5) is deposited close to the roads and could be\r\n    washed off by rain into rivers and coastal marine waters (Hodge &\r\n    Stallard, 1986). However, only small amounts of platinum have been\r\n    detected in environmental samples (see sections 5.1.2. and 5.1.3.). \r\n\r\n         Large amounts of metals including platinum can be transported\r\n    in rivers draining major industrialized regions, leading to elevated\r\n    platinum concentrations in sediments (section 5.1.3).\r\n\r\n         Platinum forms soluble complexes with ammonia, cyanide, amines,\r\n    olefins, organic sulfides, and tertiary arsines. However, the level\r\n    of these ligands in natural waters is insufficient to make platinum\r\n    mobile (Fuchs & Rose, 1974).\r\n\r\n         Organic matter has a role as a vehicle for the transport of\r\n    platinum and for bringing about its precipitation or concentration.\r\n    There is a good correlation between high contents of platinum and\r\n    organic carbon in polluted stream sediments of the Ginsheimer-\r\n    Altrhine river, near Mainz, Germany (see section 5.1.2), and it is\r\n    assumed that organic matter such as humic and fulvic acids binds\r\n    platinum, aided perhaps by appropriate pH and redox potential\r\n    conditions in the aquatic environment (Dissanayake, 1983).\r\n\r\n         Detailed information about the geochemical behaviour of\r\n    platinum-group metals is available from the platinum mining area of\r\n    Stillwater, Montana, USA (Fuchs & Rose, 1974). The mobility of\r\n    platinum depends on pH, the redox potential, chloride concentrations\r\n    in soil water, and the mode of occurrence of platinum in the primary\r\n    rock. The relation between redox potentials and pH conditions\r\n    indicates that platinum behaviour also depends on the kind of ore it\r\n    is associated with. If bound in chromite, it has essentially no\r\n    mobility in weathering because of the resistant character of\r\n    chromite. On the other hand, platinum in the form of trace mineral\r\n    inclusions in sulfides is readily released by oxidation during\r\n    weathering. Calculated relations between pH and redox potential\r\n    indicate that increased chloride concentrations in soil water will\r\n\r\n    promote mobility. Thus, platinum will be mobile only in extremely\r\n    acid waters or those with a high chloride level (Fuchs & Rose,\r\n    1974).\r\n\r\n         In twigs from four limber pines (Pinus flexilis) in the\r\n    platinum mining area of Stillwater, the platinum concentrations were\r\n    the same as in the adjacent soil. It was concluded that limber pine\r\n    does not concentrate platinum, probably due to the limited mobility\r\n    of platinum (Fuchs & Rose, 1974). However, high concentrations of\r\n    platinum were found in the roots of nine horticultural crops\r\n    (cauliflower, radish, snapbean, sweet corn, pea, tomato, bell\r\n    pepper, broccoli, and turnip) grown in Hoagland's hydroponic culture\r\n    solution containing platinum tetrachloride concentrations of 0.057,\r\n    0.57, or 5.7 mg/litre (Pallas & Jones, 1978; see section 7.3). For\r\n    example, at the highest concentration, cauliflower and tomato roots\r\n    contained 1425 and 1710 mg Pt/kg, respectively. Only pepper,\r\n    cauliflower, and radish accumulated platinum in their tops, but to a\r\n    very limited extent. From the data of Pallas & Jones (1978) it is\r\n    not clear whether they differentiated between contamination of the\r\n    root surface and true uptake of platinum. However, these results\r\n    indicate that platinum can enter food crops but the bioavailability\r\n    essentially depends on the solubility of the platinum species. It\r\n    should be noted that the salt (PtCl4) used by Pallas & Jones\r\n    (1978) is soluble in water.\r\n\r\n         In the context of a German government programme (see section\r\n    3.2.1.4), Rosner et al. (1991) conducted engine test stand\r\n    experiments with a three-way-catalyst-equipped engine (monolith-type\r\n    catalyst) to determine platinum uptake by plants. Grass cultures (Lolium multiflorum) were placed in continuously stirred tank\r\n    reactors and exposed to slightly diluted (1:10/20) exhaust gas for 4\r\n    weeks (8 h/day, 5 days/week). Using atomic absorption spectrometry\r\n    for the measurement of platinum emissions (see section 2.4.3.8,\r\n    K\u00f6nig & Hertel, 1990), no platinum could be detected in the shoots\r\n    at a detection limit of 2 ng/g dry weight. 4.2  Biotransformation By analogy, platinum compounds may undergo biotransformation\r\n    comparable to processes described for other metals. The\r\n    biomethylation of platinum compounds, i.e. [Pt(IV)Cl6]2-,\r\n    [Pt(IV)(CN)4Cl2]2-, [Pt(IV)(CN)5Cl]2-, and\r\n    [Pt(IV)(SO4)2], has been established only in in vitro test\r\n    systems (Taylor, 1976; Wood et al., 1978; Fanchiang et al., 1979;\r\n    Taylor et al., 1979; Fanchiang, 1985).\r\n\r\n         Methylcobalamin (MeB12) reacts with Pt(II) and Pt(IV)\r\n    complexes to give a methylated platinum compound. Agnes et al.\r\n    (1971) reported that this reaction requires the presence of platinum\r\n    in both oxidation states. Spectrophotometric measurements showed the\r\n    consumption of one mole of [Pt(IV)Cl6]2- per mole of MeB12,\r\n\r\n    [Pt(II)Cl4]2- being required only in catalytic quantities.\r\n    Aquocobalamin (aquo-B12) and methylplatinum were shown to be the\r\n    products of the reaction (Taylor & Hanna, 1977).\r\n\r\n         From these laboratory data produced under abiotic conditions it\r\n    is not, however, possible to conclude that microorganisms in the\r\n    environment are able to biomethylate platinum complexes. 4.3  Ultimate fate following use The value of platinum-group metals has greatly increased and\r\n    methods for their recovery from spent catalysts are of economic\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\n         Platinum metal has been successfully recycled from used\r\n    chemical and petroleum catalysts for many years, but many companies\r\n    are still trying to find a successful formula for retrieving it from\r\n    automobile catalysts. The latter accounts for more than 30% of the\r\n    total platinum-group metal consumption in the USA. The US Office of\r\n    Technology calculated that if 50-60% of catalytic converters were\r\n    recovered for their metal value, about 7717 kg platinum per year\r\n    could be reclaimed in 1990. However, currently only between 25 to\r\n    40% of the used converters are being reclaimed (Agoos, 1986).\r\n    According to another estimate, 5443 kg of platinum was recovered in\r\n    1989 from automobile catalysts, of which 4666 kg was recovered in\r\n    the USA (Johnson Matthey, 1990).\r\n\r\n         In contrast to automobile catalysts, almost 100% of spent\r\n    reforming and gauze catalysts are collected for their metal value.\r\n    This is based on their much higher platinum metal content (Agoos,\r\n    1986). 5.  ENVIRONMENTAL LEVELS AND HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.1  Environmental levels 5.1.1  Ambient air\r\n\r\n         Few measurements of platinum ambient air concentrations have\r\n    been reported. Results obtained before the introduction of cars with\r\n    catalytic converters can serve as a baseline. Air samples taken near\r\n    freeways in California, USA, and analysed using atomic absorption\r\n    spectrometry were below the detection limit of 0.05 pg/m3 (Johnson\r\n    et al., 1975; 1976).\r\n\r\n         No platinum could be detected in two air samples collected by\r\n    Ito & Kidani (1982) in an industrial area of Nagoya, Japan, in 1981.\r\n\r\n         Close to city roads in Frankfurt, Langenbr\u00fcgge, Germany, the\r\n    platinum air concentrations (particulate samples) were measured in\r\n    1989 to be between < 1 and 13 pg/m3. In rural areas the\r\n    concentrations were < 0.6-1.8 pg/m3 (T\u00f6lg & Alt, 1990). At the\r\n    time of these measurements, few German cars were equipped with\r\n    catalysts. Thus, these levels virtually reflect background levels.\r\n\r\n         Rosner & Hertel (1986) estimated ambient air concentrations for\r\n    different scenarios, based on dispersion models used by US EPA\r\n    (Ingalls & Garbe, 1982) and on the emission data of Hill & Mayer\r\n    (1977) (see section 3.2.1.4). As shown in Table 9, total platinum\r\n    concentrations near and on roads could range from 0.005 to 9\r\n    ng/m3. Estimates for parking and personal garages were also made,\r\n    based on an assumed emission rate of 1 \u00b5g/min for total platinum,\r\n    but this is definitely an overestimate. It can be assumed that the\r\n    emission of platinum depends on the exhaust gas temperature. At\r\n    idling or very low speed conditions, emissions are expected to be\r\n    negligible (see section 3.2.1.4).\r\n\r\n         As described in section 3.2.1.4, emission data indicate that\r\n    the total platinum emission of a monolith-type catalyst is probably\r\n    lower by a factor of 100 than that of a pellet-type catalyst.\r\n    Assuming an average emission rate of approximately 20 ng/km (see\r\n    section 3.2.1.4) and applying the same dispersion models, the\r\n    theoretical ambient air concentrations would be lowered to the\r\n    picogram to femtogram per m3 range (see Table 9).\r\n\r\n    Table 9.

At the edge of a major freeway (154 000\r\n    vehicles/day), dust samples contained the highest concentration (680\r\n    \u00b5g Pt/kg dry weight; 680 ppb). At a distance of about 34 m, the\r\n    platinum content of 100 \u00b5g/kg was about 7 times lower. At the edge\r\n    of another heavily used freeway (96 000 vehicles/day) platinum\r\n    content was 250 \u00b5g/kg, while with less heavy traffic (14 000\r\n    vehicles/day) 260 and 300 \u00b5g/kg were found in two dust samples. The\r\n    lowest concentrations, 37 and 60 \u00b5g/kg, were found in samples\r\n    collected from plants growing in the yards of houses located on\r\n\r\n    highly used road. The platinum concentration was not correlated with\r\n    the lead concentration. However, the samples with the highest\r\n    platinum concentrations also had the highest lead values. Although\r\n    the number of samples was limited, the results indicate that\r\n    automobile catalysts release platinum. However, it should be noted\r\n    that platinum emissions from pelleted catalysts were probably\r\n    responsible for the concentrations reported and that the use of\r\n    monolith catalysts should result in much lower platinum\r\n    concentrations in the roadside environment. 5.1.2  Water and sediments\r\n\r\n         In a study to determine baseline levels of platinum, Johnson et\r\n    al. (1976) analysed tap water samples collected in Lancaster and Los\r\n    Angeles, California, USA. No platinum was found at a detection limit\r\n    of 0.08 \u00b5g/litre. In tap water (probably only one sample) from\r\n    Liverpool, United Kingdom, a platinum content of 0.06 \u00b5g/litre was\r\n    determined by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltametry (Van den Berg\r\n    & Jacinto, 1988).\r\n\r\n         Investigations of platinum concentrations in Lake Michigan\r\n    sediments led to the conclusion that platinum has been deposited\r\n    over the past 50 years at a constant rate. Concentrations at\r\n    sediment depths of 1-20 cm varied between 0.3 and 0.43 \u00b5g/kg dry\r\n    weight (Goldberg et al., 1981). In comparison, lead concentrations\r\n    have markedly increased in the sediment due to increased emissions\r\n    from industry and motor traffic.\r\n\r\n         Lee (1983) noted a rapid increase in the palladium contents of\r\n    the sediments from the Palace Moat, Tokyo, Japan, between 1948 and\r\n    1973 and attributed it to the introduction of car catalysts.\r\n    However, this is not conclusive as the palladium content in the\r\n    sediment had already begun to increase in 1964-1965, before the\r\n    introduction of the catalytic converter, and even in 1973 only a few\r\n    cars were equipped with converters.\r\n\r\n         Dissanayake et al. (1984) determined platinum concentrations in\r\n    the sediments of a cut-off channel of the Rhine river near Mainz,\r\n    Germany. Sediment samples from this highly polluted river were\r\n    sieved and the < 2 \u00b5m fraction was analysed by flameless AAS. The\r\n    platinum concentrations in 12 samples collected at different sites\r\n    varied over a wide range. In four samples no platinum was detected,\r\n    while eight samples contained between 730 and 31 220 \u00b5g/kg (dry\r\n    weight). This is higher by a factor of up to 15 000 compared to\r\n    unpolluted average North Sea sediments. The high variation was\r\n    attributed to differences in pH and redox conditions. The extremely\r\n    high concentrations appeared at the interface between an extremely\r\n    reducing and an oxidizing aquatic environment that provided,\r\n    together with a pH of 6.6-7.8, optimum conditions for the formation\r\n    of metal-organic complexes. The sample containing 31 220 \u00b5g Pt/kg\r\n    also contained the highest concentration of palladium (4000 \u00b5g/kg).\r\n\r\n    The gold content (100-400 \u00b5g/kg) had a relatively uniform\r\n    distribution, but was also indicative of a high state of pollution.\r\n\r\n         Using a more sensitive graphite furnace AAS method, Goldberg et\r\n    al. (1986) detected very low platinum concentrations in sea water.\r\n    Samples of filtered water (0.45-\u00b5m filter) from the open Eastern\r\n    Pacific Ocean showed an increase in platinum concentration with\r\n    depth from surface values of around 100 to a value of 250 pg/litre\r\n    at 4500 m. Similar concentration profiles were obtained in\r\n    unfiltered sea water taken from the California Borderline region\r\n    (Hodge et al., 1985). Sea-water samples analysed by Van den Berg &\r\n    Jacinto (1988) were also within this concentration range. A deep-sea\r\n    and a shallow-water sample from the Indian Ocean contained 154 and\r\n    37 pg/litre, respectively, whereas sea water of coastal origin\r\n    contained 332 pg/litre. It should be noted that these were only\r\n    single samples.\r\n\r\n         In sediment cores from the Eastern Pacific taken to a depth of\r\n    6-22 cm in carbonate and siliceous ooze, platinum concentrations\r\n    varied between 1.1 and 3 \u00b5g/kg (dry weight basis). Lower\r\n    concentrations (0.3 \u00b5g/kg) were reported in the Santa Barbara Basin\r\n    (Hodge et al., 1985). The highest concentration (21.9 \u00b5g/kg) was\r\n    found in pelagic ocean sediments (Hodge et al., 1986).\r\n\r\n         In several investigations, the platinum content of seamount\r\n    ferromanganese nodules or crusts was studied. In deep-sea nodules\r\n    from the Northwest Pacific nodule belt, platinum concentrations from\r\n    < 5 to 145 \u00b5g/kg were found (Agiorgitis & Gundlach, 1978).\r\n\r\n         Platinum values in ferromanganese seamount crusts from the\r\n    Central Pacific were much higher and varied between 140 \u00b5g/kg at\r\n    3780 m and a maximum of 880 \u00b5g/kg at a depth of 1120 m (Halbach et\r\n    al., 1984). Both platinum and nickel concentrations correlated\r\n    positively with manganese content and led to the conclusion that\r\n    platinum and nickel are incorporated in the manganese oxide\r\n    fraction. It was suggested that the high platinum concentration in\r\n    the crusts is derived directly from sea water by a process of\r\n    specific adsorption onto colloidal particles of hydrous manganese\r\n    oxide, which has a negative surface charge in sea water.\r\n\r\n         In a further investigation, platinum concentrations in\r\n    ferromanganese minerals from various localities were found to vary\r\n    between 6 and 940 \u00b5g/kg (Goldberg et al., 1986). In manganese\r\n    nodules obtained at depths of between 1700 and 4200 m in the Pacific\r\n    Ocean, platinum concentrations varied between 138 and 940 \u00b5g/kg\r\n    (Hodge et al., 1986). 5.1.3  Soil\r\n\r\n         Few measurements of platinum in soil have been reported. In the\r\n    baseline study of Johnson et al. (1976), all surface soil samples\r\n\r\n    collected near freeways in California, USA, and in a mining area in\r\n    Sudbury, Canada, were below the detection limit of 0.8 \u00b5g/kg.\r\n\r\n         In the USA, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1977)\r\n    estimated the accumulation of platinum in roadside environments on\r\n    the basis of an emission rate of 1.9 \u00b5g per km from cars equipped\r\n    with catalytic converters and a frequency of 5000 cars per day.\r\n    Assuming that all emitted platinum was localized near the freeway in\r\n    the topsoil (uniformly distributed about 30 cm deep over a width of\r\n    about 90 m and a length of 1.6 km, with a soil density of 1.5\r\n    g/cm3), a platinum concentration after 10 years of 8 \u00b5g/kg could\r\n    be expected. 5.1.4  Food\r\n\r\n         Hamilton & Minski (1972/1973) estimated a total daily platinum\r\n    intake of less than 1 \u00b5g/day, based on an analysis of a United\r\n    Kingdom total-diet sample and 1963 United Kingdom consumption and\r\n    population figures. No data were given on the platinum content of\r\n    the foods analysed. 5.1.5  Terrestrial and aquatic organisms\r\n\r\n         Fuchs & Rose (1974) analysed samples of twigs from four limber\r\n    pines (Pinus flexilis) in the Stillwater mining area, Montana,\r\n    USA. Three samples contained between 12 and 56 \u00b5g Pt/kg (ash\r\n    weight), while one contained platinum at a level below the detection\r\n    limit. The content of the adjacent soils was also in this range, so\r\n    that no evidence for accumulation could be derived from these\r\n    limited data (see also section 4.1).\r\n\r\n         Using neutron activation analysis (section 2.4.3.2) Valente et\r\n    al. (1982) measured the following platinum concentrations in\r\n    isolated samples of plants from an ultrabasic soil: Fragaria virginiana, 830 \u00b5g/kg (dry weight); Prunella vulgaris, 440\r\n    \u00b5g/kg; Aspidotis densa, 100 \u00b5g/kg. \r\n\r\n         In marine macroalgae the following platinum concentrations (on\r\n    a dry weight basis) were found near La Jolla, California, USA (Hodge\r\n    et al., 1986): red algae Prionites australis and Opuntiella californica, 0.19 and 0.08 \u00b5g/kg, respectively; brown algae Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica, 0.22 and 0.32\r\n    \u00b5g/kg, respectively. 5.2  General population exposure Two studies were conducted in the USA to establish baseline\r\n    levels of platinum in the tissues and body fluids of the general\r\n    population prior to the introduction of automobile catalysts.\r\n\r\n         Johnson et al. (1975, 1976) analysed autopsy tissue samples\r\n    from 10 people, 12 to 75 years old, who died from a variety of\r\n    causes in Southern California. All samples taken from liver, kidney,\r\n    spleen, lung, muscle, and fat were below the detection limits\r\n    (0.2-2.6 \u00b5g/kg wet weight). Samples collected from 282 people from\r\n    Southern California living near a heavily used urban freeway (Los\r\n    Angeles) or in a desert area near Lancaster also showed platinum\r\n    concentrations below the detection limits (blood, < 31 \u00b5g/litre;\r\n    urine, < 0.6 \u00b5g/litre; hair, < 50 \u00b5g per kg; faeces, < 2 \u00b5g/kg).\r\n    Only in pooled blood samples were detectable concentrations\r\n    measured, i.e. 0.49 \u00b5g/litre in the Los Angeles group and 1.8\r\n    \u00b5g/litre in the Lancaster group.\r\n\r\n         In a second study, tissue samples were taken from autopsied\r\n    individuals from Southern California (95 people) and New York (2\r\n    people), who had not been knowingly exposed to platinum either\r\n    occupationally or by medical treatment (Duffield et al., 1976). In\r\n    42 individuals no platinum was detected. Of the 1313 samples\r\n    collected, only 62, i.e. 5%, had detectable concentrations of\r\n    platinum ranging from 0.003 to 1.46 mg/kg wet weight (mean 0.16\r\n    mg/kg, median 0.067 mg/kg). Table 10 shows the frequency of platinum\r\n    detection in the various tissue samples. The frequency of occurrence\r\n    was taken as a measure of the distribution of platinum among various\r\n    body organs. Platinum was frequently found in subcutaneous fat. This\r\n    is surprising, as most platinum compounds are regarded as lipid-\r\n    insoluble. Other target sites were kidney, pancreas, and liver.\r\n    However, the analytical accuracy has been questioned and\r\n    contamination of the samples suspected (NAS, 1977), because the\r\n    baseline levels found by Johnson et al. (1976) were at least one\r\n    order of magnitude lower. The problem of questionable analytical\r\n    reliability reflects the difficulties in interpreting data on trace\r\n    levels of platinum in the environment and in human tissues and body\r\n    fluids.\r\n\r\n         New data have been provided by Nygren et al. (1990). Using\r\n    absorptive voltametry (see section 2.4.3.5), the background levels\r\n    of platinum in human blood were found to be in the range of 0.1-2.8\r\n    \u00b5g/litre (median 0.6 \u00b5g per litre). These results were verified by\r\n    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using gold as an\r\n    internal standard. 5.3  Occupational exposure during manufacture, formulation, or use Occupational exposure occurs during the mining and processing\r\n    of platinum. However, the most common current occupational exposure\r\n    to soluble platinum compounds is through inhalation in platinum\r\n    refining and catalyst manufacture.\r\n\r\n    Table 10.

(1976)\r\n\r\n         Many countries have set occupational exposure limits. For\r\n    example, in the USA, the time-weighted Threshold Limit Value (TWA-\r\n    TLV) for daily occupational exposure has been established for\r\n    soluble platinum salts at 2 \u00b5g Pt/m3 (ACGIH, 1980, 1990). Many\r\n    countries have adopted this ACGIH value. In addition ACGIH (1980,\r\n    1990) recommended a Threshold Limit Value of 1 mg/m3 for platinum\r\n    metal. In the United Kingdom an occupational exposure limit (8-h\r\n    TWA) of 5 mg/m3 has been proposed for platinum metal as total\r\n    inhalable dust (Health and Safety Executive, 1990). \r\n\r\n         The published data base for platinum concentrations at the\r\n    workplace is meagre. Due to analytical shortcomings older data are\r\n    not considered reliable. In an early investigation (Fothergill et\r\n    al., 1945), a platinum content of less than 5 \u00b5g/m3 in the\r\n    atmosphere in the immediate neighbourhood of a refinery was measured\r\n    using particle filters. In the dry salts handling area, platinum\r\n    concentrations as high as 70 \u00b5g/m3 were found. In another\r\n\r\n    investigation (Hunter et al., 1945), the platinum content in the\r\n    atmosphere at various points in four refineries was estimated. At\r\n    most points concentrations varied between 1.6 and 5 \u00b5g/m3. Higher\r\n    concentrations were found in the neutralization of platinum salts\r\n    (20 \u00b5g/m3), sieving spongy platinum (400-900 \u00b5g/m3), and\r\n    crushing ammonium chloroplatinate (1700 \u00b5g/m3).\r\n\r\n         Workplace measurements in a catalyst production plant in the\r\n    USSR were reported to exceed an air concentration of 2 \u00b5g/m3 in\r\n    33% of the measurements (Gladkova et al., 1974).\r\n\r\n         In a cross-sectional survey (section 9.2), Bolm-Audorff et al.\r\n    (1988) reported workplace measurements at a platinum refinery in the\r\n    Federal Republic of Germany. In 1986, concentrations of between 0.08\r\n    and 0.1 \u00b5g/m3 were measured in the filter press area, but in other\r\n    working areas platinum salt exposure was generally below the\r\n    detection limit of 0.05 \u00b5g/m3. No data were given on the number of\r\n    samples.\r\n\r\n         The results obtained during a four-month period of measurements\r\n    in a US platinum refinery showed that workplace concentrations\r\n    exceeded the occupational limit of 2 \u00b5g/m3 between 50 and 75% of\r\n    the time (Brooks et al., 1990.\r\n\r\n         In samples of blood, urine, faeces, and hair from employees at\r\n    a Canadian mine near Sudbury, platinum concentrations were below the\r\n    limits of detection (0.1 \u00b5g per litre or 0.1 \u00b5g/kg). Tissue samples\r\n    from three out of nine autopsies had detectable platinum\r\n    concentrations in fat (4.5 \u00b5g/kg), lung (3.7 \u00b5g/kg), or muscle (25.0\r\n    \u00b5g per kg) (Johnson et al., 1976). However, since the three\r\n    detectable concentrations were in individuals who, like the other\r\n    six, showed no platinum concentrations in liver, kidney and spleen,\r\n    sample contamination was suggested (NAS, 1977). It was concluded\r\n    that people who work in mining areas probably do not incorporate\r\n    significant amounts of platinum into their body.\r\n\r\n         Blood samples collected from 61 refinery workers in New Jersey\r\n    contained no measurable platinum (less than 1.4 \u00b5g/litre) (Johnson\r\n    et al., 1976). However, platinum levels in 10% of the urine samples\r\n    were above the detection limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/litre, the maximum reported\r\n    value being 2.6 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         Using the method of LeRoy et al. (1977), platinum serum levels\r\n    in 11 platinum refinery workers with positive skin tests were\r\n    analysed. These studies found serum platinum levels ranging from 150\r\n    to 440 \u00b5g/litre (mean = 240 \u00b5g/litre), the quantification limit\r\n    being 100 \u00b5g per litre (Biagini et al., 1985).\r\n\r\n         A special case of possible occupational exposure is the\r\n    handling of cisplatin and its analogues by pharmacy and nursing\r\n    staff and other hospital personnel. In a study with two pharmacists\r\n\r\n    (one male and one female) and eight female nurses, platinum levels\r\n    in urine (0.6-23.1 \u00b5g per litre) were at the limit of sensitivity of\r\n    the AAS method used and did not significantly differ from the\r\n    controls (2.6-15.0 \u00b5g/litre). By comparison, the urine of cisplatin-\r\n    treated patients contained on average 7 mg/litre (Venitt et al.\r\n    1984). 6.  KINETICS AND METABOLISM Most toxicokinetic data on platinum, both for experimental\r\n    animals and humans, have been derived from studies with platinum\r\n    complexes.\r\n\r\n         Moore et al. (1975c) studied the whole body retention, lung\r\n    clearance, distribution, and excretion of 191Pt in outbred albino\r\n    rats (Charles River CD-1 strain) after single nose-only inhalation\r\n    exposure to different chemical forms of platinum for 48 min.\r\n    Particle concentration in the nose-only exposure chambers was\r\n    approximately 5.0 mg per m3 with 191PtCl4, 5-7 mg/m3 with 191Pt(SO4)2, and 7-8 mg/m3 with PtO2 and 191Pt metal.\r\n    The aerodynamic diameter was given as 1.0 \u00b5m for 191PtCl4 and 191Pt(SO4)2; both aerosols were generated by a nebulizer. The 191PtO2 and 191Pt metal aerosols (aerodynamic diameter not\r\n    given) were generated by passing Pt(SO4)2 or PtCl4,\r\n    respectively, through a furnace tube and decomposing them at 600 \u00b0C.\r\n    Whole body counts, showed that most of the inhaled 191Pt was\r\n    rapidly cleared from the body, followed by a slower clearance phase\r\n    during the remaining post-exposure period. The whole body retention\r\n    of 191Pt was approximately 41, 33, 31, and 20%, respectively, of\r\n    the initial body burden 24 h after exposure to 191PtCl4, 191Pt(SO4)2, 191PtO2, and 191Pt metal. After ten days,\r\n    the body burden was only about 1, 5, 8, and 6%, respectively. This\r\n    shows that there was only a slight difference between the clearance\r\n    rates for the various chemical forms, although the clearance of 191PtCl4 seemed to be the fastest. Clearance from the lungs also\r\n    reflected the two-phase pharmacokinetics in the whole body, with a\r\n    fast clearance phase in the first 24 h followed by a slow phase with\r\n    a half-time of about 8 days.\r\n\r\n         Excretion data from the study by Moore et al. (1975c) indicate\r\n    that most of the 191Pt cleared from the lungs by mucociliary\r\n    action was swallowed and excreted via the faeces (half-time 24 h). A\r\n    small fraction of the 191Pt was detected in the urine, indicating\r\n    that little was absorbed by the lungs and the gastrointestinal\r\n    tract. However, no quantitative data were given.\r\n\r\n         As shown in Table 11, the portals of entry, lung and trachea,\r\n    contained most of the platinum, i.e. 93.5% and 3.9%, respectively,\r\n    of the total radioactivity (48 618 counts/g) 1 day after exposure.\r\n    Of the other tissues analysed, highest levels were found in the\r\n    kidney and bone, suggesting some accumulation in these organs. The\r\n    low percentages of 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, on day 1, reflect\r\n    only a low accumulation tendency; no information on the statistical\r\n    significance of these figures was provided.\r\n\r\n    Table 11.

(1975c)\r\n\r\n         In a comparative study on the fate of 191PtCl4 (25 \u00b5Ci per\r\n    animal) in rats following different routes of exposure (Moore et\r\n    al., 1975a,b) retention followed the classical pattern. The highest\r\n    retention was found after intravenous administration, the next\r\n    highest after intratracheal, and the lowest after oral\r\n    administration. For comparison, retention after inhalation was lower\r\n    than after intratracheal administration. However, the total dose was\r\n    much higher with inhalation (7000 \u00b5Ci) than with intratracheal (25\r\n    \u00b5Ci) administration. Only a minute amount of 191PtCl4 given\r\n    orally was absorbed. Most of it passed through the gastrointestinal\r\n    tract and was excreted via the faeces. After 3 days less than 1% of\r\n    the initial dose was detected in the whole body. Following\r\n    intravenous administration, 191Pt was excreted in almost equal\r\n    quantities in both faeces and urine but elimination was slower than\r\n    after oral dosing. After 3 days, whole body retention was about 65%\r\n    and after 28 days it was still 14% of the initial dose. By\r\n    comparison, following intratrachael administration about 22% and 8%,\r\n    respectively, were retained by the body after these periods (Moore\r\n    et al., 1975a,b).\r\n\r\n         In the same studies the tissue distribution of 191Pt was\r\n    determined. After the single oral dose, the kidney and liver\r\n    contained the highest concentrations, while in the other organs\r\n    there were no elevated levels. In contrast, after intravenous\r\n    administration 191Pt was found in all tissues (Table 12). The high\r\n    concentration of 191Pt found in the kidney shows that once\r\n    platinum is absorbed most of it collects in the kidney and is\r\n    excreted in the urine. The liver, spleen, and adrenal gland also\r\n    contained higher platinum concentrations than the blood. The lower\r\n    level in the brain suggests that platinum ions probably cross the\r\n    blood-brain barrier only to a limited extent (Moore et al.,\r\n    1975a,b).\r\n\r\n         This was confirmed by Lown et al. (1980) in male Swiss mice\r\n    given single intragastric doses of Pt(SO4)2 (144 or 213 mg Pt/kg\r\n    body weight). Platinum levels in the blood were several times higher\r\n    than in the brain. Clearance from the whole body was slower than in\r\n    the rat studies. This could be due to species-specific differences.\r\n    In addition, the mice received much higher doses than the rats. Lown\r\n    et al. (1980) noted an enhancing effect of the higher dose on\r\n    absorption.\r\n\r\n         In a long-term study, Holbrook (1977) found evidence that a\r\n    platinum-binding protein is induced. Male Sprague-Dawley rats\r\n    received platinum salts ad libitum either in the drinking-water or\r\n    in the dry feed. The sequential platinum contents in the tissues\r\n    analysed are shown in Table 13. The data demonstrate that the oral\r\n    administration of water-soluble platinum compounds, i.e. PtCl4 and\r\n    Pt(SO4)2, results in accumulation of platinum in some organs,\r\n    primarily the kidney. After 4 weeks, the platinum content of the\r\n    kidney was about 8-fold higher than that of the liver and spleen,\r\n    and at least 16-fold higher than in the blood and testis (except for\r\n    the highest dose of PtCl4). The total platinum intake after 4\r\n    weeks increased by 4.3 times and the platinum content in kidney,\r\n    spleen, and blood increased by at least 7 times as compared with the\r\n    1-week levels. It is notable that a more than 2-fold increase in the\r\n    intake of platinum (after a 4-week consumption of PtCl4 in the dry\r\n    feed; 743 vs. 1616 mg Pt/rat) did not lead to an increase in the\r\n    platinum content of the kidney, in contrast to the situation in the\r\n    liver and spleen. This observation was not corroborated with\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Table 12.

(1975a) also administered 191PtCl4 (25\r\n    \u00b5Ci/animal) intravenously to 15 pregnant rats on day 18 of gestation\r\n\r\n    to determine placental transfer after 24 h. High levels of 191Pt\r\n    radioactivity were found in the kidney (127 064 counts/g) and liver\r\n    (43 375 counts/g), compared with 10 568 counts/g in the blood.\r\n    Accumulation was also found in the placenta (27 750 counts/g). 191Pt was detected in the 60 fetuses examined, but only at very\r\n    low concentrations (an average of 432 counts/g). Thus, the placental\r\n    barrier is crossed to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n         In contrast to the simple platinum salts, the diammine\r\n    complexes such as cisplatin (see footnote in section 1.2) are\r\n    excreted primarily in the urine. In mice, Hoeschele & Van Camp\r\n    (1972) found about 90% of the intraperitoneally injected dose in the\r\n    urine within five days. Little or no excretion occurred via the\r\n    faeces. A high urinary recovery was also observed in rats and dogs\r\n    (Hoeschele & Van Camp, 1972; Lange et al., 1972; Litterst et al.,\r\n    1976a,b, 1979; Cvitkovic et al., 1977). \r\n\r\n         The excretion of both cis- and trans- diamminedichloroplatinum(II) follows a biphasic pattern with a fast\r\n    initial alpha-phase and a second slow \u00df-phase. The variation in the\r\n    plasma half-lives is due to species differences and variations in\r\n    dose, route of administration, time points analysed, and analytical\r\n    method used (Litterst et al., 1979). The extremely rapid alpha-phase\r\n    accounts for early, high levels of platinum in kidney, liver, skin,\r\n    bone, ovary, and uterus. The prolonged \u00df-phase results in detectable\r\n    urine platinum concentrations 30 days after a single dose.\r\n\r\n         For both the simple platinum salts and cisplatin complexes, an\r\n    initial rapid clearance is followed by a prolonged clearance phase\r\n    during the remaining post-exposure period, and there is no evidence\r\n    for markedly different retention profiles between these two groups\r\n    of platinum compounds (Rosenberg, 1980).\r\n\r\n         All animal species studied show a similar organ distribution\r\n    pattern for cisplatin. An initial distribution to nearly all tissues\r\n    is followed by accumulation in the first hour mainly in kidney,\r\n    liver, muscle, and skin. By the end of the first day, plasma levels\r\n    decrease rapidly and there are elevated platinum levels in numerous\r\n    other tissues (Litterst et al., 1979).\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin is extensively bound to plasma proteins; 90% of it\r\n    may be bound 2 h after an intravenous injection. The bound portion\r\n    is no longer cytotoxic (Safirstein et al., 1983; Sternson et al.,\r\n    1984). In addition to its reactivity with plasma protein, renal\r\n    excretion leads to a very low concentration of free cisplatin in the\r\n    plasma and to a rapid accumulation in the kidney. Due to the\r\n    presence of high chloride ion concentrations, cisplatin is\r\n    relatively stable in extracellular fluids (see also section 7.6),\r\n    which explains why it is excreted mainly in the unchanged form in\r\n    human and rat urine (Safirstein et al., 1983). 7.  EFFECTS ON LABORATORY MAMMALS AND IN VITRO TEST SYSTEMS 7.1  Single exposure Acute toxicity data on platinum mainly relate to its\r\n    coordination complexes, the chloroplatinates and ammines. Hofmeister\r\n    (1882) was one of the first to test ammonium salts containing\r\n    divalent and tetravalent platinum with various numbers of ammine\r\n    ligands. He injected solutions of platinum complexes into the dorsal\r\n    lymphatic sac of single frogs and subcutaneously into the dorsal\r\n    skin of single rabbits. The symptoms observed included vomiting and\r\n    diarrhoea with bloody stools and a \"curare-like\" action of the\r\n    salts.\r\n\r\n         The acute toxicity of platinum depends considerably on the\r\n    species of platinum involved (Table 14). Soluble platinum compounds\r\n    are much more toxic. Hence, in the study of Holbrook (1976a) oral\r\n    toxicity to rats decreased in the following order: PtCl4 >\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O > PtCl2 > PtO2. For the two latter\r\n    compounds no LD50 could be derived. \r\n\r\n         Signs of poisoning observed, for example, with\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4], include hypokinesia, piloerection, diarrhoea,\r\n    clonic convulsions, laboured respiration, and cyanosis (Degussa,\r\n    1989a).\r\n\r\n         Hexachloroplatinic acid is highly nephrotoxic in rats. After an\r\n    intraperitoneal LD50 injection of 40-50 mg/kg, rats died of renal\r\n    failure, hypocalcaemia, and hyperkalaemia. The necrotizing renal\r\n    tubular lesions involved the entire renal cortex (Ward et al.,\r\n    1976).\r\n\r\n         In its metallic state, platinum has an extremely low acute\r\n    toxicity. Thus some alloys containing platinum are used in\r\n    protheses. Fine dust particles of metallic platinum, 1-5 \u00b5m in\r\n    diameter, orally administered to rats caused only slight necrotic\r\n    changes in the gastrointestinal epithelium, granular dystrophy of\r\n    hepatocytes, and swelling in the epithelium of the convoluted renal\r\n    tubules (Roshchin et al., 1979, 1984). The highest dose given was\r\n    not lethal. The dose was reported as \"129 \u00b5A/kg\" (25 167 \u00b5g per kg;\r\n    personal communication from Prof. A.V. Roshchin to IPCS dated 3\r\n    April 1991).\r\n\r\n         Due to the different absorption rates for platinum compounds,\r\n    the route of administration also affects the toxicity, the\r\n    intraperitoneal and intravenous routes leading to much higher\r\n    toxicity than the oral route (Table 14).\r\n\r\n        Table 14.

(1975) conducted repeated-dose oral toxicity\r\n    studies on male Sprague-Dawley rats. The soluble salts PtCl4 and\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O were added to the drinking-water, which was\r\n    consumed ad libitum. Within the observation period of 4 weeks, a\r\n    concentration of 0.54 mmol/litre (182 mg PtCl4/litre or 248 mg\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O per litre) did not affect the normal weight\r\n    gain. A 3-fold increase in the platinum concentration to 1.63\r\n    mmol/litre reduced the weight gain by about 20% during the first\r\n    week only; this paralleled a 20% decrease in feed and fluid\r\n    consumption. The dietary administration of PtCl4 at concentrations\r\n    of 0.5 mmol/litre for approximately 30 days or 1.6 mmol/litre for 8\r\n    days (169 and 539 mg/litre, respectively) did not affect the weights\r\n    of any of the five organs investigated, i.e. liver, kidney, spleen,\r\n    heart, and testes. Similarly, the administration of 1.6 mmol per\r\n    litre of Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (734 mg/litre) for 8-9 days did not\r\n    significantly affect organ weights. Total platinum intake for each\r\n    of these three experimental conditions was approximately 50 mg per\r\n    rat. When 1.6 mmol PtCl4/litre (539 mg/litre) was given for about\r\n    30 days (total intake of about 250 mg Pt per rat), the kidney weight\r\n    increased by about 6-10%. No effects on the level of microsomal\r\n    protein or the activities of aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine\r\n    demethylase in liver microsomes were found (Holbrook, 1976b). 7.3  Skin and eye irritation; skin and respiratory sensitization 7.3.1  Skin irritation\r\n\r\n         The dermal irritancy of several platinum compounds was tested\r\n    on albino rabbits using comparable procedures and evaluation\r\n    criteria. Platinum test materials were spread on abraded and intact\r\n    skin sites, located dorsolaterally on the animals' trunks. The skin\r\n    reactions were evaluated after 24, 48, and 72 h, and are summarized\r\n    in Table 15. 7.3.2  Eye irritation\r\n\r\n         Summarized data on eye irritation are presented in Table 15.\r\n    All tested platinum salts were either corrosive or irritating to\r\n    varying degrees. 7.3.3  Skin sensitization\r\n\r\n         In a study by Kolpakova & Kolpakov (1983), platinum\r\n    hydrochlorides administered intravenously to rabbits in repeated\r\n    doses induced sensitization confirmed by the basophil degranulation\r\n    test, neutrophil damage index, leucocyte agglomeration, neutrophil\r\n    alteration, and the drop skin and skin fenestra tests. These data\r\n    are unusual and have not been confirmed in other studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Table 15.

The method used by Campbell et al. (1975)\r\n      is comparable to these tests. c The eye irritation tests on albino rabbits were carried out according to the US Federal Register 1973 Eye Test (Johnson Matthey)\r\n      or according to OECD Guideline No. 405 (Degussa). d Average score from 0.2 (intact skin) and 0.6 (abraded skin); a score of 0-0.9 was considered as \"non-irritant\" by the authors. e Average score from 1.8 (intact skin) and 2.6 (abraded skin); a score of 2 was considered as \"irritant\" by the authors. f Using OECD Test Guideline No. 404 (4-h contact).\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n         Taubler (1977) injected rabbits, guinea-pigs, and mice\r\n    subcutaneously and intravenously with PtSO4 (0.05-0.3 mg/litre\r\n    with and without NH4Cl) three times a week for 4 weeks. No\r\n    induction of an allergic state was found, as measured by skin tests\r\n    (guinea-pigs and rabbits), passive transfer, and footpad tests\r\n    (mice). Administration of platinum-egg-albumin complex also failed\r\n    to sensitize the experimental animals.\r\n\r\n         In a study by Murdoch & Pepys (1985), rats were immunized with\r\n    ovalbumin-platinum. Sera of the animals which were positive in the\r\n    passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) test and a radioallergosorbent\r\n    test (RAST) were pooled and used for PCA tests with other platinum\r\n    salts having differing ligands. A significant cross-reactivity\r\n    between ammonium tetrachloroplatinate(II), ammonium\r\n    hexachloroplatinate(IV), and the conjugated tetrachloroplatinate was\r\n    observed. There was very limited or no cross-reactivity with the\r\n    compounds cesium trichloronitroplatinate(II), cis- diamminedichloroplatinum(II), potassium tetracyanoplatinate(II), and\r\n    tetraammineplatinum(II) chloride. 7.3.4  Skin and respiratory sensitization\r\n\r\n         Biagini et al. (1983) exposed two groups of Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis) to disodium hexachloroplatinate,\r\n    Na2[PtCl6], by nose-only inhalation of 200 and 2000 \u00b5g/m3,\r\n    4h/day, biweekly for 12 weeks. Another group was exposed\r\n    percutaneously to the salt (20 mg/ml) applied biweekly to an open\r\n    patch area in the intrascapular region. Two weeks after termination\r\n    of exposure, bronchoprovocation challenges with Na2[PtCl6] and\r\n    pulmonary function tests were performed. Percutaneous application\r\n    did not affect post-challenge pulmonary function. The 200 \u00b5g/m3 group showed significantly greater pulmonary deficits as compared to\r\n    control animals. Average pulmonary flow resistance (RL) was\r\n    significantly increased, while forced expiratory volume in 0.5\r\n    seconds, corrected for vital capacity (FEV0.5/FVC), was decreased.\r\n    No dermal hypersensitivity was observed. The question of whether the\r\n    observed pulmonary hyper-reactivity is due to a\r\n    superpharmacological, irritant, local immune, or combination\r\n    mechanism is unresolved. The absence of hyper-reactivity in the\r\n    2000-\u00b5g/m3 group suggests a possible pulmonary tolerance\r\n    mechanism, tachyphylaxis, or delay in the development of symptoms at\r\n    higher sensitization concentrations. 7.3.5  Respiratory sensitization\r\n\r\n         In a 12-week inhalation experiment with Cynomolgus monkeys\r\n    exposed to either ammonium hexachloroplatinate (200 \u00b5g/m3) or\r\n    ozone (2000 \u00b5g/m3; 1 ppm) alone or as a combination of both,\r\n    Biagini et al. (1986) found significant allergic platinum dermal\r\n    hypersensitivity, based on concentrations necessary to give a\r\n    positive test, and pulmonary hyper-reactivity only with concomitant\r\n\r\n    exposure to ozone. Inflammation, epithelial damage, cell\r\n    recruitment, and modifications of cellular tight junctions caused by\r\n    ozone may increase the penetration of platinum into the pulmonary\r\n    epithelium and subepithelial tissue. This could lead to increased\r\n    protein binding sites or absorption of the platinum salts and\r\n    finally to the development of pulmonary hyper-reactivity and\r\n    allergic sensitization (Biagini et al., 1986). 7.3.6  Sensitization by other routes\r\n\r\n         Murdoch & Pepys (1984) investigated the immunological responses\r\n    to complex platinum salts in the female hooded Lister rat, a strain\r\n    that produces high and consistent levels of circulating IgE when\r\n    immunized with low doses of antigen together with Bordetella pertussis adjuvant, and that reacts with enhanced synthesis of IgE\r\n    upon secondary boosting. Sensitization with the free salt of\r\n    ammonium tetrachloroplatinate, (NH4)2[PtCl4], was attempted\r\n    via the intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous,\r\n    intratracheal, and footpad routes over a wide range of doses (1 to\r\n    1000 \u00b5g). Both B. pertussis and/or aluminium hydroxide gel were\r\n    added as adjuvants. As shown by direct skin testing using the PCA or\r\n    RAST methods, no sensitization was achieved. However, sensitization\r\n    was obtained by intraperitoneal injection of the platinum salt\r\n    conjugated to ovalbumin (OVA). Antibodies were produced to Pt-OVA\r\n    and to OVA alone. Specific sensitization was demonstrated both by\r\n    PCA challenge with Pt-BSA (no positive PCA reactions were seen with\r\n    BSA alone) and by positive RAST, demonstrated by RAST inhibition\r\n    techniques with a Pt-BSA conjugate. 7.4  Reproductive toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity Only limited experimental data concerning the effects of\r\n    platinum on reproduction, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity are\r\n    available. D'Agostino et al. (1984) studied the embryotoxic effects\r\n    of platinum compounds in Swiss ICR mice. Single doses of either\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O or Na2[PtCl6].6H2O were administered\r\n    intragastrically or subcutaneously, respectively, on the 7th and\r\n    12th day of gestation. The pups were cross-fostered to treated or\r\n    untreated dams at birth and were culled to three animals of each sex\r\n    per litter. In the Pt(SO4)2 study, the LD1 wdose of 200 mg\r\n    Pt/kg caused a reduced offspring weight from day 8 to day 45\r\n    postpartum. The major effect of disodium hexachloroplatinate (20 mg\r\n    Pt/kg) was a reduced activity level exhibited by the offspring of\r\n    dams exposed on the 12th day of gestation. The general activity was\r\n    quantified on an activity field consisting of concentric circles.\r\n    The number of lines crossed during 1 min comprised the activity\r\n    score. On days 60-65 postpartum, open-field behaviour (ambulation\r\n    and rearing), rotarod performance, and passive avoidance learning\r\n    were investigated in the adult offspring. No effects were found\r\n    after administration on the 7th day, but administration on day 12 of\r\n    gestation had significant behavioural effects.\r\n\r\n         Solid platinum, wire or foil, is considered to be biologically\r\n    inert and adverse effects on implantation are probable due to the\r\n    physical presence of a foreign object in the uterus (Barlow &\r\n    Sullivan, 1982).\r\n\r\n         Kraft et al. (1978) reported normal fertility in male rabbits\r\n    with open tube gold/platinum devices inserted into the vas deferens.\r\n    There was an initial decrease in sperm count and motility, but these\r\n    parameters returned to normal after three weeks. At 117-426 days\r\n    after insertion, 7 out of 9 animals were fertile in numerous\r\n    matings.\r\n\r\n         Effects on human sperm motility were investigated by Kesseru &\r\n    Leon (1974). Fresh sperm were incubated for up to 5 h in the\r\n    presence of strips of platinum or other metals. Motility after 2 and\r\n    5 h was 60 and 30%, respectively, compared to 10 and 0% for copper,\r\n    40 and 7% for silver, and 90 and 65% for gold.\r\n\r\n         Platinum wire inserted into the uterus of rats was reported to\r\n    reduce the implantation of fertilized ova. An 83% reduction in the\r\n    number of implantation sites in the affected uterine horn, compared\r\n    to the unoperated horn, was found in rats unilaterally implanted on\r\n    day 3 (Chang et al., 1970). Chang & Tatum (1975) found no effect on\r\n    embryonic or fetal survival if platinum wire was inserted after\r\n    implantation on day 6. Tobert & Davies (1977) showed a 37% reduction\r\n    in the number of implanting ova in the uteri of rabbits containing\r\n    platinum foil. 7.5  Mutagenicity and related end-points The genotoxic effects of platinum compounds have been\r\n    investigated in bacterial systems, mammalian cell cultures and in vitro studies.\r\n\r\n         In bacteria many of the tested platinum compounds were\r\n    moderately mutagenic. Cisplatin and some of its analogues showed the\r\n    greatest mutagenic potential; other platinum compounds were less\r\n    mutagenic.\r\n\r\n         In Ames tests, nearly all using the test strains Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, positive results were reported\r\n    (Lecointe et al., 1977; Andersen, 1979; Suraikina et al., 1979; Life\r\n    Science Research, 1980a; Kanematsu et al., 1980). With\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, mutagenic potential was observed in strain\r\n    TA1537 with and without S-9 metabolic activation (Life Science\r\n    Research, 1980a).\r\n\r\n         The induction of reverse mutations in the plasmid-carrying\r\n    strains TA98 and TA100 indicated base-pair substitution and frame-\r\n    shift mutations (Lecointe et al., 1977; Suraikina et al., 1979;\r\n    Kanematsu et al., 1980). \r\n\r\n         (NH4)2[PtCl6] but not PtCl4 caused base-change mutation\r\n    in Escherichia coli B/r WP2 (Kanematsu et al., 1980).\r\n\r\n         The growth of a Rec strain of Bacillus subtilis was\r\n    significantly inhibited by (NH4)2[PtCl6] (0.1 mol/litre),\r\n    H2[PtCl6] (0.01 mol/litre), and PtCl4 (0.01 mol/litre)\r\n    (Kanematsu et al., 1980).\r\n\r\n         In a mutagenic test with the mouse lymphoma cell line L 5178Y,\r\n    cisplatin, transplatin, and PtCl4 produced significantly higher\r\n    mutation frequencies than occurred in the controls, but\r\n    [Pt(NO2)2](NH3)2 and PtCl2 did not (Sandhu, 1979).\r\n\r\n         Cellular resistance to the toxic effects of two platinum\r\n    complexes was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by\r\n    continuous exposure to K2[PtCl6] and Pt(SO4)2 for 5 and 4\r\n    months, respectively. These cell lines had resistant phenotypes\r\n    stable for at least 55 population doublings in the absence of a\r\n    platinum compound. The induced resistances were interpreted by the\r\n    authors to be a result of mutation and selection (Smith et al.,\r\n    1984).\r\n\r\n         In a micronucleus test in mice involving oral administration of\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, no significant increase in the incidence of\r\n    micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was found. Additionally,\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 did not markedly inhibit bone marrow cell\r\n    division at any level (Life Science Research, 1980b). Also, no\r\n    evidence of induced chromosomal damage leading to micronucleus\r\n    formation in polychromatic erythrocytes was observed after oral\r\n    administration of K2[PtCl4] in mice (Life Science Research,\r\n    1981a).\r\n\r\n         No significant increase in the incidence of aberrant metaphases\r\n    was found in bone marrow cells after subacute oral administration of\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 or K2[PtCl4] to Chinese hamsters (Life\r\n    Science Research, 1981b, 1982).\r\n\r\n         K2[PtCl4] and [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 induced no increase in\r\n    the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster (Life Science Research, 1980c, 1981c).\r\n\r\n         In a structure-mutagenicity study with the CHO:HGPRT-system, cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2] was the most potent of six platinum\r\n    compounds tested. Based on the slope of the mutation induction\r\n    curve, the approximate relative mutagenic activity of cis- [Pt(NH3)2Cl2], K[Pt(NH3)Cl3], and [Pt(NH3)3Cl]Cl was\r\n    100:9:0.3. The mutation frequency for K2[PtCl4] and trans- [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] was related to the concentration used, but was\r\n    not much greater than the maximum spontaneous mutation frequency. No\r\n    mutagenic activity was observed for [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2. The\r\n    relative cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was similar.\r\n\r\n    Additionally, it was found that cis- and trans- [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] bind to DNA after entering the cell, but the\r\n    relative mutagenicities are not a consequence of different initial\r\n    levels of DNA binding (Johnson et al., 1980).\r\n\r\n         Dose-dependent forward mutations were induced by PtCl4 to 8-\r\n    azaguanine resistance (8-AGR/HGPRT locus) in Chinese hamster ovary\r\n    (CHO-S) cells. In addition there was an increased dose-related\r\n    frequency of CHO-AUXB1 reversion (Taylor et al., 1979)\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin, which is not reviewed in detail in this document\r\n    (see footnote in section 1.2), induces structural chromosomal\r\n    aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in cells of rodents\r\n    treated in vivo, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and sister\r\n    chromatid exchanges in both human and rodent cells in vitro, and\r\n    mutation and DNA damage in rodent cells in vitro. Cisplatin is\r\n    also mutagenic in Drosophila, fungal, and bacterial test systems\r\n    (IARC, 1987a). 7.6  Carcinogenicity and anticarcinogenicity No experimental data are available on the carcinogenicity of\r\n    platinum and platinum compounds except for cisplatin (see footnote\r\n    in section 1.2). IARC (1987b) considered sufficient the evidence for\r\n    the carcinogenicity of cisplatin for animals (see chapter 13).\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin and its analogues, however, are exceptional compared\r\n    to the other platinum compounds. This is reflected by the unique\r\n    mechanism for their anti-neoplastic activity demonstrated in in vitro studies (Rosenberg, 1980, 1985). At low doses cisplatin\r\n    produces specific inhibition of DNA synthesis (but not of RNA and\r\n    protein synthesis) by causing DNA lesions such as monofunctional\r\n    adducts, bifunctional binding to a single base moiety, and DNA\r\n    cross-links of inter- and intrastrand types (Harder & Rosenberg,\r\n    1970; Howle & Gale, 1970). There is sufficient evidence that the DNA\r\n    cross-links are responsible for cellular toxicity, but not for anti-\r\n    tumour activity. For the latter, another observation probably plays\r\n    the decisive role; only the cis isomer forms a closed ring chelate\r\n    of the aquated cisplatin with guanine at a certain position of\r\n    guanine. Thus, intrastrand DNA cross-linking is considered to be the\r\n    most important reason for anti-tumour activity. It appears that, due\r\n    to the cisplatin-induced DNA cross-links, the replication of DNA is\r\n    impaired in cancer cells, while in normal cells the cisplatin\r\n    lesions on guanine are repaired before replication (Rosenberg, 1985;\r\n    Pinto & Lippard, 1985).\r\n\r\n         The high chloride concentration of the extracellular fluid (112\r\n    mmol/litre) is sufficient to limit the substitution of water ligands\r\n    for chloride. However, within the cell the platinum complex is\r\n    exposed to low chloride concentrations (4.4 mmol/litre) and\r\n    hydrolysis of the chloride leaving groups can occur (Rosenberg,\r\n\r\n    1975), a process that has been shown to accelerate the rate of\r\n    reaction of platinum with DNA (Johnson et al., 1980) and to increase\r\n    its toxicity (Litterst, 1981). This hydration provides the only\r\n    known activation process required for cisplatin to react with\r\n    molecules in the cell, and metabolic activation is not required\r\n    (Rosenberg, 1980). The binding of cisplatin with plasma proteins, on\r\n    the other hand, is not inhibited by chloride and presumably involves\r\n    a different mechanism (De Conti et al., 1973), such as the strong\r\n    electrophiles on proteins (Cleare, 1977a). 7.7  Other special studies 7.7.1  Effects on alveolar macrophages\r\n\r\n         Rabbit alveolar macrophages exposed to the water-soluble\r\n    platinum(IV) chloride at a concentration of 0.4 mmol/litre (78 mg\r\n    Pt/litre) for a period of 20 h exhibited a 50% reduction in\r\n    macrophage viability. A reduction in phagocytic activity and a\r\n    decrease in total cellular adenosine triphosphate to 50% of the\r\n    value in control macrophages was observed at 0.21 and 0.25\r\n    mmol/litre (41 and 48 mg Pt/litre). Platinum(IV) oxide (PtO2) did\r\n    not dissolve in the culture medium and, hence, was ineffective at\r\n    concentrations as high as 500 mg/litre (Waters et al., 1975). 7.7.2  Non-allergic mediator release\r\n\r\n         Investigations in guinea-pigs, rats, and dogs showed an\r\n    increase in bronchomotility and histamine release after intravenous\r\n    treatment with disodium chloroplatinate, Na2[PtCl6] (Saindelle &\r\n    Ruff, 1969; Parrot et al., 1969). \r\n\r\n         Saindelle & Ruff (1969) noticed dyspnoea one minute after an\r\n    intravenous injection of disodium chloroplatinate (20 mg/kg) into\r\n    guinea-pigs. Within 5 min an intense attack of asthma occurred\r\n    resulting in death. Histamine release occurred following the\r\n    injection and the blood histamine level was greatly increased. The\r\n    injection of a smaller dose (1-2 mg/kg) resulted in bronchospasm\r\n    comparable to that caused by 3 \u00b5g/kg of histamine. Repeated\r\n    injections of histamine caused reproducible changes in bronchial\r\n    motility, whereas the platinum compound caused tachyphylaxis.\r\n\r\n         The intense breathing difficulties observed in these studies\r\n    were presumably due to non-allergenic histamine release. This\r\n    nonspecific histamine release has complicated the interpretation of\r\n    both animal and human studies with respect to the conclusion of\r\n    allergic sensitization. 7.7.3  Effects on mitochondrial function\r\n\r\n         No pronounced effects of platinum on the mitochondrial function\r\n    of liver, heart, lung or kidney cells were observed in an in vitro test on succinate-stimulated O2 uptake 24 and 48 h after\r\n    intragastric administration of 40 and 80 \u00b5mol K2[PtCl6]/litre\r\n    (19 and 38 mg/litre) to Sprague-Dawley rats (Michael et al., 1976). 7.7.4  Effects on the nervous system\r\n\r\n         The open field behaviour of adult Swiss mice has been found to\r\n    be influenced by platinum salts administered intragastrically in the\r\n    form of a single dose or of repeated doses. A single dose of\r\n    Pt(SO4)2 at the LD25 level (213 mg Pt/kg body weight)\r\n    depressed ambulation significantly and rearing marginally. For\r\n    ambulation, this pattern persisted from 4 h to 7 days after\r\n    administration, although the effect was most obvious at 4 h.\r\n    Repeated doses of the same salt at the LD1 level (up to 10 doses\r\n    of 109 mg Pt/kg every 72 h) caused a marginal depression of activity\r\n    and exploratory behaviour (Lown et al., 1980). Also, a single dose\r\n    of Na2[PtCl6] depressed ambulation significantly (Massaro et\r\n    al., 1981).\r\n\r\n         During the course of a reproduction study, behavioural effects\r\n    were observed in the offspring of mice treated with sodium\r\n    hexachloroplatinate (see section 7.4; D'Agostino et al., 1984). 7.7.5  Side effects of cisplatin and its analoguesa As discussed in section 8.3, the therapeutic use of cisplatin\r\n    in humans can be accompanied by several toxic side-effects. In\r\n    animal studies, only some of which are presented in this monograph,\r\n    similar effects were observed.\r\n\r\n         Ward et al. (1976) investigated the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin\r\n    and its analogues in male F-344 (Fischer CDF) rats. An intravenous\r\n    LD50 dose of cisplatin (7.4 mg Pt/kg body weight) caused an\r\n    increase in the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels reaching a\r\n    peak on days 4 to 5. Diarrhoea developed by day 3. Necrotizing\r\n    enteritis of the small intestine, caecum, and colon, cellular\r\n    depletion of bone marrow and thymus, and acute degenerative and\r\n    necrotizing renal tubular lesions also occurred (Ward et al., 1976).\r\n\r\n         Oxoplatinum ( cis-dichlorodiammine-trans-\r\n    dihydroxyplatinum(IV)) also caused marked nephrotoxicity after\r\n    intravenous administration (20 mg/kg as a single dose) to rats.\r\n    However, another cisplatin analogue, CBDCA ( cis-diammine-l,1-\r\n    cyclobutane dicarboxylate platinum(II)), did not result in\r\n    significant changes in renal function parameters (Laznickova et al.,\r\n    1989). a See footnote in section 1.2.\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin has been found to cause bone marrow suppression. The\r\n    surviving fraction of haemopoietic bone-marrow system cells in mice\r\n    decreased from 1 to 0.03 after treatment with an LD50 dose of\r\n    cisplatin (Lelieveld et al., 1984). A 36-53% decrease in lymphocyte\r\n    and granulocyte counts was observed in mouse bone marrow after\r\n    intra-peritoneal treatment with 5 mg cisplatin/kg (Bodenner et al.,\r\n    1986).\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin administered intraperitoneally (6 mg/kg) has been\r\n    shown to affect gastric emptying in rats. There was a large increase\r\n    in the weight of the stomach due to retained food (Whitehouse &\r\n    Garrett, 1984).\r\n\r\n         In dogs, cisplatin given intravenously as a dose of 2 mg/kg\r\n    resulted in a complete interruption of interdigestive myoelectric\r\n    activity of the gastric antrum, duodenum, and jejunum (Chey et al.,\r\n    1988).\r\n\r\n         Ototoxicity has been demonstrated in guinea-pigs. A cisplatin\r\n    dose of 1.5 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally once a day caused\r\n    hearing loss beginning at about the ninth day of administration\r\n    (Hoeve et al., 1987). 7.8  Factors modifying toxicity Physiological levels of selenium administered simultaneously\r\n    with food to mice markedly depressed the acute toxicity of some\r\n    platinum salts by forming inert complexes of high relative molecular\r\n    mass in the presence of protein (Imura, 1986). 8.  EFFECTS ON HUMANS 8.1  General population exposure 8.1.1  Acute toxicity - poisoning\r\n\r\n         Except for one case of poisoning in 1896 (Hardman & Wright,\r\n    1896), no acute poisoning cases have been reported. 8.1.2  Effects of exposure to platinum emitted from automobile\r\n           catalysts\r\n\r\n         An immunological study conducted by Cleare (1977b) addressed\r\n    the question of whether the emitted platinum is allergenic. He\r\n    investigated the response of individuals, who were highly sensitive\r\n    to platinum salt (skin test positive at low platinum salt\r\n    concentrations), to extracts of particulate exhaust samples. The\r\n    total platinum content at the highest concentration was more than 5\r\n    \u00b5g/ml, which would normally be sufficient to elicit a response. Five\r\n    extracts tested on three people, using the skin prick test, did not\r\n    elicit a positive response. 8.2  Occupational exposure The occupational hazards of platinum are principally confined\r\n    to some halogenated complex platinum salts (Rosner & Merget, 1990). 8.2.1  Case reports and cross-sectional studies\r\n\r\n         A report of health problems arising from occupational exposure\r\n    to platinum was produced by Karasek & Karasek (1911). They studied\r\n    workers in photographic studios in Chicago handling photographic\r\n    paper treated with complex platinum salts. The symptoms observed in\r\n    eight workers were pronounced irritation of the nose and throat\r\n    causing violent sneezing and coughing, together with difficulties in\r\n    breathing.\r\n\r\n         Hunter et al. (1945) conducted environmental and clinical\r\n    studies on workers in four British platinum refineries. Out of 91\r\n    workers exposed to complex salts of platinum, 52 showed symptoms\r\n    starting with repeated sneezing and rhinorrhoea, followed by\r\n    tightness of the chest, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and wheezing.\r\n    Scaly erythematous dermatitis of hands and forearms, sometimes also\r\n    affecting the face and neck, and urticaria were observed in 13\r\n    workers. The respiratory tract symptoms persisted during working\r\n    hours and for about one hour after leaving the factory. The latency\r\n    period from the first contact with platinum to the occurrence of the\r\n    first symptoms varied from a few months to six years. Once skin and\r\n    respiratory tract sensitization was established, symptoms tended to\r\n    become worse as long as the workers were exposed to platinum salts.\r\n\r\n         In the USA, Roberts (1951) studied 21 employees of a platinum\r\n    refinery for five years. All workers showed some form of platinum-\r\n    related disease for which Roberts (1951) introduced the term\r\n    \"platinosis\". According to his classification of this occupational\r\n    disease, 40% of the employees did not have typical symptoms but\r\n    exhibited the same inflammatory changes in the conjunctivae and the\r\n    mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract as were seen in the\r\n    60% of the workers with definite symptoms. \r\n\r\n         These observations have been confirmed by other investigators.\r\n    The term \"platinosis\" is no longer used, as it implies a chronic\r\n    fibrosing lung disease. This had been assumed by Roberts (1951) but\r\n    has not been reported elsewhere. The terms \"platinum salt allergy\"\r\n    (Schultze-Werninghaus et al., 1978), \"platinum salt sensitivity\"\r\n    (Linnett, 1987), \"allergy to platinum compounds containing reactive\r\n    halogen ligands\" (Hughes, 1980) and \"platinum salt hypersensitivity\"\r\n    (PSH) have been used, with the latter being preferred.\r\n\r\n         The symptoms typical of platinum salt sensitization (Roshchin\r\n    et al., 1979; Health and Safety Executive, 1983; Brooks et al.,\r\n    1990) include watering of the eyes, sneezing, tightness of the\r\n    chest, wheezing, breathlessness, coughing, eczematous and urticarial\r\n    skin lesions, signs of mucous membrane inflammation.\r\n\r\n         In earlier studies, the prevalence of allergic symptoms due to\r\n    platinum salt exposure was as high as 80% (Table 16) although this\r\n    was not consistently confirmed by skin testing. Estimated workplace\r\n    exposure concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 1700 \u00b5g Pt/m3 (Hunter\r\n    et al., 1945). However, due to analytical deficiencies, these data\r\n    do not allow the quantification of these exposure situations. It can\r\n    be assumed that occupational exposure is much lower today due to\r\n    improved engineering control and occupational exposure limits.\r\n    Airborne dust analyses in a platinum refinery revealed levels\r\n    between 0.08 and 0.1 \u00b5g/m3 in the separation department; in other\r\n    areas the measurements were all below 0.05 \u00b5g/m3 (Bolm-Audorff et\r\n    al., 1988) or below 0.08 \u00b5g/m3 (Merget et al., 1988). Work-related\r\n    symptoms were reported in 8 to 23% of workers exposed to these\r\n    concentrations (Table 16). The risk of developing platinum salt\r\n    hypersensitivity seems to be correlated with the intensity of\r\n    exposure. In the surveys of Bolm-Audorff et al. (1988) and Merget et\r\n    al. (1988), the highest rates of prevalence occurred in the groups\r\n    exposed to the highest concentration.\r\n\r\n    Table 16.

With the\r\n    exception of a single reported case of alleged contact dermatitis\r\n    from a \"platinum\" ring (Sheard, 1955), no allergic reactions have\r\n    been reported.\r\n\r\n         Halogenated platinum salts are among the most potent\r\n    sensitizers. The compounds mainly responsible for platinum\r\n    sensitization are hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6], and the\r\n    chlorinated salts such as ammonium hexachloroplatinate,\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], potassium tetrachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl4],\r\n    potassium hexachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl6], and sodium\r\n    tetrachloroplatinate, Na2[PtCl4]. Cleare et al. (1976)\r\n    investigated the allergenic potency of platinum complexes by means\r\n    of skin prick tests on platinum refinery workers who were known to\r\n\r\n    be sensitive to hexachloroplatinate. Their results suggest that\r\n    platinum allergy is confined to a small group of charged compounds\r\n    that contain reactive ligand systems, the most effective of which\r\n    are chloride ligands. The allergic response generally increases with\r\n    increasing number of chlorine atoms, as demonstrated by the\r\n    following sequence of potency:\r\n\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6] approx. (NH4)2[PtCl4] >\r\n    Cs2[Pt(NO2)Cl3] > Cs2[Pt(NO2)2Cl2] >\r\n    Cs2[Pt(NO2)3Cl]\r\n\r\n         Ionic platinum compounds containing bromide or iodide are also\r\n    allergenic, but are less effective.\r\n\r\n         Non-halogenated complexes such as [Pt{(NH2)2CS}4]Cl2,\r\n    K2[Pt(NO2)4], and [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, and neutral complexes\r\n    such as cisplatin, cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2], are not allergenic,\r\n    probably because they do not react with proteins to form a complete\r\n    antigen. Anaphylactic shock reactions observed after the intravenous\r\n    administration of relatively high doses of cisplatin (Khan et al.,\r\n    1975; Von Hoff et al., 1979) were probably caused by contamination\r\n    with the potent hexa- or tetrachloroplatinate (Pepys, 1983). 8.2.3  Clinical manifestations\r\n\r\n         The latency period from the first exposure to platinum salts to\r\n    the occurrence of the first symptoms usually varies between three\r\n    months and three years (Parrot et al., 1969; Schultze-Werninghaus et\r\n    al., 1978; Ruff et al., 1979; Biagini et al., 1985), but is\r\n    sometimes only a few weeks (Roberts, 1951; Hughes, 1980; Merget et\r\n    al., 1988). \r\n\r\n         The dermatitis observed in the past (Roberts, 1951) is believed\r\n    to have been mainly of a primary irritant nature following exposure\r\n    to strong acids and alkalis. True contact dermatitis (i.e. allergic)\r\n    is extremely rare. However, contact urticaria is seen in sensitized\r\n    people following splashes with platinum salts and in some instances\r\n    this is the first indication of sensitization (Hughes, 1980).\r\n\r\n         The symptoms usually worsen with increasing duration of\r\n    exposure but generally disappear when the subject is removed from\r\n    exposure. The latter was shown by the follow-up study carried out on\r\n    platinum refinery workers who had to cease work with platinum salts\r\n    because of sensitization (Newman-Taylor, 1981). This study found no\r\n    evidence of long-term effects when workers giving a positive skin\r\n    prick test and showing symptoms of platinum sensitization were\r\n    removed immediately from contact with platinum salts. However,\r\n    Schultze-Werninghaus et al. (1989) reported that after long duration\r\n    exposure following sensitization individuals may never become\r\n    completely free of symptoms. Similarly, Biagini et al. (1985)\r\n    demonstrated the existence of positive platinum skin tests at very\r\n\r\n    low concentrations in workers who had been free of occupational\r\n    platinum exposure for periods of up to four years. 8.2.4  Immunological mechanism and diagnosis\r\n\r\n         The clinical manifestations of soluble platinum salt allergy\r\n    reflect a true allergic response based on the following clinical\r\n    criteria (Hughes, 1980; Biagini et al., 1985, 1986; Merget et al.,\r\n    1988; Schultze-Werninghaus et al., 1989):\r\n\r\n    *    the appearance of sensitivity is preceded by a symptomless\r\n         exposure;\r\n\r\n    *    not all exposed individuals become sensitized;\r\n\r\n    *    the affected individuals become increasingly sensitive to\r\n         platinum and react even at very low levels of exposure;\r\n\r\n    *    negative prick test results are obtained in atopic and non-\r\n         atopic controls.\r\n\r\n         The mechanism of platinum salt allergy appears to be a Type I\r\n    (IgE mediated) response. The possibility of the formation of IgE\r\n    antibodies to platinum chloride complexes in sensitized individuals\r\n    has been assumed on the grounds of allergy and serological tests. It\r\n    is believed that platinum salts of low relative molecular mass act\r\n    as haptens combining with serum proteins to form the complete\r\n    antigen. However, the actual immunological mechanism has not yet\r\n    been defined (Zachgo et al., 1985).\r\n\r\n         It has been demonstrated that platinum(II) reacts with the\r\n    sulfur atoms in the six methionine groups in human serum albumin\r\n    (HSA) and that methionine 123 is the primary binding site\r\n    (Grootveld, 1985).\r\n\r\n         Skin prick tests with freshly prepared solutions of soluble\r\n    platinum complexes appear to provide reproducible, reliable,\r\n    reasonably sensitive, and highly specific biological monitors of\r\n    allergenicity (Cleare et al., 1976; Dally et al., 1980). The\r\n    compounds used for routine screening of exposed workers are\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], Na2[PtCl6], and Na2[PtCl4]. After\r\n    sensitization due to previous exposure, prick testing with\r\n    concentrations of the platinum compound in the range of 10-3 to\r\n    10-9 g/ml will produce immediate weal and flare reactions (Pepys\r\n    et al., 1972; Pickering, 1972; Hughes, 1980; Gallagher et al., 1982;\r\n    Biagini et al., 1985; Boggs, 1985; Jacobs, 1987; Linnett, 1987;\r\n    Murdoch & Pepys, 1987; Schultze-Werninghaus et al., 1989). At these\r\n    concentrations, nonspecific skin reactions were not found in atopic\r\n    or non-atopic controls (Pepys et al., 1972; Murdoch & Pepys, 1987;\r\n    Merget et al., 1988).\r\n\r\n         Passive transfer of immediate reactivity to intracutaneous\r\n    tests in humans was demonstrated in the Prausnitz-K\u00fcstner test by\r\n    Freedman & Krupey (1968). Schultze-Werninghaus et al. (1978)\r\n    observed positive reactions in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA)\r\n    in monkeys with serum from a platinum refinery worker. Similar tests\r\n    were performed by Pepys et al. (1979) and Biagini et al., (1985).\r\n    The results, however, were inconsistent, because positive as well as\r\n    negative Prausnitz-K\u00fcstner prick test or PCA reactions were elicited\r\n    in human recipients or in monkeys, respectively. Parish (1970) also\r\n    demonstrated the presence of heat-stable IgG antibodies by passive\r\n    cutaneous anaphylaxis on monkey skin. These results were confirmed\r\n    by Biagini et al. (1985).\r\n\r\n         The sensitivity and reliability of the skin prick test has not\r\n    been achieved in any in vitro test available. In enzyme\r\n    immunoassays (Zachgo et al., 1985; Merget et al., 1988) and in the\r\n    radioallergosorbent test (RAST) (Cromwell et al., 1979; Pepys et\r\n    al., 1979) IgE antibodies specific to platinum chloride complexes\r\n    were found. Although a good correlation with the results of prick\r\n    tests was reported (Cromwell et al., 1979), their practical\r\n    application for screening purposes was questioned because of the\r\n    lack of specificity (Boggs, 1985; Jacobs, 1987; Merget et al.,\r\n    1988). This was shown in a cross-sectional survey of platinum\r\n    refinery workers (Merget et al., 1988). Higher total serum IgE and\r\n    hexachloroplatinate-specific IgE levels in subjects with work-\r\n    related symptoms were noted. However, not all the individuals\r\n    allergic to platinum salt and some of the controls showed binding in\r\n    RAST. Similar effects were seen with in vitro histamine release\r\n    from basophils, which was relatively high in skin-test positive\r\n    workers but even higher in the atopic control group. Histamine\r\n    release with anti-IgE showed a similar pattern, indicating identical\r\n    binding sites of hexachloroplatinate and anti-IgE on the surface of\r\n    cutaneous mast cells and basophils.\r\n\r\n         Biagini et al. (1985) also found significantly higher mean\r\n    total serum IgE levels in platinum refinery workers. However, good\r\n    correlation between the RAST data and the skin test results was\r\n    seen. Of the workers with positive skin tests, 95% (20/22) showed\r\n    higher RAST binding than a control group, whereas only 8.5% (8/94)\r\n    of those with negative skin tests demonstrated positive RAST\r\n    results. \r\n\r\n         Since refinery workers are exposed to more than one platinum-\r\n    group metal salt, the question of cross-reactivity was investigated\r\n    by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) tests. First results\r\n    indicated that platinum (Na2[PtCl6] and (NH4)2[PtCl6]) and\r\n    palladium (Na2[PdCl6]) appear to be equally effective as\r\n    eliciting agents. Five-fold concentrated sera from platinum refinery\r\n    workers produced positive PCA results in monkeys (Biagini et al.,\r\n    1982). No in situ reactions due to palladium salts were reported.\r\n    There was only limited cross-reactivity between platinum and\r\n\r\n    palladium salts in both skin test and RAST. Reactions to the\r\n    platinum-group metals other than platinum were only seen in\r\n    individuals sensitive to platinum salts (Murdoch et al., 1986;\r\n    Murdoch & Pepys, 1987).\r\n\r\n         Instillation in the nose of concentrations of 10-3 to 10-9 g per ml has been used in the past as another method of detecting\r\n    platinum salt sensitivity. A nasal reaction was considered positive\r\n    if itching, sneezing, nasal obstruction or discharge occurred singly\r\n    or in combination within 15 min of the challenge (Pepys et al.,\r\n    1972).\r\n\r\n         Inhalation tests with a mixture of ammonium hexachloroplatinate\r\n    and lactose dust gave immediate asthmatic reactions in sensitized\r\n    individuals and in one case a late asthmatic reaction occurred\r\n    (Pepys et al., 1972).\r\n\r\n         Merget et al. (1990) reported three cases of platinum refinery\r\n    workers with negative skin tests who showed non-specific hyper-\r\n    reactivity and a clearly positive immediate reaction in the\r\n    bronchial provocation test. 8.2.5  Predisposing factors\r\n\r\n         Dally et al. (1980) conducted a retrospective cohort analysis\r\n    in a group of 86 platinum workers entering a United Kingdom refinery\r\n    in 1973-1974. It was found that significantly more atopics left\r\n    employment, but this was apparently irrespective of the development\r\n    of platinum salt allergy. The incidence of the disease did not\r\n    differ significantly between the atopics (14/32 = 44%) and non-\r\n    atopics (21/54 = 39%), although Burge et al. (1979) demonstrated\r\n    that the atopics were sensitized more quickly. Thus, the increased\r\n    leaving rate of atopics cannot be regarded as proof for the atopic\r\n    status being a true predisposing factor, as suggested by Linnett\r\n    (1987). It may, at most, be considered a trend.\r\n\r\n         Merget et al. (1988) examined 27 refinery workers and found no\r\n    evidence to support tobacco smoking as a predisposing factor.\r\n    However, Linnett (1987) found a significant association between\r\n    smoking and the incidence of positive skin test results in life\r\n    table studies of 134 refinery workers. Also, in a longitudinal\r\n    cohort study on 91 platinum refinery workers (86 males, 5 females)\r\n    in the United Kingdom who started work in 1973-1974 and were\r\n    followed up until 1980, the risk of a positive skin test result was\r\n    found to be 4-5 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers\r\n    (Venables et al., 1989). Age, varying from 15-54 years in the\r\n    cohort, was a definite confounding factor. After taking account of\r\n    age, the risk of leaving refinery work was only 1.75 times greater\r\n    in smokers than in non-smokers. The risk from atopy was not\r\n    significant after taking smoking into consideration. \r\n\r\n         Brooks et al. (1990) further studied 107 current and 29\r\n    medically terminated workers, first described by Biagini (1985),\r\n    using platinum skin testing and cold air challenge for evaluation of\r\n    pulmonary hypersensitivity. Of these workers (74 current and 12\r\n    terminated workers), 63% underwent repeat platinum skin testing one\r\n    year later. Among current workers, there was a conversion to\r\n    positive platinum skin tests in five employees (with three of these\r\n    conversions occurring in workers who had positive cold air challenge\r\n    tests a year earlier). Thus, positive cold air challenge (airway\r\n    hyperactivity) appears to have value for predicting conversion to\r\n    positive skin test status with continued occupational exposure. 8.3  Side effects of cisplatina The therapeutic use of cisplatin is often complicated by the\r\n    occurrence of side effects. Prominent among these are\r\n    nephrotoxicity, severe nausea and vomiting, myelotoxicity (bone\r\n    marrow suppression), and ototoxicity.\r\n\r\n         The most important toxic effect of cisplatin occurs in the\r\n    kidney, eventually becoming irreversible during continued treatment.\r\n    For instance, Lippman et al. (1973) found an approximately 50%\r\n    reduction in renal function in each of 16 patients after treatment\r\n    with total doses of 3.0-7.0 mg/kg body weight. Degeneration and\r\n    necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubules, dilation of distal\r\n    tubules, and glomerular abnormalities (elevation of the blood urea\r\n    nitrogen and serum creatine levels, decreased creatine clearance)\r\n    have been reported (Swierenga et al., 1987). A significant\r\n    protection of renal function can be obtained by forced hydration,\r\n    which flushes the drug through the kidney rapidly (Merrin, 1976).\r\n    The simultaneous intravenous administration of mannitol can\r\n    contribute to the prevention of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (Fillastre\r\n    & Raguenez-Viotte, 1989).\r\n\r\n         Gastrointestinal toxicity consists mainly of nausea and\r\n    vomiting lasting from 4 to 6 h and, occasionally in some sensitive\r\n    patients, anorexia for up to one week (Hill et al., 1975).\r\n\r\n         Ototoxicity is another serious side-effect, consisting of\r\n    tinnitus with or without clinical loss of hearing. Early in its\r\n    course it is almost exclusively associated with high-range hearing\r\n    loss in the 4000-8000 Hz range (Von Hoff et al., 1979).\r\n\r\n         Cisplatin can also cause peripheral neuropathy described as\r\n    sensory, affecting primarily large fibres (Mollman et al., 1988). a See footnote in section 1.2.\r\n\r\n         Single cases of allergic reactions, angioneurotic oedema, rash,\r\n    asthma (Von Hoff et al., 1979), cardiac arrest (Vogl et al., 1980),\r\n    gingival discolouration (Ettinger & Freeman, 1979), and tetany due\r\n    to hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia (Hayes et al., 1979) have all\r\n    been reported.\r\n\r\n         There are less toxic analogues, for example, cis- diammine-1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato platinum(II) (Carboplatin,\r\n    JM8) and cis-dichloro- trans-dihydroxybisisopropylamine\r\n    platinum(IV) (JM9). These cause less kidney damage, nausea, and\r\n    vomiting. However, these analogues affect bone marrow and, in\r\n    addition to the negative effects of cisplatin, may inhibit the\r\n    formation of white cells, red cells, and blood platelets (Schacter &\r\n    Carter, 1986; Bradford, 1988). 8.4  Carcinogenicity No data are available to assess the carcinogenic risk of\r\n    platinum or its salts to humans. With respect to cisplatin, IARC\r\n    (1987b) considered the evidence for carcinogenicity for humans to be\r\n    inadequate (see chapter 13). 9.  EFFECTS ON OTHER ORGANISMS IN THE LABORATORY AND FIELD 9.1  Microorganisms Simple complexes of platinum have bactericidal effects. In\r\n    general, charged complexes in solutions, e.g., (NH4)2[PtCl6]\r\n    above a concentration of 1 mg/litre, are lethal for bacteria.\r\n    Neutral complexes are bactericidal only at considerably higher\r\n    concentrations (> 38 \u00b5mol per litre) (Rosenberg et al., 1967;\r\n    Shimazu & Rosenberg, 1973).\r\n\r\n         Rosenberg et al. (1965) reported the discovery of a unique\r\n    property of some simple platinum-group metal complexes. When culture\r\n    medium was subjected to an alternating current using platinum\r\n    electrodes, bacterial cell division was inhibited. The spent medium\r\n    itself was bactericidal. Detailed analysis revealed that the active\r\n    agent was the cis isomer of [PtCl2(NH3)2], i.e. cisplatin. It\r\n    was shown that such neutral platinum complexes, diluted in growth\r\n    media, selectively inhibit cell division without reducing the cell\r\n    growth of a variety of gram-positive and especially of gram-negative\r\n    bacteria. As a result the bacterial rods are forced to form long\r\n    filaments. This effect has been studied most intensively on Escherichia coli with cisplatin. In this case filamentation is\r\n    reversed as soon as the bacterial filaments are transferred to a\r\n    fresh medium free of the drug (Rosenberg et al., 1967).\r\n\r\n         Hoffmann (1988) studied the effects of cisplatin and PtCl4 on\r\n    the in vitro metabolism of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both compounds strongly inhibited DNA, RNA, and ribosome synthesis\r\n    in the mmol/litre range. The IC50 (median inhibitory\r\n    concentration) for the inhibition of DNA synthesis, for instance,\r\n    was 0.42 mmol/litre (126 mg/litre) for cisplatin and 0.2 mmol/litre\r\n    (67 mg per litre) for PtCl4. 9.2  Aquatic organisms 9.2.1  Plants\r\n\r\n         Barnes & Talbert (1984) studied the influence of\r\n    hexachloroplatinic acid (250, 500, and 750 \u00b5g/litre) on the growth\r\n    of the green alga Euglena gracilis using a laboratory \"microcosm\".\r\n    The growth recorded over 32 days was relatively slow, indicating\r\n    that the experiments were conducted under low nutrient conditions,\r\n    although these were not reported by the authors. For example, the\r\n    doubling time of the control culture was about 9 days. Although no\r\n    precise data were given, H2[PtCl6]reduced growth rate and yield\r\n    after 32 days in a dose-dependent manner.\r\n\r\n         After cisplatin was applied to the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes at 2.5 mg/litre, chlorosis was evident and the plants\r\n    were stunted. At the 10-mg/litre level, some plant leaves were\r\n\r\n    necrotic and chlorotic, and the roots were darkened and stunted. The\r\n    most prominent symptom was the appearance of reddish-brown streaks\r\n    on the leaves. These were particularly noticeable on young leaves\r\n    and on the leaves of daughter plants (Farago & Parsons, 1985). 9.2.2  Animals\r\n\r\n         Biesinger & Christensen (1972), using Lake Superior water as a\r\n    medium, studied the effects of various metals on the survival,\r\n    growth, reproduction, and metabolism of the invertebrate Daphnia magna. Chronic (3-week) exposure to hexachloroplatinic acid,\r\n    H2[PtCl6], resulted in an LC50 value of 520 \u00b5g Pt/litre (range\r\n    437-619 \u00b5g per litre). Biochemical measurements and reproductivity\r\n    were much more sensitive parameters than growth. A dose of 62\r\n    \u00b5g/litre caused a 12% reduction in weight gain, 13% reduction in\r\n    total protein, and 20% decrease in glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase\r\n    activity. At concentrations of 14 and 82 \u00b5g/litre, reproduction,\r\n    measured as total number of young, was impaired by 16 and 50%,\r\n    respectively.\r\n\r\n         Ferreira & Wolke (1979) investigated the effects of short-term\r\n    exposure to tetrachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl4], on the coho\r\n    salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch at 8.5\u00b0C and a water hardness of about\r\n    56 mg CaCO3/litre. In the static bioassay, 24-, 48-, and 96-h\r\n    LC50 values of 15.5, 5.2, and 2.5 mg Pt/litre, respectively, were\r\n    found. General swimming activity and opercular movement started to\r\n    be affected at 0.3 mg/litre. Lesions in the gills and the olfactory\r\n    organ were also noted at 0.3 mg/litre or more. Concentrations of\r\n    0.03 and 0.1 mg/litre had no effect. 9.3  Terrestrial organisms A few studies have examined the effects of platinum on plants.\r\n    All were conducted with soluble platinum chlorides.\r\n\r\n         Hamner (1942) investigated the effect of hexachloroplatinic\r\n    acid, H2[PtCl6].6H2O, on the growth of beans and tomato plants\r\n    grown in sand culture. At concentrations of 3 x 10-5 to 15 x\r\n    10-5 mol/kg (5.9-29.3 mg/kg), growth was inhibited and the plants\r\n    showed smaller leaf areas, higher osmotic pressure, and lower\r\n    transpiration rates. They also resisted wilting longer than the\r\n    controls and were less succulent.\r\n\r\n         Tso et al. (1973) reported that platinum increased the nicotine\r\n    content of tobacco plants.\r\n\r\n         In a study by Pallas & Jones (1978) on the uptake of platinum\r\n    by nine horticultural crops (see section 4.1), effects on growth\r\n    were observed. Radish (Raphanus sativus), cauliflower ( Brassica oleracea cv. Snowball), snapbean (Phaseolus vulgaris), sweet\r\n    corn (Zea mays), pea (Pisum sativum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), bell pepper (Capsicum annuum), broccoli ( Brassica oleraceaw cv. Crusader), and turnips (Brassica rapa) were grown\r\n    in hydroponic solution at 25/20 \u00b0C, 60/90% relative humidity, and\r\n    320/400 \u00b5l CO2/litre air for 14/10 h photo- and nyctoperiods,\r\n    respectively. When the seedlings reached an early maturity stage,\r\n    such as flowering in the case of peas, snapbeans, cauliflower,\r\n    tomato, and broccoli, root expansion in the case of turnip and\r\n    radish, and considerable leafiness in the case of corn, platinum\r\n    tetrachloride, PtCl4, was added to fresh nutrient solution to give\r\n    concentrations of 0.057, 0.57, and 5.7 mg Pt/litre. After a 7-day\r\n    treatment, roots and tops were harvested and dried at 80 \u00b0C. As\r\n    shown in Table 17, dry weights were significantly reduced in tomato,\r\n    bell pepper, and turnip tops, and in radish roots at the highest\r\n    platinum concentration. At this level, the buds and immature leaves\r\n    of most species became chlorotic. In some of the species the low\r\n    levels of PtCl4 had a stimulatory effect on growth. In addition,\r\n    transpiration was suppressed at the highest platinum concentration,\r\n    probably due to increased stomatal resistance. Photosynthesis was\r\n    also apparently reduced, consistent with the observed growth\r\n    depression. On the other hand, the stimulation of transpiration and\r\n    growth observed at the two lower concentrations, as compared to the\r\n    control plants, explains the stimulated growth.\r\n\r\n         A stimulation of growth was also observed in seedlings of Setaria verticillata (L. P. Beauv) treated with a low level of\r\n    platinum (0.5 mg Pt/litre) administered as potassium\r\n    tetrachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl4] (Farago & Parsons, 1986). This\r\n    South African grass species was grown in nutrient solution, and\r\n    after two weeks, the length of the longest roots had increased by\r\n    65%. At the higher concentration applied, i.e. 2.5 mg Pt/litre,\r\n    phytotoxic effects were seen in the form of stunted root growth,\r\n    i.e. root length about 75% compared to control, and chlorosis of the\r\n    leaves. As platinum was shown to accumulate in the roots and, at the\r\n    higher level, also in the shoots (see section 4.1), the potential\r\n    use of this grass species, either for the colonisation of flotation\r\n    tailings (a waste product from the concentration of precious metal\r\n    ores) or for the removal of platinum from the tailings, was\r\n    investigated. However, due to a substantial lack of essential\r\n    macronutrients in the tailings, growth of S. verticillata was very\r\n    poor. No platinum was detected in the plants. \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    Table 17.

EVALUATION OF HUMAN HEALTH RISKS AND EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT 10.1  Evaluation of human health risks 10.1.1  General population exposure\r\n\r\n    10.1.1.1  Exposure\r\n\r\n         There is lack of data on the actual exposure situation in\r\n    countries where automobile exhaust gas catalysts have been\r\n    introduced. Therefore, estimates of possible ambient air\r\n    concentrations of platinum are based on emission data and dispersion\r\n    models.\r\n\r\n         Loss of platinum from the pellet-type catalyst, which has never\r\n    been used in Europe and is no longer used on new cars in the USA,\r\n    was found to be up to approximately 2 \u00b5g per km travelled. Of the\r\n    particles emitted, 80% had particle diameters greater than 125 \u00b5m.\r\n    Since no determination of the particle size distribution was\r\n    performed, the percentage of the respirable portion is not known.\r\n    About 10% of the platinum emission was found to be water-soluble. In\r\n    general, these data are based on single or only a few measurements\r\n    and have not been validated.\r\n\r\n         Recent emission data from the new-generation monolith-type\r\n    catalyst indicate that the emission of platinum is lower by a factor\r\n    of 100-1000 than that of the pelleted catalyst. Emissions were on\r\n    average between 2 and 39 ng per km travelled at simulated speeds of\r\n    between 60 and 140 km/h. The mean aerodynamic diameter of the\r\n    particles emitted was 4-9 \u00b5m. These data have been validated by\r\n    repeated measurements using two monolith-type catalysts. However,\r\n    other types of catalysts should be investigated to substantiate\r\n    these emission data. In addition, because of the inadequate data\r\n    base, the speciation is not known exactly, although there is an\r\n    indication that the platinum emitted is in the metallic form or\r\n    consists of surface-oxidized particles.\r\n\r\n         The striking difference between the emission pattern of the two\r\n    catalyst types may be attributable to their basically different\r\n    design.\r\n\r\n         The possible ambient air concentrations of platinum, estimated\r\n    on the basis of these emission data and dispersion models, range\r\n    between 0.005 and 9 ng/m3 for the pellet-type catalyst and between\r\n    0.05 and 90 pg/m3 for the monolith-type catalyst. These\r\n    concentrations are lower by factors of 1 x 105 to 2 x 108 and 1\r\n    x 107 to 2 x 1010, respectively, than the occupational exposure\r\n    limit of 1 mg/m3 established by some countries for platinum metal\r\n    as total inhalable dust.\r\n\r\n         Assuming that 10% of the platinum emission from pelleted\r\n    catalysts contains potentially allergenic soluble platinum\r\n    compounds, the safety factor to the occupational exposure limit for\r\n    soluble platinum salts (2 \u00b5g/m3) would be 2 x 103 to 4 x 106.\r\n    However, there is no evidence that the soluble fraction of the\r\n    platinum emissions is allergenic.\r\n\r\n    10.1.1.2  Health effects\r\n\r\n         Since platinum is most probably not emitted in the form of\r\n    halogenated soluble salts, the sensitization risk from car catalyst\r\n    platinum is very low. There is no substantial evidence of any\r\n    biological effects from automobile platinum emissions. There are\r\n    also no data to substantiate the possibility that very finely\r\n    dispersed metallic platinum could be biologically active upon\r\n    inhalation. 10.1.2  Occupational groups\r\n\r\n    10.1.2.1  Exposure\r\n\r\n         Occupational exposure to platinum occurs in various workplaces\r\n    including mining. However, only exposure to certain halogenated\r\n    soluble salts through inhalation of dusts and skin contact is of\r\n    toxicological relevance. These compounds are mainly encountered\r\n    during platinum refining and catalyst manufacture.\r\n\r\n         There are only limited data to quantify workplace exposure. An\r\n    occupational exposure limit of 2 \u00b5g/m3 for soluble platinum salts\r\n    has been adopted by several countries. There are again limited data\r\n    suggesting that the exposure limit may sometimes be exceeded in\r\n    practice. Before the allergenic potential of soluble platinum salts\r\n    was established, workplace concentrations exceeding the present\r\n    occupational exposure limit by up to one order of magnitude were\r\n    found. However, it should be noted that analytical accuracy was not\r\n    very reliable.\r\n\r\n         Occupational exposure to the anti-tumour agents cisplatin and\r\n    its analogues during manufacturing and use is of importance.\r\n    However, a review and an evaluation of the health effects of these\r\n    compounds are beyond the scope of this document as these substances\r\n    are used primarily as therapeutic agents. In addition, their\r\n    toxicological properties are exceptional compared to other platinum\r\n    compounds.\r\n\r\n    10.1.2.2  Health effects\r\n\r\n         The acute toxicity of platinum salts for animals is low and\r\n    depends on their solubility. Insoluble compounds such at PtCl2 and\r\n    PtO2 have an extremely low acute toxicity and this would also be\r\n    expected for metallic platinum.\r\n\r\n         By far the most significant health effect from exposure to\r\n    soluble platinum salts is sensitization.\r\n\r\n         Some halogenated platinum salts are highly allergenic in\r\n    humans. The compounds mainly responsible for platinum salt\r\n    hypersensitivity (PSH) are hexachloroplatinic acid, H2[PtCl6],\r\n    ammonium hexachloroplatinate, (NH4)2[PtCl6], and potassium\r\n    tetra- and hexachloroplatinate, K2[PtCl4] and K2[PtCl6].\r\n    Except for one unsubstantiated case of alleged contact dermatitis in\r\n    connection with a \"platinum\" ring, there is no evidence for\r\n    sensitization from metallic platinum.\r\n\r\n         The mechanism of platinum salt allergy appears to be a type I\r\n    (IgE mediated) response as established through in vivo and in vitro tests. There is evidence that platinum salts of low relative\r\n    molecular mass act as haptens combining with serum proteins to form\r\n    the complete antigen. \r\n\r\n         The signs and symptoms of allergic reactions due to platinum\r\n    salt exposure include urticaria, itching of skin, eyes, and nose,\r\n    watering of the eyes, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, coughing, wheezing, and\r\n    dyspnoea. The latent period from the first contact with platinum\r\n    salts to the occurrence of the first symptoms varies from a few\r\n    weeks to several years. Once sensitivity is established, even minute\r\n    amounts can elicit immediate and/or late onset of signs and\r\n    symptoms. The symptoms persist during exposure and usually disappear\r\n    on removal from exposure. However, if long-duration exposure occurs\r\n    after sensitization, individuals may never become completely free of\r\n    symptoms. \r\n\r\n         The diagnosis of platinum salt hypersensitivity is usually\r\n    based on a history of work-related symptoms and a positive platinum\r\n    skin prick test. The combination of these has been shown to be\r\n    reasonably sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of platinum salt\r\n    hypersensitivity. In vitro tests appear to be useful for\r\n    epidemiological evaluation, but lack specificity for individual\r\n    dignosis. Symptoms usually worsen as long as the workers remain in\r\n    the contaminated environment.\r\n\r\n         There is good evidence for the association of smoking or\r\n    pulmonary hyper-reactivity and sensitization. The evidence for atopy\r\n    as a predisposing factor is equivocal. This may be due to bias from\r\n    pre-employment screening. \r\n\r\n         Despite the occupational exposure limit of 2 \u00b5g/m3, wthe\r\n    prevalence of positive skin prick tests was found to be between 14\r\n    and 20% in workers exposed to levels of between < 0.05 and 0.1 \u00b5g\r\n    Pt/m3. Since these data were derived from area samples, short\r\n    sharp exposures above this limit could also have been responsible\r\n    for the sensitization observed. The present occupational exposure\r\n    limit might not be sufficient to prevent platinum salt\r\n\r\n    hypersensitization, although it is difficult to reach a firm\r\n    conclusion because of the lack of adequate data. To minimize the\r\n    risk, workplace exposure should be as low as practicable. 10.2  Evaluation of effects on the environment Compared to that of other metals, the total production of\r\n    platinum is low, amounting annually to approximately 100 tonnes.\r\n    There are no data on platinum emissions during production. However,\r\n    because of the high value of platinum, losses are assumed to be low.\r\n    During the use of platinum-containing catalysts, platinum can escape\r\n    into the environment in small amounts, depending on the type of\r\n    catalyst. Of the stationary catalysts used in industry, only those\r\n    used for ammonia oxidation emit a quantifiable amount of platinum.\r\n    This is present in the nitric acid produced, which may be used for\r\n    conversion to nitrate fertilizers. In the USA the annual loss of\r\n    platinum is estimated to be around 200 kg. Since part of this amount\r\n    is distributed fairly uniformly all over the country, a rise in the\r\n    background level of platinum in soil would probably not be detected\r\n    because of the very low likely concentration.\r\n\r\n         Platinum emission from automobile catalysts also contributes to\r\n    a diffuse contamination of the environment. On the basis of the\r\n    emission data derived from the new-generation monolithic-type\r\n    catalysts, total platinum loss from mobile sources would be less\r\n    than that from nitric acid production. For example, at an assumed\r\n    average emission rate of 20 ng platinum per km travelled, 100\r\n    million cars equipped with catalytic converters would emit\r\n    approximately 20 kg per year for an average kilometreage of 10 000\r\n    km per year and per car. This implies that the contamination of the\r\n    environment with platinum is very low or negligible.\r\n\r\n         In comparison, the total loss of platinum from the older design\r\n    pellet-type catalytic converter would have been higher by a factor\r\n    of 100, i.e. 2000 kg per year, most of the platinum being emitted in\r\n    the form of larger particles that would be deposited close to the\r\n    roads. This would also explain platinum levels of up to 0.7 mg/kg\r\n    dry weight found in roadside dust samples near major free-ways in\r\n    the USA.\r\n\r\n         There is limited evidence that most of the platinum emitted is\r\n    in the metallic form, and thus will probably not be bioavailable in\r\n    the soil. Biomethylation of soluble platinum(IV) compounds has been\r\n    demonstrated in the presence of platinum(II). However, from these\r\n    laboratory data produced under abiotic conditions, it is not\r\n    possible to conclude that microorganisms in the environment are able\r\n    to biomethylate platinum complexes.\r\n\r\n         Analysis of Lake Michigan sediments led to the conclusion that\r\n    platinum has been deposited over the past 50 years at a constant\r\n    rate, while lead concentrations have markedly increased. However,\r\n\r\n    since the car catalyst was introduced in the USA only a few years\r\n    before these measurements were performed, these data are\r\n    insufficient for firm conclusions to be drawn.\r\n\r\n         No data on the effects of platinum compounds on environmental\r\n    microorganisms are available. However, from the bactericidal\r\n    activity of platinum complexes it can be assumed that these\r\n    compounds could influence, at appropriate concentrations, microbial\r\n    communities in the environment or, for example, in sewage treatment\r\n    plants. \r\n\r\n         Aquatic and terrestrial plants are affected by platinum\r\n    compounds at concentrations in the mg/litre or mg/kg range. Although\r\n    there is a lack of definite data on platinum levels in the\r\n    environment, it is probable that platinum and platinum compounds do\r\n    not present a risk to naturally occurring organisms at the low\r\n    concentrations expected to occur in the environment. 11.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE\r\n         ENVIRONMENT 11.1  Pre-employment screening and medical evaluations To screen workers at risk of developing platinum salt\r\n    hypersensitivity (PSH), the following should be carried out for all\r\n    employees potentially exposed to soluble platinum salts:\r\n\r\n    *    a questionnaire with particular attention being paid to\r\n         previous respiratory disease, allergy, smoking habits, and\r\n         employment history;\r\n\r\n    *    a complete medical examination, including lung function tests\r\n         (spirometry, flow volume), tests of bronchial reactivity (cold\r\n         air, methacholine, histamine, etc.), and an immunological\r\n         profile including total serum IgE;\r\n\r\n    *    a skin prick test for atopic status using a battery of antigens\r\n         to include house dust mite, tree and grass pollen or other\r\n         equivalent common aeroallergens;\r\n\r\n    *    skin prick tests with freshly prepared, properly buffered\r\n         saline solutions (e.g., 5% v/v glycerol/water containing 2.5 g\r\n         NaCl/litre, 1.37 g NaHCO3/litre, and 2 g phenol per litre) of\r\n         (NH4)2[PtCl6], Na2[PtCl4], and Na2[PtCl6].\r\n         Concentrations used for testing may vary from 10-9 to 10-3 g/ml depending on specific situations. All tests should be\r\n         performed in duplicate and should include a positive and\r\n         negative saline control. 11.2  Substitution with non-allergenic substances An attempt should be made to substitute, whenever practicable,\r\n    non-allergenic for allergenic platinum compounds during refining,\r\n    manufacturing, and use. 11.3  Employment screening and medical evaluations a)   To detect sensitization during employment, skin prick tests\r\n         should be performed on all potentially exposed people at least\r\n         once a year. There is no convincing evidence that repeated\r\n         platinum skin testing could cause sensitization. Quarterly\r\n         testing intervals might be considered during the first two\r\n         years of employment, as sensitization more often occurs during\r\n         this period.\r\n\r\n    b)   If medical symptoms or signs suggest the development of PSH,\r\n         the worker should be removed from any risk of exposure as soon\r\n         as possible. To detect functional changes in the respiratory\r\n         tract, lung function assessment, as described in section 11.1,\r\n         should also be performed at appropriate intervals. 11.4  Workplace hygiene a)   Since PSH can occur despite time-weighted average workplace\r\n         concentrations being consistently below the ACGIH threshold\r\n         limit value (TLV) of 2 \u00b5g/m3, the most effective prevention\r\n         is the improvement of control measures. This includes enclosed\r\n         processing and optimal ventilation in order to reduce exposure\r\n         to platinum salt aerosols and dusts to the lowest practicable\r\n         limit.\r\n\r\n    b)   It has been suggested that high but short-lived platinum\r\n         concentrations resulting from spills or accidents are of\r\n         importance with respect to sensitization. Since the correlation\r\n         between the platinum exposure concentration and the development\r\n         of sensitization is unknown, a recommendation for a reduction\r\n         in the occupational exposure limit cannot be justified.\r\n         However, it is recommended that the commonly used occupational\r\n         exposure limit of 2 \u00b5g/m3 be changed from an 8-h time-\r\n         weighted average (TWA) to a ceiling value and that personal\r\n         sampling devices be used in conjunction with area sampling to\r\n         determine more correctly the true platinum exposure.\r\n\r\n    c)   Engineering controls should always be in place to minimize\r\n         exposure. However, in some circumstances the use of protective\r\n         clothing, including specially designed airstream helmets, may\r\n         be necessary.\r\n\r\n    d)   Workers should be provided with clean overalls solely for use\r\n         in the workplace, and showering facilities. Outdoor clothes\r\n         should not be worn in the workplace. 12.  FURTHER RESEARCH a)   As there appears to be a lack of information concerning the\r\n         concentration-response relationship for the development of PSH\r\n         in experimental animals, studies should be performed to\r\n         investigate the effect of exposure concentration on\r\n         sensitization and to define the thresholds for sensitization\r\n         and elicitation.\r\n\r\n    b)   The effect of predisposing factors such as pulmonary hyper-\r\n         reactivity should be investigated in greater detail to\r\n         determine their applicability for screening and identifying\r\n         individuals at risk of developing PSH.\r\n\r\n    c)   The use of provocation challenge with soluble platinum salts as\r\n         an indicator of sensitization should be investigated to\r\n         determine if it is a more sensitive indicator than skin prick\r\n         tests.\r\n\r\n    d)   The majority of human occupational studies regarding PSH were\r\n         performed as cross-sectional studies at platinum refineries.\r\n         Due to the inherent lack of sensitivity of this type of study\r\n         with respect to past exposures and workers leaving employment\r\n         because of disease, longitudinal studies should be performed to\r\n         determine the true incidence of PSH in worker populations. In\r\n         addition, human studies should be designed to study, for\r\n         instance, exposure concentration effects on sensitization and\r\n         determine thresholds for sensitization and elicitation.\r\n\r\n    e)   The extent of occupational and environmental exposure to\r\n         cisplatin is not known at the present time. It is recommended\r\n         that studies be initiated to determine exposure during the\r\n         manufacture and use of this compound.\r\n\r\n    f)   Further measurements of the quantities and speciation of\r\n         platinum emitted from automobile catalysts should be performed.\r\n\r\n    g)   The toxic effects of finely divided metallic platinum on humans\r\n         and animals have not been studied adequately. Adequate\r\n         inhalation studies are initially required, and further tests\r\n         may be necessary.\r\n\r\n    h)   Quality control programmes should be initiated to ensure the\r\n         accuracy and precision of sampling methods and analyses and to\r\n         facilitate comparability.\r\n\r\n    i)   Platinum-containing exhaust emissions from automobile catalysts\r\n         most probably do not pose an adverse health effect for the\r\n         general population. However, to be on the safe side, the\r\n         possibility should be kept under review. 13.  PREVIOUS EVALUATIONS BY INTERNATIONAL BODIES The carcinogenicity of platinum and platinum compounds has not\r\n    been evaluated by international bodies, except for cisplatin, which\r\n    has not been covered in detail in this Environmental Health Criteria\r\n    monograph (see also footnote in section 1.2).\r\n\r\n         The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 1987b)\r\n    considered the evidence for carcinogenicity of cisplatin for animals\r\n    to be sufficient, but that for humans inadequate. Cisplatin is\r\n    classified in Group 2A, i.e. probably carcinogenic to humans.

Identit\u00e9, propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physiques et chimiques et m\u00e9thodes\r\n        d'analyse Le platine (Pt) est un m\u00e9tal noble, mall\u00e9able et ductile de\r\n    couleur blanc argent dont le num\u00e9ro atomique est 78 et le poids\r\n    atomique 195,9. On le trouve principalement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat naturel sous la\r\n    forme des isotopes 194Pt (32,9 %), 195Pt (33,8 %) et 196Pt\r\n    (25,3 %). Son \u00e9tat d'oxydation maximum est de +6, les \u00e9tats +2 et +4\r\n    \u00e9tant les plus stables.\r\n\r\n         Le m\u00e9tal ne se corrode pas \u00e0 l'air quelle que soit la\r\n    temp\u00e9rature mais il peut \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 par les halog\u00e8nes, les\r\n    cyanures, le soufre et ses compos\u00e9s en fusion, les m\u00e9taux lourds et\r\n    les hydroxydes alcalins. L'attaque par l'eau r\u00e9gale ou par Cl2/HCl\r\n    (acide chlorhydrique concentr\u00e9 dans lequel on fait barboter du\r\n    chlore) produit l'acide hexachloroplatinique, H2(PtCl6), un\r\n    important complexe du platine. Lorsqu'il est chauff\u00e9, le sel\r\n    d'ammonium de l'acide hexachloroplatinique produit une substance\r\n    gris\u00e2tre appel\u00e9e \"mousse de platine\". La r\u00e9duction d'une solution\r\n    aqueuse d'acide hexachloro-platinique donne une poudre noire\r\n    dispers\u00e9e appel\u00e9e \"noir de platine\".\r\n\r\n         En solution aqueuse, les esp\u00e8ces chimiques dominantes sont des\r\n    complexes. Beaucoup de ces sels complexes sont solubles dans l'eau\r\n    en particulier ceux qui contiennent des ligands donneurs comme les\r\n    halog\u00e8nes ou l'azote. Le platine, comme les autres m\u00e9taux du m\u00eame\r\n    groupe, ont une forte tendance \u00e0 r\u00e9agir sur les compos\u00e9s carbon\u00e9s,\r\n    en particulier les alc\u00e8nes et les alcynes pour former des complexes\r\n    de coordination de Pt(II).\r\n\r\n         On dispose de diverses m\u00e9thodes d'analyse pour le dosage du\r\n    platine. La spectom\u00e9trie d'absorption atomique et la spectroscopie\r\n    d'\u00e9mission en plasma sont tr\u00e8s s\u00e9lectives et sp\u00e9cifiques et\r\n    constituent les m\u00e9thodes de choix pour le dosage du platine dans les\r\n    \u00e9chantillons d'origine biologique ou environnementale. Dans\r\n    diff\u00e9rents milieux, on a obtenu avec ces m\u00e9thodes des limites de\r\n    d\u00e9tection de l'ordre du \u00b5g par kg ou par litre.\r\n\r\n         La spectroscopie d'\u00e9mission atomique en plasma induite par\r\n    haute fr\u00e9quence (PIHF) est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'absorption atomique\r\n    \u00e9lectrothermique du fait que les effets de matrice sont plus faibles\r\n    et qu'il y a possibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter simultan\u00e9ment l'analyse d'autres\r\n    \u00e9l\u00e9ments. 2.  Sources d'exposition humaine et environnementale La concentration moyenne du platine dans la lithosph\u00e8re, c'est-\r\n    \u00e0-dire la cro\u00fbte rocheuse de la terre, est estim\u00e9e \u00e0 0,001-0,005\r\n    mg/kg. On trouve le platine soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat natif (m\u00e9tallique) soit en\r\n\r\n    combinaison, dans un certain nombre de min\u00e9raux. Les sources\r\n    d'importance \u00e9conomique se trouvent en R\u00e9publique d'Afrique du Sud\r\n    et en URSS. La teneur en platine de ces gisements est de 1-500\r\n    mg/kg. Au Canada, les m\u00e9taux du groupe du platine (platine,\r\n    palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium et ruth\u00e9nium) sont pr\u00e9sents dans\r\n    les minerais sulfur\u00e9s de cuivre et de nickel \u00e0 une concentration\r\n    moyenne de 0,3 mg/kg; l'affinage du cuivre et du nickel porte cette\r\n    concentration \u00e0 plus de 50 mg/kg. De petites quantit\u00e9s sont\r\n    extraites de mines situ\u00e9es aux Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique, en Ethiopie,\r\n    aux Philippines et en Colombie.\r\n\r\n         La production mini\u00e8re mondiale des m\u00e9taux du groupe du platine,\r\n    constitu\u00e9e \u00e0 40-50% de platine, augmente r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement depuis les\r\n    deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies. En 1971, la production \u00e9tait de 127\r\n    tonnes, dont 51-64 tonnes de platine. Depuis l'apparition du pot\r\n    d'\u00e9chappement catalytique, la production mini\u00e8re mondiale de ces\r\n    m\u00e9taux est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 environ 270 tonnes (dont 108-153 tonnes de\r\n    platine) en 1987. En 1989, la demande totale de platine dans le\r\n    monde occidental \u00e9tait d'environ 97 tonnes.\r\n\r\n         La principale utilisation du platine tient \u00e0 ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s\r\n    catalytiques exceptionnelles. Les autres applications industrielles\r\n    sont bas\u00e9es sur d'autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s remarquables de ce m\u00e9tal, en\r\n    particulier sa r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 la corrosion chimique dans un grand\r\n    intervalle de temp\u00e9rature, son point de fusion \u00e9lev\u00e9, sa ductilit\u00e9\r\n    et sa grande r\u00e9sistance m\u00e9canique. Le platine est \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9\r\n    en joaillerie et en art dentaire.\r\n\r\n         Certains complexes du platine, en particulier le cis- diamminedichloroplatine(II) ou cisplatine sont utilis\u00e9s en\r\n    th\u00e9rapeutique.a On ne dispose pas de donn\u00e9es sur les \u00e9missions de platine\r\n    d'origine industrielle. Lors de l'utilisation de catalyseurs \u00e0 base\r\n    de platine, une certaine quantit\u00e9 de m\u00e9tal peut s'\u00e9chapper dans\r\n    l'environnement selon le type de catalyseur. Parmi les catalyseurs\r\n    fixes utilis\u00e9s dans l'industrie, seuls ceux qui servent \u00e0\r\n    l'oxydation de l'ammoniac d\u00e9gagent des quantit\u00e9s importantes de\r\n    platine. a Cette monographie traite sp\u00e9cialement du platine et de\r\n         certains de ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s importants du point de vue\r\n         professionnel ou \u00e9cologique. Une \u00e9tude d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des effets\r\n         toxiques du cisplatine en tant que m\u00e9dicament anti-canc\u00e9reux et\r\n         de ses analogues chez l'homme et l'animal sortirait du cadre de\r\n         cette s\u00e9rie car il s'agit de produits utilis\u00e9s essentiellement\r\n         comme agents th\u00e9rapeutiques. En outre leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s toxiques\r\n         sont exceptionnelles compar\u00e9es \u00e0 celles des autres d\u00e9riv\u00e9s du\r\n         platine. \r\n\r\n         Les catalyseurs de v\u00e9hicules automobiles constituent des\r\n    sources mobiles de platine. Selon des donn\u00e9es limit\u00e9es, l'attrition\r\n    des anciens catalyseurs en granul\u00e9s se situe entre 0,8 et 1,9 \u00b5g/par\r\n    km parcouru. Environ 10% de ce platine est soluble dans l'eau.\r\n\r\n         Les r\u00e9sultats fournis par des mesures au banc d'essai montrent\r\n    que les pots catalytiques \u00e0 trois voies utilisant des catalyseurs\r\n    monolithiques de la nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration r\u00e9duisent les \u00e9missions\r\n    totales de platine d'un facteur de 100-1000 par rapport aux\r\n    catalyseurs en granul\u00e9s. A des vitesses simul\u00e9es de 60, 100 et 140\r\n    km/heure on a constat\u00e9 que l'\u00e9mission totale de platine se situait\r\n    entre 3 et 39 ng/m3 dans les gaz d'\u00e9chappement, ce qui correspond\r\n    environ \u00e0 2-39 ng par kilom\u00e8tre parcouru. Le diam\u00e8tre a\u00e9rodynamique\r\n    moyen des particules \u00e9mises variait, lors des diff\u00e9rents essais,\r\n    entre 4 et 9 \u00b5m. D'apr\u00e8s quelques indices, on peut penser que la\r\n    majeure partie du platine est \u00e9mise sous forme de m\u00e9tal ou de\r\n    particules oxyd\u00e9es en surface. 3.  Transport, r\u00e9partition et transformation dans l'environnement Les m\u00e9taux du groupe du platine sont rares dans le milieu\r\n    ambiant, comparativement aux autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Dans les zones tr\u00e8s\r\n    industrialis\u00e9es, on peut trouver d'importantes quantit\u00e9s de platine\r\n    dans les s\u00e9diments des cours d'eau. On pense que les mati\u00e8res\r\n    organiques, par exemple les acides humiques et fulviques, se lient\r\n    au platine, cette r\u00e9action \u00e9tant sans doute facilit\u00e9e par des\r\n    conditions convenables de pH et de potentiel redox dans le milieu\r\n    aquatique.\r\n\r\n         Dans le sol, la mobilit\u00e9 du platine d\u00e9pend du pH, du potentiel\r\n    redox, de la teneur en chlore de l'eau qui impr\u00e8gne le sol et de\r\n    l'\u00e9tat naturel du platine dans les roches primaires. On estime que\r\n    le platine n'est mobilis\u00e9 que dans des conditions d'acidit\u00e9 extr\u00eame\r\n    ou lorsque l'eau du sol est tr\u00e8s riche en chlore.\r\n\r\n         On a montr\u00e9 qu' in vitro certains complexes du platine(IV)\r\n    pouvaient \u00eatre m\u00e9thyl\u00e9s en pr\u00e9sence de platine(II) par la\r\n    m\u00e9thylcobalamine bact\u00e9rienne dans des conditions abiotiques. 4.  Concentrations dans l'environnement et exposition humaine La base de donn\u00e9es relatives aux concentrations dans\r\n    l'environnement est tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e en raison de la tr\u00e8s faible teneur\r\n    de celui-ci en platine et des probl\u00e8mes d'analyse que cela pose.\r\n\r\n         Les concentrations de platine dans des \u00e9chantillons d'air\r\n    ambiant pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d'autoroutes aux Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique\r\n    avant l'introduction du pot catalytique se situaient en dessous de\r\n    la limite de d\u00e9tection de 0,05 pg/m3. Un certain nombre de donn\u00e9es\r\n    r\u00e9centes en provenance d'Allemagne indiquent qu'\u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des\r\n    routes, des concentrations de platine dans l'air ambiant\r\n\r\n    (\u00e9chantillons de mati\u00e8re particulaire) vont de moins de 1 pg/m3 \u00e0\r\n    13 pg/m3. Dans les zones rurales, ces concentrations \u00e9taient du\r\n    m\u00eame ordre de grandeur (moins de 0,6 \u00e0 1,8 pg/m3).\r\n\r\n         A proximit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate des routes, les concentrations de platine\r\n    dans l'air ambiant qui r\u00e9sultent de l'introduction de catalyseurs en\r\n    granul\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 partir de mod\u00e8les de dispersion et sur\r\n    la base des donn\u00e9es exp\u00e9rimentales relatives aux \u00e9missions. Etant\r\n    donn\u00e9 que l'\u00e9mission totale de platine d'un catalyseur de type\r\n    monolithique est plus faible, sans doute d'un facteur allant de 100\r\n    \u00e0 1000, que celle d'un catalyseur en granul\u00e9s, les concentrations en\r\n    platine provenant de ce type de catalyseur devraient \u00eatre de l'ordre\r\n    du picogramme au femtogramme par m\u00e8tre cube.\r\n\r\n         En divers endroits de Californie, on a trouv\u00e9, dans la\r\n    poussi\u00e8re d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sur les plantes \u00e0 larges feuilles, des\r\n    concentrations de 37-680 \u00b5g/kg de poids sec. Le nombre\r\n    d'\u00e9chantillons \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 mais les r\u00e9sultats montrent tout de m\u00eame\r\n    que le pot catalytique lib\u00e8re du platine dans l'environnement\r\n    imm\u00e9diat des routes.\r\n\r\n         Des cultures de gramin\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es dans des serres\r\n    exp\u00e9rimentales pendant quatre semaines \u00e0 des gaz d'\u00e9chappement\r\n    l\u00e9g\u00e8rement dilu\u00e9s provenant d'un moteur \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un catalyseur \u00e0\r\n    trois voies (vitesse simul\u00e9e 100 km/heure): \u00e0 la limite de d\u00e9tection\r\n    de 2ng par gramme de poids sec, on n'a pas trouv\u00e9 de platine.\r\n\r\n         Des analyses effectu\u00e9es sur les s\u00e9diments du lac Michigan ont\r\n    montr\u00e9 que du platine s'y \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 depuis une cinquantaine\r\n    d'ann\u00e9es \u00e0 un rythme assez uniforme. Des concentrations dans des\r\n    carottes de 1 \u00e0 20 cm \u00e9taient comprises entre 0,3 et 0,4 \u00b5g/kg de\r\n    poids sec seulement. \r\n\r\n         On ne signale pas la pr\u00e9sence de platine dans les eaux douces,\r\n    en revanche de fortes concentrations (730 \u00e0 31 220 \u00b5g/kg de poids\r\n    sec) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mesur\u00e9es dans les s\u00e9diments d'un canal tr\u00e8s pollu\u00e9 du\r\n    Rhin en Allemagne. \r\n\r\n         Dans des \u00e9chantillons de bois de Pinus flexilis on a trouv\u00e9\r\n    des concentrations de platine allant de 0 (non d\u00e9celable) \u00e0 56 \u00b5g/kg\r\n    (poids des cendres). Toutefois la teneur du sol voisin \u00e9tait du m\u00eame\r\n    ordre et ces donn\u00e9es plut\u00f4t limit\u00e9es n'indiquent aucune tendance \u00e0\r\n    l'accumulation.\r\n\r\n         Dans des \u00e9chantillons isol\u00e9s de v\u00e9g\u00e9taux provenant d'un sol\r\n    extr\u00eamement basique, on a mesur\u00e9 des teneurs en platine allant de\r\n    100 \u00e0 830 \u00b5g/kg (poids sec).\r\n\r\n         Dans des \u00e9chantillons d'eau de mer, on a relev\u00e9 des\r\n    concentrations allant de 37 \u00e0 332 pg/litre. Des carottes de s\u00e9diment\r\n    pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es dans le Pacifique oriental pr\u00e9sentaient des teneurs en\r\n\r\n    platine allant de 1,1 \u00e0 3 \u00b5g/kg (poids sec). La concentration la\r\n    plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e (21,9 \u00b5g/kg) a \u00e9t\u00e9 mesur\u00e9e dans des s\u00e9diments oc\u00e9aniques\r\n    \u00e0 distance du littoral. Les algues macroscopiques marines pr\u00e9sentent\r\n    des teneurs en platine allant de 0,08 \u00e0 0,32 \u00b5g/kg de poids sec.\r\n\r\n         Dans la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le taux de platine sanguin se situe\r\n    entre 0,1 et 2,8 \u00b5g/litre. Dans le s\u00e9rum de travailleurs expos\u00e9s au\r\n    platine de par leur activit\u00e9 professionnelle, on a relev\u00e9 des\r\n    concentrations de 150 \u00e0 440 \u00b5g/litre.\r\n\r\n         La base de donn\u00e9es relative aux concentrations de platine sur\r\n    les lieux de travail est limit\u00e9e. En raison de probl\u00e8mes d'analyse,\r\n    les donn\u00e9es anciennes (0,9 \u00e0 1700 \u00b5g/m3) ne sont probablement pas\r\n    fiables. Toutefois on peut d\u00e9duire de ces donn\u00e9es que l'exposition\r\n    aux sels de platine \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque plus forte que la limite\r\n    d'exposition professionnelle de 2 \u00b5g/m3 qui est actuellement en\r\n    vigueur dans la plupart des pays. Des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9centes effectu\u00e9es sur\r\n    les lieux de travail font \u00e9tat de concentrations qui sont, soit\r\n    inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la limite de d\u00e9tection de 0,05 \u00b5g/m3, soit comprises\r\n    entre 0,08 et 0,1 \u00b5g/m3. 5.  Cin\u00e9tique et m\u00e9tabolisme Une seule exposition de 48 minutes par la voie respiratoire \u00e0\r\n    du platine sous diff\u00e9rentes formes chimiques (5-8 mg/m3) a montr\u00e9\r\n    que le 191Pt inhal\u00e9 \u00e9tait rapidement \u00e9limin\u00e9 de l'organisme. On\r\n    observe ensuite une phase d'\u00e9limination plus lente au cours de la\r\n    p\u00e9riode suivant l'exposition. Dix jours apr\u00e8s exposition \u00e0 du 191PtCl4, du 191Pt(SO4), du 191PtO2 et du 191Pt sous\r\n    forme m\u00e9tallique, la r\u00e9tention du 191Pt dans l'ensemble de\r\n    l'organisme \u00e9tait respectivement de 1, 5, 8 et 6% de la dose\r\n    initiale. La majeure partie du 191Pt a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e des poumons\r\n    par l'action de l'ascenseur mucociliaire puis aval\u00e9e et excr\u00e9t\u00e9e\r\n    dans les mati\u00e8res f\u00e9cales (temps de demi-\u00e9limination, 24 h.). Une\r\n    petite fraction du 191Pt a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cel\u00e9e dans les urines, ce qui\r\n    indique que la r\u00e9sorption est tr\u00e8s faible au niveau des poumons et\r\n    des voies digestives.\r\n\r\n         Lors d'une \u00e9tude sur la destin\u00e9e compar\u00e9e du 191PtCl4 administr\u00e9 \u00e0 des rats selon diff\u00e9rentes voies \u00e0 raison de 25uCi par\r\n    animal, on a constat\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la voie intraveineuse qui\r\n    entra\u00eenait la r\u00e9tention la plus forte, suivie par la voie\r\n    intratrach\u00e9enne. Elle \u00e9tait minimale apr\u00e8s administration par voie\r\n    orale. Etant donn\u00e9 que seule une tr\u00e8s faible partie du produit\r\n    administr\u00e9 par voie orale a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sorb\u00e9e, l'essentiel a travers\u00e9 les\r\n    voies digestives et a \u00e9t\u00e9 excr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les mati\u00e8res f\u00e9cales. Au bout\r\n    de trois jours, on ne d\u00e9celait plus dans l'ensemble de l'organisme\r\n    que moins de 1% de la dose initiale. Apr\u00e8s administration\r\n    intraveineuse, le 191Pt se retrouvait en quantit\u00e9s pratiquement\r\n    \u00e9gales dans les mati\u00e8res f\u00e9cales et dans l'urine. L'\u00e9limination\r\n    \u00e9tait plus faible qu'apr\u00e8s administration orale. Au bout de cette\r\n\r\n    m\u00eame p\u00e9riode le taux de r\u00e9tention dans l'ensemble de l'organisme\r\n    \u00e9tait d'environ 65% et au bout de 28 jours il se situait encore \u00e0\r\n    14% de la dose initiale. A titre de comparaison, au bout de ces deux\r\n    intervalles de temps environ 22 et 8% respectivement de la dose\r\n    initiale demeuraient dans l'organisme apr\u00e8s administration intra-\r\n    trach\u00e9enne.\r\n\r\n         Les principaux sites d'accumulation sont les reins, le foie, la\r\n    rate et les glandes surr\u00e9nales. La forte quantit\u00e9 de 191Pt\r\n    retrouv\u00e9e dans les reins montre qu'une fois absorb\u00e9, le platine\r\n    s'accumule en majeure partie dans ces organes d'o\u00f9 il est excr\u00e9t\u00e9\r\n    dans l'urine. La quantit\u00e9 plus faible trouv\u00e9e dans le cerveau montre\r\n    que les ions platine ne traversent qu'en faible proportion la\r\n    barri\u00e8re h\u00e9mo-m\u00e9ning\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n         Contrairement aux sels solubles dans l'eau, le PtO2, qui est\r\n    insoluble, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sorb\u00e9 qu'en quantit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s faibles, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s\r\n    administration dans la nourriture \u00e0 dose tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire\r\n    correspondant \u00e0 une dose totale de platine de 4308 mg par rat sur\r\n    une p\u00e9riode de quatre semaines.\r\n\r\n         Qu'il s'agisse des sels simples ou du cisplatine, il est \u00e9tabli\r\n    que l'\u00e9limination se fait en deux phases : une phase initiale rapide\r\n    suivie d'une phase prolong\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode suivant\r\n    l'exposition, et que rien ne permet de penser que les modalit\u00e9s de\r\n    r\u00e9tention soient tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. Toutefois le cisplatine est tr\u00e8s\r\n    stable dans les liquides extracellulaire en raison de la forte\r\n    concentration en ions chlorure qui suppriment l'hydratation. Ainsi\r\n    s'explique que cette substance soit excr\u00e9t\u00e9e presque enti\u00e8rement\r\n    sous forme inchang\u00e9e. Contrairement au cas des sels simples, elle\r\n    est excr\u00e9t\u00e9e principalement dans les urines. 6.  Effets sur les mammif\u00e8res de laboratoire et les syst\u00e8mes\r\n        d'\u00e9preuve in vitro La toxicit\u00e9 aigu\u00eb du platine est principalement fonction de la\r\n    forme sous laquelle il se trouve. Les sels solubles sont beaucoup\r\n    plus toxiques que les sels insolubles. Par exemple la toxicit\u00e9 par\r\n    voie orale pour les rats (DL50) d\u00e9cro\u00eet dans l'ordre suivant:\r\n    Na2[PtCl6] (25-50 mg/kg) > (NH4)2[PtCl6] (195-200 mg/kg)\r\n    > PtCl4 (240 mg/kg) > Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (1010 mg/kg) >\r\n    PtCl2(> 2000 mg/kg) > PtO2 (> 8000 mg/kg). En ce qui concerne\r\n    ces deux derniers compos\u00e9s on n'a pas pu calculer la valeur de la\r\n    DL50.\r\n\r\n         Des tests cutan\u00e9s pratiqu\u00e9s sur des lapins albinos ont montr\u00e9\r\n    que PtO2, PtCl2, K2[PtCl4], [Pt(NO2)2(NH3)2],\r\n    Pt(C5H7O2)2 et trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] pouvaient \u00eatre\r\n    consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme non irritants. Par contre (NH4)2[PtCl6],\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4], Na2[PtCl6], Na2[Pt(OH)6],\r\n\r\n    K2[Pt(CN)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, et cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2]\r\n    se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s irritants mais \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers.\r\n\r\n         Des tests d'irritation oculaire ont montr\u00e9 que tous les\r\n    compos\u00e9s test\u00e9s avaient une action irritante. Le trans- [PtCl2(NH3)2] ainsi que (NH4)2[PtCl4] se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s\r\n    corrosifs.\r\n\r\n         De tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s respiratoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es\r\n    apr\u00e8s injection intraveineuse de complexes chloroplatiniques \u00e0 des\r\n    cobayes et \u00e0 des rats, vraisemblablement par suite d'une lib\u00e9ration\r\n    d'histamine d'origine non allergique. Cette lib\u00e9ration asp\u00e9cifique\r\n    d'histamine complique l'interpr\u00e9tation des \u00e9tudes sur l'animal et\r\n    sur l'homme en ce qui concerne le diagnostic de la sensibilisation\r\n    allergique. Apr\u00e8s injection sous-cutan\u00e9e et intraveineuse de\r\n    Pt(SO4)2, trois fois par semaine pendant quatre semaines, on n'a\r\n    pas constat\u00e9 l'apparition d'un \u00e9tat allergique, \u00e0 en juger d'apr\u00e8s\r\n    les r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9preuves cutan\u00e9es effectu\u00e9es sur des cobayes et\r\n    des lapins, le transfert passif et les tests sur le coussinet\r\n    plantaire de la souris. L'administration d'un complexe\r\n    platine/albumine d'oeuf n'a pas non plus entra\u00een\u00e9 de sensibilisation\r\n    chez les animaux de laboratoire.\r\n\r\n         On a essay\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s de sensibiliser des rats Lister\r\n    femelles avec du t\u00e9trachloroplatinate d'ammonium,\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4] par administration intrap\u00e9riton\u00e9ale,\r\n    intramusculaire, intradermique, sous-cutan\u00e9e, intratrach\u00e9enne, et\r\n    dans le coussinet plantaire en pr\u00e9sence de Bordetella pertussis comme adjuvant; la sensibilisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e par un test cutan\u00e9\r\n    direct, un test d'anaphylaxie cutan\u00e9e passive (PCA) ou un test avec\r\n    radio-allergo-absorbant (RAST). Toutefois le test PCA a donn\u00e9 un\r\n    r\u00e9sultat positif apr\u00e8s administration de conjugu\u00e9s\r\n    platine/prot\u00e9ines.\r\n\r\n         Chez des singes Cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) expos\u00e9s \u00e0 de\r\n    l'hexachloroplatinate de sodium, Na2[PtCl6] exclusivement en\r\n    inhalations nasales \u00e0 la dose de 200 \u00b5g par m3, 4 h par jour, deux\r\n    fois par semaine pendant 12 semaines, on a observ\u00e9 un d\u00e9ficit\r\n    pulmonaire sensiblement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que chez les t\u00e9moins. Dans le cas\r\n    de l'hexachloroplatinate d'ammonium, il a fallu exposer les animaux\r\n    simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 de l'ozone (200 \u00b5/m3) pour obtenir une\r\n    hypersensibilisation cutan\u00e9e et une hyperr\u00e9activit\u00e9 pulmonaire\r\n    significatives.\r\n\r\n         Des \u00e9tudes sur des rats Sprague-Dawley m\u00e2les ont montr\u00e9 que des\r\n    sels comme PtCl4 (182 mg/litre d'eau de boisson) et comme\r\n    Pt(SO4).4H2O (248 mg/litre) n'affectaient pas le gain de poids\r\n    au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'observation de 4 semaines. En triplant la\r\n    concentration de platine, il y a eu une r\u00e9duction de 20% du gain de\r\n    poids, mais seulement pendant la premi\u00e8re semaine, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0\r\n    une diminution de 20% de la prise de nourriture et de boisson.\r\n\r\n         On ne dispose que de donn\u00e9es exp\u00e9rimentales limit\u00e9es \u00e0 propos\r\n    des effets du platine sur la reproduction, et plus particuli\u00e8rement\r\n    \u00e0 propos de ses \u00e9ventuels effets embryotoxiques et t\u00e9ratog\u00e8nes. Le\r\n    Pt(SO4)2 (200 mg Pt/kg) a provoqu\u00e9 la mise bas de souriceaux\r\n    Swiss ICR de poids r\u00e9duit du jour 8 au jour 45 du post-partum. Le\r\n    principal effet de Na2[PtCl6] (20 mg Pt/kg) a consist\u00e9 dans une\r\n    r\u00e9duction de l'activit\u00e9 de la prog\u00e9niture lorsque les m\u00e8res avaient\r\n    \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es le douzi\u00e8me jour de la gestation. Les fils et les\r\n    feuilles de platine sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme inertes biologiquement et\r\n    les effets nocifs constat\u00e9s apr\u00e8s implantation dans l'ut\u00e9rus de\r\n    rattes et de lapines \u00e9taient probablement dus \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence physique\r\n    d'un corps \u00e9tranger.\r\n\r\n         Apr\u00e8s administration \u00e0 des rattes gravides d'une dose de 191Pt \u00e9gale \u00e0 25 microcuries par animal, le 18\u00e8me jour de la\r\n    gestation, on a constat\u00e9 un passage limit\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la barri\u00e8re\r\n    foeto-placentaire.\r\n\r\n         Plusieurs d\u00e9riv\u00e9s du platine se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s mutag\u00e8nes dans un\r\n    certain nombre de syst\u00e8mes bact\u00e9riens. Lors d'\u00e9tudes comparatives on\r\n    a constat\u00e9 que la mutag\u00e9nicit\u00e9 du cisplatine \u00e9tait plusieurs fois\r\n    sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des autres compos\u00e9s. Des \u00e9tudes in vitro ont\r\n    montr\u00e9 que, dans le syst\u00e8me cellulaire mammalien CHO-HGPT,\r\n    l'activit\u00e9 mutag\u00e8ne relative s'\u00e9tablissait selon la proportion\r\n    100:9:0,3 respectivement pour les compos\u00e9s suivants: cis- [PtCl2(NH3)2], K[PtCl3(NH3)], et [Pt(NH3)3Cl]Cl. La\r\n    mutag\u00e9nicit\u00e9 de K2[PtCl4] et du trans-[PtCl2(NH3)] \u00e9tait\r\n    marginale, tandis que le [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 n'\u00e9tait pas mutag\u00e8ne.\r\n    Les compos\u00e9s K2[PtCl4] et [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 ne l'\u00e9taient pas\r\n    non plus dans les tests suivants: mutation r\u00e9cessive l\u00e9thale li\u00e9e au\r\n    sexe chez Drosophila melanogaster, recherche de micronoyaux dans\r\n    des cellules de souris et le test sur moelle osseuse de hamster. On\r\n    ne poss\u00e8de de donn\u00e9es exp\u00e9rimentales sur la canc\u00e9rog\u00e9nicit\u00e9 des\r\n    d\u00e9riv\u00e9s du platine que dans le cas du cisplatine pour lequel les\r\n    preuves d'une activit\u00e9 canc\u00e9rog\u00e8ne chez l'animal sont suffisantes.\r\n    Cependant le cisplatine et ses analogues font plut\u00f4t figure\r\n    d'exception si on les compare aux autres d\u00e9riv\u00e9s du platine. Cela\r\n    transpara\u00eet dans leur activit\u00e9 antitumorale, dont le m\u00e9canisme est\r\n    tr\u00e8s particulier. On pense que celle-ci est, semble-t-il, due \u00e0 la\r\n    formation de ponts intercat\u00e9naires qui ne se produit qu'en pr\u00e9sence\r\n    de l'isom\u00e8reciset pour une certaine position de la guanine. Les\r\n    cellules tumorales ne sont plus en mesure de se r\u00e9pliquer, alors que\r\n    les cellules normales conservent leur capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9plication apr\u00e8s\r\n    avoir r\u00e9par\u00e9 les l\u00e9sions provoqu\u00e9es par le cisplatine. 7.  Effets sur l'homme L'exposition aux sels de platine se limite essentiellement aux\r\n    ambiances de travail, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux ateliers d'affinage du\r\n    platine et aux unit\u00e9s de production de catalyseurs.\r\n\r\n         Les compos\u00e9s principalement responsables de l'hyper-sensibilit\u00e9\r\n    aux sels de platinea sont l'acide hexachloroplatinique\r\n    H2[PtCl6]et un certain nombre de sels comme\r\n    l'hexachloroplatinate d'ammonium (NH4)2[PtCl6], le\r\n    t\u00e9trachloroplatinate de potassium, K2[PtCl4], et le\r\n    t\u00e9trachloroplatinate de sodium, Na2[PtCl4]. Les complexes dans\r\n    lesquels il n'y a pas d'halog\u00e8nes coordonn\u00e9s au platine (complexes\r\n    non halog\u00e9n\u00e9s), comme K2[Pt(NO2)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 et\r\n    [Pt{(NH2)2CS}4]Cl2, de m\u00eame que les complexes neutres comme\r\n    le cis-[PtCl2(NH3), ne sont pas allerg\u00e9niques car ils\r\n    r\u00e9agissent avec les prot\u00e9ines pour former un antig\u00e8ne complet.\r\n\r\n         Les sympt\u00f4mes de cette hypersensibilit\u00e9 sont les suivants:\r\n    urticaire, dermatite de contact, ainsi qu'un certain nombre de\r\n    troubles respiratoires, comme reniflement, essouflement, cyanose et\r\n    asthme grave. La p\u00e9riode de latence entre le premier contact avec\r\n    des sels de platine et l'apparition des sympt\u00f4mes dure de quelques\r\n    semaines \u00e0 plusieures ann\u00e9es. Apr\u00e8s sensibilisation les sympt\u00f4mes\r\n    ont tendance \u00e0 s'aggraver aussi longtemps que les travailleurs sont\r\n    expos\u00e9s sur leur lieu de travail, mais ils disparaissent, en\r\n    g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, d\u00e8s que cesse l'exposition. Toutefois, si une exposition de\r\n    longue dur\u00e9e fait suite \u00e0 la sensibilisation, les sympt\u00f4mes risquent\r\n    de ne jamais dispara\u00eetre compl\u00e8tement.\r\n\r\n         Bien qu'il soit impossible de tirer des donn\u00e9es publi\u00e9es une\r\n    relation dose-effet qui ne soit pas ambigu\u00eb, il semble que le risque\r\n    d'apparition d'une hyper-sensibilit\u00e9 aux sels de platine soit en\r\n    corr\u00e9lation avec l'intensit\u00e9 de l'exposition. Le platine m\u00e9tallique\r\n    ne semble pas \u00eatre allerg\u00e9nique. A l'exception d'un cas unique de\r\n    dermatite de contact, aucune r\u00e9action allergique n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e.\r\n\r\n         Les manifestations cliniques de l'hypersensibilit\u00e9 aux sels de\r\n    platine sont celles d'une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9action allergique. Le\r\n    m\u00e9canisme de cette r\u00e9action est du type 1 (m\u00e9diation par les IgE).\r\n    Sur la base d'\u00e9preuves in vivo et in vitro on pense que chez les\r\n    sujets sensibles il se forme des anticorps IgE dirig\u00e9s contre les\r\n    complexes chloroplatiniques. Les sels de platine de faible masse\r\n    mol\u00e9culaire relative se comportent comme des hapt\u00e8nes qui se\r\n    combinent aux prot\u00e9ines pour former des antig\u00e8nes complets. a Le terme platinose n'est plus usit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9signer les\r\n         affections provoqu\u00e9es par les sels de platine, car il implique\r\n         une fibrose pulmonaire chronique du type silicose. Il est\r\n         pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'utiliser le terme allergie aux sels de platine, ou\r\n         allergie aux compos\u00e9s du platine contenant des ligands\r\n         halog\u00e9n\u00e9s r\u00e9actifs ou mieux, hypersensibilit\u00e9 aux sels de\r\n         platine. \r\n\r\n         Les tests cutan\u00e9s avec des sels de platine dilu\u00e9s permettent de\r\n    surveiller les r\u00e9actions allergiques de mani\u00e8re reproductible,\r\n    fiable, assez sensible et tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifique. Pour les contr\u00f4les de\r\n    routine en milieu professionnel on utilise les compos\u00e9s suivants:\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl6], Na2[PtCl6] et Na2[PtCl4]. Il n'existe\r\n    pas d'\u00e9preuve in vitro dont la sensibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9\r\n    approchent celles des tests cutan\u00e9s. Des tests immunoenzymatiques ou\r\n    par immunoallergosorption ont permis de mettre en \u00e9vidence des\r\n    anticorps IgE sp\u00e9cifiques dirig\u00e9s contre les complexes chlor\u00e9s du\r\n    platine. Il y avait corr\u00e9lation avec les r\u00e9sultats des tests cutan\u00e9s\r\n    mais l'utilisation du test RAST reste probl\u00e9matique en raison de son\r\n    manque de sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9.\r\n\r\n         Les tests cutan\u00e9s et l'\u00e9preuve RAST montrent qu'il n'existe\r\n    qu'une faible r\u00e9activit\u00e9 crois\u00e9e entre les sels de platine et les\r\n    sels de palladium. Des r\u00e9actions d'hypersensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres\r\n    m\u00e9taux du groupe du platine ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es, mais\r\n    seulement chez des personnes allergiques aux sels de platine.\r\n\r\n         Le tabagisme, l'atopie et l'hyperr\u00e9activit\u00e9 pulmonaire\r\n    asp\u00e9cifique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'hypersensibilit\u00e9 aux sels de\r\n    platine et pourraient \u00eatre des facteurs pr\u00e9disposants.\r\n\r\n         En ce qui concerne la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on manque de donn\u00e9es\r\n    sur l'exposition effective dans les pays o\u00f9 le pot catalytique est\r\n    devenu obligatoire. Les concentrations dans l'air ambiant estim\u00e9es\r\n    d'apr\u00e8s de nouvelles donn\u00e9es sur les \u00e9missions et sur la base de\r\n    mod\u00e8les de dispersion sont probablement inf\u00e9rieures d'au moins un\r\n    facteur 10 000 \u00e0 la limite d'exposition professionnelle de 1 mg/m3 adopt\u00e9e par certains pays pour le platine total inhalable sous forme\r\n    de poussi\u00e8res. Etant donn\u00e9 que le platine est tr\u00e8s probablement\r\n    pr\u00e9sent dans les \u00e9missions sous forme m\u00e9tallique, le potentiel de\r\n    sensibilisation du platine \u00e9mis par les pots catalytiques est\r\n    probablement tr\u00e8s faible. M\u00eame si une partie du platine \u00e9mis est\r\n    soluble et potentiellement allerg\u00e9nique, la marge de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 par\r\n    rapport \u00e0 la limite d'exposition professionnelle pour les sels\r\n    solubles de platine (2 \u00b5g/m3) serait d'au moins 2000.\r\n\r\n         Lors d'une \u00e9tude immunologique pr\u00e9liminaire, on a pratiqu\u00e9 des\r\n    tests cutan\u00e9s sur trois volontaires au moyen d'extraits de mati\u00e8res\r\n    particulaires \u00e9mises par des v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 moteur. On n'a pas observ\u00e9\r\n    de r\u00e9ponse positive.\r\n\r\n         On ne dispose d'aucune donn\u00e9e sur les risques de\r\n    canc\u00e9rog\u00e9nicit\u00e9 pour l'homme attribuables au platine et \u00e0 ses sels.\r\n    Pour ce qui est du cisplatine les preuves de canc\u00e9rog\u00e9nicit\u00e9 sont\r\n    jug\u00e9es insuffisantes. 8.  Effets sur d'autres organismes au laboratoire et dans la nature Les complexes simples du platine ont des effets bact\u00e9ricides.\r\n    En observant que les complexes neutres comme le cisplatine\r\n    inhibaient s\u00e9lectivement la division cellulaire sans r\u00e9duction de la\r\n    croissance chez diverses bact\u00e9ries gram-positives mais aussi, et\r\n    surtout, gram-n\u00e9gatives on a eu l'id\u00e9e de les utiliser comme agents\r\n    anticanc\u00e9reux.\r\n\r\n         On a observ\u00e9 qu'au sein d'un \"microcosme\" de laboratoire, la\r\n    croissance des algues vertes du genre eugl\u00e8ne \u00e9tait inhib\u00e9e en\r\n    pr\u00e9sence d'acide hexachloroplatinique soluble aux concentrations de\r\n    250, 500, et 750 \u00b5g/litre. Le cisplatine a provoqu\u00e9 une chlorose et\r\n    un ralentissement de la croissance chez la jacinthe d'eau Eichornia crassipes\u00e0 la concentration de 2,5 mg/litre. \r\n\r\n         Apr\u00e8s 3 semaines d'exposition \u00e0 de l'acide\r\n    hexachloroplatinique, H2[PtCl6], on a observ\u00e9 chez la daphnie\r\n    une mortalit\u00e9 correspondant \u00e0 une CL50 de 520 \u00b5g de Pt par litre.\r\n    Aux concentrations de 14 et 82 \u00b5g/litre, la reproduction (nombre de\r\n    jeunes daphnies) \u00e9tait r\u00e9duite dans la proportion de 16 et 50%\r\n    respectivement.\r\n\r\n         Apr\u00e8s exposition de saumons (Oncorhyncus kisutch) \u00e0 de\r\n    l'acide t\u00e9trachloroplatinique pendant une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode de temps\r\n    dans des conditions statiques, on a observ\u00e9 que les valeurs de la\r\n    CL50 \u00e9taient respectivement \u00e9gales \u00e0 15,5, 5,2 et 2,5 mg Pt/litre\r\n    au bout de 24, 48, et 96 h. On constatait, \u00e0 la dose de 0,3\r\n    mg/litre, une diminution globale de l'activit\u00e9 natatoire et du\r\n    mouvement des opercules. Aux concentrations sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 cette\r\n    valeur, des l\u00e9sions apparaissaient au niveau des branchies et de\r\n    l'organe olfactif. Les concentrations de 0,03 et 0,1 mg/litre\r\n    \u00e9taient sans effet.\r\n\r\n         Toutes les \u00e9tudes consacr\u00e9es aux effets du platine sur les\r\n    plantes terrestres concernent uniquement les chlorures solubles. A\r\n    des concentrations allant de 3.10-5 \u00e0 15.10-5 mol/kg (5,9-29,3\r\n    mg/kg) il y a eu inhibition de la croissance de plants de haricots\r\n    et de tomates en sol sableux. Neuf vari\u00e9t\u00e9s horticoles en culture\r\n    hydroponique ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction de leur poids \u00e0 sec apr\u00e8s\r\n    adjonction de t\u00e9trachlorure de platine aux concentrations\r\n    respectives de 0,057, 0,57, et 5,7 mg Pt/litre; il s'agissait de\r\n    tomates, de poivrons, de fanes de navets et pour la concentration la\r\n    plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e, de radis. A cette concentration les bourgeons et les\r\n    feuilles immatures devenaient chlorotiques chez la plupart des\r\n    esp\u00e8ces. En revanche, chez certaines esp\u00e8ces, le t\u00e9trachlorure de\r\n    platine stimulait la croissance. Par ailleurs, la teneur la plus\r\n    \u00e9lev\u00e9e en platine supprimait la transpiration, sans doute par\r\n    accroissement de la r\u00e9sistance des stomates. On constatait \u00e9galement\r\n    une stimulation de la croissance aux faibles teneurs en platine (0,5\r\n    mg/litre), lorsque l'on ajoutait au milieu nutritif d'une gramin\u00e9e\r\n\r\n    sud-africaine (Setaria vertillata) dut\u00e9trachloroplatinate de\r\n    potassium. Au bout de deux semaines, la racine la plus longue avait\r\n    pouss\u00e9 de 65%. A la concentration utilis\u00e9e, soit 2,5 mg Pt/litre, on\r\n    observait des effets phytotoxiques tels que rabougrissement des\r\n    racines et chlorose foliaire. RESUMEN 1.  Identidad, propiedades f\u00edsicas y qu\u00edmicas, m\u00e9todos anal\u00edticos El platino (Pt) es un metal noble maleable, d\u00factil, de color\r\n    plateado blanquecino; su n\u00famero at\u00f3mico es 78 y su peso at\u00f3mico\r\n    195,09. Sus is\u00f3topos naturales m\u00e1s abundantes son 194Pt (32,9%), 195Pt (33,8%), y 196Pt (25,3%). En los compuestos de platino, el\r\n    estado de oxidaci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima es +6; los estados +2 y +4 son los m\u00e1s\r\n    estables.\r\n\r\n         Aunque el metal no se corroe en el aire a ninguna temperatura,\r\n    es sensible a los hal\u00f3genos, los cianuros, el azufre, los compuestos\r\n    de azufre fundentes, los metales pesados y los hidr\u00f3xidos de\r\n    \u00e1lcalis. La digesti\u00f3n con agua regia o Cl2/HCl (\u00e1cido clorh\u00eddrico\r\n    concentrado por el que se burbujea cloro) produce \u00e1cido\r\n    hexacloroplat\u00ednico, H2[PtCl6], un importante complejo de\r\n    platino. Cuando se calienta, la sal am\u00f3nica del \u00e1cido\r\n    hexacloroplat\u00ednico produce una esponja gris de platino. La reducci\u00f3n\r\n    en soluci\u00f3n acuosa produce un polvo dispersivo de color negro\r\n    (\"negro de platino\").\r\n\r\n         Las propiedades qu\u00edmicas de los compuestos del platino en\r\n    soluci\u00f3n acuosa se ven dominadas por los compuestos complejos.\r\n    Muchas de las sales, particularmente las que llevan ligandos\r\n    donadores de hal\u00f3geno o de nitr\u00f3geno, son solubles en agua. El\r\n    platino, al igual que los otros metales de su grupo, tiene una\r\n    pronunciada tendencia a reaccionar con los compuestos del carbono,\r\n    especialmente los alquenos y los alquinos, formando complejos de\r\n    coordinaci\u00f3n Pt(II).\r\n\r\n         Existen diversos m\u00e9todos anal\u00edticos para la determinaci\u00f3n del\r\n    platino. La espectrometr\u00eda de absorci\u00f3n at\u00f3mica (EAA) y la\r\n    espectroscopia de emisi\u00f3n de plasma son sumamente selectivas y\r\n    espec\u00edficas y constituyen el m\u00e9todo de elecci\u00f3n para analizar el\r\n    platino presente en muestras biol\u00f3gicas y medioambientales. Con esos\r\n    m\u00e9todos se han alcanzado en diversos medios l\u00edmites de detecci\u00f3n del\r\n    orden de unos cuantos \u00b5g/kg o \u00b5g/litro.\r\n\r\n         La espectroscopia de emisi\u00f3n at\u00f3mica con plasma de arg\u00f3n\r\n    acoplado por inducci\u00f3n es preferible a la EAA electrot\u00e9rmica por sus\r\n    menores efectos matriciales y por la posibilidad de analizar\r\n    simult\u00e1neamente muchos elementos. 2.  Fuentes de la exposici\u00f3n humana y ambiental Se calcula que la concentraci\u00f3n media de platino en la\r\n    litosfera o corteza terrestre es del orden de 0,001-0,005 mg/kg. El\r\n    platino se encuentra en forma met\u00e1lica o en varias formas minerales.\r\n    Existen fuentes econ\u00f3micamente importantes en la Rep\u00fablica de\r\n    Sud\u00e1frica y en la URSS. El contenido de platino de esos dep\u00f3sitos es\r\n\r\n    de 1-500 mg/kg. En el Canad\u00e1, los metales del grupo del platino\r\n    (platino, paladio, iridio, osmio, rodio, rutenio) se encuentran en\r\n    menas de sulfuro de cupron\u00edquel con una concentraci\u00f3n media de 0,3\r\n    mg/kg, pero esa concentraci\u00f3n supera los 50 mg/kg durante el afinado\r\n    del cobre y el n\u00edquel. En los EE.UU., Etiop\u00eda, Filipinas y en\r\n    Columbia se extraen peque\u00f1as cantidades.\r\n\r\n         La producci\u00f3n minera mundial de metales del grupo del platino,\r\n    de la cual el 40-50% corresponde al platino, ha aumentado\r\n    uniformemente durante los \u00faltimos 20 a\u00f1os. En 1971, la producci\u00f3n\r\n    fue de 127 toneladas (51-64 toneladas de platino). A ra\u00edz de la\r\n    introducci\u00f3n del catalizador de los gases de escape en los\r\n    autom\u00f3viles, la producci\u00f3n minera mundial de metales del grupo del\r\n    platino aument\u00f3 hasta aproximadamente 270 toneladas (108-135\r\n    toneladas de platino) en 1987. En 1989, la demanda total de platino\r\n    en el mundo occidental fue de unas 97 toneladas.\r\n\r\n         El uso principal del platino deriva de sus excepcionales\r\n    propiedades catal\u00edticas. Las dem\u00e1s aplicaciones industriales\r\n    aprovechan otras notables propiedades, en particular la resistencia\r\n    a la corrosi\u00f3n qu\u00edmica en un amplio intervalo de temperaturas, su\r\n    elevado punto de fusi\u00f3n, su gran resistencia mec\u00e1nica y su buena\r\n    ductilidad. El platino se usa asimismo en joyer\u00eda y odontolog\u00eda. \r\n\r\n         Ciertos complejos de platino, en particular el cis- diaminodicloroplatino(II) (cisplatino), tienen aplicaciones\r\n    terap\u00e9uticas.a No se dispone de datos sobre las emisiones de platino al medio\r\n    ambiente a partir de fuentes industriales. El uso de catalizadores\r\n    con platino puede entra\u00f1ar la liberaci\u00f3n de ese elemento al medio\r\n    ambiente, seg\u00fan el tipo de catalizador. De los catalizadores\r\n    estacionarios utilizados en la industria, s\u00f3lo los empleados para la\r\n    oxidaci\u00f3n del amoniaco emiten cantidades significativas de platino.\r\n\r\n         Los catalizadores utilizados en automoci\u00f3n son fuentes m\u00f3viles\r\n    de platino. Se dispone de datos limitados que indican que el\r\n    desgaste de platino a partir del antiguo catalizador en pastilla es a La presente monograf\u00eda se ocupa espec\u00edficamente del platino y\r\n         de ciertos compuestos del platino de importancia ocupacional\r\n         y/o ambiental. No entra en el \u00e1mbito restringido de la serie de\r\n         Criterios de Salud Ambiental el estudio pormenorizado de los\r\n         efectos t\u00f3xicos del f\u00e1rmaco anticanceroso cisplatino y de sus\r\n         an\u00e1logos en el hombre y los animales, puesto que esas\r\n         sustancias se usan principalmente como agentes terap\u00e9uticos.\r\n         Adem\u00e1s, sus propiedades t\u00f3xicas son excepcionales en\r\n         comparaci\u00f3n con las de otros compuestos de platino.\r\n\r\n    de 0,8 a 1,9 \u00b5g por km recorrido. Alrededor del 10% del platino es\r\n    soluble en agua.\r\n\r\n         Con la nueva generaci\u00f3n de catalizadores de tipo monol\u00edtico,\r\n    los resultados de experimentos en plataforma de pruebas de motores\r\n    con un catalizador de tres v\u00edas indican que la emisi\u00f3n total de\r\n    platino es inferior por un factor de 100-1000 a la producida en\r\n    catalizadores en pastilla. Con velocidades simuladas de 60, 100 y\r\n    140 km/h, se encontr\u00f3 que la emisi\u00f3n total de platino era de 3 a 39\r\n    ng/m3 en los gases de escape, lo que corresponde a unos 2-39 ng\r\n    por km recorrido. El di\u00e1metro aerodin\u00e1mico medio de las part\u00edculas\r\n    emitidas era de 4 a 9 \u00b5m en las distintas pruebas. Existen pruebas\r\n    limitadas de que la mayor parte del platino emitido se encuentra en\r\n    forma met\u00e1lica o en part\u00edculas de superficie oxidada. 3.  Transporte, distribuci\u00f3n y transformaci\u00f3n en el medio ambiente Los metales del grupo del platino son escasos en el medio\r\n    ambiente en comparaci\u00f3n con otros elementos. En zonas muy\r\n    industrializadas, pueden encontrarse cantidades elevadas de platino\r\n    en los sedimentos fluviales. Se supone que la materia org\u00e1nica, por\r\n    ejemplo los \u00e1cidos h\u00famicos y f\u00falvicos, enlaza platino, proceso que\r\n    tal vez se vea favorecido por condiciones apropiadas de pH y de\r\n    potencial redox en el medio acu\u00e1tico.\r\n\r\n         En el suelo, la movilidad del platino depende del pH, el\r\n    potencial redox, las concentraciones de cloruros en las aguas\r\n    subterr\u00e1neas y la forma en que se encuentra el platino en la roca\r\n    primitiva. Se considera que el platino s\u00f3lo ser\u00e1 m\u00f3vil en\r\n    condiciones extremadamente \u00e1cidas o en aguas subterr\u00e1neas con\r\n    elevado contenido de cloro.\r\n\r\n         En los sistemas de ensayo in vitro se ha demostrado que\r\n    algunos complejos de platino(IV), en presencia de platino(II),\r\n    pueden sufrir metilaci\u00f3n por la metilcobalamina bacteriana en\r\n    condiciones abi\u00f3ticas. 4.  Niveles medioambientales y exposici\u00f3n humana Se dispone de muy pocos datos en cuanto a las concentraciones\r\n    medioambientales debido a los reducidos niveles de platino en el\r\n    medio ambiente y los problemas anal\u00edticos que ello acarrea.\r\n\r\n         Las concentraciones en muestras de aire obtenidas en las\r\n    proximidades de autopistas en los Estados Unidos antes de la\r\n    introducci\u00f3n del catalizador en los autom\u00f3viles se encontraban por\r\n    debajo del l\u00edmite de detecci\u00f3n de 0,05 pg/m3. Algunos datos\r\n    obtenidos recientemente en Alemania indican que en las cercan\u00edas de\r\n    las carreteras las concentraciones de platino en el aire (muestras\r\n    particuladas) var\u00edan entre < 1 pg/m3 y 13 pg/m3. En zonas\r\n\r\n    rurales, las concentraciones se encontraban en un orden de magnitud\r\n    similar (< 0,6 a 1,8 pg/m3).\r\n\r\n         Las concentraciones de platino en el aire cercano a carreteras\r\n    tras la introducci\u00f3n de los catalizadores de pastilla en los\r\n    autom\u00f3viles se han calculado bas\u00e1ndose en modelos de dispersi\u00f3n y\r\n    datos experimentales de emisi\u00f3n. Las concentraciones estimadas de\r\n    platino en las carreteras y en las zonas pr\u00f3ximas variaron entre\r\n    0,005 y 9 ng/m3 para el platino total. Puesto que la emisi\u00f3n total\r\n    de platino en un catalizador de tipo monol\u00edtico es inferior,\r\n    probablemente por un factor de 100 a 1000, que en un catalizador de\r\n    pastilla, las concentraciones de platino emitidas en ese tipo de\r\n    catalizador se encontrar\u00edan en el margen de picogramos a femtogramos\r\n    por m3.\r\n\r\n         En el polvo depositado en las plantas de hoja ancha que bordean\r\n    las carreteras en distintos lugares de California, se detectaron\r\n    concentraciones de 37-680 \u00b5g por kg de peso seco. Aunque el n\u00famero\r\n    de muestras era limitado, los resultados indican que los\r\n    catalizadores de autom\u00f3viles liberan platino al medio ambiente\r\n    pr\u00f3ximo a las carreteras.\r\n\r\n         En experimentos en c\u00e1mara vegetal, los cultivos herb\u00e1ceos\r\n    expuestos durante cuatro semanas a gases de escape ligeramente\r\n    diluidos procedentes de un motor equipado con un catalizador de 3\r\n    v\u00edas (velocidad simulada: 100 km/h) no conten\u00edan platino con un\r\n    l\u00edmite de detecci\u00f3n de 2 ng/g de peso seco.\r\n\r\n         Los estudios de las concentraciones de platino en sedimentos\r\n    del Lago Michigan llevaron a la conclusi\u00f3n de que el platino se ha\r\n    ido depositando en ellos durante los \u00faltimos 50 a\u00f1os a una velocidad\r\n    uniforme. Las concentraciones en calas de sedimento de 1 a 20 cm\r\n    variaron s\u00f3lo entre 0,3 y 0,43 \u00b5g/kg de peso seco.\r\n\r\n         Mientras que no se han comunicado niveles de platino en aguas\r\n    dulces, se han encontrado elevadas concentraciones (730 a 31 220\r\n    \u00b5g/kg de peso eco) en los sedimentos de un canal de corta sumamente\r\n    contaminado en el r\u00edo Rin (Alemania).\r\n\r\n         En muestras de Pinus flexilisse encontraron niveles de\r\n    platino entre el l\u00edmite de detecci\u00f3n y 56 \u00b5g/kg (peso de ceniza). No\r\n    obstante, el contenido de los suelos adyacentes se encontraba entre\r\n    los mismos valores; estos datos limitados no indicaban tendencia\r\n    alguna de acumulaci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\n         En muestras aisladas de vegetales procedentes de un suelo\r\n    ultrab\u00e1sico, se encontraron niveles de platino de 100-830 \u00b5g/kg\r\n    (peso seco).\r\n\r\n         En muestras de agua marina se han encontrado entre 37 y 332\r\n    pg/litro. En calas de sedimento obtenidas en el Pac\u00edfico oriental,\r\n\r\n    las concentraciones de platino variaron entre 1,1 y 3 \u00b5g/kg (peso\r\n    seco). La concentraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s elevada (21,9 \u00b5g por kg) se encontr\u00f3 en\r\n    sedimentos oce\u00e1nicos alejados del litoral. En macroalgas marinas se\r\n    han encontrado concentraciones de platino entre 0,08 y 0,32 \u00b5g/kg de\r\n    peso seco.\r\n\r\n         En la poblaci\u00f3n general se han medido niveles sangu\u00edneos de\r\n    platino de 0,1 a 2,8 \u00b5g/litro. En suero de trabajadores expuestos\r\n    por su profesi\u00f3n, se han comunicado niveles de 150 a 440 \u00b5g por\r\n    litro.\r\n\r\n         Se dispone de datos limitados sobre las concentraciones de\r\n    platino en el lugar de trabajo. Es probable que los datos antiguos\r\n    (0,9 a 1700 \u00b5g/m3) no sean de fiar debido a las deficiencias del\r\n    an\u00e1lisis. No obstante, esos datos permiten suponer que el nivel de\r\n    exposici\u00f3n a sales de platino era superior al l\u00edmite de exposici\u00f3n\r\n    profesional de 2 \u00b5g/m3 adoptado actualmente en la mayor\u00eda de los\r\n    pa\u00edses. En recientes estudios realizados en los lugares de trabajo,\r\n    se han medido concentraciones inferiores al l\u00edmite de detecci\u00f3n de\r\n    0,05 \u00b5g/m3 o entre 0,08 y 0,1 \u00b5g/m3. 5.  Cin\u00e9tica y metabolismo Tras una exposici\u00f3n \u00fanica por inhalaci\u00f3n (48 minutos) a\r\n    distintas formas qu\u00edmicas del platino (5-8 mg/m3), la mayor parte\r\n    del 191Pt inhalado fue r\u00e1pidamente eliminado del organismo. A\r\n    continuaci\u00f3n se observ\u00f3 una fase m\u00e1s lenta de eliminaci\u00f3n durante el\r\n    resto del periodo posterior a la exposici\u00f3n. A los diez d\u00edas de la\r\n    exposici\u00f3n a 191PtCl4, 191Pt(SO4)2, 191PtO2, y 191Pt\r\n    met\u00e1lico, la retenci\u00f3n total de 191Pt por el organismo fue de\r\n    aproximadamente 1, 5, 8 y 6%, respectivamente, de la carga inicial\r\n    del organismo. La mayor parte del 191Pt eliminado de los pulmones\r\n    por mecanismos mucociliares e ingerido se excret\u00f3 con las heces\r\n    (semivida: 24 h). Una peque\u00f1a fracci\u00f3n del 191Pt se detect\u00f3 en la\r\n    orina, lo que indica que la absorci\u00f3n en los pulmones y el tracto\r\n    gastrointestinal fue muy reducida.\r\n\r\n         En un estudio comparativo sobre el destino del 191PtCl4 en\r\n    ratas (25 \u00b5Ci/animal) tras la exposici\u00f3n por distintas v\u00edas, la\r\n    retenci\u00f3n fue m\u00e1xima tras la administraci\u00f3n intravenosa, seguida por\r\n    la exposici\u00f3n intratraqueal. La m\u00ednima se registr\u00f3 tras la\r\n    administraci\u00f3n oral. Puesto que s\u00f3lo fue absorbida una cantidad\r\n    min\u00fascula del 191PtCl4 administrada por v\u00eda oral, la mayor\u00eda\r\n    atraves\u00f3 el tracto gastrointestinal y se excret\u00f3 con las heces. Al\r\n    cabo de tres d\u00edas, menos del 1% de la dosis inicial se detect\u00f3 en\r\n    todo el cuerpo. Tras la administraci\u00f3n intravenosa, el 191Pt se\r\n    excret\u00f3 en cantidades casi iguales tanto en las heces como en la\r\n    orina. La eliminaci\u00f3n fue m\u00e1s lenta que en el caso de la\r\n    administraci\u00f3n oral. A los tres d\u00edas la retenci\u00f3n en todo el\r\n    organismo era de alrededor del 65%, y al cabo de 28 d\u00edas a\u00fan era del\r\n    14% de la dosis inicial. A t\u00edtulo de comparaci\u00f3n, al cabo de\r\n\r\n    periodos iguales alrededor del 22% y del 8%, respectivamente,\r\n    quedaron retenidos por el organismo tras la administraci\u00f3n\r\n    intratraqueal.\r\n\r\n         Los principales lugares de dep\u00f3sito son el ri\u00f1\u00f3n, el h\u00edgado, el\r\n    bazo y las gl\u00e1ndulas suprarrenales. La elevada cantidad de 191Pt\r\n    encontrada en el ri\u00f1\u00f3n demuestra que una vez que el platino es\r\n    absorbido, la mayor parte se acumula en \u00e9l y se excreta en la orina.\r\n    El nivel m\u00e1s bajo en el cerebro sugiere que los iones de platino\r\n    atraviesan la barrera hematoencef\u00e1lica s\u00f3lo en grado limitado.\r\n\r\n         A diferencia de las sales hidrosolubles, el PtO2, que es\r\n    insoluble, s\u00f3lo fue captado en cantidades insignificantes a pesar de\r\n    que la sal se administr\u00f3 con la dieta en concentraciones sumamente\r\n    elevadas, que representaron un consumo total de platino de 4308 mg\r\n    por rata durante el periodo de cuatro semanas.\r\n\r\n         Tanto en el caso de las sales simples de platino como en el\r\n    cisplatino, se ha determinado que existe un periodo de eliminaci\u00f3n\r\n    r\u00e1pida seguido de una fase prolongada de eliminaci\u00f3n durante el\r\n    resto del periodo posterior a la exposici\u00f3n, y que no existen\r\n    pruebas de que los perfiles de retenci\u00f3n sean notablemente\r\n    diferentes. No obstante, el cisplatino es sumamente estable en los\r\n    fluidos extracelulares debido a que las elevadas concentraciones de\r\n    cloruro suprimen la hidrataci\u00f3n. Ello explica que se excrete\r\n    principalmente en la forma no alterada. Su excreci\u00f3n, a diferencia\r\n    de la de las sales simples de platino, tiene lugar principalmente\r\n    con la orina. 6.  Efectos en mam\u00edferos de laboratorio y en sistemas de ensayo in\r\n        vitro La toxicidad aguda del platino depende principalmente de la\r\n    especie de platino. Los compuestos solubles son mucho m\u00e1s t\u00f3xicos\r\n    que los insolubles. Por ejemplo, la toxicidad por v\u00eda oral en la\r\n    rata (valores de la LD50) disminuyo en el orden siguiente:\r\n    Na2[PtCl6] (25-50 mg/kg) > (NH4)2[PtCl6] (195-200 mg/kg)\r\n    > PtCl4 (240 mg/kg) > Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (1010 mg/kg) >\r\n    PtCl2 (> 2000 mg/kg) > PtO2 (> 8000 mg/kg). No pudo alcularse\r\n    la DL50 correspondiente a los dos \u00faltimos compuestos.\r\n\r\n         En las pruebas cut\u00e1neas realizadas en conejos albinos, los\r\n    compuestos PtO2, PtCl2, K2[PtCl4], [Pt(NO2)2(NH3)2],\r\n    Pt(C5H7O2)2 y trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] se clasificaron\r\n    como no irritantes. Los compuestos (NH4)2[PtCl6],\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4], Na2[PtCl6], Na2[Pt(OH)6],\r\n    K2[Pt(CN)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, y cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2]\r\n    resultaron irritantes en diversos grados. \r\n\r\n         En los ensayos de irritaci\u00f3n ocular todos los compuestos de\r\n    platino ensayados dieron resultados positivos. El trans- [PtCl2(NH3)2] y el (NH4)2[PtCl4] resultaron ser\r\n    corrosivos.\r\n\r\n         Tras la inyecci\u00f3n intravenosa de complejos de cloroplatino en\r\n    cobayos y ratas, se observaron dificultades respiratorias intensas,\r\n    probablemente debidas a la liberaci\u00f3n anal\u00e9rgica de histamina. Esta\r\n    liberaci\u00f3n inespec\u00edfica de histamina ha complicado la interpretaci\u00f3n\r\n    de los estudios en animales y en el hombre en relaci\u00f3n con el\r\n    diagn\u00f3stico de la sensibilizaci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica.\r\n\r\n         Tras la inyecci\u00f3n subcut\u00e1nea e intravenosa de Pt(SO4)2 tres\r\n    veces a la semana durante cuatro semanas, no se observ\u00f3 inducci\u00f3n de\r\n    un estado al\u00e9rgico, de acuerdo con las pruebas cut\u00e1neas (cobayos y\r\n    conejos), la transferencia pasiva y los ensayos en la almohadilla\r\n    plantar (ratones). La administraci\u00f3n del complejo platino-huevo-\r\n    alb\u00famina tampoco sensibiliz\u00f3 a los animales de experimentaci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\n         No se consigui\u00f3 sensibilizar a hembras de rata encapuchada de\r\n    Lister con la sal libre de tetracloroplatinato de amonio,\r\n    (NH4)2[PtCl4], aplicada por las v\u00edas intraperitoneal,\r\n    intramuscular, intrad\u00e9rmica, subcut\u00e1nea, intratraqueal y por la\r\n    almohadilla plantar, conBordetella pertussisw como coadyuvante, de\r\n    acuerdo con los resultados de la prueba cut\u00e1nea directa, la prueba\r\n    de anafilaxis cut\u00e1nea pasiva o un ensayo de radioalergosorbencia\r\n    (RAST). No obstante, se han comunicado resultados positivos de\r\n    anafilaxis cut\u00e1nea pasiva con conjugados platino-prote\u00edna.\r\n\r\n         En monos Cynomolgus (Macaca fasicularis) expuestos a\r\n    hexacloroplatinato de sodio, Na2[PtCl6], por inhalaci\u00f3n\r\n    exclusivamente nasal de una concentraci\u00f3n de 200 \u00b5g/m3 wdurante 4\r\n    horas al d\u00eda, dos veces a la semana durante 12 semanas, se\r\n    observaron insuficiencias pulmonares significativamente mayores que\r\n    en los animales testigo. Con la exposici\u00f3n a hexacloroplatinato de\r\n    amonio, (NH4)2[PtCl6], s\u00f3lo la exposici\u00f3n simult\u00e1nea a ozono\r\n    (2000 \u00b5g/m3) produjo hipersensibilidad cut\u00e1nea e hiperreactividad\r\n    pulmonar significativas.\r\n\r\n         En estudios de administraci\u00f3n oral a machos de rata Sprague-\r\n    Dawley, las sales PtCl4 (182 mg/l de agua de bebida) y\r\n    Pt(SO4)2.4H2O (248 mg/litro) no ejercieron efecto alguno en la\r\n    adquisici\u00f3n normal de peso durante el periodo de observaci\u00f3n de 4\r\n    semanas. Al triplicar la concentraci\u00f3n de platino, la adquisici\u00f3n de\r\n    peso se redujo en un 20% s\u00f3lo durante la primera semana,\r\n    paralelamente a una disminuci\u00f3n del 20% del consumo de alimento y\r\n    agua. \r\n\r\n         S\u00f3lo se dispone de datos experimentales limitados sobre los\r\n    efectos del platino en la reproducci\u00f3n, la embriotoxicidad y la\r\n    teratogenicidad. El Pt(SO4)2 (200 mg Pt/kg) redujo el peso de\r\n\r\n    las cr\u00edas en ratones suizos ICR desde el d\u00eda 8 al 45 despu\u00e9s del\r\n    parto. El principal efecto del Na2[PtCl6] (20 mg Pt/kg) fue un\r\n    nivel de actividad menor en las cr\u00edas de madres expuestas el duo-\r\n    d\u00e9cimo d\u00eda de gestaci\u00f3n. Se considera que el alambre y las l\u00e1minas\r\n    de platino s\u00f3lido son biol\u00f3gicamente inertes; los efectos adversos\r\n    observados a ra\u00edz de la implantaci\u00f3n en el \u00fatero de ratas y ratones\r\n    se debieron probablemente a la presencia f\u00edsica de un objeto\r\n    extra\u00f1o.\r\n\r\n         Tras la administraci\u00f3n intravenosa de 191PtCl4 a ratas\r\n    gestantes (25 \u00b5Ci/animal) el d\u00eda 18 de la gestaci\u00f3n, una cantidad\r\n    limitada del compuesto atraves\u00f3 la barrera placentaria.\r\n\r\n         Se ha observado que varios compuestos de platino son\r\n    mutag\u00e9nicos en diversos sistemas bacterianos. En estudios\r\n    comparativos, el cisplatino era varias veces m\u00e1s mutag\u00e9nico que\r\n    otras sales de platino ensayadas. En estudios realizados in vitro con c\u00e9lulas de mam\u00edfero (sistema CHO-HGPT), la actividad mutag\u00e9nica\r\n    relativa de los compuestos cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2],\r\n    K[PtCl3(NH3)] y [Pt(NH3)3Cl]Cl fue 100:9:0,3. La\r\n    mutagenicidad del K2[PtCl4] y el trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] era\r\n    marginal, mientras que el [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 no era mutag\u00e9nico. No\r\n    se observ\u00f3 actividad mutag\u00e9nica en los compuestos K2[PtCl4] y\r\n    [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2, en el ensayo de letalidad recesiva ligada al\r\n    sexo en Drosophila melanogaster, en un ensayo de micron\u00facleo de\r\n    rat\u00f3n ni en el ensayo en m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea de h\u00e1mster chino.\r\n\r\n         Salvo en el caso del cisplatino, no se dispone de datos\r\n    experimentales relativos a la carcinogenicidad del platino y sus\r\n    compuestos. Existen prueba suficientes de la carcinogenicidad del\r\n    cisplatino en los animales. No obstante, el cisplatino y sus\r\n    an\u00e1logos son excepcionales en comparaci\u00f3n con otros compuestos de\r\n    platino; ello se refleja en su mecanismo caracter\u00edstico de actividad\r\n    anti-tumoral. La constituci\u00f3n de enlaces cruzados entre las hebras\r\n    de ADN, formados s\u00f3lo por el is\u00f3mero cis en determinada posici\u00f3n de\r\n    la guanina, se considera el motivo de esa actividad antitumoral.\r\n    Parece ser que la replicaci\u00f3n del ADN es defectuosa en las c\u00e9lulas\r\n    cancerosas, mientras que en las normales las lesiones causadas por\r\n    el cisplatino en la guanina se reparan antes de la replicaci\u00f3n. 7.  Efectos en el ser humano La exposici\u00f3n a sales de platino se limita principalmente al\r\n    medio ocupacional, en particular a las refiner\u00edas de platino\r\n    met\u00e1lico y las plantas de fabricaci\u00f3n de catalizadores.\r\n\r\n         Los princiaples compuestos responsables de la hiper-\r\n    sensibilidad a las sales de platino son el \u00e1cido hexacloroplat\u00ednico,\r\n    H2[PtCl6], y algunas sales cloradas como el hexacloroplatinato\r\n    de amonio, (NH4)2[PtCl6], el tetracloroplatinato de potasio,\r\n    K2[PtCl4], el hexacloroplatinato de potasio, K2[Pt6] y el\r\n\r\n    tetracloroplatinato de sodio, Na2[PtCl4].a Los complejos en\r\n    los que no hay ligandos hal\u00f3genos coordinados al platino (\"complejos\r\n    no halogenados\"), como el K2[Pt(NO2)4], [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 y\r\n    [Pt{(NH2)2CS}4]Cl2, as\u00ed como los complejos neutros como el cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2], no son alerg\u00e9nicos, puesto que\r\n    probablemente no reaccionan con prote\u00ednas para formar un ant\u00edgeno\r\n    completo.\r\n\r\n         Entre los signos y s\u00edntomas de hipersensibilidad figuran\r\n    urticaria, dermatitis de contacto de la piel, y trastornos\r\n    respiratorios que pueden ir desde estornudos, disnea y cianosis a\r\n    crisis graves de asma. El periodo de latencia desde el primer\r\n    contacto con el platino hasta la aparici\u00f3n de los primeros s\u00edntomas\r\n    var\u00eda desde unas pocas semanas a varios a\u00f1os. Una vez que la\r\n    sensibilizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 establecida, los s\u00edntomas tienden a empeorar\r\n    durante el tiempo que los individuos sigan expuestos en el lugar de\r\n    trabajo, pero suelen desaparecer al cesar la exposici\u00f3n. No\r\n    obstante, si se produce una exposici\u00f3n prolongada despu\u00e9s de la\r\n    sensibilizaci\u00f3n, es posible que los individuos nunca queden\r\n    completamente exentos de s\u00edntomas. \r\n\r\n         Aunque a partir de los datos disponibles no puede deducirse una\r\n    relaci\u00f3n inequ\u00edvoca entre la concentraci\u00f3n y el efecto, el riesgo de\r\n    desarrollar sensibilidad a las sales de platino parece guardar\r\n    relaci\u00f3n con la intensidad de la exposici\u00f3n. El platino met\u00e1lico\r\n    parece no ser alerg\u00e9nico. A excepci\u00f3n de un solo caso comunicado de\r\n    supuesta dermatitis de contacto provocada por un anillo \"de\r\n    platino\", no se han notificado reacciones al\u00e9rgicas.\r\n\r\n         Las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas de la hipersensibilidad a las\r\n    sales de platino reflejan una aut\u00e9ntica respuesta al\u00e9rgica. El\r\n    mecanismo parece ser una respuesta de tipo I (medida por la IgE). La\r\n    posibilidad de que se desarrollen anticuerpos IgE a complejos de\r\n    cloruro de platino en personas sensibles se ha supuesto bas\u00e1ndose en\r\n    los ensayos in vivo e in vitro. Se cree que las sales de platino\r\n    de baja masa molecular relativa act\u00faan como haptenos que se combinan\r\n    con las prote\u00ednas s\u00e9ricas para formar el ant\u00edgeno completo. a Se ha abandonado el t\u00e9rmino \"platinosis\" para describir las\r\n         enfermedades relacionadas con las sales de platino, puesto que\r\n         implica una enfermedad pulmonar fibrosante cr\u00f3nica del tipo de\r\n         la silicosis. En su lugar, se han utilizado \"alergia a las\r\n         sales de platino\", \"alergia a los compuestos de platino que\r\n         contienen ligandos hal\u00f3genos reactivos\" e \"hipersensibilidad a\r\n         sales de platino\" (HSP), siendo preferible el \u00faltimo. \r\n\r\n         Las pruebas de punci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea con concentraciones diluidas de\r\n    complejos solubles de platino parecen proporcionar indicadores\r\n    biol\u00f3gicos de la alergenicidad reproducibles, fiables,\r\n    razonablemente sensibles y sumamente espec\u00edficos. Los compuestos\r\n    utilizados para las pruebas peri\u00f3dicas de detecci\u00f3n de alergias en\r\n    los trabajadores expuestos son (NH4)2[PtCl6], Na2[PtCl6] y\r\n    Na2[PtCl4]. La sensibilidad y fiabilidad de las pruebas de\r\n    punci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea no tienen igual en ninguno de los ensayos in vitro disponibles. En los inmunoensayos enzim\u00e1ticos y las pruebas de\r\n    radioalergosorbencia (RAST) se han encontrado anticuerpos IgE\r\n    espec\u00edficos de los complejos del cloruro de platino. Aunque se\r\n    comunic\u00f3 la existencia de correlaci\u00f3n con los resultados de las\r\n    pruebas de punci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea, la aplicabilidad de la prueba RAST para\r\n    los ex\u00e1menes de detecci\u00f3n se puso en tela de juicio a causa de su\r\n    falta de especificidad.\r\n\r\n         Se ha encontrado una reactividad cruzada limitada entre las\r\n    sales de platino y de paladio en los ensayos cut\u00e1neos y el RAST. Las\r\n    reacciones a los metales del grupo del platino distintos de \u00e9ste\r\n    s\u00f3lo se han observado en individuos sensibles a las sales de\r\n    platino.\r\n\r\n         El tabaquismo, la atopia y la hiperreactividad pulmonar\r\n    inespec\u00edfica se han asociado a la hipersensibilidad a las sales de\r\n    platino y pueden ser factores predisponentes.\r\n\r\n         En cuanto a la poblaci\u00f3n general, no se dispone de bastantes\r\n    datos sobre la situaci\u00f3n real en materia de exposici\u00f3n en los pa\u00edses\r\n    en los que se ha introducido el catalizador en los autom\u00f3viles.

Not long after the creation of the earth, the book of Genesis records that the gold found in the land of Havilah \"is good.\" There are 358 references to gold in the Bible, the last of which makes reference to the heavenly city. Only in recent years has a process been discovered for casting gold in transparent form and in gold-plating glass. Scripture records the amount of gold used in adorning the great temple Solomon built in Jerusalem 3000 years ago. It's 3750 tons of gold would be worth over 45 billion dollars today!\nGold has an atomic number 79 and an atomic weight of 196.9665. Gold is 19.3 times heavier than water, melts at 1063 degrees Centigrade, and is the most malleable and ductile of all the elements. One ounce of this metal (slighter more than a cubic centimeter) may be beaten into 300 square feet of gold leaf. Gold can be fired by a potter into clays to produce exquisitely beautiful porcelain or glass.\nGold is chemically quite inert. No single acid dissolves it. It is unaffected by oxygen or hydrogen sulfide. Gold does not rust, tarnish, corrode, crumble, decompose or decay, even after centuries on the sea floor or in a damp dripping cavern. Gold is found in nature principally as a free metal in veins of quartz, or in alluvial (placer) deposits resulting from the breakup of such rock. Gold in nature typically contains 10 to 15 percent silver in solid solution; it may also contain copper, iron, or more rarely bismuth, tin, lead, platinum, palladium, or iridium. Electrum is the usual name applied to gold containing a high silver content. Gold sometimes occurs in nature in combination with tellurium in the mineral sylvanite. Gold chlorides and cyanides also occur more rarely.\nGold is number 81 down on a list of the atomic elements in terms of relative abundance in the universe and has been highly prized for jewelry and coins since the dawn of mankind. Gold is economically mined today by open pit methods (for example in Nevada and California) even though the gold content is somewhat less than 0.1 ounce per ton of waste rock. The famous gold mines of South Africa are more than a mile deep. Gold is often recovered as a by-product of other metal mining, for example copper or lead. The total amount of gold mined in the world in the history of mankind amounts to less than 90,000 tons. If this gold were all collected together it would fit into a cube only 58 feet on a side! Total gold production per year in the world is less than 2000 tons of which about two-thirds comes from South Africa, 30% from the Soviet Union, 4% from Canada and 3% from the United States. Perhaps only 40,000 tons of gold remains in the earth yet to be mined.\nFive stories below the ground at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City is an enormous, compartmentalized vault holding some 10,000 metric tons of gold worth $117 billion - the gold reserves of some 50 nations.\nThe \"London Good Delivery Bar,\" which is the standard bar used in international trade, weighs 400 ounces troy. One troy ounce is equal to 1.09714 regular (avoirdupois) ounces. These bars have a refiner name, a bar number, and other information stamped on them, and the minimum fineness must be .995, or 99.5% pure gold.\nGold leaf is widely used for lettering names on glass, for building ornamentation and gilding. In 1986 the Statue of Liberty was refurbished with 6000 squares of gold leaf. 250,000 leaves of gold can be stacked into a pile only one inch high.\nGold is a good electrical conductor - almost identical with that of aluminum and not far from silver and copper. Because of its high atomic stability gold emits no particles or rays from its nucleus. It enters into almost no chemical reactions at room temperature and therefore is impossible to detect at a distance by a remote sensing or a chemical-sniffing method.\nIn the United States about one-fifth of the annual production, that is about 47 metric tons, is used for electronics where superior electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance are required. Gold can be vacuum deposited on glass or plastic to make heat reflecting windows or sunglasses of superior optical screening properties.\nGold can be detected close up (for instance on the sea floor) using neutron activation. However this technique involving the use of a radioactive isotope and sensitive detectors is not much used today. The claims of some amateur prospectors that gold can be detected at a distance by a \"molecular frequency detector\" are unfounded according to all known legitimate science. Success, if any, obtained with one of these devices (which are in a class similar to dowsing or water-witching methods) can not be explained by any principle known to science today.\nWhile relatively scarce on earth, gold is apparently more common than brick or asphalt in God's Eternal City, the New Jerusalem, \"The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass...And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.\" (Revelation 21:18, 21)\n"}, {"score": 859.8937, "uuid": "48221e21-c2aa-579f-b929-d214fbea2922", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-83-32741", "target_hostname": "www.miningmx.com", "target_uri": "http://www.miningmx.com/commentary/505428.htm", "page_rank": 1.1812764e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>Gold</em> Fields seeks <em>to</em> thaw Arctic Pt", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> because North American Palladium will pay <em>Gold</em> Fields in $45m worth of its shares, <em>equal</em> <em>to</em> about 16% <em>to</em> 17% of North American Palladium\u0092s share capital.", "explanation": null, "document": "Gold Fields seeks to thaw Arctic Pt\nDavid McKay\nPosted: Wed, 19 Oct 2005\n[ miningmx.com ] -- IN January, 2001, when the palladium price burst through $1,000/oz, there was allegedly talk in the corridors of Gold Fields that its newly discovered platinum group metal resource, which carries the misnomer \u0091Arctic Platinum\u0092, might be worth $1bn. Four years later, Gold Fields has rescued the predominantly palladium project from the filing cabinet after agreeing to sell control to North American Palladium, a Canadian firm keen to resuscitate its own declining fortunes.\nA dramatic correction in the palladium price since 2001, a lack of refining capacity, and lower than expected grades in the Finland-based deposit effectively torpedoed Gold Fields\u0092 plans to diversify. But many of the same conditions have worked to undo North American Palladium which is struggling with poor market prices and declining assets.\nAs such, the proposal that the two companies breathe new life into Arctic is snappy piece of entrepreneurship.\nThe terms of the agreement is for Gold Fields to sell 60% of Arctic Platinum to North American Palladium if the Canadian firm spends $12.5m in a rescoping and feasibility study. The aim of the study is to produce a smaller. but higher grade project from the original Arctic project.\nGold Fields international director, John Munro, says Gold Fields was shooting at a 400,000 to 450,000 oz/year palladium-platinum mine. North American Palladium\u0092s project would be much smaller, however, with a target resource of five million ounce resource yielding not less than 3g/t. This compares to a 2g/t average grade that had been identified by Gold Fields when it was assessing its much larger project.\n\u0093What we\u0092ve done is to keep the Arctic Platinum project in the game with the possibility of participating again at a later stage,\u0094 said Munro.\nFor the Canadian firm, it may well benefit hugely from the project if it has called the palladium price well. One hope is that Russian sales of palladium, from inventories the size of which remain unknown, will slow amid poor market prices. As a result, North American Palladium is bullish about market prices whereas Gold Fields is less so. Perhaps the current $195 to $210/oz palladium price represents its lower limits.\nFor its part, Gold Fields may recover half of the $90m that has been sunk into Arctic so far, including buying the stake originally owned by Outokumpu. This is because North American Palladium will pay Gold Fields in $45m worth of its shares, equal to about 16% to 17% of North American Palladium\u0092s share capital.\nIf the Arctic Platinum project can be made to work under North American Palladium\u0092s more experienced hand, Gold Fields stands to benefit from a share price appreciation. Gold Fields is not sure whether its partner will succeed, but it has the option to claw back 10% of the project by reducing its stake in the Canadians by about a fifth.\nThe rescoping and feasibility studies will begin in the first quarter of 2006 and will take about 30 months to complete, the companies said.\n"}, {"score": 855.9256, "uuid": "d191bc71-2e44-5f1f-a1ab-dffa4dc3a56f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-32-05160", "target_hostname": "www.commodityonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.commodityonline.com/commodities/bullion/gold.php", "page_rank": 3.8393853e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Gold</em>,<em>Gold</em> Price,Jewellery,<em>Gold</em> Funds,ETFs,<em>Gold</em> Mining", "snippet": "Although this <em>is</em> certainly not a professional way of examining <em>gold</em>, the bite test should score the <em>gold</em> because <em>gold</em> <em>is</em> considered a soft metal according <em>to</em> the Mohs&#x27; scale of mineral hardness.

Gold has been used as a symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties (see gold album). Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was made fun of by Thomas More in his treatise \u2018Utopia\u2019.\nOn that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware and lavatory-seats. When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly-dressed of their party.\nThere is an age-old tradition of biting gold in order to test its authenticity. Although this is certainly not a professional way of examining gold, the bite test should score the gold because gold is considered a soft metal according to the Mohs' scale of mineral hardness. The purer the gold the easier it should be to mark it. Painted lead can cheat this test because lead is softer than gold.\nGold in antiquity was relatively easy to obtain geologically; however, 75% of all gold ever produced has been extracted since 1910.[2] It has been estimated that all the gold in the world that has ever been refined would form a single cube 20 m (66 ft) a side (8000 m\u00b3).\nCheck out India Gold Spot and Futures Prices Here!\nDuring the 19th century, gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered, including the California, Colorado, Otago, Australian, Witwatersrand, Black Hills, and Klondike gold rushes. Because of its historically high value, much of the gold mined throughout history is still in circulation in one form or another.\nLike other precious metals, gold is measured by troy weight and by grams. When it is alloyed with other metals the term carat or karat is used to indicate the amount of gold present, with 24 carats being pure gold and lower ratings proportionally less.\nThe purity of a gold bar can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the millesimal fineness, such as 0.995.\nThe price of gold is determined on the open market, but a procedure known as the Gold Fixing in London, originating in 1919, provides a twice-daily benchmark figure to the industry.\nHistorically gold was used to back currency; in an economic system known as the gold standard, a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to $20.67 ($664.56/kg), but in 1934 the dollar was revalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($1125.27/kg). By 1961 it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand.\nHow much Gold is there in the world? Read Here!\nOn 17 March 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level. Central banks still hold historical gold reserves as a store of value although the level has generally been declining. The largest gold depository in the world is that of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank in New York.\nSince 1968 the price of gold on the open market has ranged widely, with a record high of $850/oz ($27,300/kg) on 21 January 1980, to a low of $252.90/oz ($8,131/kg) on 21 June 1999 (London Fixing).[5] On 11 May 2006 the London gold fixing was $715.50/oz.[6]\nAccording to World Gold Council, at US$21.2bn, global dollar demand for gold reached new heights in the second quarter of 2008, rising 9% on year earlier levels. Global investment demand for gold showed the strongest surge, reaching $3.5 billion in Q2 2008, 29% higher than Q2 2007, with particular strength in the US, China, Egypt and Vietnam.\nHowever, with a decrease of 19% on Q2\u201907 to 735.6 tonnes, the continued high and volatile price of gold dampened total demand in tonnage terms during the quarter, according to Gold Demand Trends, which was released on August 13 by the World Gold Council (WGC). This particularly impinged on jewellery demand, which fell 24% to 504 tonnes and was also affected by tightened consumer spending due to the global credit squeeze and growing inflationary pressures. Markets which saw the largest decline in jewellery demand were India, which fell 47% to 118 tonnes, and the US, which fell 30% to 33 tonnes. However, positive news came from China and Egypt, which saw a 2% and 8% increase in jewellery demand respectively.\nDespite a number of markets turning to gold due to its investment attributes as a safe haven in times of rising inflation and unstable equity markets, identifiable global investment demand in tonnage terms was down by 4% over Q2 2007 to 119.8, as some investors took profits. This decline represents a 9% decrease in net retail investment, which was partly offset by a move to positive net investment in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and similar products.\n"}, {"score": 855.6994, "uuid": "d22489dc-c1f3-54ad-852e-5c3a803443fa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200wb-67-11055", "target_hostname": "www.gold-prices.biz", "target_uri": "http://www.gold-prices.biz/home/goldmoney-physical-gold-or-paper-gold.html", "page_rank": 1.1880914e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Gold</em> Prices - <em>Gold</em> Prices - GOLDMONEY: Physical <em>Gold</em> or Paper <em>Gold</em>?", "snippet": "The first step <em>is</em> <em>to</em> own physical <em>gold</em> and silver.

Why is gold such a universally recognised and accepted standard of value?\nGold is portable \u2013 Unlike many other commodities, gold is also relatively portable; gold can be melted down or cut into smaller pieces, though it does have limitations when it comes to everyday transactions\u2026the amount of gold needed to pay for a loaf of bread is not only very difficult to cut and weigh, it would be so small that it would get lost easily lost! So, while gold buyers can not use gold in everyday transactions, gold buyers can always sell gold for its equivalent value in notes.\nGold does not degrade \u2013 Gold can be stored or hidden without fear that it will rot, rust, or be eaten by termites. Gold buyers can be certain that if they buy gold for investment, it will not depreciate physically.\nGold is durable \u2013 Gold is not destroyed by floods, fires, famine, or other natural disasters. Gold buyers can be confident that any gold will withstand just about anything!\nGold is divisible \u2013 Unlike investments of property and other commodities, gold can be melted into various forms and weights when required.\nGold purity or gold standard is uniform \u2013 Gold has a \u2018standard\u2019 unit of value, gold purity by gold weight. One ounce of pure gold is always one ounce of pure gold, unlike, for example, one carat of diamonds which are of variable quality and thus variable value. Perhaps the most vital factor to the acceptance of gold as money is that the standard of gold purity can be can be guaranteed and maintains its value; in other words, gold buyers can be confident that they can sell gold for near equal value in the future.\nUnderstanding valuations when buying & selling gold jewellery\nWednesday, April 21st, 2010\nWhen buying or selling gold jewellery, it is very important to understand how the value is determined. \u00a0In order to make sense of the gold buying and gold selling processes, there are three common but often misunderstood terms: cost, price, and value.\nCost is used to define a wholesale figure on a piece of gold jewellery, or can be used as a definition of the actual amount of money it took to produce or manufacture the gold item.\nPrice is the amount of money asked for an item of gold jewellery (retail price). Jewellers set prices.\nValue, in terms of a valuation report for your gold, is an estimated figure of an item\u2019s worth when used for a particular purpose.\u00a0 The value attributed to a piece of gold jewellery on a valuation can vary immensely depending on what the purpose of the valuation is.\nThere are different types of value, each appropriate to a particular purpose and function. The most common types of values encountered are listed below.\nRetailer Value or Valuation Jewellers and retailers often provide customers with in-store valuations when they are purchasing an item of jewellery. Consumers should be cautious of relying on retailer valuations \u2013 these gold valuations are often grossly inflated and used as selling tools to dupe you into believing that you are receiving a good \u201cdeal\u201d when buying gold jewellery. A valuation should be very close to the actual price of the jewellery item, as this is the value for which it can be purchased.\nInsurance Replacement Value or Valuation for insurance replacement The function of a valuation for insurance purposes is to determine how much it would cost to replace the jewellery should something happen to it. This being the case, the insurance valuation should be very similar to the price actually paid, as this is the actual realised amount that the item could be replaced for. Over-inflated valuations for insurance purposes serve only the interests of the insurance company. You, the consumer, pay premiums based on the valuation; if the valuation is over-inflated, so are your premiums. However, should something happen to your jewellery, the insurance company is able to replace the item for much less than the value you have been paying premiums on.\nIntrinsic Value or Valuation Also known as the gold scrap value, or gold melt value. This is the monetary return on the materials and components of an item; for example, the amount of pure gold in an 18K gold ring. Scrap value is unrelated to the cost of making the jewellery and to the price paid to a jeweller for an item; it is also unrelated to retailer or insurance replacement valuation. In determining melt value, the price is calculated from the spot gold price of the day, the purity of gold in your items (ie. 18K gold is 75% pure gold), and the weight of the item. Gold refining companies purchase items based on this calculated value \u2013 all gold is melted and refined into its pure gold state.\nAuction Value is the price for jewellery sold to the highest bidder at an auction. When deciding where to sell your unwanted gold jewellery, special considerations should be taken into account such as: whether the item is an antique, its designer, or whether it is \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d custom gold jewellery. Often, there can be a considerable amount of value in the quality of craftsmanship or the historical significance of an item.\nThe price of gold is at an all-time high, making this an excellent time to sell gold for refining purposes. However, you may be able to get more cash for gold jewellery that is of exceptional make or significance if you sell it as a whole piece of jewellery rather than breaking its value down into its separate components. Some other options for selling gold jewellery are:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first port of call is usually the jeweller from which the item was purchased, especially if the jewellery is still in new condition.\u00a0 However, many jewellers will not buy back an item they have sold you because their profit margin would be exposed. In other words, rather than offer you a much lower price than you paid, they opt not to get involved with buy-backs.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Online Auction \u2013 Websites such as Ebay are most suitable for well-known, designer-branded gold jewellery, or items where buyers can externally verify what the regular retail price of the jewellery is.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Live Auction \u2013 Auction houses such as Sothebys or Christies will catalogue special pieces to sell at live auction. \u00a0As the seller, you may put a minimum reserve price on the items when selling gold at auction.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Private Sale \u2013 Selling gold jewellery privately can be done in the same manner as, for example, selling a car privately.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pawnbrokers\nFor more information on valuations and selling gold jewellery, please contact The GoldCompany and we will be happy to assist.\n"}], [{"score": 854.61066, "uuid": "93612500-bf41-5315-835f-2a573283084b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1116wb-66-23314", "target_hostname": "figfcu.com", "target_uri": "http://figfcu.com/page.dm.php?id=24", "page_rank": 1.3808534e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Visa\u00ae <em>Platinum</em> | figfcu.com for DMs", "snippet": "Express your creativity by adding your favorite photo <em>to</em> your Visa\u00ae <em>Platinum</em> credit card. * Design and order your card in less than three minutes \u2020The balance transfer amount from other FIGFCU credit cards will retain its current rate (i.e., Visa Select at 8.99%, Visa <em>Platinum</em> at 10.99%, MasterCard <em>Gold</em>", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n\u2020The balance transfer amount from other FIGFCU credit cards will retain its current rate (i.e., Visa Select at 8.99%, Visa Platinum at 10.99%, MasterCard Gold at 11.99%, MasterCard Classic at 13.99%, and MasterCard Credit Builder at 18%) until the transferred balance is paid off.

He spoke to Miningmx. MININGMX: Roy, your platinum project, where exactly is it?\nPITCHFORD: It\u0092s right next door to Lonmin\u0092s Western Platinum.\nMININGMX: How close are you to production?\nPITCHFORD: We have completed the feasibility study. We will be looking to raise the money by the end of the year. All things being equal, we would like to suggest that we could start development early in the new year.\nMININGMX: Funding for that project, how exactly will you raise that capital?\nPITCHFORD: It will be a mixture of equity and debt. We are working with Rand Merchant Bank at the moment to define what the correct equity/debt ratio should be.\nMININGMX: And how much capital would you be looking at?\nPITCHFORD: At today\u0092s prices, we would be looking at R1.9bn. You would have to make your own decision as to what the exchange rate is, but let\u0092s call it somewhere in the region of $300m.\nMININGMX: And what does that buy you?\nPITCHFORD: That buys us two shafts with venetilation, production shafts, the initial development underground. It buys us the concentrate, all the surface infrastructure, offices, etcetera . A production mine.\nThe concentrate will be sold to a third party miner. We have three bids on record at the moment and we are busy working with the various refiners to select the successful one.\nMININGMX: Roy, some people feel that 1.3km, which is the depth of your proposed mine, is a bit deep. What do you say to that?\nPITCHFORD: Lonmin, next door, already have 1.3km. The new one at Impala is 1.6km and of course, dear old Northam is down to 3.2km. And a lot of the Anglo Platinum mines are deeper than 1.3km. So 1.3km is not deep for the fourth generation shafts that are going in.\nMININGMX: Roy, what kind of production would you be looking at and what kind of resource do you have at the moment? When does that get converted into reserves?\nPITCHFORD: Well, we have 7 million ounces in reserve now. We have got 450 million ounces in resource, but that is only half our property. We are drilling the other half and we expect the ore reserve base to be over 100 million ounces. So at 300,000 ounces for the first mine, it\u0092s a very, very long mine life. If we build it up with another two mines, and get to a production of 1 million ounces a year, that\u0092s a 100-year mine life. Any way you look at it, we will be there for a very long time.\nMININGMX: Do you think that your company could be a takeover target for any of the majors?\nPITCHFORD: One has to assume that the existing majors will want to get into the platinum industry. A 100 million ounce is a big reserve by any stretch of the imagination. And so yes it\u0092s a distinct possibility. There are no moves at the moment, we are just going ahead to develop the mine.\nMININGMX: Roy you also have prospects in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Won\u0092t you just talk me through that.\nPITCHFORD: Look, they are greenfields projects. There is no value for them in our share price, but we are going to work our way through these to see whether we are prepared to spend time and money on them.\nThe main consideration is that we have a fantastic deposit on the bushveld, but we are a small company with limited resources. So do we want to dissipate our resources or focus them? It\u0092s a fair suggestion that we will probably focus local and think about what we will do in the area sometime later.\nMININGMX: Would you consider listing on another stock exchange apart from AIM (Britain\u0092s Alternative Investment Market)?\nPITCHFORD: Yes we will, but we have to be convinced of the benefits. There are suggestions of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Politically, that would be a smart thing to do because the assets are here in South Africa. We are also talking about a secondary listing. But our focus will be AIM because it is the destination of mining companies at the moment and that is where it is all happening.\nMININGMX: Tell me more about Amex (American Exchange) what is the thinking behind that?\nPITCHFORD: Well, we have a very big shareholder base, so a North American listing has to be considered.\nMININGMX: Why not Toronto?\nPITCHFORD: I just think at Amex would just suit us better than Toronto. We haven\u0092t done a cost benefit analysis on it, it\u0092s something that\u0092s work in progress.\nMost Read\n"}, {"score": 838.30426, "uuid": "5ffe4b0e-61f8-5ac1-a66c-45eff165c80b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-34-24161", "target_hostname": "www.miningmx.com", "target_uri": "http://www.miningmx.com/special_reports/mining-yearbook/2007/230819.htm", "page_rank": 1.1793365e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Gold</em> supply <em>to</em> dominate long-term price", "snippet": "JP Morgan expects demand <em>to</em> <em>equal</em> supply at 3,890 tonnes both this year and next, a clear driver of its decidedly bullish <em>gold</em> stance.", "explanation": null, "document": "Steve Shepherd, precious metals analyst, JP Morgan\nRelated Stories\nGold supply to dominate long-term price\nGarth Theunissen | Tue, 17 Jul 2007 09:42\n[ miningmx.com ] -- \u0093OVER THE LONG TERM the outlook for gold, supply and demand will feature significantly going forward,\u0094 says David Davis, Credit Suisse Standard Securities gold analyst. South Africa, still the world\u0092s largest producer of gold, has seen production fall from a peak of 1,000 tonnes/year in 1970 to just 297 tonnes last year.\nWhat\u0092s more, rising costs from unionisation and the increasing depth at which gold must be mined means that South Africa will struggle to see its gold production recover to 300 tonnes over the next three years, according to JP Morgan\u0092s recent gold and platinum forecast.\nJP Morgan also reports that US production is now down 29% from its 366 tonnes peak in 1998, while the combined gold production of US and Canada is on a decline since peaking at 533 tonnes in 1997 \u0096 it was down 29% to 380 tonnes in 2005. Australian production is down 13% from its 300 tonnes high in 1997.\nIn other words, gold production is starting to stall \u0096 with the result that supply and demand will be in precarious balance over the next three years. JP Morgan expects demand to equal supply at 3,890 tonnes both this year and next, a clear driver of its decidedly bullish gold stance.\nSays JP Morgan\u0092s Steve Shepherd: \u0093Going forward, limited mine supply growth and limited (if any) growth in central bank sales should ensure a long-term average real price of $575/oz for gold. More near-term we expect gold to average $678/oz this year and $725/oz in 2008, as the combination of the above industry factors and trends in the US dollar combine to give gold an ongoing lift while its base metal peers enter a decline.\u0094\nDavis is even more bullish on the metal. \u0093Due to the tight supply and demand scenario I see gold trending upwards, with and average price of $700/oz by 2008 not unreasonable and $800/oz by 2010.\u0094\nHowever, it\u0092s Davis\u0092s long-term prognosis that\u0092s truly startling. \u0093GFMS [a British-based metals consultancy] put average global gold mining cost increases at 17%,\u0094 says Davis. \u0093If the current cost escalation continues it\u0092s likely that gold would have to rise to $1,400/oz by 2015, assuming current margins.\u0094\nOf course there are those who argue that central banks \u0096 which sit on huge stockpiles of gold \u0096 could again ramp up secondary supply of the metal, thereby tilting the balance in favour of a far lower gold price.\nHowever, JP Morgan doesn\u0092t buy that. \u0093Central bank sales in the Nineties contributed to the depressed gold prices through the late Nineties. Now with new mine supply threatened and central banks holding back on supplies higher gold prices seem likely.\u0094\nAnother view is that central banks won\u0092t be willing to sell gold, as they\u0092re effectively in a catch-22 situation. That\u0092s because the minute they indicate a desire to sell gold the price will drop, thereby diminishing the value of their remaining reserves.\nClick Here to subscribe to our daily newsletter\nBut there\u0092s also the fear factor at play. In 1999, the Bank of England sold a portion of it\u0092s gold for under $300/oz \u0096 only to see the price rocket to more that $700/oz. Of course, you can\u0092t talk about the gold price without mentioning the so-called speculative element of investor-driven demand.\nTo date, gold-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs) have sucked in around 700 tonnes of gold, making them the perfect foil for the possibility of higher central bank sales.\nDavis says the 700 tonnes of gold in ETF vaults is enough to put them in eighth position if you were to benchmark that against central bank gold holdings. \u0093That\u0092s why I call ETFs the people\u0092s central bank,\u0094 he says.\nThat ETF activity has obvious upside potential for the gold price, with more to come if any new versions are introduced in India and China.\nMost Read\n"}, {"score": 849.1486, "uuid": "c84e38fb-18da-5c8a-95c8-cba6f029bc01", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100wb-04-16593", "target_hostname": "www.alliancees.org", "target_uri": "http://www.alliancees.org/2010/11/01/passive-house-leed-platinum/", "page_rank": 1.2249096e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Passive House, LEED <em>Platinum</em>, HERS 3 | LEED <em>Platinum</em>", "snippet": "rehab habitat lake HERS iecc Illinois incentives Indiana leed leed 2012 LEED AP+H leed for homes LEED <em>Gold</em> leed nd LEED <em>Platinum</em> LEED Silver michigan Minnesota MR2.2 net zero homes passive house prefab real estate Single-Family Projects slider solar pv solar thermal tour usgbc wind The Alliance for Environmental", "explanation": null, "document": "Home \u00bb Certifications \u00bb LEED Platinum \u00bb Passive House, LEED Platinum, HERS 3\nPassive House, LEED Platinum, HERS 3\nWritten by Jason La Fleur, LEED AP+Homes //\u00a0 November 1, 2010 \u00a0// LEED Platinum , Minnesota , Net Zero , Passive House , Single-Family Projects // 2 Comments\nImagine that every building maintained the ecological balance needed to sustain life on earth.

If we can\u2019t prove our claims, they are meaningless.\nThe Isabella EBB Project\u2019s initial goal was to create the most environmentally conscious building possible.\u00a0 It targeted integrating all seven design criteria listed above. \u00a0Additionally, each criterion is monitored, measured and verified to prove, we can indeed live in balance with nature.\u00a0 Following is a description of how the Isabella EBB Project integrated the design criteria:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Isabella EBB Project was designed to consume an annual energy load of 4.5 kBTU/sq-ft. It achieved Passive House Certification, (HERS rating of 3), as the design method to achieve this extremely low energy use index. This is similar to having a 200 MPG car in lieu of our standard a 25 MPG car. There are 9,700 Heating Degree Days in this climate zone & 189 Cooling Degree Days.\u00a0 This was accomplished through the design and construction of thermally broken/R 55 walls and R 90 roof, the use of high performance windows with glazing selected specifically to optimize the solar gain for each orientation and an air tightness of .5 air changes per hour.\u00a0 Using BTU meters on the heating distribution system, the system is to telling us if the design loads are being met.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because extreme measures were taken to reduce the energy loads for this building, renewable energy generation produces more energy than is needed to operate the building.\u00a0 An 11,000 kWH per year PV system/8.4 kw peak load and 92 solar heat collecting vacuum tubes averaging 172,500 BTUs per day collect renewable energy. An experimental long term solar storage area using 16 inches of EPS \u00a0insulation on all six sides contains both waste taconite from mines and sand.\u00a0 Excess solar heat collection in the summer, fall and spring are stored in this solar storage containment area under the building.\u00a0 The monitoriong system is gathering temperatures of the containment area, the Kwh generated and used \u00a0and kBTUs for the collection system.\u00a0 We hope to prove that we are producing more clean energy than we use and that this solar storage system can be scaled down for use in other buildings.\n3. Two additional areas used for solar storage: a 500 gallon water tank and an 80 gallon domestic hot water tank.\u00a0 These are also being monitor and measured to tell us how hot they are and how many days of cloudy conditions depletes the stored energy supply.\n4. A small electric boiler is used for backup energy should the building need it due to depletion of solar energy.\u00a0 This boiler is also being monitor to tell us if it is being powered on.\u00a0 This has already proven to be a great diagnostic tool, as it told us that the relays and sensors were not properly sequenced because the boiler was turning on whenever the domestic hot water dropped a few degrees.\n5. A Heat Recovery Ventilation System makes sure that the building and occupants are receiving the right amount of fresh air at the right temperature. An innovative ground loop heat recovery system is connected to the HRV to preheat the outside air prior to being heated by the exhaust air from the building.\u00a0 The success of preheating \u00a0the incoming sub zero temperature fresh air with heated water from the ground near the footings of the building is being gathered by the monitoring system.\u00a0 We hope to discover a 10 to 15 degree preheating of temperature through this system.\n6. A rain water collection system and vegetative roof assures that water continues to perform its job of replenishing the aquifers and supporting plants and animals that conversely support an ecologically balanced building.\n7. Information being stored through the use of the monitoring system is allowing the building to be adapted to new conditions and future improvements. Security alarms, for example, are sent when power, pumps, temperatures or water levels are not performing as intended.\u00a0 Historical data gives us the ability to adjust and improve the performance due to accessibility to baseline and historical data.\n8.

The Tweespalk drill program is planned for 1000 meters with a further 500 meters in phase 2. The Company is also currently compiling soil sampling and geological exploration completed by the previous operators on the War Springs Platinum Project - results from this will be available within a few weeks. It is anticipated that this work will generate targets for drill testing.\nThe Tweespalk property has advanced quickly to the drill ready stage. As a result of the obvious target from platinum, palladium and copper nickel values in the soil and rock sampling, combined with a clear Bushveld contact target from the geophysics the project has advanced directly to drill testing.\nThe Tweespalk Property is between three known platinum deposits along the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex. Tweespalk is 25 kilometres (16 miles) north along trend from the Anglo Platinum PPRust open pit platinum mine (reserves of 332 million tonnes grading 2.67 g/t 4 PGE''s platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold - equal to approximately 28 million ounces), 17 kilometres (10 miles) north of Anooraq''s Drenthe Farm, (inferred mineral resource of 99.4 million PGE''s tonnes 1.31 g/t 4 PGE''s and 0.16% nickel, 0.10% copper) and 23 kilometres (14 miles) south of the Nonnenwerth Deposit (inferred resources of 50 million tonnes of 1.19 g/t 4 platinum and palladium and 0.07% nickel and 0.21% copper). All these figures are from publicly published data as referenced in previous new releases.\nThe Tweespalk property consists of 2,177 hectares (8.4 sq miles) covering 3 kilometres (1.8 miles) of the Platreef trend. PTM can acquire up to 100% interest in the Tweespalk property for US$ 1.4M three years from the grant of the prospecting permit. PTM RSA has also entered into a joint venture agreement with a black economic empowerment company, Africa Wide Mining -- a subsidiary of Africa Wide Investments Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement Africa Wide can participate for up to 30% in the Tweespalk property. The arrangement exceeds the 10-year target under the Mining Charter of South Africa, indicating PTM''s strong endorsement of the Charter.\nThe War Springs Platinum Project covers an area of 2,396 hectares (9.2 square miles) hosting approximately 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) of the important Platreef lower contact of the Bushveld Complex.

Back in the late 1900s, HSBC sent a commission from their London gold department to meet with the Chinese financial administration and were abruptly turned away. But\u2026in 2001, the Chinese became less lenient on the gold market and since then the demand has grown substantially. As of 2010, China\u2019s gold consumption every year evolved at a 7.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its gold claim has risen from just over 15.55 tonnes or 500,000 ounces in the late 1980s to above 373.25 tonnes or 12 million ounces when 2010 came to a close. All this occurred even though gold went from $200 to $1,650 an ounce.\nSimultaneously, China has progressed from an inconsequential global player to the second largest economy world-wide with its end goal in place as becoming the most important. Just looking at its quick and efficient growth of around 10% per annum over this time, the change in China has been the desire of all other nations. Together with this growth there has been a revolution of Chinese society, also. The Chinese middle income have evolved into a class with an equal growth in income. Despite this important change, what is more envious is the manner in which they take care of their pockets. Similar to the Indian population, the Chinese are normally frugal, with a tendency to put aside rather than spend disposable earnings.\nAnd not only did they lift all encumbrances on the gold market but also aggressively expressed optimism about gold buying while motivating the expansion of a nation-wide gold distribution system through their leading banking institutions. The amount of foreign banks now permitted to import gold has soared. The choice of gold as a savings option has grown due to the system of distribution extending throughout the country. The insight of confiding in gold as a practical savings and investment method has benefitted the Chinese immensely. Their long-established reverence for gold, as money, was inculcated in past generations and is sustained right through to modern times with only one difference: their government\u2019s approval. As a result, since the gold price rose in 2005, on a per capita basis, per capita investment in gold in China is twice over than in 2005. The claim for gold as an investment has multiplied at a 14% annual rate since the Chinese government stopped tampering with the local gold market eleven years ago.\nInterestingly, the Chinese believe in physical gold, not derivatives or gold shares. This is where the Asians differ from western investors. When I refer to China buying gold, it is just that\u2026the metal itself. In the developed world, only a modest fraction of investment funds are of gold bars, coins, and pure gold jewelry. Accordingly, the United States is responsible for only 8% of gold bullion demand while Asia invests in more than 70% of gold coin, bar, and pure gold jewelry demand. As the Chinese middle class and their earnings grow, prospective gold claim annually in China has the facility to expand to over 3,000 tonnes. Reality is that the People\u2019s Bank of China is purchasing all local production and thus this makes it clear that there will not be enough gold obtainable to hold this claim.\nBetween the facts presented here as well as some wise prediction, it is very clear that China, in time, is destined to turn into the nucleus of the gold market world-wide. The government in China has made it clear that it considers gold a serious issue in the growth of their country and it is projected that China will aspire to do what it can to implement power over it. They are obviously a world-class model within the gold bullion sector.

Because American Eagle Gold Bullion Coins (their official name) are the world's best-selling gold bullion coins, they provide instant liquidity. Still, the Krugerrand is probably the world's best known gold bullion coin.\nMinted at West Point, New York, American Gold Eagles come in four sizes: 1-ounce, 1/2-ounce, 1/4-ounce, and 1/10-ounce. The 1-oz Gold Eagles are by far the most popular and sell at small premiums over the value of their gold content. The smaller coins sell at higher premiums.\nThe smaller (fractional-ounce) coins are not always available as the Mint is dedicating its production capacity to turning out 1-oz Gold Eagles and the immensely popular 1-oz Silver Eagles , which have sold at record paces in recent years.\nAmerican Gold Eagles are 22-karat gold, which means they contain 91.6% gold and 8.4% of a copper-silver alloy. Because Gold Eagles are 22-karat, many investors incorrectly believe that Gold Eagles have less than an ounce of gold. This is not so.\nGold Eagles: exactly 1-oz ounce of gold\nThe 1-oz American Gold Eagles contain exactly one ounce of gold, and the smaller fractional-ounce Gold Eagles contain the gold content stamped on them. The copper-silver alloy causes the coins to weigh slightly more than their stated gold contents.\nAmerican Gold Eagles\nLegal Tender Gold Coins\nAmerican Eagles are legal tender coins, but their face values are symbolic, as Gold Eagles do not sell at their legal tender values; Gold Eagles sell at prices that reflect the value of their gold content plus small premiums for being coins.\nAmerican Gold Eagles: four sizes\nThe 1-oz Gold Eagle coins are $50 face value, the 1/2-oz coins $25, the 1/4-oz coins $15, and the 1/10-oz coins $5. One-ounce Gold Eagles come in tubes of twenty but can be bought in smaller quantities.\nAll four American Gold Eagle sizes carry the same design. Gold Eagles minted 1986-1991 are dated with Roman numerals. In 1992, the U.S. Mint switched to Arabic numbers for dating Gold Eagles.\nIf you would like to discuss buying American Gold Eagles, or would like to discuss any aspect of investing in gold , call us at 800-528-1380.

Currency in Massively Multiplayer games is almost universally oversimplified. Coin standards in vastly different games have an overwhelming similarity because game designers are content to use familiar conventions. Players don\u2019t mind because they don\u2019t have to learn a new currency system. But when talking about world immersion or in-world consistency, does the same old same old make sense?\nCoin of the Realm\nThe economic trope we\u2019re familiar with in modern fantasy mmogs is a simple base ten currency built on coins of different metals. Ten coppers equals one silver, ten silvers equal one gold, ten gold equal one platinum, right? A tried and true way to go about it, and one we\u2019re all used to it from D&D. This may seem like a small and unimportant issue, but I believe that a different approach to currency would be an improvement in Massively Multiplayer gaming. A change in name would be a good place to start. If you have to have the copper/silver/gold/plat system, why do you have to call them by the metals they\u2019re made of? In the US, our copper is the penny. Why not do a small bit of design work up front and give players a more interesting vocabulary to use when referring to their coins? In the Forgotten Realms kingdom of Cormyr, coppers are called \u201cthumbs\u201d, silvers are called \u201cfalcons\u201d, golds are called \u201clions\u201d and platinums are \u201ctri-crowns\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three falcons for that buckler\u201d sounds a good deal more immersive than \u201cthree silvers\u201d. Having a consistent naming convention for your in-game nation\u2019s currency will go a long way towards establishing it\u2019s validity.\nDeprecate Base 10\nFor a more flavourful currency system, a non-base ten economy would be a welcome change. The united states has several different units of coinage. One hundred pennies, twenty nickels, and four quarters all are equal to the dollar. Simply from a convenience standpoint, being able to pay for items in different ways makes sense if you\u2019re going for realism. In the real world coins aren\u2019t magically converted to lower denominations. Warhammer Online is doing exactly this, using an imperial system of currency. Twelve brass pennies will equal a silver schilling, and twenty schillings will net you a gold pound. And, as you\u2019ll notice, they are using actual names for their units of currency. Already you have the impression that the nation-states of Warhammer have a history behind them, which has culminated in a naming and numbering convention for their currency.\nExchange your money at teller window two, please\nAn aspect of real-world currency that I am not aware of existing in any game at the moment is the simple reality of multiple currencies. While banks will recognize rupees and dollars interchangeably, trying to pay for a taxi ride in Seattle with rupees will likely get you kicked out at the curb. The nation of ShinyMetal should probably have a different money standard than the nation of FuzzyCritters. Having to deal with coin from several different areas of the game world would be a small additional challenge for players to address. This, of course, assumes a relatively large world map. The smaller the area the more likely that there will only be one currency used. Beyond lending a sense of realism to the game, MMOG players are nothing if not mini-economists. A brisk market in currency exchanges would likely spring up, above and beyond the usual item and property sales.\nOof\u2026what do you have in here, gold?\nFor the sake of total immersion, give coinage an in-game physical element. Even a sack of pennies can weigh several pounds. Just think what a sack full of gold coins could weigh. Adding weight to coinage would force players to think more carefully about their travel decisions, and demand that players have some form of base location from which to operate. If you\u2019re thinking of having players establish proper camps in the wilderness, this could be a good way to enforce that. To give the weight more meaning, have banks that do not have teleportation technology. IE, don\u2019t allow items and currency stored in one bank to be immediately accessible from another. This will make traveling to new locales a real experience for players, and further enforce a sense of reality.\nEncouraging players to get involved in the in-game economy is always rewarding. Most need no prompting, but there will always be a few who could use a pat on the back. An immersive economy will be vastly more appealing to some players, engaging individuals who traditionally play minor roles in MMOG economies. A modest amount of up-front game design will net you big rewards in including potential players.\n"}], [{"score": 838.0033, "uuid": "2c53231c-94d8-5890-94b8-9524ade39d04", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0012wb-54-12462", "target_hostname": "www.amergold.com", "target_uri": "http://www.amergold.com/library/about.php", "page_rank": 4.7241167e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Gold</em> coins, Buy <em>gold</em>, <em>gold</em> bullion, US <em>gold</em> silver coins", "snippet": "Our goal <em>is</em> <em>to</em> provide the best value, selection, and service in <em>gold</em>, silver, <em>platinum</em>, and palladium coins and bars.

China, Australia and the 15 other largest mining nations averaged weekly output of 41.6 tons last year, researcher GFMS Ltd. estimates. Even though prices have fallen 5.1 percent to $1,185.30 from a record $1,249.40 an ounce May 14, the median in a Bloomberg survey of 23 traders, analysts and investors shows it will reach $1,500 by the end of the year.\nBuying accelerated as the MSCI World Index of 23 developed nations\u2019 stocks tumbled as much as 16 percent since mid-April and the euro weakened to a four-year low against the dollar. Holders of ETPs, including George Soros and John Paulson, accumulated a record 1,938 tons by May 21, eclipsing all but four of the biggest central-bank holdings.\n\u201cYou could see gold go up another $1,000,\u201d said Evan Smith, who helps manage $2 billion at U.S. Global Investors Inc. in San Antonio and in 2006 correctly predicted that gold would reach $700 within two years. \u201cAll of the turmoil and problems we\u2019ve seen in Europe is just another reminder that there\u2019s a lot of value in gold as a safe haven.\u201d\nThe risk to gold bulls lies in economic growth, which should buoy the prospects of metals linked to industrial demand, such as copper and silver. The world economy will expand 4.2 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said April 21, raising its January projection from 3.9 percent.\nIndustrial Metals\nAstor Asset Management LLC, with $520 million under management, held as much as 10 percent of its assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETP backed by bullion, according to Bryan Novak, managing director of the Chicago-based company. The firm sold the stake in the first quarter.\nChina, the biggest consumer of industrial metals, will expand 10.1 percent this year, more than three times the pace of the U.S.\u2019s anticipated 3.2 percent gain, according to as many as 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe feeling now is as we move into the expansion phase of economic growth, we want to be diversified in economically sensitive metals,\u201d Novak said. \u201cWe\u2019re not negative on the economy now.\u201d\n\u2018Afraid of Debasement\u2019\nWhile gold is favored by investors when the dollar weakens and inflation gains, the metal can also advance at other times. Gold rose 5.8 percent in 2008 as U.S. consumer prices gained 0.1 percent. The metal added 18 percent in 2005 when the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure against six counterparts, advanced 13 percent. Gold rose 8 percent this year as the U.S. Dollar Index jumped 11 percent. U.S. consumer prices dropped in April.\n\u201cPeople are afraid of the debasement of all the currencies,\u201d said Peter Schiff, president and chief global strategist for Darien, Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital, whose clients have more than $2 billion in assets. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is that gold is still as low as it is,\u201d he said, predicting $5,000 to $10,000 an ounce in the next five to 10 years.\nSince the last week of April, ETPs have been adding bullion at a pace not seen since the first quarter of 2009, in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Buying rose as European policymakers agreed on an almost $1 trillion emergency loan package to prevent sovereign defaults.\nHalf the Peak\nAssets in gold-backed products increased 18.3 tons last week, according to UBS data. The bank revised its estimate for the previous week\u2019s holdings.\nGold is still at half the peak set in 1980, after adjusting for inflation. Then, prices rose to $850, equal to $2,266 today, according to a calculator on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nSupply from mines, which peaked in 2001, fell in five of the last eight years, data from London-based GFMS show. Companies are digging deeper to extract dwindling reserves, with mines in South Africa extending as far as 2.35 miles (3.8 kilometers) down.\nInvestment, including bars and coins, almost doubled to 1,901 tons last year, exceeding jewelry demand for the first time in three decades, according to GFMS. Jewelry will jump 19 percent to 2,100 tons this year and industrial use 8 percent to 398 tons, Sydney-based Macquarie Group Ltd. says.\nCentral Banks\nMuenze Oesterreich AG, the Vienna-based mint that makes the Philharmonic, the best-selling gold coin in Europe and Japan, on May 12 said it had sold 243,500 ounces since April 26, more than the 205,300 ounces sold in the entire first quarter.\nCentral banks and governments are also buying gold, adding 425.4 tons last year, for a combined 30,116.9 tons, the most since 1964 and the first expansion since 1988, data from the World Gold Council show. Official reserves of central banks and governments may expand by another 192 to 289 tons this year, according to CPM Group, a research and asset-management company in New York.\nThe net-long position in Comex futures, or bets on higher prices, is within 13 percent of the record reached in November, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. The most widely held option gives owners the right to buy gold at $1,500 an ounce by December, data from the bourse in New York show.\nEconomists\u2019 outlook may be too rosy, said Michael Pento, chief economist at Delta Global Advisors in Holmdel, New Jersey, who correctly predicted the 2008 commodity collapse. Some investors judge that a debt crisis in Greece may spread elsewhere in the euro zone, including Spain and Portugal.\nBillionaire Managers\n\u201cThe second half of this year will likely show very anemic growth on a global basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis in Greece is going to spread to Spain and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to deal with. They are bailing out debt with more debt and it isn\u2019t sustainable. It\u2019s a wonderful scenario for gold.\u201d\nBillionaire John Paulson\u2019s New York-based Paulson & Co. hedge fund is the SPDR gold trust\u2019s biggest investor, with 31.5 million shares, or about 96 tons, a May 17 regulatory filing showed. Kyle Bass, the head of Dallas-based Hayman Advisors LP who made $500 million in 2007 on the U.S. subprime collapse, bought gold this month, according to a letter to clients.\nBuying at the start of a bubble is \u201crational,\u201d Soros said in January. His New York-based Soros Fund Management LLC was the sixth-biggest investor in the SPDR fund in the first quarter, a May 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. He trimmed his holding by 9.6 percent from the previous quarter.\n\u201cPeople still want a store of wealth,\u201d said Andrew Karsh, co-manager of funds for the Credit Suisse Total Commodity Return Strategy team. \u201cA lot of the fundamentals are still in place.\u201d\n\u2013With assistance from Jonathan Tirone in Vienna.

Extract of a Letter from William Brownrigg M.D. F.R.S. to Wm. Watson F.R.S.\nRead Dec. 13. 1750.\nWhitehaven, Dec. 5, 1750\nDear Sir,\nI take the Freedom to enclose to you an Account of a Semi-metal call'd Platina di Pinto; which, so far as I know, hath not been taken notice of by any Writer on Minerals. Mr. Hill (note) , who is one of the most modern, makes no mention of it. Presuming therefore that the Subject is new, I request the Favour of you to lay this Account before the Royal Society, to be by them read and published, if they think it deserving those Honours. I should sooner have published this Account, but waited, in hopes of finding Leisure to make further Experiments on this Body with sulphureous and other Cements; also with Mercury, and several corrosive Menstrua. But these Experiments I shall now defer, until I learn how the above is receiv'd. The Experiments which I have related were several of them made by a Friend (note) , whose Exactness [p. 585] in performing them, and Veracity in relating them, I can rely on: However, for greater Certainty, I shall myself repeat them. I am, dear Sir,\nYour most obedient Servant,\nW. Brownrigg.\nII. Memoirs of a Semi-metal called Platina di Pinto, found in the Spanish West Indies.\nAltho' the History of Minerals, and other fossil Substances, hath been diligently cultivated, especially by the Moderns; yet it must be acknowleged, that, among the vast Variety of Bodies which are the Objects of that Science, there still remains Room for new Inquiries.\nNo Wonder that, among the great, and almost inexhaustible Varieties of Salts, Ores, and other Corncretes, new Appearances and Mixtures before unknown, should daily be discover'd: But that, among Bodies of a more simple Nature, and particularly among the metalline Tribe, several distinct Species should still remain almost wholly unknown to Naturalists, will doubtless appear more strange and extraordinary.\nGold is usually esteem'd the most ponderous of Bodies; and yet I have seen, in the Possession of the late Professor s'Gravesande (note) , a metalline Substance, brought from the East Indies, that was specifically heavier than Gold, by at least a twentieth Part. Mercury, next to Gold, is commonly said to be the heaviest Body; yet Mercury is greatly exceeded in specific Gravity [p. 586] by a Semi metal brought from the West Indies, whereof I have now the Honour to present Specimens to the Royal Society. And this Semi-metal seems more particularly to deserve our Attention, as it is endu'd with some very singular Qualities, which plainly demonstrate that certain general Theorems, tho' long establish'd, and universally receiv'd by the Metallurgists, yet do not hold true in all Cases, and ought not to be admitted into their Arts, without proper Limitations and Restrictions. For instance, that Gold and Silver may be purified from all heterogenous Substances by Coppellation, is a Proposition that all Assayers and Refiners have long thought true and undeniable; yet this Proposition ought not to be receiv'd by those Artificers, without an Exception to the Semi-metal here treated of; since, like those nobler Metals, it resists the Power of Fire, and the destructive Force of Lead in that Operation.\nThis Semi-metal was first presented to me about nine Years ago, by Mr. Charles Wood, a skilful and inquisitive Metallurgist, who met with it in Jamaica, whither it had been brought from Carthagena in New Spain. And the same Gentleman hath since gratified my Curiosity, by making further Inquiries concerning this Body. It is found in considerable Quantities in the Spanish West Indies (in what Part I could not learn) and is there known by the Name of Platina di Pinto. The Spaniards probably call it Platina, from the Resemblance in Colour that it bears to Silver. It is bright and shining, and of a uniform Texture; it takes a fine Polish, and is not subject to tarnish or rust; it is extremely hard and compact, but, like Bath-metal, or cast Iron, brittle, and cannot be extended under the Hammer.\n[p. 587] The Spaniards do not dig it in the Form of Ore, but find it in Dust, or small Grains, as herewith presented to the Royal Society. Whether they gather it in a pretty pure State, as brought to us, or wash it, like Gold-dust, from among Sand, and other lighter Substances, is to me unknown: However, it is seldom collected perfectly pure; since, among several Parcels of it that I have seen, I constantly observ'd a large Mixture of a shining black Sand, such as is found on the Shores of Virginia and Jamaica, which is a rich iron Ore, and answers to the Magnet. It hath also usually mix'd with it some few shining Particles of a golden Colour, which seem to be a Substance of a different Nature.\nIt is very probable that there is great Plenty of this Semi-metal in the Spanish West Indies; since Trinkets made of it are there very common. A Gentleman of Jamaica bought five Pounds of it at Carthagena for less than its Weight of Silver; and it was formerly sold for a much lower Price.\nWhen exposed by itself to the Fire, either in Grains, or in larger Pieces, it is of extreme difficult Fusion; and hath been kept for two Hours in an Air-Furnace, in a Heat that would run down cast Iron in fifteen Minutes: Which great Heat it endur'd without being melted or washed; neither could it be brought to fuse in this Heat, by adding it to Borax, and other saline Fluxes. But the Spaniards have a Way of melting it down, either alone, or by means of some Flux; and cast it into Sword-hilts, Buckles, Snuff-boxes, and other Utensils.\nWhen exposed to a proper Degree of Fire, with Lead, Silver, Gold, Copper, or Tin, it readily melts [p. 592=588] and incorporates with these Metals; rendering the Mixture, like itself, extremely hard and brittle.\nHaving been melted in an Assay-Furnace, on a Test with Lead, and therewith exposed to a great Fire for three Hours, till all the Lead was wrought off, the Platina was afterwards found remaining at the Bottom of the Test, without having suffer'd any Alteration or Diminution by this Operation.\nA Piece of Platina was put into strong and pure Aqua fortis, and therewith placed in a Sand-heat for twelve Hours: The Platina, when taken out of the Aqua fortis, was found of the same Weight as when put into it; being in no-wise dissolved or corroded by that Menstruum.\nId had been reported, that this Semi-metal was specifically heavier than Gold; but having weigh'd several Pieces of it hydrostatically in a nice Assay-Balance, I found one of these Pieces to weigh in Air gr. 241/8, and in Water gr. 122/8: So that its specific Gravity was to that of Water exactly as 15:1. Another Piece, that seem'd to be cast very open and porous, I found in Gravity to Water only as 13.91 to 1. Altho' this last mention'd Piece, could it have endur'd the Hammer as well as Gold, might probably have been reduc'd to a considerably greater Degree of Solidity than that of the first-mention'd Specimen. For the purest Gold is seldom found, after Fusion, to come up to its true specific Weight, until it hath been brought up to its greatest Degree of Solidity under the Hammer.\nI also weigh'd an equal Mixture of Gold and Platina, which I found nearly as ponderous as Gold itself; the specific Weight of this Mixture being to that of Water as 19 to 1.\n[p. 593=589] It has been reported that the Spaniards have sometimes been tempted to adulterate Gold with Platina, as the Mixture could not be distinguish'd from true Gold by all the ordinary Trials: But the Gold thus adulterated was, upon a nicer Examination, found hard and brittle, and could not be separated from the Platina, and render'd ductile and pure, either by Cementation, or by the more ordinary Operations with Lead and Antimony. In order therefore to prevent this Fraud, the King of Spain commanded that the Mines of Platina should be stopped up; so that this Semi-metal is now much scarcer than formerly.\nFrom the foregoing Account it appears, that no known Body approaches nearer to the Nature of Gold, in its most essential Properties of Fixedness and Solidity, than the Semi-metal here treated of; and that it also bears a great Resemblance to Gold in other Particulars. Some Alchemists have thought that Gold differ'd from other Metals in nothing so much as in its specific Gravity; and that, if they could obtain a Body that had the specific Weight of Gold, they could easily give it all the other Qualities of that Metal. Let them try their Action on this Body; which, if it can be made as ductile as Gold, will not easily distinghuish'd from Gold itself.\nUpon the whole, this Semi-metal seems a very singular Body, that merits an exacter Inquiry into its Nature than hath hitherto been made;since it is not altogether improbable, that, like the Magnet, Iron, Antimony, Mercury, and other metallic Substances, it may be endowed with some peculiar Qualities [p. 590], that may render it of singular Use and Importance to Mankind.\nSpecimens of Platina presented to the Royal Society.\nNo. 1 Platina, in Dust, or minute Masses, mixed with Black Sand, and other Impurities, as brought from the Spanish West Indies.\n2.

To the Royal Society.\nLondon, Dec. 13, 1750\nGentlemen,\nI beg Leave to subjoin a few Lines to my learned and ingenious Friend Dr. Brownrigg's Paper concerning the Platina di Pinto, or what is likewise call'd in Ameria Juan Blanco. This Substance is mention'd in no Author I have met with, except by our worthy Brother Don Antonia d'Ulloa, who, in the History of his Voyage to South America, Vol. II. Book 6. Chap. 10. which I have here extracted, and translated from the Spanish, when giving an Account of the Gold and Silver Mines in the Province of Quito, and of the various Methods of separating these Metals from other Substances, with which they are combin'd, says, that, \"in the Territory of Choco... there are Gold Mines, in which that [p. 590] Metal is so disguised and enveloped with other mineral Substances, Juices, and Stones, that, for their Separation from the Gold, they are obliged to use Quicksilver. Sometimes they find mineral Substances, which, from their being mixed with Platina, they chuse to neglect. This Platina is a Stone (Piedra) of such Resistance, that it is not easily broken by a Blow upon an Anvil. It is not subdued by Calcination, and it is very difficult to extract the Metal it contains even with much Labour and Expence.\"\nIn the before mention'd Work, Chap. 11. the same Author, when speaking of the remaining Works of the Indians of old, says, \"the Specula wrought out of Stones, which are found in the Places of Worship of the Indians, are of two kinds, in relation to the Matter of which they are made: One of these is call'd Piedra de Inga, the other Piedra de Gallinazo. The first of these is smooth, of a leaden Colour, and not transparent; they are usually found wrought of a circular Figure: One of the Surfaces is plain, and as smooth as though it were made of a kind of Chrystal; the other Surface is oval, or rather somewhat spherical, and not so much burnish'd as the plain one. Although they vary in their Size, they are commonly from three to four inches in Diameter; but he has seen one that was a Foot and half in Diameter. Its principal Surface was concave, and much augmented the Size of Objects, as its Polish, was in as great Perfection as though it had been work'd by a dextrous Artist in these Times.\n[p. 588=592] This Stone has certain Veins, or hair-like Appearances, on its Surface; whereby it is render'd less fit for a Speculum, and is apt to break in these Veins in receiving any Blow. May are persuaded, or at least suspect, that the Matter of these is a cast Composition; and although there are some Appearances of this being so, they are not sufficiently convincing. In this Country there are Gullies (Quebradas) where the Mineral of them is found rough, and from whence some are always taken; but these are not now wrought for those Purposes for which heretofore they were employ'd by he Indians: But this is no Reason but that some of them may have been cast, as with the same Material taken out of the Mine, they may have been made artificially, and thereby have receiv'd a greater Degree of Perfection, as well in their Quality as in their Figure.\" He says further, \"that, although at present, these, as well as several other things found there are but of small Value, nevertheless they are extremely curious, and worthy to be esteem'd, as well for their great Antiquity, as for their being the Performances of those barbarous People.\"\nSome of these Piedras de Inga I now take the Liberty of laying before the Society, both in their rough and in their polish'd State. They were brought hither with several other Curiosities from America by that excellent Person, and my much lamented Friend, Don Pedro Maldonado, and were presented by him to our most worthy President, who was pleased to put them into my Hands. They are doubtless of a metalline Substance, and have, in [p. 589=593] my Opinion, evident Marks of having been fused and cast. They very much resemble, as you will see by comparing them, the Platina before mention'd: And though they are call'd (Piedras) Stones by Don Antonio d'Ulloa, he likewise gives the same Appellation to the Platina. I cannot therefore help recommending to some curious Metallurgist of the Society to make the Experiment, whether or no, when the Piedras de Inga are, by a proper Process, divested of their stony and other heterogeneous Parts, the metalline Residuum will not resemble, as well in specific Gravity (for which it is so remarkable) as in other Properties, the purified Platina now before us?\nWm. Watson.\nIV.\nRead Dec. 20, 1750.\nIn January 1742-3. there were brought from Jamaica, in a Man of War, several Bars (as thought) of Gold, consigned from different Merchants of that Island, to their different Correspondents here, as Bars of Gold. These Bars had the same specific Gravity, or rather more than Gold, and were exactly like that Metal in Colour, Grain &c. A Piece of one of these counterfeit Bars was sent to the Mint to be tested, and it was found to be twenty one Carats three Grains worse than Standard.\nEmanuel Mendez da Costa (note) .\n[p. 594]\nV. Extract of a Letter from Wm. Brownrigg M.D. and F.R.S. to Wm. Watson F.R.S. containing some further Experiments upon the Platina.\nRead Feb. 28. 1750-51.\nWhitehaven, Feb. 13, 1750\nI was favour'd with your Letter of Dec. 15, and am much obliged to you for the Trouble you took in presenting my Specimens of the Platina to the Royal Society, together with my Memoir relating thereto; and I thank you for the Addition you made to it of the Extract of Don d'Ulloa's Voyage.\nThe Gentleman, whose Experiments on Platina I mention'd to the Royal Society, was Mr. Charles Wood, who permitted me to make what Use of them I pleased; and I did not pretend to have made any new Discovery, nor to know so much of that Body, as hath long been known to the Spaniards. I might indeed have made use of his Authority; but he was not ambitious of appearing in Print.\nThe chief thing about which I had any Difficulty, was what had been asserted of the Platina's resisting the Force of Lead in Coppellation. This Experiment I have tried therefore, by adding to gr. xxvi. of Platina, sixteen times its Weight of pure Lead, that I had myself reduced from Litharge. To the Lead put into a Coppel, and placed in a proper Furnace; as soon as it was melted I added the Platina, which in a short time was dissolved in the Lead. After the Lead was all wrought off, there remain'd at the Bottom of the Coppel a Pellet of Platina, which I found to weigh only gr. xxi.; so that, in [p. 595] this Opinion, the Platina had lost neat a fifth Part of its Weight.\nAccording therefore to this Experiment, the Platina does not wholly resist the Force of Lead in Coppellation; but, by repeated Operations of that kind with larger Quantities of Lead, may probably all be destroy'd: And by such repeated Coppellations, Gold and Silver may very likely be refin'd from it; although what was before asserted may hold pretty true, with regard to the common Coppellation of the Assayers and Refiners.\nMr. Wood said, that, in his Experiment, he thought the Platina rather gain'd than lost, in Weight by Coppellation. This might happen from some small Mixture of Lead, or other Metal continuing with it after it remained no longer fused.\nFrom this single Experiment I will not be quite positive that Lead thus consumes some small Quantity of Platina, since it is possible the Platina used might not be pure. Besides, in order to keep it longer in Fusion, I urged on the Experiment with an uncommon Degree of Heat, especially towards the End of the Operation; although I think no great Error could thence arise; as half a Drachm of Silver, which I coppel'd at the same time, had lost only two Grains in the Operation.\nI am told that one Mr. Ord, formerly a Factor to the South Sea Company, took in Payment from some Spaniard; Gold, to the Value of 500 l.

That\u2019s all right\u2013as a theory. What is the matter with loyalty to yourself?\u201d\n- Speech, 3/30/1901\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens was born on November 30, 1835 and died April 21, 1910.\u00a0 He is known by his pseudonym Mark Twain, a moniker under which he authored humorous and poignant fiction novels and spoke publicly. He is known, in the collective mind of North Americans, for his novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), and its sequel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885).\nTwain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri and achieved great success as a writer and public speaker, befriending presidents, artists, industrialists and European royalty. Twain even developed a close and lasting relationship with Nikola Tesla and spoke highly of John D. Rockefeller in writings that would become parts of his autobiography.\nOn April 18 2012, three days before the 102nd anniversary of the late, great authors\u2019 death, the House of Representatives passed the Mark Twain Commemorative Coin Act , marking perhaps the most worthwhile piece of legislation in recent memory.\nThe bill, H.R. 2452, was first presented on July 7, 2011 by the courageous Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, who stood in the ring in the corner of his and Twain\u2019s state of Missouri and battled it out against nay-saying northern, eastern and western states.\nThe legislation allows for no more than 100,000 $5 gold and 350,000 $1 silver commemorative coins for issuance during the calendar year 2012.\n\u201cMark Twain is one of our nation\u2019s greatest scribes whose work has withstood the test of time and continues to remind Americans of where we have come as a people,\u201d said Rep. John Larson of Connecticut, who cosponsored H.R. 2453.\u201dThese coins will help a new generation of Americans learn about Twain\u2019s contributions.\u201d And with the price of gold and silver rocketing as they have, the leaders of this great nation can rest assured that it will only be the well-to-do generations\u2019 who have the money to afford the lesson offered by these precious metal coins. Twain coins have had trouble passing in the House and Senate, causing the coins to be introduced in a non-anniversary year.\nWhat sort of lessons does this great scribe of our nation offer to the progeny of his generation? Always peeking out from behind the obfuscation of his tongue-in-cheek was a riveting conclusion as to why things were the way they were.\nTwain, in The New York Herald in 1900 admitted to a transformation and political awakening, inspired in him by the Philippine-American War, away from being \u201ca red-hot imperialist:\u201d\nI wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific \u2026Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I asked myself? \u2026 I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves. But I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris [which ended the Spanish-American War ], and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem. It should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people free, and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land.\nTwain looked beyond the tiny constipation of his own nation to see the overarching insufficiency of\u00a0 civilization in carrying the torch of man much further without stumbling upon intense tragedy. He saw a deeply corrupted core of society and posited ancient winds as the source. He did not look to presidents, some of whom his friends, for answers to why the world turned as it did, for to ask such a task of them, he knew, was asking too much, for they too were mere mortals.\n\u201cIs it, perhaps, possible that there are two kinds of Civilization\u2013one for home consumption and one for the heathen market?\u201d\n- To the Person Sitting in Darkness\n\u201cThere is no salvation for us but to adopt Civilization and lift ourselves down to its level.\u201d\n- To the Person sitting in Darkness\n\u201cThere are many humorous things in the world; among them, the white man\u2019s notion that he less savage than the other savages.\u201d\n- Following the Equator\n\u201cEvery civilization carries the seeds of its own destruction, and the same cycle shows in them all. The Republic is born, flourishes, decays into plutocracy, and is captured by the shoemaker whom the mercenaries and millionaires make into a king. The people invent their oppressors, and the oppressors serve the function for which they are invented.\u201d\n- Mark Twain in Eruption\nFunds collected from surcharges placed on sales of the commemorative coins would get split into fourths and paid equally to:\nthe Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, to support the continued restoration of the Mark Twain house and grounds, and ensure continuing growth and innovation in museum programming to research, promote and educate on the legacy of Twain.\nthe Mark Twain Project at the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley, California, to be used for research and education purposes.\nthe Center for Mark Twain Studies at Elmira College Elmira College, New York, to be used for research and education purposes.\nthe Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal, Missouri, to preserve historical sites related to Twain and help support programs to study and promote his legacy.\n"}, {"score": 824.7329, "uuid": "cef0b57c-850d-5ff3-a406-75c5768b5d0e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-99-14870", "target_hostname": "www.langleyfcu.org", "target_uri": "http://www.langleyfcu.org/personal/accounts/loans/credit/platinum.html", "page_rank": 1.1769473e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Platinum</em> Rewards - Langley Federal Credit Union", "snippet": "If you like <em>gold</em>, you&#x27;ll love <em>platinum</em>.

F.", "explanation": null, "document": "How Can I Value My Gold Scrap?\nSunday, 13 Mar 2011\nHow to Calculate the Value of Scrap Gold?\nIf you have scrap gold and you\u2019d like to sell it how do you come up with a value? Spot gold values change daily so before you bring your gold jewelry, dental fillings, nuggets, coins, watches, and bars to Union Square Jewelry Buyers have an idea of what it is worth and how that value is appraised.\n1. Separate your scrap gold into their various karat values.\nThe various popular karat values are: 10k, 14k, 18k and 22k. You may need a magnifying glass to see the pureness hallmark inscribed on the piece. If not, you may need to have the gold tested. There is the possibility that some of the gold is plated, which we can determine with certainty by using rare Earth magnets and chemical tests.\n2. Bite down on it!\nWell, if the gold is near pure, like 22kt and you bite down on it, your bite will leave an indentation on the gold surface. The rule of thumb: The softer the gold the more pure. We don't recommend this test... however it is one of the most popular images people have of testing for gold purity.\n3. Magnet Test\nRare Earth magnets can be purchased online. This is a simple test we usually perform right away. It tests for imitation, rolled, plated and filled gold. It allows for deeper penetration of the item to identify non-gold material below the surface. Just run the magnet over the gold and look for the piece that is showing signs of life! That\u2019s the gold that has metal below the surface.\n4. Acid Test (not to be confused with Haight Ashbury)\nThe acid test you can perform on your own. The testing acid and the stone can be purchased from jewelry suppliers such as this San Francisco supplier located 1 block from our Union square office: Otto Frei ( http://www.ottofrei.com/store/product.php?productid=20555&cat=0&page=1on... ). For 14k items rub the item on the stone to create a gold scratch sample and place a drop of 14k acid onto the sample. If your item is 14k the scratch will stand up to the acid and no physical change will be noticed. If the scratch sample is 10k the 14k acid will turn it brown. If the scratch bubbles up and disappears, it is not gold at all! If the scratch sample is unmarked, test using the next higher acid 18k followed by 22k acid until the scratch turns brown. When the scratch turns brown you will know the karat of the residue is the previous measurement.\nIf you have gold coins, they may have a numismatic (coin) value above their metal value, based on age, rarity, and condition. Gold coins are not pure but can be as much as .999 which is pretty close!\n5. Determine the weight of each group by using a scale.\nIdeally use a gram scale but also measure pennyweight (dwt) as many buyers quote using this measurement. Quoting dwt allows buyers to quote up the price or more accurately make it appear as if they are paying more. How? It takes 20 dwt to make a troy ounce whereas it takes 31.1 grams to equal the same weight. The buyer quoting $37 a dwt makes the buyer quoting $31 a gram sound like a rip-off. However, in reality the $31 gram buyer is actually paying more! We quote in dwt ourselves but if a client prefers grams we will offer that conversion too.\n6. Determine today's price of gold.\nYou can find this online at http://www.kitco.com/charts/livegold.html or in your local newspaper. Fine gold as of this writing is about $1400 per troy ounce. (A troy ounce equals 31.1 grams. This never changes.) To get a value divide today's gold price by 31.1 this comes up with a per gram value. Now multiply by the fineness of the gold. For each group of gold, divide the karat by 24, then multiply that number by today's gold price per gram. For example, if you have 10kt gold and the current price of gold is $45.016 per gram ($1400.00 / 31.1), then the price of your scrap gold is $45.016 x .4167 = $18.75 per gram (29.169 per dwt).\n10kt = 10/24 = .4167, 14kt = 14/24 = .5833, 18kt = 18/24 = .750\nMultiply the price per gram by the weight in grams. If you have 10 grams of 10kt gold and you calculated the price at $45.016 per gram, then your scrap gold is worth 10 x $45.06 = $450.60.\nNotes\nA. Scrap gold buyers buy gold at about 30 to 60 percent of its spot value, since they must process it and still turn a profit from reselling it. WE PAY 20-30% because we must, by law, hold the product for 30-days before we can resell it. In 30-days the market may go up or down 5-10%.\nB. Gold refiners pay 90-97% and most reputable refiners have a website stating actual percentages but they do have minimums, usually 3-5 ounces. Smaller amounts can be sold on Ebay for 80% sometimes more if you have good wearable jewelry.\nC. Signed designer jewelry, antique jewelry and larger heavier pieces in good condition can fetch premiums over spot price. The premiums could be 25% to 100% of spot value depending on the manufacturer, period, style and condition.\nD. At today\u2019s spot prices jewelry with smaller diamonds get weighed along with the gold. Larger diamonds such as .25ct or above should be removed or at least factored out for the purpose of estimating a scrap value. Larger diamonds can be sold separately and could add value to a scrap purchase.\nE. Dental gold can be 18k - 24k. Partials and bridges sometimes have gold underneath the ceramic overlay and can be accessed with a hammer but be careful, it will fly everywhere when you hit it. White metal in dental hardware can look like platinum but is not to be confused with carbochlor which passes the acid test for gold and platinum. Either way this can be sent to refiners and it will be assayed just like gold and platinum.\nF. Buyers use grams and/or pennyweight (dwt) for calculations. There are 20 pennyweights in a troy ounce. You can substitute 20 for 31.1 to calculate pennyweight in our formula. You can also multiply a pennyweight by 1.555 to get an equivalent gram weight or divide a gram weight by the same 1.555 to get pennyweight.\nCategories\n"}, {"score": 823.4437, "uuid": "66b94273-cb3d-57ef-aca3-39e3032f788a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1705wb-50-04066", "target_hostname": "www.pvsb.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pvsb.com/marketing/Marketing?BANKID=70&LVLNBR=4&NAV_ITM_KEY=70100201", "page_rank": 1.2229378e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "BucksBack <em>Platinum</em> Edition Visa Card", "snippet": "Cash back accumulates as points and <em>is</em> redeemable in $25 (2,500 point) increments. \u0086\u0086Visa&#x27;s Zero Liability policy <em>is</em> valid on U.S. issued cards only.
