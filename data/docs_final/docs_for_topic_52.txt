Get all the facts to help you choose the ideal rice cooker for your home and you're sure to find this handy device one of the most indispensable machines in your kitchen.\nWhat is a rice cooker?\nThis handy one pot machine takes the guess work out of making fluffy rice every time. As well as rice, today's models can also be used for everything from cooking your morning porridge, to making hearty soups and even delicious puddings.\nBasic or multifunction?\nThere are two kinds of rice cookers: basic and multifunction. Basic models are the cheapest no-frills versions that are ideal for most home cooks. They usually come with a keep warm function to keep the rice heated once it's finished cooking and some are equipped with a steaming basket. You can use a basic rice cooker to cook soups, stews and puddings.\nMultifunction rice cookers are more expensive, but they have a range of automatic settings to let you slow cook, steam and cook a range of dishes. The most expensive use 'fuzzy logic' technology that allows you to perfectly cook every type of rice imaginable and will adjust the temperature throughout the cooking process to ensure a perfect result. Look for one with presets for all of the dishes you're likely to make and this is sure to become your most handy kitchen appliance.\nIt's all about size\nWhen you're choosing a rice cooker, think about the quantity of rice you'll want to cook at one time. If you're likely to cook for many, then opt for the largest option, similarly, choose the smaller models if you're only cooking for two. Think about the size of the machine and where you intend to store it.\nOptional extras\nFrom steamer baskets to LCD countdown screens, it seems like you can find every extra to go with a rice cooker.

Your answer will dictate how much water you use and how long you cook your brown rice.\nChewier rice = less water and less cooking time.\nSticker rice = more water and more cooking time.\nHeat the cooker. Place rice in the pressure cooker and stir, sauteeing until lightly toasted (1-2 minutes). Carefully stir in boiling water, seasoning options, and salt.\nLock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure. When high pressure is reached, lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure. Cook for 15-40 minutes, depending on how chewy or sticky you like your rice. Turn off heat and allow pressure to come down naturally for 10 minutes.\nRemove the lid. If your rice isn't done to your liking, replace the lid and allow it to steam in the residual heat for another few minutes (and be sure to make a note so you cook it longer next time).\nYour pressure cooker brown rice is now ready to be used in any way you'd like.

The links take you to the 4731.)\nOster Inspire Multi-Use Deluxe Rice Cooker:\n10 cup (20 cups) $29.99 I didn\u2019t think I would like this rice cooker, but I discovered that it does a really good job on white rice. It\u2019s also good for soups, stews and other dishes that need more liquid. I bought mine at Target.\nBuy from Amazon\nPanasonic SR-W15FSP Rice Cooker: 8 cup (16 cups), 600 watts, $29.99. The Panasonic has a glass lid without a hole and a sturdy steamer tray. The steamer tray sits on the bottom of the rice cooker pan. This steamer tray is useful, but I prefer one that suspends from the top of the pan. The Panasonic rice cooker has a removable cord. I bought mine at Wal-Mart. The link here is to a similar rice cooker. I was unable to find the model I have on the web. Wal-Mart still carries it. Buy from Amazon\nZojirushi NHS-10HX Rice Cooker: 6 Cup, $49.99. This rice cooker is a perfect size for 2 people. I use mine almost every day to cook our breakfast. I use it for rice also. It is sturdier than the other cheaper rice cookers I have. Buy from Amazon\nZojirushi NS-ZAC18 10-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker: $169.99. I bought this rice cooker to see if it was really worth it to use a fuzzy logic (computerized) rice cooker. If you cook primarily brown rice, this is the one to buy if you don\u2019t plan to cook other food in it .\u00a0It cooks perfect brown rice every time. For white rice, the less expensive rice cookers are just fine. Buy from Amazon\n* Note to rice cooker manufacturers: If you want me to review your rice cooker, please contact me.\n** Note - this rice cooker was reviewed at the request of the manufacturer and I received the rice cooker as a gift. I was not paid for this review and certainly did not need any more rice cookers.

Not only does it enhance the full flavor and texture of food, it helps retain juices and nutrients and is free of the metals and chemicals typically found in glazes and non-stick coatings.\nHow does cooking with VitaClay \u00ae enhance natural flavor?\nCooking foods in their own juices increases the intensity of their flavor; you don't have to add oils and fats for taste. What this means to you is you're cooking delicious dishes that are healthy and natural. The slow steady evaporation of steam from within the unglazed pores and the closed chamber of the clay pot make the foods you cook healthful, tender, and more flavorful.\nWhy cooking with VitaClay \u00ae is healthier solution for busy family on the go?\nBecause of the slow steady evaporation of steam from within the unglazed pores and the closed chamber of the clay pot, the foods you cook are healthier and more tender, but most importantly, more flavorful. Vitamins, minerals and aromatic elements are completely retained, since no water, stock or liquid has to be added. That means that your food simmers in, and absorbs, its own juices and nutrients rather than allowing the benefits to boil away, with the added liquid. It is perfect for a family who wants delicious and nutritious meals!\nDoes VitaClay\u00ae offer Space saving -- two appliances in one Authentic Rice Cooker and Programmable Slow Cooker?\nYes, the VitaClay offers extensive food cooking versatility, including large cuts of meat, better soups, and healthy steamed vegetables\nI've never cooked with VitaClay \u00ae before. Is it difficult to use the VitaClay \u00ae 2-in-1 cooker?\nVitaClay\u00ae cookers are powered by modern technology but the cooking vessel connects you to an ancient cooking method. It's convenient -- simply set and forget. It\u2019s like having a real gourmet chef right in your kitchen!\nHow do I clean a VitaClay \u00ae pot?\nFor general washing, wait until the clay pot cools. Then wash it in warm water with a very small amount of dishwashing liquid and rinse thoroughly. Be sure to let the pot dry completely.\nFor hard to remove residue or to do a thorough cleaning, allow the clay pot to soak overnight in the sink with water and \u00bc cup baking soda. Wash using a brush or nonmetallic scrubbing pad. Follow this treatment after cooking fish or foods with strong seasoning.\nDo I need to presoak brown rice prior to cooking? What are recommended water to rice ratios shall I choose after rinse of rice?\nAs a result of a fully sealed enclosure, it is not necessary to presoak rice before cooking. Simply rinse the rice and place in the cooker with water. Recommended water to rice ratios are:\nRegular white rice, long or short grain, sushi rice, jasmine rice, etc. - 1:1 (slightly more/less can be used if preferred)\nSticky/sweet rice - 0.8:1 (water adjusted a little less than regular rice)\nBrown rice \u2013 1.2-1.5:1 (more water can be added if preferred)\nHow do I apply the time conversion from traditional slow cooker recipes into VitaClay\u00ae Rice N\u2019 slow cookers Pro (VF7900-X) recipes?\nThe VitaClay \u00ae Rice N\u2019 Slow Cookers Pro preserves nutrients allowing food to cook in their natural juices. It brings food to a boil 2-4 times faster than conventional slow cookers then reduces the heat to a slow simmer for gourmet perfection. The Automatic Warming Cycle holds food perfectly cooked for up to 12 hours. It reduces the cooking time by about 30-50% and reduces the cooking liquid by about one-half.\nTo convert cooking time from conventional slow cooker recipes into VitaClay \u00ae slow cooking, the rule of thumb is if the conventional slow cooking time is set on \u2018high\u2019 for 4 hours, or on \u2018low\u2019 for 8 hours, the VitaClay\u00ae Rice/Slow Cooker Pro will only take 2 hours.\nHow can I prevent rice from sticking to the cooking pot?\nOf course when rice cooking cycle complete, your rice is ready to service. However, to achieve the best cooking result is to allow rice stay in \u201cWARM\u201d cycle for extra 15 minutes. When moisture settled, the rice will not stick to the cooking surface as well\nWhat types of approvals have VitaClay \u00ae cookers received for safety of use?\nVitaClay \u00ae cookers are UL, cUL listed. It meets standard requirement of FDA, CA Prop 65, which covers lead and cadmium test. Moreover, our VitaClay \u00ae has passed RoHS laboratory testing as well. The RoHS Directive stands for \"the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment\". This Directive bans the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants.\nWhat is meant by \u201cunglazed\u201d?\nMost earthenware and natural clay cooking utensils are coated with a \u201cglaze\u201d. This is a shiny coating applied to the surface to provide decoration and to seal the piece making it less susceptible to stains. But commercial glazes often contain pigments or chemical impurities that do touch the food. Other non-stick coatings, such as Teflon \u00ae, have been found to contain trace amounts of the chemicals use in their manufacture. Many are concerned about the long-term effects of these substances on humans.\nTraditional hard-fired unglazed clay, like the VitaClay \u00ae pot, have no such coatings. Unglazed clay has been used for thousands of years all over the world as cooking vessels. The slightly porous natural clay enables additional steaming not possible in metal, glass, or glazed ceramic pots. The VitaClay \u00ae line of slow cookers brings the healthy benefits of this ancient cooking to the modern kitchen with 21st century features.\nDo VitaClay \u00ae pots contain any lead?\nOur pots have been tested by an independent laboratory for lead contamination. This lab, like most others, can detect lead up to 0.01% or 100 parts per million (the same standard applied to children's toys). When testing our clay pot, the lab concluded that our pot is at least 99.99% lead-free. In other words, our pots may actually be 100% lead-free but the lab can't measure them to this level of accuracy.\nWe've long believed our pots are in fact 100% lead-free, but we cannot make this claim for legal reasons.\nView the lab report here.\nCan the clay pot be used as a serving piece?\nOf course! But be aware that the pot may be hot and that the natural clay surface is rougher than glazed clay or glass. Place the pot on a trivet or other protection for wood, plastic or composite table surfaces.\nWhat is the best way to clean the pot?\nAllow the pot to cool to room temperature, then wash it with warm water and dishwashing detergent and rinse with warm water. A dishwashing brush or a light scrubbing pad (such as a white Scotch Brite \u00ae or a Chore Girl \u00ae) may be used. Burned on food may be softened by filling the pot with warm water and allowing it to soak for several hours. Then, wash with detergent and warm water and rinse thoroughly. If odors build up in the pot due to oily or spicy foods, fill it with warm water and add 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Allow to soak overnight then wash normally.\nThe clay pot is safe for use in automatic dishwashers, but water scale may develop due to the drying cycle. This is not harmful but may be removed with a solution of half and half vinegar and water. Note that this is an unglazed pot, and some change in coloration with use is to be expected.\nHow do I remove burnt food from my VitaClay pot?\nTheresa, a helpful customer, shared this method for removing burnt food with us:\n\"Last week, I made rice pudding and some of the milk and rice burnt on the bottom.\nThe pudding turned out great but I did have some rice that really stuck to the\nbottom. I soaked it overnight but could not get the burnt rice off. I thought I\nwould try an experiment and put 1 cup water, 1/4 vinegar, 1 tablespoon of baking soda and\nturned the cooker on the brown rice setting and let it go through the cycle as if\nI was cooking rice. I checked it at the end of the cooking time and opened up\nthe lid. All the burnt stuff from the bottom came floating to the top and I just\npoured out the liquid and wiped it clean with a cloth, no scrubbing needed.\"\nCan I use metal utensils in the pot?\nYes. But be careful not to strike the pot hard as it may crack or break. Wooden or soft plastic utensils (like the stirring paddle provided) are preferred.\nDoes the pot require special care?\nLike any natural ceramic, the VitaClay \u00ae pot is sensitive to sudden thermal shocks. Do not place a heated pot in cold water. Allow it to cool first. Also, the pot may break if dropped or struck. This misuse is not covered by our warranty. It is best to store the pot in the cooker.\nWhy can't I log in to my Affiliate account?\nYour VitaClay\u00ae Affiliate account is a separate account from the your VitaClay\u00ae Store account.

It is perfect for a family who wants delicious and nutritious meals!\nDoes VitaClay\u00ae offer Space saving -- two appliances in one Authentic Rice Cooker and Programmable Slow Cooker?\nYes, the VitaClay offers extensive food cooking versatility, including large cuts of meat, better soups, and healthy steamed vegetables\nI've never cooked with VitaClay \u00ae before. Is it difficult to use the VitaClay \u00ae 2-in-1 cooker?\nVitaClay\u00ae cookers are powered by modern technology but the cooking vessel connects you to an ancient cooking method. It's convenient -- simply set and forget. It\u2019s like having a real gourmet chef right in your kitchen!\nHow do I clean a VitaClay \u00ae pot?\nFor general washing, wait until the clay pot cools. Then wash it in warm water with a very small amount of dishwashing liquid and rinse thoroughly. Be sure to let the pot dry completely.\nFor hard to remove residue or to do a thorough cleaning, allow the clay pot to soak overnight in the sink with water and \u00bc cup baking soda. Wash using a brush or nonmetallic scrubbing pad. Follow this treatment after cooking fish or foods with strong seasoning.\nDo I need to presoak brown rice prior to cooking? What are recommended water to rice ratios shall I choose after rinse of rice?\nAs a result of a fully sealed enclosure, it is not necessary to presoak rice before cooking. Simply rinse the rice and place in the cooker with water. Recommended water to rice ratios are:\nRegular white rice, long or short grain, sushi rice, jasmine rice, etc. - 1:1 (slightly more/less can be used if preferred)\nSticky/sweet rice - 0.8:1 (water adjusted a little less than regular rice)\nBrown rice \u2013 1.2-1.5:1 (more water can be added if preferred)\nHow do I apply the time conversion from traditional slow cooker recipes into VitaClay\u00ae Rice N\u2019 slow cookers Pro (VF7900-X) recipes?\nThe VitaClay \u00ae Rice N\u2019 Slow Cookers Pro preserves nutrients allowing food to cook in their natural juices. It brings food to a boil 2-4 times faster than conventional slow cookers then reduces the heat to a slow simmer for gourmet perfection. The Automatic Warming Cycle holds food perfectly cooked for up to 12 hours. It reduces the cooking time by about 30-50% and reduces the cooking liquid by about one-half.\nTo convert cooking time from conventional slow cooker recipes into VitaClay \u00ae slow cooking, the rule of thumb is if the conventional slow cooking time is set on \u2018high\u2019 for 4 hours, or on \u2018low\u2019 for 8 hours, the VitaClay\u00ae Rice/Slow Cooker Pro will only take 2 hours.\nHow can I prevent rice from sticking to the cooking pot?\nOf course when rice cooking cycle complete, your rice is ready to service. However, to achieve the best cooking result is to allow rice stay in \u201cWARM\u201d cycle for extra 15 minutes. When moisture settled, the rice will not stick to the cooking surface as well\nWhat types of approvals have VitaClay \u00ae cookers received for safety of use?\nVitaClay \u00ae cookers are UL, cUL listed. It meets standard requirement of FDA, CA Prop 65, which covers lead and cadmium test. Moreover, our VitaClay \u00ae has passed RoHS laboratory testing as well. The RoHS Directive stands for \"the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment\". This Directive bans the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants.\nWhat is meant by \u201cunglazed\u201d?\nMost earthenware and natural clay cooking utensils are coated with a \u201cglaze\u201d. This is a shiny coating applied to the surface to provide decoration and to seal the piece making it less susceptible to stains. But commercial glazes often contain pigments or chemical impurities that do touch the food. Other non-stick coatings, such as Teflon \u00ae, have been found to contain trace amounts of the chemicals use in their manufacture. Many are concerned about the long-term effects of these substances on humans.\nTraditional hard-fired unglazed clay, like the VitaClay \u00ae pot, have no such coatings. Unglazed clay has been used for thousands of years all over the world as cooking vessels. The slightly porous natural clay enables additional steaming not possible in metal, glass, or glazed ceramic pots. The VitaClay \u00ae line of slow cookers brings the healthy benefits of this ancient cooking to the modern kitchen with 21st century features.\nDo VitaClay \u00ae pots contain any lead?\nOur pots have been tested by an independent laboratory for lead contamination. This lab, like most others, can detect lead up to 0.01% or 100 parts per million (the same standard applied to children's toys). When testing our clay pot, the lab concluded that our pot is at least 99.99% lead-free. In other words, our pots may actually be 100% lead-free but the lab can't measure them to this level of accuracy.\nWe've long believed our pots are in fact 100% lead-free, but we cannot make this claim for legal reasons.\nView the lab report here.\nCan the clay pot be used as a serving piece?\nOf course! But be aware that the pot may be hot and that the natural clay surface is rougher than glazed clay or glass. Place the pot on a trivet or other protection for wood, plastic or composite table surfaces.\nWhat is the best way to clean the pot?\nAllow the pot to cool to room temperature, then wash it with warm water and dishwashing detergent and rinse with warm water. A dishwashing brush or a light scrubbing pad (such as a white Scotch Brite \u00ae or a Chore Girl \u00ae) may be used. Burned on food may be softened by filling the pot with warm water and allowing it to soak for several hours. Then, wash with detergent and warm water and rinse thoroughly. If odors build up in the pot due to oily or spicy foods, fill it with warm water and add 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Allow to soak overnight then wash normally.\nThe clay pot is safe for use in automatic dishwashers, but water scale may develop due to the drying cycle. This is not harmful but may be removed with a solution of half and half vinegar and water. Note that this is an unglazed pot, and some change in coloration with use is to be expected.\nHow do I remove burnt food from my VitaClay pot?\nTheresa, a helpful customer, shared this method for removing burnt food with us:\n\"Last week, I made rice pudding and some of the milk and rice burnt on the bottom.\nThe pudding turned out great but I did have some rice that really stuck to the\nbottom. I soaked it overnight but could not get the burnt rice off. I thought I\nwould try an experiment and put 1 cup water, 1/4 vinegar, 1 tablespoon of baking soda and\nturned the cooker on the brown rice setting and let it go through the cycle as if\nI was cooking rice. I checked it at the end of the cooking time and opened up\nthe lid. All the burnt stuff from the bottom came floating to the top and I just\npoured out the liquid and wiped it clean with a cloth, no scrubbing needed.\"\nCan I use metal utensils in the pot?\nYes. But be careful not to strike the pot hard as it may crack or break. Wooden or soft plastic utensils (like the stirring paddle provided) are preferred.\nDoes the pot require special care?\nLike any natural ceramic, the VitaClay \u00ae pot is sensitive to sudden thermal shocks. Do not place a heated pot in cold water. Allow it to cool first. Also, the pot may break if dropped or struck. This misuse is not covered by our warranty. It is best to store the pot in the cooker.\nWhy can't I log in to my Affiliate account?\nYour VitaClay\u00ae Affiliate account is a separate account from the your VitaClay\u00ae Store account. YOU CANNOT LOGIN TO YOUR AFFILIATE ACCOUNT WITH THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD YOU CREATED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS.\nYou must either sign in with your VitaClay\u00ae Affiliate account, or create a new VitaClay\u00ae Affiliate account.\nWhere is this product VitaClay Chef Gourmet Rice N Slow Cooker Pro manufactured?\nChina. Our products have been inspected by independent 3rd party Lab and have passed all FDA and CA Proposition 65 safety requirements, UL, RoHs certification.\nWhat are the differences between \u201csmart Multi cooker\u201cand 2-in-1rice n slow cooker ?\nPlease reference details on model chart from website.

I really like the digital controls - there's no guesswork especially with brown rice. I made several types of rice in this cooker and even saut\u00e9ed vegetables before adding flavoring, water and rice to vary my menu. Steaming vegetables in the special tray while cooking rice works very well too. It cuts down on the amount of pots you need and the juices that drip into the rice while steaming, add more flavor.\nI found this cooker ideal for various meals and stirfrys, and more convenient than doing them on stove. The nonstick finish cleans up very quickly and seems very durable. Since it merely sits inside the cooker's base, there's nothing to detach - just lift it out. I especially like the size for ease of handling and cleaning. When it comes to soups and stews, this capacity is very convenient for two people. The price of this Aroma rice cooker is very good and when you factor in the multi-function abilities, there's a real bonus here.\nA Note About the Sensor Logic\u2122 Technology\nThere was a couple of occasions while cooking white rice that the temperature seemed to fluctuate a little on the high side and to reduce the risk of overflow, I removed the cover for a few minutes. To gain a better understanding of how this digital rice cooker works, I asked the manufacturer about its temperature settings. According to Aroma, their Sensor Logic\u2122 Technology actually regulates the temperature at different levels throughout the cooking cycle to better burn off starches for perfect, fluffy cooked rice. Hence why I detected temperature variations. It's good to know that it's supposed to work this way.\nHe went on to add that once the temperature rises above boiling, it's the cooker\u2019s indication that the water has boiled away and the rice is ready. I can now see that removing the cover isn't a good idea on this setting; it could interrupt this digital cooker's thinking process. It knew what to do all along.\nRelated Resources\n"}, {"score": 1651.7306, "uuid": "0a62de44-a9f9-5794-b126-21687babf5cd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-15-10151", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/ricecookerreviews/fr/Aroma-Professional-20Cup-Rice-Cooker-Arc-2000-Review.htm", "page_rank": 1.2103681e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Aroma <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em> - Aroma Professional <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em> and Food Steam ARC-2000", "snippet": "Test of Aroma Professional 20-Cup <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em>, Steamer, Slow Cook ARC-2000 <em>What</em> I like <em>the</em> most before even trying this Aroma <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em>, is <em>the</em> <em>rice</em> capacity - 20-cups (cooked), which is ideal for family serving.", "explanation": null, "document": "Aroma Professional Rice Cooker ARC-2000\nPhoto \u00a9 Aroma\nWhat I like the most before even trying this Aroma Rice Cooker, is the rice capacity - 20-cups (cooked), which is ideal for family serving.

The hinged cover design looks great and helps to seal in flavor, but it can take more time cleaning than when lids are separate. The exterior stays cool and is easy to wipe clean. My favorite features include capacity, delay start, Keep Warm and being able to cook just about anything in it.\nAs for rice cooking performance, it makes excellent rice. Make sure to rinse rice several times before loading and follow guides for rice/water. I found that if I left the cooked rice for too long on Warm, it tended to stick and burn, so I added a little water and fluffed it, if on warm for awhile. Quick Rice came in very handy. I especially love the Smart Steam function, being able to steam vegetables while rice is cooking. I found it also handy for steaming sections of pumpkin, before peeling to make filling for pies - took 2 steam cycles (10 minutes). Slow Cook maintains a constant simmer; there's no low setting. And it heats up faster than a slow cooker, which means cooking is faster, so plan on a shorter cooking time. I found this simmer function very handy for soups, pasta sauce and such.\nOverall Impression\nThe multifunction nature of the ARC-2000 Rice Cooker makes it extremely versatile. Rice cooking is definitely this cooker's best feature, followed by its great steaming abilities. But beyond rice, it's also ideal for soups, stews, chili, meats, vegetables and various one-dish meals.\nThere's no debate as to the convenience of a rice cooker when it comes to making perfect white or brown rice and Aroma makes great rice cookers. But the addition of multi functions makes a rice cooker all the more convenient and versatile. Using the Smart Steam, White Rice or Slow Cook settings, you can cook or steam almost anything you would do on the range top - the difference is a shorter time and the fact that you can walk away and do other things while it's cooking, and that's a big help. It also delivers good results without the guesswork.\nThe steam function was a help with cleaning - to soften the residue on the inside of the lid and in the vent area after a messy rice pudding. After several attempts (with various rice cookers) that resulted in burnt rice pudding and a messy cooker, I found it best to cook white rice first, then add other ingredients(egg, milk, raisins, sugar etc) and run the White Rice setting for only a couple of minutes to complete. The price value of this appliance is excellent, especially given the capacity and versatile nature of this rice cooker.\nRelated Resources\nAroma Professional Rice Cooker ARC-2000\nPhoto \u00a9 Aroma\n"}, {"score": 1665.0688, "uuid": "efd98709-3811-5476-80d9-d773149995ae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-14-13045", "target_hostname": "cookingequipment.about.com", "target_uri": "http://cookingequipment.about.com/b/2008/04/25/making-risotto-in-the-rice-cooker.htm", "page_rank": 1.1755847e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Making Risotto in <em>the</em> <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em>", "snippet": "But then I tried making risotto in my <em>rice</em> <em>cooker</em>.

We once had to make tons of osushi for a party, so strapped for time and in need of a large volume of rice, I found that rice cooker and made rice with it as well as in the usual pot.\nWhen my VERY skeptical mother decided that the rice cooker made \"decent rice\", it was only then that we could even use the cooker without her getting upset about it (She believed for the longest time that rice cookers could not make proper rice).\nWell, as you say, rice cookers aren't the same as pots, but the main difference is that you don't get any okoge (the crusty part on the bottom--at least what we called it) with the cookers. I was never much of an okoge fan, but my father enjoyed it with shouyu, too!\nNow I use a Zojirushi Neurofuzzy cooker so that rice can be set up in advance, so that hot rice is ready when we return home from work in the evenings -- sorry Mom :( )\nSubject: Re: Rice Cooker\n> We have a very small home and there are no empty\n> electric wall sockets, so I cannot use a Panasonic\n> rice cooker. Instead, I cook it in a heavy pot.\nI've been cooking rice in a pot on the stove for quite a while now. It came out of necessity when my rice cooker broke. Whenever friends find I out I make rice that way, they just shake their heads, laugh at me and say, \"Why don't you buy a rice cooker?\" Somehow I think it tastes better cooked on the stove.\nI am glad to know I am not the only dinosaur around!!! :-))\nSubject: Re: Rice Cooker\nMy mother (Nisei) always made rice in an electric rice cooker (an antique now by today's standards - I think they only upgraded it maybe 5 years ago - the original must have been >20-25 years old... but I was a kid at the time, so what do I know...)\nI grew up on rice cooker rice, so I always think the quality is the best.\n"}], [{"score": 1615.0902, "uuid": "7769f366-dce9-570f-b278-67e22f505c6e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0911wb-87-17242", "target_hostname": "www.maplecreek.org", "target_uri": "http://www.maplecreek.org/blog/post/2010/04/08/rice-cookers.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1977178e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "LSSM | Church donates <em>rice</em> <em>cookers</em> for refugees", "snippet": "Betty Crowe, a Trinity member, went from store to store looking for <em>the</em> <em>best</em> bargains.

Having an automatic rice cooker speeds up the cooking process of rice, allowing you to have one to several cups done in one time.\nDifferent types rice cookers and their key features\nRice cookers come in a number of classifications. Each specializes in a particular cooking need.\nOn/Off Rice Cookers\nThese are the simplest type of rice cookers, only requiring a quick press of the button to start cooking the rice. You don\\'t need to wait and monitor the rice\\'s progress--simply leave it for a while and the cooker will switch from cooking to warm mode once the rice is done cooking. Apart from quickly cooking a few cups of rice, on/off models can also cook other rice dishes such as paella, or liquid recipes of stews and soups.\nInduction heat cookers\nThese models use an induction heating system to cook the rice. The technology applied evenly distributes the heat used, giving you just the right fluffiness. The heat distribution goes throughout the rice pan and is not limited to just coming from underneath. The heat distributed is adjusted according to possible errors that could occur with the set cooking time and temperature.\nCook and Keep Warm\nCook and keep warm rice cookers are practical for households that want to cook their rice for the day in one go. The cooker automatically switches to \\'keep warm\\' mode after the rice is properly cooked. Most models also include steamers that can be used to reheat food and cook other kinds of dishes.\nFuzzy logic rice cookers\nThese rice cookers have more advanced features, able to adjust the heat amount and cooking duration based on certain cooking errors. All one needs to do is set the program and the cooker will adjust the process accordingly, depending on your preference: sticky or fluffy rice.\nBasic features to look for\nCapacity\nChoose a model that accommodates the amount you usually consume per day. Capacity also depends on how much you cook per batch. Getting a small rice cooker will force you to use it over and over, while a model too large will waste the excess rice cooked.\nSteamer tray\nSome models include a built in steamer tray that you can use to warm other kinds of food. This can be helpful if you want to multitask. The downside is it cannot cook the rice as fast since you will be cooking two things at the same time. Steamer trays are most useful to those who cook vegetables regularly.\nThe lid\nA clear lid is most practical since it lets you see how the rice is cooked. The cooker should also include a steam release hole, otherwise, the steam will stain the lid\\'s edges and cleaning it will be quite difficult.\nConstruction\nHigher end models offer durable stainless steel while the more affordable ones are made of plastic or aluminum. The material you choose will really depend on your budget and the durability you are after.\nOther features\nOther models include extra but very convenient features, such as a digital display, preset timer, indicator light, and quick cook. The digital display lets you go through the cooker\\'s various settings and other features, making programming easy to learn and done in a few minutes.\nThe preset timer lets you prepare the rice at night, ready to be eaten in the morning or have it done in the middle of the day, ready for dinner. The indicator light lets you know the rice\\'s status, without you having to peek through the lid. There\\'s also the quick cook feature, usually found in more expensive models, which cooks faster as it skips straight to cooking model.\nOther factors to consider when buying a rice cooker\nSafety\nThere are also safety features worth looking into. Safety options are particularly helpful for families with young children. An auto cord reel can keep the cord away while the rice cooker is not being used. This lessens the chances of the kids playing with the cord, maybe getting into accidents or causing the rice cooker to fall down.\nFuse protector\nYou might also want to consider a fuse protector, which automatically turns off the appliance when an electrical malfunction occurs. This is more helpful when one leaves the rice cooker on or sets the timer to cook at night or in the afternoon. This can prevent any fires in case the cooker is left on for a long time.\nFunctionality\nYou should also look out for other aspects, such as extra functions, cleaning results, accessories, and programmability. Extra functions usually include a warm function, a steamer, extended keep warm, or specialized rice texture settings. More advanced and high end models usually have the specialized settings, letting you choose between sushi or long grain rice. This feature is helpful for chefs or kitchen users who like to cook a wide range of dishes.\nCleaning\nIn terms of cleaning, most models are non-stick, making the process quick and easy. But other cookers require soaking, depending on the material. Programmable functions are helpful for those who leave their cookers on for a long time or tend to forget they were using it in the first place.\nAccessories\nIn terms of accessories, some brands offer steam baskets, measuring cups, a rice spatula, or even recipe books. These freebies are usually included in special discounts and promos.\nWhat you really need?\nChoose your rice cooker depending on what you really need and what your budget can afford. Once you\\'ve narrowed down the features you need, choosing the best rice cooker will be easy.\n"}, {"score": 1602.12, "uuid": "163449c2-f90c-5af7-9edc-caa902e56877", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1303wb-03-15857", "target_hostname": "vitaclaychef.com", "target_uri": "https://vitaclaychef.com/info/affiliate", "page_rank": 1.6903884e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "VitaClay\u00ae Chef <em>Rice</em> <em>Cookers</em> and Slow <em>Cookers</em> - VitaClay Affiliate Offer", "snippet": "VitaClay <em>Rice</em> &amp; Slow <em>Cooker</em> sells between $79.99 and $169.99 depending on <em>what</em> sales <em>are</em> going on at that time.

The lab also found that fisetin promoted the survival of brain cells and enhanced memory.\nUnfortunately you'd have to eat nearly 40 strawberries a day to get the profound effects seen in the tested mice, but the fruit is healthy for several other reasons too. They're high in anti-oxidants - which reduce the signs of aging - as well as Vitamin C.

(The picture should give you an idea of the texture - I scooped off the top layer on part of the pudding to show what it looks like inside.) I only changed the recipe by using 2 cups of unsweetened Silk soymilk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. I also lifted the lid up a crack and stirred the mixture once 2 hours into the cooking to mix some of the cinnamon back into the mixture because it was floating on the top with the melted butter. This dish made my house smell wonderful. Before eating it I poured a little soy milk over it in my bowl and it was delicious. I think it would still taste great without any of the whipping cream. The next time I will try using 3 cups of soy milk and no whipping cream just to make it a bit healthier. I followed the cooking time (3.5 hours) and am undecided over if I will cut the cooking back 15 minutes to keep the rice more in rice form.\n21 out of 22 people found this helpful.\nWas this review helpful to you?

The lab also found that fisetin promoted the survival of brain cells and enhanced memory.\nUnfortunately you'd have to eat nearly 40 strawberries a day to get the profound effects seen in the tested mice, but the fruit is healthy for several other reasons too. They're high in anti-oxidants - which reduce the signs of aging - as well as Vitamin C. And they don't have nearly as much sugar as you'd expect - about 7 grams in a cup of them.\nHowever, when buying strawberries, you should exercise caution.

This cooker can make a variety of rices, grains and other foods, and it can double as a slow cooker.\nAbout the Sanyo Micom Rice & Slow Cooker\nThis slow cooker has a wide range of functions and settings that give it lots of versatility. A button-push menu lets you choose three different textures for white rice (regular, firm/sushi or soft), or you can set it to cook porridge (such as steel-cut oats ), haiga (a Japanese type of rice that still has its germ) or brown rice. There is also a quick-cook setting that eliminates the soaking period, and a rinse-free setting if you want to skip the step of rinsing your rice.\nBeyond rice and grains, there is a setting to steam foods, and a slotted steamer tray that has indentations for eggs so that you can use the cooker to cook eggs, as well as a tofu setting and an included plastic tofu mold.\nThe rice cooker doubles as a slow cooker , with high and low settings and a 12-hour countdown timer. While some other rice cookers have a slow cooker setting, this one has a longer-spanning timer than most, and it also comes with a separate insert and lid to be used for the slow cooker. These are made of the same nonstick-coated aluminum as the rice-cooker insert, but it is a nice added feature that reduces the possibility of the flavors of slow-cooked foods contaminating subsequent pots of rice.\nThe Sanyo Micom Rice Cooker to the Test\nEven without the manual, the Sanyo Micom Slow Cooker is a no-brainer to use. Like most rice cookers, comes with a measuring cup for the rice, and the required water levels for each type of food are marked on the sides of the pot. A large menu button scrolls through the types of rice, and a prominent start button begins the process. Because the cooking times vary depending on the quantity and type of rice and liquid, the clock does not begin a countdown (this cooker employs the fuzzy logic technique of rice cooking, which means an internal computer calibrates the cooking time and temperature according to what's inside the pot). However, in the last 10 minutes or so of cooking, the clock will begin counting down to give you fair warning when your rice will be finished. A chart in the instruction manual gives approximate cooking times.\nCompared to other cookers I've used, this machine took a shorter amount of time to make brown rice, and the results were fluffy and perfectly cooked. The other functions performed similarly well. The steamer can be set for up to 58 minutes, and the sealed enclosure ensures that the water doesn't boil dry. As a slow cooker, it worked just as well as a regular slow cooker, yielding evenly cooked, tender foods.\nThere are a few more features that I really like about the Sanyo Micom Rice Cooker. For instance, the cooker has a built-in lithium battery so that the clock retains the correct time, even when it's unplugged. I also appreciated the indentations on the vegetable steamer that could hold eggs; being able to use the rice cooker for making hard and soft boiled eggs really expands its usefulness. And I liked that the timer has a memory so that it can be programmed for two different settings, in case you want to set the timer for a different time on weekdays than for on weekends.\nWith its ease of use, effectiveness in making perfectly cooked rice and durable, well-designed construction, the Sanyo Micom Rice Cooker is one of the best rice cooker choices on the market. My only complaints would be that this rice cooker is somewhat expensive, and not all the menu options are that useful \u2013 for instance, few Americans even know what haiga is, let alone have the need for a special rice cooker setting with which to make it. But it's definitely a cooker that is built to last and has plenty of other versatile attributes, so this is a minor complaint.\nThe Details\n"}, {"score": 1437.2892, "uuid": "1791b95a-0d71-5c48-aab6-419be494c4c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1715wb-95-18303", "target_hostname": "plush-baby.com", "target_uri": "http://plush-baby.com/blog/39-home-a-family/142-how-to-decide-on-a-rice-cooker", "page_rank": 1.367382e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "How To Decide on a <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> electricity isn=92t tied to evening meal sometimes =96 a lot of grain <em>cookers</em> will make oats, you just need to search around.

In terms of vitamins and nutrients, sweet potatoes have often been called a \"perfect food.\" They taste great baked up with a little butter and brown sugar, but what if you want to mix it up a bit?

Not surprisingly, quite a few of them involved the kitchen, including the toaster (patented in 1919), can opener (patented 1855), coffee maker (1840), microwave (first sold in 1947) and corkscrew, the earliest reference to which described it in 1681 as a \u201csteel worm used for the drawing of Corks out of Bottles.\u201d The food processor was invented by a French catering salesman and first marketed in 1960, while we owe the invention of the first self-off-shutting electric kettle to G.E. (1930).\nFamed molecular gastronomy chef Heston Blumenthal revealed his love for the SodaStream, with which you can make your own seltzer, and I share his enthusiasm for the device. But were you to force me to offer a favorite, I\u2019d choose the VitaClay Cooker.\nAs cooler weather sweeps in, the late-harvest vegetables invite the creation of stews. Chicken, that most accommodating of entr\u00e9es, is a flavorful companion to just about anything, root veggies especially. And how pleasing, on those fall and winter days when I\u2019d be out for several hours, to come home to a crock-pot meal of simmering chicken stew. In fact, the cheaper cuts of any meat\u2014or veggies alone\u2014develop that all-for-one blending of flavors when so prepared.\nThe drawback, of course, is the pile of mush an all-day crock-pot session can produce. Your stew doesn\u2019t need eight hours, so when I acquired a Romertopf clay baker, which is a two-part unit that works in the oven, I budgeted in the time required for the items to cook. But a late dinner, especially in winter, seems especially late.\nClay pot cooking has inspired many forms (and names) in many cultures. The Indian tandoor is a cylindrical unit with high walls; the Spanish cazuela is shallow and wide. A tagine from Morocco looks like a cazuela with a conical clay hat, and produces a stew also called a tagine. There\u2019s an earthy flavor unique to clay, and preparation can be as simple or complicated, as spicy or bland as you prefer.\nI\u2019m a fairly recent convert to the automatic rice cooker. We use a model by Aroma that automatically sets the cooking time for white or brown rice, and provides a steaming shelf that allows you to cook something else on top of your rice. Provided you rinse the living hell out of the rice that goes into it, you get a great result, and you can delay the start of the cooking for several hours by manipulating the digital timer.\nThe technology of the rice cooker and the flavor of the clay come together in the VitaClay. It\u2019s a large appliance, so clear some space. Its programming is nicely intuitive. It has a capacitor-driven clock, and so will hold the time setting when it\u2019s unplugged and put away.\nThanks to the unglazed two-piece clay pot that lives inside, you needn\u2019t worry about cooking on a Teflon surface, if such is your concern. And its operation is really a matter of deciding what you want to cook\u2014rice or some manner of stew\u2014how long you want it cook for, and at what time you want said cooking to begin.\nI\u2019ve schlepped this thing everywhere over the summer. Because I often volunteer to cook when I visit friends, I\u2019ve taken this baby to shorten my kitchen time. It went with the family on a Cape Cod vacation for some culinary variety, and I\u2019d swear that it, too, enjoyed the change of scene. Because it\u2019s easy to anthropomorphize a versatile gadget like this one.\nRefined wheat, rice and sugar products are taboo in my house, thanks to my daughter\u2019s admirable determination to remain healthy. Although I\u2019ve yet to give up risotto\u2019s thirsty arborio variety, in all other dishes I find brown rice to be a tastier alternative. But you can\u2019t rinse it too much. You need three or four cycles at least to get the best result, and the VitaClay cooker will do the rest. (Although I have to confess that I\u2019ve spoiled myself. I cook the rice in the Aroma cooker and the rest of dinner in the VitaClay, plugging them in to two different circuits and avoiding use of the toaster.)\nAt it simplest, a good stew starts with the big three: onions, carrots and celery. Garlic is a given. Add potatoes, rutabaga and/or turnips and right there you have a hearty vegetarian compote. You need some liquid, but not much. If the machine senses too heavy a weight, it\u2019ll quietly shut off. Chicken or other meat will make its own stock with the water you add, but you can jazz it a bit by using beer instead.\nAdd cumin, coriander, garam masala and hot pepper to go in the curry direction. Tomatoes, olives and capers take it to the Mediterranean. Moroccan stews feature garlicky harissa and preserved lemons (mssiyar) that marinate for at least a month with salt and bay leaves.\nAssemble your ingredients in the clay pot. Don\u2019t forget to put on the lid. Choose the slow cooking option, and set the cooking timer in increments of 10 minutes for up to four hours, although I\u2019ve rarely needed more than 90 minutes. Then backtime the start of cooking so it\u2019ll put the food on your table when you\u2019ll be ready to eat.\nRecipes abound. People are preparing porridge in their VitaClays, and apple crisp and spinach-cheese dip and even lasagne.\nRemember bread machines? I resisted that bandwagon and the fad went away. But I\u2019m putting my money on this one as a keeper. I don\u2019t want to sound too infomercially, but I think this cooker transcends the great crowd of kitchen novelties and should take its place alongside the food processor and stand mixer as something you\u2019ll wonder how you lived without.\nFeatured at Metroland .\u00a0 Written by B.A. Nilsson on October 6, 2011.\nfollow us on\n"}, {"score": 1381.8214, "uuid": "f5b8aa71-7724-5af0-b384-cc8572ae78d7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1303wb-14-14707", "target_hostname": "vitaclaychef.com", "target_uri": "https://vitaclaychef.com/recipes-rice-cookers/for-the-love-of-a-gadget", "page_rank": 1.1827528e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "VitaClay\u00ae Chef <em>Rice</em> <em>Cookers</em> and Slow <em>Cookers</em> - For <em>the</em> Love of a Gadget", "snippet": "You need three or four cycles at least to get <em>the</em> <em>best</em> result, and <em>the</em> VitaClay <em>cooker</em> will do <em>the</em> rest.

I just fire up the stove, and things start to fade away. ~Paula Deen\nI found out what the secret to life is: friends. Best friends. ~Ninny Threadgoode\nTuesday, February 28, 2012\nSlow Cooker red beans & rice made with dried beans, and cooked with a ham bone, bacon and smoked sausage.\nSlow Cooker Red Beans and Rice\nThough it's a tradition in the Deep South, we don't have red beans and rice every single Monday of every week at my house, but, I admit that when we don't, things do seem to feel a little out of sorts for me. It's just a routine that has been part of the culture down here for all of my life really. Even as a career woman working outside of the house, red beans and rice were the special of the day, every Monday, at local restaurants we frequented for lunch.\nWhen I make them at home, I've pretty much made my homemade red beans and rice the same way since I've been cooking them - low and slow on the top of the stove. For many of us who do work outside of the home, that's just not possible to pull off on a Monday though, so we either have to plan ahead and prepare them on Sunday night, which many of us do, or else we have to rely on our modern appliances to give us a helping hand.\nMost of you know that I've never been a big fan of the crockpot for much other than pulled pork or roasts, feeling it pretty much boiled everything else to death, but with the prompts of our family of readers here, I've been trying to learn to love my slow cooker these past couple of years. Of course, you don't have to limit your consumption of red beans and rice to a Monday either. With a slow cooker, you can have them any day of the week. Here's how to make the slow cooker version of my homemade red beans and rice.\nNow first, a warning. Don't you just love when you have to issue a warning with a recipe? Eating raw kidney beans can be dangerous, so don't do that. Seems that they have some pesky compound that needs to be cooked out of them, so make sure that any kidney bean you consume is very well cooked and not even slightly undercooked. To be extra cautious, use a quick boil method before adding them to the slow cooker, by putting them in a stockpot, bring them to a rolling boil, boil for 10 minutes, drain and then transfer to the slow cooker.\nSince I like to live on the edge and I've eaten plenty of unboiled, slow cooked on the stovetop red beans, I knew I had plenty of time for the beans to be thoroughly cooked through thanks to the slow cooker, so I decided not to pre-soak/boil the beans. I just rinsed and sorted them and placed them into the crock of my 6-quart slow cooker. Boil them first to be on the safe side.\nI still like to saute all of the ingredients, rather than to just dump everything in the slow cooker raw. To me, that process takes very little prep time while making a strong contribution to the flavor, so it's worth the effort.\nIn a separate skillet, cook 3 slices of chopped bacon until the fat is rendered. To that, add 2 cups of chopped onion, 1 cup of chopped bell pepper, and 1/2 cup of chopped celery and saut\u00e9 until tender, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cloves of chopped garlic, black pepper to taste, 1 teaspoon of dried basil and 1 bay leaf into the vegetable mixture stir together and transfer to the slow cooker.\nI purposely do not use any additional salt with my beans until the end of the cooking process, mostly because I find that there is plenty of sodium present in the added meats already, and also in my experience, sometimes it does seem to affect the cooking time on beans.\nBecause I didn't pre-soak the beans, I added 7 cups of hot water. If you soaked yours, you may need to add a bit more water to cover. I like to use warmed water so that the slow cooker doesn't have to take that time for heating and can get right to work!\nSaute the sausage in that same skillet with a bit of olive oil or vegetable oil, until nicely browned, then transfer it to the slow cooker pot.\nYou can add a ham bone, a couple of ham hocks, or just some additional chopped ham to the beans for extra flavor. If you're lucky enough to have a ham bone, slide that right into your beans now.\nThis was an especially meaty bone, so with the addition of the smoked sausage, I didn't add any extra ham. If your bone is sparse or if you are using ham hocks, add in some chopped, cooked ham, toward the end of the cooking process.\nCover and let her go on high for 5 to 7 hours or so. My beans were nice and tender right at about 5 hours on high. When the beans are cooked through, remove 1 cup of them, but drain the liquid back into the slow cooker.\nMash the beans to form a paste and stir that back into the pot. Add a tablespoon or three into the beans if you like, for a little extra richness too. Totally optional.\nTaste, add salt and cayenne pepper, if desired. Serve over hot, cooked rice and garnish with sliced green onion, if desired. Pass Cajun seasoning and hot sauce at the table.\nIf you think this sounds yummy, I'd sure \u2665 it if you'd click to pin it, tweet it, stumble it, or share it on Facebook to help spread the word - thanks!\n"}, {"score": 1354.317, "uuid": "f196b1c0-b9f2-56bb-8668-c50f3ba45ca7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-70-21588", "target_hostname": "www.hbees.com", "target_uri": "http://www.hbees.com/paco23curico.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Panasonic Consumer 23 cups <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em> &#x2F; Food Steamer", "snippet": "<em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em> with 23-Cup Uncooked <em>Rice</em> Capacity and Automatic Cooking Feature.

Not surprisingly, quite a few of them involved the kitchen, including the toaster (patented in 1919), can opener (patented 1855), coffee maker (1840), microwave (first sold in 1947) and corkscrew, the earliest reference to which described it in 1681 as a \u201csteel worm used for the drawing of Corks out of Bottles.\u201d The food processor was invented by a French catering salesman and first marketed in 1960, while we owe the invention of the first self-off-shutting electric kettle to G.E.

Over time, however, chronic inflammation can weaken the cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems. Here are some times for keeping inflammation to a minimum:\n1. Determine the type. A high-sensitivity C-reactive protein test (hs-CRP) is the most accurate way to determine the type of inflammation. It's not perfect, however; while it can tell you whether your body is experiencing high amounts of inflammation, it can't detect every single type.\n2. Change the way you cook. Grilling and frying create advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can trigger inflammation. Instead, boil or steam your food--or use your VitaClay--to preserve nutrients.\n3. Cut down on sugar. Foods high in sugar tax the pancreas--the organ responsible for producing insulin. When the body detects excess levels of insulin in the bloodstream, it triggers to inflammatory response to reduce the insulin levels.\nFeatured Recipe:\nQuick Sesame Teriyaki Low-Carb Lettuce Wraps\nfrom The 150 Healthiest Slow Cooker Recipes on Earth\nFrom Dr. Jonny: Chef Jeannette calls this recipe an example of \u201cslow-cooked fast food,\u201d which I think is hysterical.

That can mean eating raw foods for a week, going off sugar and caffeine for a week, or consuming the standard \u201cjuice and broth\u201d program with steamed vegetables and high-quality protein. Why broth? Because it\u2019s a highly concentrated form of nutrients, distilling everything wonderful from the vegetables into a nice rich liquid, perfect for providing your liver with everything it needs to do its natural job of detoxifying the body. Homemade stock is the best. It\u2019s fresher tasting, it doesn\u2019t have added sodium, and you control the quality of the ingredients.\nThe slow cooker is absolutely the best tool ever for making perfect stock because all you do is prep it and leave it. Note: We leave the skins on all the veggies because of their concentration of nutrients, but the skins are also where pesticides and chemicals tend to accumulate, so we strongly recommend you use organic veggies for this recipe. Or at the very least, wash them in a high-quality vegetable wash.\nFrom Chef Jeannette:\nAn easy and economical way to make vegetable stock is to hang on to all the peels, sores, and ends f your vegetables from the week and use them over the weekend to make stock. Just keep them fresh in a container in the refrigerator. Different herbs and veggies lend different qualities to your stocks. Many peels, such as onion skins, tend to darken the color. You can also sweat chopped veggies in a skillet on the stove for 5 to 10 minutes before adding to the slow cooker to further concentrate their flavors.\nIngredients\n4 ribs celery with leaves, quartered\n4 carrots, unpeeled and quartered (with greens, if possible)\n3 parsnips, unpeeled and quartered\n1 large yellow onion, unpeeled and quartered\n1 large leek, well rinsed and coarsely chopped\n2 portobello mushrooms, including stems (use 6 or 8 cremini mushrooms if you prefer a lighter-colored broth)\n1 small zucchini, coarsely chopped\n2 cabbage leaves (optional)\n1 bunch Italian parsley, thicker stems removed\n4 cloves garlic, unpeeled and crushed\n2 star anise (optional)\n1\u20442 teaspoon green peppercorns (or 1\u20442 teaspoon\nfreshly ground pepper)\nDirections\nCombine all the ingredients in a VitaClay slow cooker and set on \u201cSOUP\u201d to cook for 2-3 hours.

That can mean eating raw foods for a week, going off sugar and caffeine for a week, or consuming the standard \u201cjuice and broth\u201d program with steamed vegetables and high-quality protein. Why broth? Because it\u2019s a highly concentrated form of nutrients, distilling everything wonderful from the vegetables into a nice rich liquid, perfect for providing your liver with everything it needs to do its natural job of detoxifying the body. Homemade stock is the best. It\u2019s fresher tasting, it doesn\u2019t have added sodium, and you control the quality of the ingredients.\nThe slow cooker is absolutely the best tool ever for making perfect stock because all you do is prep it and leave it. Note: We leave the skins on all the veggies because of their concentration of nutrients, but the skins are also where pesticides and chemicals tend to accumulate, so we strongly recommend you use organic veggies for this recipe. Or at the very least, wash them in a high-quality vegetable wash.\nFrom Chef Jeannette:\nAn easy and economical way to make vegetable stock is to hang on to all the peels, sores, and ends f your vegetables from the week and use them over the weekend to make stock. Just keep them fresh in a container in the refrigerator. Different herbs and veggies lend different qualities to your stocks. Many peels, such as onion skins, tend to darken the color. You can also sweat chopped veggies in a skillet on the stove for 5 to 10 minutes before adding to the slow cooker to further concentrate their flavors.\nIngredients\n4 ribs celery with leaves, quartered\n4 carrots, unpeeled and quartered (with greens, if possible)\n3 parsnips, unpeeled and quartered\n1 large yellow onion, unpeeled and quartered\n1 large leek, well rinsed and coarsely chopped\n2 portobello mushrooms, including stems (use 6 or 8 cremini mushrooms if you prefer a lighter-colored broth)\n1 small zucchini, coarsely chopped\n2 cabbage leaves (optional)\n1 bunch Italian parsley, thicker stems removed\n4 cloves garlic, unpeeled and crushed\n2 star anise (optional)\n1\u20442 teaspoon green peppercorns (or 1\u20442 teaspoon\nfreshly ground pepper)\nDirections\nCombine all the ingredients in a VitaClay slow cooker and set on \u201cSOUP\u201d to cook for 2-3 hours. Cool slightly and strain the mixture through a double-mesh sieve into one or two large storage containers. Cool slightly and strain the mixture through a double-mesh sieve into one or two large storage containers. Reserve the veggies for another use or discard. Store in the fridge or in pintsize containers in the freezer for later use (place a layer of microwave-safe plastic wrap on the surface of the cold soup and under the lid before freezing to keep it airtight).\nYield: 3 to 4 quarts (2.8 to 3.7 L)\nPer Serving: Calories 143.4; Calories From Fat 6.3; Total Fat 0.8 g; Cholesterol\n0 mg; Sodium 74.3 mg; Potassium 844.2 mg; Total Carbohydrates 33.6 g;\nFiber 8.9 g; Sugar 10.4 g; Protein 3.2 g\nIn The News\n\u201cLow levels of the essential vitamin can bring on symptoms including muscle weakness, fatigue, shakiness, unsteady gait, incontinence, low blood pressure and depression.\u201d \u00a0From nytimes.com , It Could Be Old Age, or It Could Be Low B12\nExperts say making small changes to your day is one of the best ways to lose weight\n\"On your walk or run, add backward walking,\" says trainer Gunnar Peterson\nDr. Tim Church recommends downsizing wine glasses to cut calories\nAuthor Missy Chase Lapine says, \"Slip exercise into everyday life, and make it fun.\"\nFrom CNN.com , Wake Up Slimmer with These Easy Tips\n\u201cCoffee and espresso can have consequences in people taking certain medications, by either blocking their absorption or enhancing their effects.\u201d\u00a0 From NYTimes.com , Really?

Matters -or- the story of Michelle\u2019s Rice Cooker\nI stopped into my new cutting room today to check in on the status of the work. \u00a0(Full disclosure, I'm trying a new cutter as I got tired of being bullied-about by my earlier one.)\n(For those of you who don't know anything about domestic apparel manufacturing, most garments made in the U.S.A. require the coordinated work of a couple of factories. \u00a0The \"cutting room\" cuts the fabric, and the \"factory\" generally \"makes and trims\", i.e., they sew the garment pieces together and apply any trims.)\nSo, when I stopped into the cutting room today in the NYC garment district, Michelle, the lovely Chinese lady who runs the place, was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0When I asked where she was, I was told to wait. \u00a0After a few minutes, in walked Michelle, smiling and carrying what appeared to be a very heavy pot with a lid.\nIt turns out it was the pot of a rice cooker, and Michelle had just filled it with rice and water. \u00a0As Michelle put the pot in place on the rice cooker and plugged in the power, I asked her if she was making rice for the whole factory (it was after all, a very large pot with a great deal of rice in it).\n\"Yes\", she replied, \"I make rice everyday\". \u00a0\"So everyone eats together at the same time and eats like a family?\" I asked. \u00a0\"Yes, they bring their own vegetables and meat, I make the rice, so everyone have hot rice for lunch.\"\nI told her that I liked the idea of everyone stopping work and sitting down to eat together over a communal pot of rice (cooked by the forewoman/boss no less).\n\"Especially important in winter to have hot rice for lunch\" she went on to explain.\nShe seemed to beam as we talked about her cooking of the rice and she proudly showed off her enormous rice cooker, which looked as though it had seen years of use.\nShe then went on to show me the giant coffee maker (my Aunt Francie had one just like it which she used for family reunions, \"open houses\" as my family called them).\nMichelle then pointed out the small refrigerator and mircowave, \"we have small kitchen here,\" \u00a0she said. \u00a0She seemed surprised that I understood the value of feeding your co-workers and everyone eating together as a family. \u00a0I found myself getting a little choked up as we were speaking.\nI realized that this was a clean, organized, quiet cutting room, run by a woman who took care of her employees. \u00a0Not only was I not being bullied-about by the owner, but the workers were being looked after and treated like family.\nThis seemed like such an incredible contrast to some of the stories of foreign manufacturing I have been hearing lately. \u00a0From the fire at the factory in Bangladesh that killed 29 people to the nets put up at the Apple factory to prevent suicides , factories in Asia have always scared me.\nI choose early on to have my swimsuits for breast cancer survivors made in the U.S.A. \u00a0I grew up in a really blue-collar household in Northeast Ohio and I remember my Dad going on, in the early 70's, about how impossible it was to find a TV that was made in the US and how, pretty soon, nothing would be made here any more.\nMy dad was way ahead of his time. \u00a0There is very little make in the US these days, and it is very hard for those of us who want to do domestic manufacturing to actually find the people who can do it properly. \u00a0Those designers who do make domestically, closely guard the secrets of where they are manufacturing. \u00a0As one old-timer in the business told me when I was starting out, \"I'd sooner give you my husband's cell number than the name of my factory!\"\nI'm really happy to have met Michelle. \u00a0I still don't know if her shop is the best cutter to use for my swimsuits, but I'm happy to take a chance on them for a while, as long as she continues to treat me well, and cook for her family.\n"}, {"score": 1217.4912, "uuid": "248e8622-3743-56c7-ba87-e0c2d202466b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-93-00155", "target_hostname": "www.mommyonlyhas2hands.org", "target_uri": "http://www.mommyonlyhas2hands.org/2012/01/slow-cooker-chicken-and-rice.html", "page_rank": 1.1781915e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": ": Slow <em>Cooker</em> Chicken And <em>Rice</em>", "snippet": "You can do this ahead of time if you like, after all that is <em>what</em> having a slow <em>cooker</em> day is for right, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cooking dinner at <em>the</em> last minute.

Appliances It&#x27;s true that you can cook short or long-grain white or brown <em>rice</em>, whole grains, soups, stews or most foods in a regular pot on a range cooktop, so <em>what</em> is <em>the</em> benefit of using an electric <em>cooker</em>?", "explanation": null, "document": "Benefits of Electric Cookers and Cooking Appliances\nHow a Cooker Can Save You Time in the Kitchen\nBy Mariette Mifflin ,\u00a0About.com Guide\nSee More About:\nskillets\nIt's true that you can cook short or long-grain white or brown rice, whole grains, soups, stews or most foods in a regular pot on a range cooktop, so what is the benefit of using an electric cooker? An electric cooker or cooking appliance is basically a pot with or without a nonstick finish, that is designed for cooking various foods while maintaining a constant cooking temperature. Some cookers have preprogrammed settings for certain foods or keep-warm settings to keep the food warm (after it is cooked) till the rest of the meal is ready to serve.\nElectric cookers include a vast range of appliances such as rice cookers , whole grain cookers , stock pots, all purpose pots, steamers, pressure cookers and even slow cookers . One could even argue that an electric skillet is also a cooker or cooking appliance.\nHowever, the term electric cooker most commonly refers to electric rice or grain cookers, steamers or soup/stock pots. And while a slowcooker performs its function by slowly cooking over several hours and a pressure cooker on the other hand cuts cooking time to a fraction, electric cookers may cut cooking time slightly, but mostly are designed to cook foods at a constant temperature for a given period of time for best flavor and texture.\nPerformance may be the reason some use an electric cooker, since results are often better than with stovetop cooking, which is sometimes rushed when the process is long. There's also a tendency to vary the heat to avoid hot spots on the stove if stirring is not consistent, and that can lead to less than ideal results. With a cooker, one is also more inclined to cook difficult foods that are otherwise avoided for lack of time and expertise.\nBut the reason most use an electric cooker is time - cooking appliances do save you time, even if the cycle is not shorter than cooking on the stove. Whole grains and especially long-grain brown rice, take a very long time to cook on the stove. That's where an electric cooker enables you to walk away and do other things. You do have to monitor cooking and unlike a slowcooker that may not require stirring, you may have to occasionally stir contents, but a cooker does release you from being held at the stove constantly during the entire cooking time. An electric cooker with a keep-warm setting, adds another level of convenience.\nLower energy is another good reason for using an electric cooker rather than a pot on a stovetop element to cook soup, stews or other foods. Another benefit is that foods can be cooked away from the range area in a cooker and that can improve the workflow in a busy kitchen. When you are cooking a large meal, an electric rice cooker or vegetable steamer can simulate having an extra cooking element (or two) and that can help you get the entire meal completed for serving time. Using an electric cooker can also generate less heat in the kitchen keeping it more comfortable in hot climates. An electric cooker can quickly become the time-saver you need to make cooking more efficient and enjoyable.\nRead More About Cookers & Small Appliances:\n"}, {"score": 1185.1234, "uuid": "693eb3bf-e809-5938-95de-f5e8ca9a632e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-46-09298", "target_hostname": "thaifood.about.com", "target_uri": "http://thaifood.about.com/od/thaisnacks/tp/bestricerecipes.01.htm", "page_rank": 1.223589e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Thai <em>Rice</em> - Thai <em>Rice</em> Recipes", "snippet": "But did you know you can also make sticky <em>rice</em> in your <em>rice</em> <em>cooker</em> with delicious results?

By cooking food in an enclosed, pressurized chamber, pressure cookers can cut cooking times by as much as two-thirds. In addition, the cooking process can preserve nutrients within foods in ways that conventional methods do not.\nBest of all, today's pressure cookers are safer to use than the pressure cookers that previous generations may have used \u2013 multiple safety features like locks and pressure-release valves prevent them from overbuilding pressure and exploding (Read more about pressure cooker safety .). Plus, the way that pressure cookers are designed, they're remarkably easy to use.\nIf you are on the market for a pressure cooker, here's what you need to know about choosing the right size, features and other options.\nPressure Cooker Size\nPressure cookers come in a wide range of sizes; you might see them ranging from smaller than 4 quarts to 10 quarts or larger. When deciding what size to get, think about how many people you typically cook for. Keep in mind that the types of recipes that are best made in a pressure cooker, such as stews, soups, grains and beans, often lend themselves to be made for large groups of people, or in large batches to freeze or refrigerate leftovers. It's better to buy a larger cooker than you think you'll need, if you have the space and budget for one, because you can cook smaller quantities in a larger cooker, but the reverse is not true.\nAlso keep in mind that you can only fill a pressure cooker two-thirds full with food (and for foods that expand or foam, such as beans, you should only fill the pot half full), which means that having a 6-quart cooker doesn't mean you'll be able to make 6 quarts of soup.\nFor a family of four, a 6-quart cooker should be a versatile, useful size. However, larger sizes do allow you to use more accessories, such as steamer inserts, pans or ramekins, or cook bulkier items, such as roasts or whole chickens.\nPressure Cooker Construction and Materials\nWhen choosing a pressure cooker, consider the material that it's made with. Aluminum is lighter in weight, but stainless steel is far more durable. Even better is a stainless steel cooker that has a thick base, preferably with encapsulated aluminum or copper, both of which will help with heat conductivity and retention. You'll also want to take a look at the handles, lid and locking mechanism and make the handles and lid are securely attached. With any size larger than 4 quarts, two handles, or a longer handle with a \"helper handle\" on the other side, will make it easier and safer to lift when it's hot and filled with food. The cooker should also have a locking lid, with a mechanism that prevents the lid from being opened before pressure is released. This is a fairly standard feature in today's pressure cookers.\nThe Pressure Regulator\nThere are several different kinds of pressure regulators, which indicate when the cooker has reached the correct pressure to be cooking your food. They all perform equally as well; it's just a matter of preference as to which one is easier for you to use:\nSpring Valve: This is a valve that pops up out of the cooker and is typically used for cookers that have high and low pressure settings; the valve will pop up to a certain level when it's reached low pressure, and then pop up more when high pressure is achieved (usually there is a line or a color change so you can tell the difference between the two pressure levels).\nWeighted Valve: Also called a jiggle top, this type of pressure regulator sits on top of the steam vent, and begins to rock when pressure is reached, an indication that you can both see and hear (handy if you're doing other things around the kitchen and can't be constantly watching your cooker). With this type of valve, you'll want to make sure it is removable so that you can check the steam valve before each use to make sure it's not clogged with food.\nModified Weighted Valve: This type of valve is attached to the steam vent but instead of rocking, will release bursts of steam intermittently to maintain pressure; the first sight of steam puffing out of the valve is your indication that pressure has been reached and you can start timing the cooking process.\nBetween the three types of pressure regulators, many people prefer the spring valve, because it gives an obvious indication of when pressure is reached.\nOther Pressure Cooker Features\nSome pressure cookers only have one pressure setting (typically 15 pounds per square inch, or psi) while others have both high and low settings (15 and 10 psi, respectively). Most recipes call for cooking food at 15 psi (the high setting). In fact, before buying a cooker, it's a good idea to make sure that the \"high\" setting actually does correspond to 15 psi, since this is the standard pressure level for most recipes. Checking with the manufacturer or looking at the manual should give this information. The lower setting is good for cooking more delicate items, such as certain types of fish, or tender fruits and vegetables.\nAnother feature to look for is the pressure release valve. Recipes typically call for releasing pressure in one of several ways: the natural release, in which the pot is removed from the heat and allowed to slowly release its pressure; the cold-water method, in which the pot is doused with cold water to quickly release pressure; and the quick-release method, in which pressure is manually released by opening a valve and letting steam escape quickly. Not all pressure cookers have the ability to do the latter; check to see if there is a knob or dial that allows you to safely and quickly release the steam from inside the pot.\nMany pressure cookers come with a number of accessories, such as additional, smaller cooking pots, steamer inserts, glass lids (to transform the pot base into a regular cooking pot) and more. Before springing for these types of sets, consider whether you'll use them, or whether it would be better to opt for a higher-end model that, while it may not have all the extra pieces, might be better quality.\nIn the long run, choose the best, and highest-quality pressure cooker that you can afford.\nPressure Cookers to Consider\n"}, {"score": 1165.9595, "uuid": "26006753-1dce-55f5-b891-270616a6d450", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-12-26262", "target_hostname": "www.thecitycook.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thecitycook.com/cooking/advice/essential_kitchen/000016", "page_rank": 1.1973232e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>The</em> Essential Kitchen: Slow <em>Cookers</em>", "snippet": "If you&#x27;ve never used one, <em>what</em> follows is a primer on buying a slow <em>cooker</em>, how to use it, and some of <em>the</em> <em>best</em> cookbooks on <em>the</em> subject.

While pottery cooking has been around for centuries, Rival seems to have set the standard for the electric version -- plus they've successfully turned their brand name into mainstream language with the Rival \"Crock Pot.\"\nWhile there are about a dozen slow cooker manufacturers, Rival is in the business in a serious way and they're the dominant brand. Slow cookers can cost as little as about $12 and rise to more than $200 (All-Clad's Deluxe Slow Cooker sells at Williams-Sonoma for $249.95).\nIn terms of functionality, all slow cookers are essentially the same and employ the same technology. The difference in price is primarily due to size or electric features. For example, the least expensive models are completely manual with a knob that simply chooses low, high, or off. Others have an option for \"warm\" after the cooking is done. Many of the newer models, including the one I bought, let you set the heat level (low or high) as well as a multi-hour timer calibrated at 30-minute intervals. After the time has passed, the cooker will automatically shift to \"warm\" and keep it there for up to four hours. And the most costly cookers have extras; All-Clad's Deluxe model has an insert made of cast aluminum that can be used on a stove top.\nNone of them let you pre-set the start because this would create a food hazard with raw food, notably meat, poultry or fish, sitting at room temperature and developing bacteria. Slow cookers always require a manual start, even if the stop is electronically controlled hours later.\nSizes range from very small, 16-ounce pots that are used as warmers, such as for serving a warm dip, to very large 8-quart appliances. Two-to-three-quart models are available for smaller households but the most popular sizes are five to six quarts. I bought a 5 1/2-quart not because I have a big household; I don't. But buying one a quart or so larger didn't seem to change the price and I wanted its versatility. Five quarts is big enough to hold a rack of ribs, a four-pound pot roast, or a whole chicken. Plus if I'm going to use 6 or so hours of electricity to cook something and go through all the effort to prep the ingredients, I want to get my money and effort's worth, meaning leftovers.\nThe pots come in two shapes: round or oval. In an oval cooker you can more easily fit a whole chicken or odd-shaped pieces of meat like lamb shanks than in a round pot. The cookers have two parts -- the removable (and dishwasher proof) interior ceramic pot and the outside metal appliance. Once you turn it on, the metal outside gets very hot, enough to burn your hand so the pot needs to be placed where children (or adults) won't brush against it during these day-long simmerings. Most slow cookers also have short electric cords as a safety feature, keeping the pots close to the wall.\nA reader wrote to me how she's used her rice cooker as a slow cooker, but my research suggests this will be a frustrating substitute because they don't get hot enough; the ideal temperature for cooking rice will not get you good results with ingredients like chicken or beef.\nThe cookers themselves are refreshingly uncomplicated. Plug it in, set at high or low, and time the clock.\nA Rival Adventure\nI chose a Rival Crockpot for two reasons: one, they're easy to find and very affordable (if I hated cooking with it I didn't want to lose too much of an investment). And two, I wanted to work with a brand that had been almost singlehandedly responsible for keeping this cooking method in American kitchens. I figured they knew what they were doing.\nBefore buying I did lots of market research, read tips that were included with the cookbooks I had begun to gather, and did the usual asking friends (only one had a slow cooker) and scanning Google. Bed, Bath & Beyond's web site had a 5 1/2 quart Rival Crockpot with a timer and automatic thermostat that would turn to warm when the cooking was done. It was very attractive with a stainless steel exterior and black ceramic pot. And it was $29. Since I live within walking distance of one of their stores I called to see if it was also available there but learned this was a web-only deal on a discontinued model. A few mouse clicks and two days later I was making my first slow cooked pot roast. Back to that in a moment.\nAfter making three dishes in my very pretty crock pot, I began to notice how recipes that were supposed to take six to eight hours on \"low\" were in fact cooking in three and I called Rival for advice. Without much of a detour I quickly reached a human being, a lovely woman named \"Tanya\" who patiently listened to my virgin crock pot experiences. After asking me to read her a code that was stamped onto the prongs of the pot's electric plug, she responded with, \"Dear, it sounds like something is wrong. Why don't you just let us send you a new one.\" It was that simple. No shipping the malfunctioning one back. No fussing. No arguments. No paperwork. Tanya guided me to a web site that had about 30 Crock Pot models with the instruction to choose anything I liked. Five days later UPS delivered me a brand new Crockpot, plus it was a newer model!\nWhen was the last time you had a customer service experience like that?\nThe Technique of Slow Cooking\nI always considered slow cookers as good for only a few dishes. Chili, soup, and maybe pot roast, recipes in which ingredients would just be thrown together and essentially abandoned for eight hours.\nBut in fact this is not the case. While slow cooking is the direct opposite of 30-minute meals, they still require some preparation and some \"technique\" to get the maximum flavor from the slow, moist cooking.\nSo what does the slow cooker do that your oven cannot? Well, nothing really. So if we can cook the same way with our stoves, why use a slow cooker -- especially in our small city kitchens that don't have room for non-essential appliances?\nHere's what I've already come to appreciate about having a slow cooker:\nWhile we can use our stovetops and ovens for braising, or a long, slow roast at a low temperature, only the slow cooker gives us such gentle heat, delivered through convection. The metal casing surrounds the ceramic container -- the \"crock\" -- and the cover keeps the moisture inside the cooker. Temperatures are lower than what we usually use in our ovens; about 185\u00b0 F to 200\u00b0 F when low, and 250\u00b0 F to 300\u00b0 F at high.\nI can cook a slow braise without heating up my entire apartment from having the oven on for three hours. Yes, the cooker will be on for six or seven hours (three or four if I set it to high) but it's not blasting heat as my oven does.\nBecause the heat is so gentle, you can cook for hours without overcooking.\nIt gives me a kind of second oven. I can be cooking a stew in the slow cooker while using my oven to bake a dessert or roast vegetables.\nIf I'm entertaining and making a multi-course meal, the slow cooker lets me keep food warm when I've made it in advance -- at a perfect temperature that doesn't continue to cook it. For example, if I'm going to serve a soup or little meatballs in sauce, I can plug the slow cooker in anywhere and keep things warm while freeing up my stovetop to finish cooking the meal.\nIt's best for inexpensive cuts of meat, such as chicken thighs, chuck roasts, pork shoulder, lamb shanks, and sturdier vegetables like beets and potatoes that benefit from long, slow cooking. If you're more carefully managing your food budget, buying cheaper cuts of meat and poultry and cooking them in a slow cooker can mean interesting flavors and satisfying meals at a lower cost.\nIt's unexpectedly well suited for cooking dishes that have far more complexity than chili. For example, it's perfect for rice pudding, cassoulet, pulled pork, or tagines (the tagine's distinctive hat-shaped pot is intended to create and return moisture to what's being cooked, exactly what a slow cooker does). And this coming summer, when the Greenmarkets are full of local, in-season, big flavor-low cost fruits, I'm going to use it to make jams and preserves.\nWhat can't a slow cooker do? You can't brown in one. As Andrew Schloss, author of the wonderful Art of the Slow Cooker, wrote, \"In cooking, brown is not just a color. It is a flavor\u2026.\" That is why most slow cooker recipes begin with browning in a skillet plus pre-cooking some of the ingredients that will develop better flavor if you get them a head start with more heat. Like onions and garlic, or blooming spices on the stove top first. This pre-cooking also helps kill any bacteria that may be on the surface of the food.\nIf you want to start a recipe in the morning and leave it cooking while you head off to work for 8 or so hours, you still have to do some cooking and prepping to get it going. This takes a bit of time. And only you can decide if browning meat and slicing onions is something you can face at 7:00 a.m.\nSlow Cooker Tips\nThis may be self-evident but put the bigger ingredients or the items that you think will take longer to cook (that big piece of chuck versus the sliced carrots) on the bottom and the quicker cooking foods on top.\nDon\u2019t preheat the pot. Add the ingredients to the cold pot, some of which will be partially cooked or browned, and then turn it on, cover it, and set the timer.\nSoon after you turn on the cooker you'll see the glass cover will steam up. This condensation is a sign that it's working right.\nSome say you should resist lifting the lid because this causes an immediate drop off in temperature, defeating the machine's slow, steady, low heat cooking. But I was learning and couldn't resist peeking and saw that the cooker got quickly back to its pre-lifted-lid state. Besides, lifting the lid is how I figured out my machine was cooking too fast. Giving the contents a bit of a stir or using tongs to move the larger ingredients around is also a good idea since electric devices sometimes have hot spots and one side of your pot may cook a bit hotter than the other.\nIf you want to use a slow cooker in its most iconic way -- meaning setting it before you leave for work so that you can come home to a pot of white bean and lamb stew -- practice a few times first by making recipes and watching the progress closely while you're still at home. That way you can confirm your slow cooker is functioning correctly.\nDon't fill a slow cooker to the top. Every cookbook I read said that you'll get the best results when it's filled one-third to three-quarters. Fill it less and things may burn; overfill it and everything may not completely cook.\nSlow Cooking Cookbooks\nBeing a complete slow cooker novice, I needed help. I began at the major recipe web sites and found that AllRecipes was particularly useful, probably because this database is filled with recipes submitted by home cooks, especially ones from across the heartland where slow cookers aren't as exotic as they are in city kitchens. It has an entire special slow cooker section, complete with tips.\nBut I wanted to learn from chefs and food writers who had developed some practice and expertise in adapting complex recipes to be made in slow cookers. I worked with six slow cooker cookbooks. They're all different but each is outstanding:\nArt of the Slow Cooker (Chronicle Books, paperback, color photos, $24.95) by Andrew Schloss may have been my favorite because it inspired me and as a beginner, it coached me with a very supportive voice. With very appealing photography by Yvonne Duivenvoorden, it has an excellent range of recipes and is full of helpful advice, tips and an extremely useful introduction with basic information about buying a slow cooker. A favorite feature is a chart that details the basic preparation, precooking and slow cook time (both at low and high) for about 50 mainstream ingredients.\nIts 80 recipes are very appealing. For example, \"Corn Chowder with Jalape\u00f1o,\" \"Barbecued Pork Ribs,\" \"Vegetable Tagine,\" \"Slow-Roasted Beets with Walnut Gremolata,\" and \"Chocolate Pudding Cake.\"\u00a0 We've been given the generous permission to reprint both the chowder and tagine recipes.\nNot Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook (Harvard Common Press, paperback, no photographs, $18.95) by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann and Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes for Two (Harvard Common Press, paperback, no photographs, $12.95) by Beth Hensperger are both excellent choices for their recipe diversity and also the tips and instructions throughout the books. I particularly like how Beth Hensperger's recipes are healthy and in these two volumes, many have international flavor and inspiration.\nThe first book has 350 recipes, including \"Our Best Pot Roast with Roots,\" the very first recipe I made in my new Crock Pot. It was motivating to have my premiere dish be such a success. It was as good a pot roast as I've ever made. I also liked their \"Italian White Beans with Pancetta,\" a recipe that confirmed how dried beans are a perfect match for slow cookers. The publisher has been generous in giving us permission to reprint both recipes.\u00a0 The second volume was written specifically for home cooks with smaller households using smaller cookers. It has some very appealing recipes, like \"Chipotle Black Bean Vegetable Soup,\" 10 different chilies, and \"Pork Tenderloin with Rhubarb,\" all made in a smaller cooker, usually one that has a one-and-a-half to three-quart capacity.\nThe $7 A Meal Slow Cooker Cookbook by Linda Larsen (Adams Media, paperback, no photographs, $9.95) has 301 recipes and was written by a \"Pillsbury Bake-Off recipe tester.\" These recipes sometimes use processed ingredients like canned soups, jarred salsa and frozen French fry potatoes. But nonetheless, the recipes are mostly easy, many are appealing, and once you get the hang of your cooker, you can easily make fresh substitutions for the canned or frozen stuff. Recipes include \"Beef With Broccoli,\" \"Chicken Wheatberry Casserole,\" and \"Vegetable Barley Stew.\" I like how each recipe is noted with the approximate price to make the dish, plus nutritional details on calories, fat, sodium, carbohydrates and protein.\nThe Gourmet Slow Cooker and The Gourmet Slow Cooker Volume II (Ten Speed Press, paperback, color photographs, $18.95 each) are by Lynn Alley and these are the most elegant of the cookbooks I worked with. The first is subtitled, \"Simple and Sophisticated Meals from Around the World\" and Volume II is \"Regional Comfort Food Classics.\"\nThese volumes inspired me to cook the more complex and sophisticated recipes and not fall back to easy stews or soups. My one squabble with both of Ms. Alley's books is her practice of including whole spices in their un-ground form. For example, recipes will call for a stick of cinnamon that you're then instructed to grind to a powder. It's not clear if it's a big stick or a little stick and if you don't have a spice grinder, you're left to your own calculation as to how to substitute powdered cinnamon. Same for every other spice -- cumin seed, fennel seed, whole cloves, etc. To be fair to Ms. Alley, this kind of commitment to best ingredients is emblematic of her refined and creative use of the slow cooker. Just anticipate that you'll either need to get a spice grinder to be prepared to use your best judgment on how to make substitutions. Her recipes include \"Chicken and Dumplings,\" \"Artichoke Risotto,\" \"San Francisco Cioppino,\" and \"New England Baked Beans.\"\nAdding French Technique to A Slow Cooker\nSo much of the appeal of slow cooking is its simplicity. But you may still be disappointed with the result if too many corners are cut. My primary complaint during this maiden voyage was how every cookbook used the addition of flour as a way to create sauces and gravies. In each of these six cookbooks, nearly every recipe for a stew or braise says to toss the meat or poultry in flour before browning, sometimes adding even more flour to the mixture before the slow cooking begins. One veal stew recipe I tried called for a half-cup of flour for about 3 pounds of veal. That's a lot of flour. Regardless of the meat or poultry and no matter how much flour was used, every time I tried this method the result was unpleasantly gummy.\nI experimented and instead of using the authors' coat-with-flour-at-the-start method, I used a technique I learned in culinary school that will let you get that gravy you want, but without the gumminess or lumps. It may sound fancy but in fact is very easy -- plus it lets you control the result.\nThe technique is called beurre mani\u00e9 and here's how it works:\nFollow your recipe to make your stew or pot roast or tagine in your slow cooker but completely omit any flour.\nThe cooking liquid, whether it's added stock, wine, water or just the juices from the meat, will be clearer and broth-like throughout the cooking because you'll have eliminated the flour.\nWhen the dish is finished cooking, take the meat and any big ingredients out of the pot, and leaving the cover off, turn the heat up high to make the liquid come to a gentle boil.\nIn a separate little bowl combine equal amounts of flour and unsalted butter; two tablespoons of each is a good amount. Use your fingers to rub the flour and butter together to make a crumbly paste-like mixture (you can do this ahead of time and keep it chilled).\nWhen the liquid in the slow cooker is bubbling, start adding bits of the paste, about a teaspoon at a time, and using a whisk or wooden spoon, stir rigorously so that the flour/butter paste dissolves into the liquid. The butter melts and the flour gets added to the liquid without any lumps. [Remember this method when you want to make Thanksgiving gravy with turkey stock.]\nKeep adding the beurre mani\u00e9 paste into the hot liquid until it develops the gravy-like appearance that you want. Want it thicker? Add more. It won't turn into a custard or get overly thick but it will develop that gravy-like viscosity. Add the other ingredients back into the pot to stay warm until serving.\nWith this method the foods that have cooked in the slow cooker will not have become coated in a pasty surface and yet you will transform a broth into a sauce, making it more appealing but retaining a clearer yet still rich taste.\nSo add a little French technique to the all American slow cooker. It's another way to explore how to fit cooking into your every day life while still enjoying special and satisfying meals.\n"}, {"score": 1159.2372, "uuid": "66af3878-5cb3-57e6-94cc-d633672be063", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1510wb-26-07242", "target_hostname": "www.sushisushi.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.sushisushi.co.uk/japanese-food/rice", "page_rank": 2.1941802e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Japanese Sushi <em>Rice</em>, Microwavable Sushi <em>Rice</em>", "snippet": "All our <em>rice</em> brands <em>are</em> excellent quality, so enjoy!

These time savers are wonderful for cooking roasts and many other foods in a fraction of the time they take by conventional methods.\nYears ago using a pressure cooker involved serious monitoring to ensure the pressure valve 'rocked' gently and continuously through the cooking period. The hissing releasing steam and pressure also had to remain constant to ensure there would not be a build-up of unsafe pressure in the cooker. The benefits of pressure cooking did outweigh the stressful operation, but I am glad that today's pressure cookers have many more safety features incorporated in their designs, making them much more user friendly and safe to use than the earlier models.\nNow available in a variety of sizes and quality of construction, from aluminum to 18/10 stainless steel, pressure cookers can also provide that additional pot when needed. Electric models are also available. Cookers have been designed with built-in safety features, like pressure indicators and steam release mechanisms. Some cookers come with additional accessories such as steam insert baskets and trivets, and even an extra lid when using it as a regular pot. Cookers usually come with instructions and an assortment of recipes to speed you on your way.\nEvaluate what your needs are before buying. A small pressure cooker up to 4 quart size is perfect for small meals, but a family of 4 or 5, may benefit more from a 5 to 8 quart size, or even larger. You should ensure the size is adequate and not too big. A cooker needs to be 2/3 full to operate properly.\nCleaning is very easy as these stovetop cookers are usually immersible (non-electrics), and some are dishwasher safe. The steam vent can be cleaned with a pipe cleaner if needed. You should consult your operation manual to ensure you are cleaning your pressure cooker properly.\nIf you are planning on harvesting and canning, many foods require that pressure is maintained at certain levels, through the whole canning process, by way of a pressure regulator gauge. Large pressure cooker/canners have such a pressure gauge to ensure that your canning is safely processed. Smaller cooker/canners are also available for small batch canning.\nNot only for a fast-paced lifestyle where time savers are a must, but pressure cookers will ensure even a cheaper cut of roast comes out fork tender every time. A meal that takes less than an hour, as opposed to 3-4 hours, also saves you money in energy.\nRead pressure cooker reviews at ConsumerSearch\nRead More About Cookware:\n"}, {"score": 1148.4403, "uuid": "0803538c-e77c-53d7-9723-196c858a68e2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-20-04086", "target_hostname": "www.amazon.com", "target_uri": "http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NP-HBC10-Induction-Heating-Stainless/dp/B000MAKVLQ", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Amazon.com: Zojirushi NP-HBC10 5-1&#x2F;2-Cup <em>Rice</em> <em>Cooker</em> and Warmer with Induction", "snippet": "<em>What</em> is <em>the</em> worst cooking mistake you ever made?", "explanation": null, "document": "(REAL NAME)\nWe purchased this rice cooker last week, and have used it twice for brown rice. The rice came out better (and with less effort on our part) than any other cooking method we've ever used. It was, in short, the best brown rice we'd ever had anywhere.\nWe also tried out the warming function, in which the machine keeps rice warm for up to 12 hours on normal warm mode--there's also an extended warm mode for up to 48 hours. After about 8 hours on warming mode, the rice was virtually the same as when it had just been cooked.\nThe machine could not be easier to use. Build and material quality appear first rate. The rice pan is heavy duty--same for the non-stick coating. Very quiet in operation, very easy to clean. All sorts of little details that suggest many cycles of refinement in the design. Aesthetics are delightfully Japanese. The stainless steel side and top panels appear as an afterthought designed to fit Western tastes.\nOne thing I haven't seen anyone else mention about Zojirushi rice cookers. On the last page in the owner's manual there's a footnote which suggests vaguely that this rice cooker may not function well at high altitude. Since I live in Santa Fe at 7,000 feet, I called Zojirushi USA and asked about this. They told me that their rice machines do not function well above 3,000 feet, and that I should return the machine I purchased. Well, instead, we tried it at better than double its supposed elevation limit, and as mentioned above, it worked perfectly--so it's hard to imagine that it might work MORE perfectly below 3,000 feet. Suffice it to say that if you live in Denver, Albuquerque or Santa Fe, you can ignore Zojirushi's disclaimers about poor function at higher elevation.\nAll in all, this is a superb product that combines the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of perfect rice with set and forget automation. The folks at Zojirushi USA (aside from their apparent ignorance about cooking rice at altitude) are informative and friendly. We tend to buy the best kitchen equipment we can find just to avoid the hassles of unreliability. Accordingly, we're difficult to please, and this machine meets our (very high) standards.\nLONG TERM USE UPDATE (January, 2009):\nThis machine has continued to function flawlessly. Apparently Zojirushi induction rice cookers aren't well known in northern New Mexico, since whenever we have a dinner party and rice is on the menu, our guests are always intrigued by this thing, and regularly end up buying one of their own.\nOne clarification: the cooking bowl is stainless steel, as is the inside cooking bowl cover. Apparently these parts tend to be aluminum on the vast majority of computerized rice cookers, even those from Zojirushi. The bowl is coated in some sort of very heavy duty anti-stick coating--after a year or two of use, the coating still looks new--it hasn't started flaking off at all. I would guess that boiling water (which is basically what rice cookers do) isn't too hard on the coating, and we're probably not poisoning ourselves, the way we might be if we used non-stick pans (which we don't).\nReference my comments above about Zojirushi rice cookers working perfectly at high elevation (which was news even to Zojirushi), I've since heard that high elevation performance may be better with induction rice cookers than with computerized rice cookers with standard heating elements. Who knows. What is definite, however, is that as of this writing this machine has functioned perfectly at 7,000 feet for almost two years.\nHelp other customers find the most helpful reviews\nWas this review helpful to you?

The desserts are puddings or fruit based cakes and cobblers.\nSome of the recipes are designed for certain types of slow cookers; small size crock pots are specified for the appetizers, oval shaped for roasts. So if you only have one type of cooker, you may not be able to make some recipes come out without figuring out how to adjust them.

It is the seed of a grass and is the staple of many cuisines from Asia to Mexico to Africa because it is rich in protein, starch, minerals, and vitamins, and low in calories and fat. It is versatile enough to be an integral part of an entree or a dessert.\nRice is intimately linked to the cuisine of the American South, especially barbecue, because it was cultivated extensively by slaves in the coastal areas of South Carolina and Georgia, where low and slow smoke roasting was also perfected by slaves.\nAccording to the USA Rice Federation , there are 120,000 different varieties of rice, but the most common cooking rices in the US are white rice, brown rice, wild rice, and arborio rice, all described below. There are many others available. I'm a big fan of forbidden black rice, red rice, and jasmine rice.\nCommercially, rice can be made into a syrup, a milk substitute, noodles, fermented into wine, beer, vodka, vinegar, and biofuel, and the bran can be used to make vegetable oil. It can also be popped to make rice cakes, the puffed rice breakfast cereal Rice Krispies, and let's not forget Rice Krispie bars.\nAbout brown rice\nAdvertisement\nBrown rice is whole grain rice that has been husked to remove the chaff, but it is still wearing its outer bran layer. According to the USA Rice Federation , one cup of brown rice provides two of the three recommended daily servings of whole grains. It is nuttier, chewier, and more nutritious than white rice. The bran is a good source of thiamin, niacin, vitamin B-6, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. Because there is oil in the husk it can go rancid if kept too long, so it should be stored in cool dark places or the refrigerator. There are several varieties, but they all cook about the same. Brown rice needs just a bit more water than white rice and takes about twice as long to cook.\nAbout white rice\nFurther processing of brown rice removes the outer bran layer, the germ, and much of the nutritional value. White rice can be stored in a sealed container for years, but watch for infestations if somehow insect eggs got in during the processing.\nLong grain rice is not as sticky as short grain rice so it is the best choice for fluffy side dishes such as pilaf, rice salads, or as a base for saucy dishes.\nMedium grain rice is more moist and tender than long grain rice when cooked, and has a greater tendency to cling together.\nShort grain rice clumps more easily and is the best choice for sushi and desserts.\nEnriched rice has had some of the with iron, niacin, thiamin, and folic acid lost when the bran and germ are removed coated back on the surface of the kernel.\nConverted rice is steamed before it is husked. This forces many of the nutrients from the husk into the kernel making it more nutritious than most white rice. It cooks quickly and doesn't clumb easily. Uncle Ben's is the best known brand.\nMinute rice or instant rice is white rice that has been cooked and then dried. It is more expensive, and doesn't have the same nutritional value. Since other rices are so easy to make, its main advantage is speed, cooking in about 5 minutes. It saves you about 10 minutes.\nA reader has pointed out that \"It makes great cheap backpacking food, especially at high altitude where cooking times need to be increased. That saves fuel. Fish can be steamed above it and the resulting broth adds a touch of fish stock to the rice. Herbs, a few shreds of smoked meat, and you can make a cheap 'gourmet' meal on the trail. It is good for breakfast, just add cinnamon sugar, crushed starlight mint, dried fruit, or a square or two of chocolate for a varied, simple breakfast. The unsticky quality of Minute Rice makes cleanup easier. Just boil another cup of water in the pot, scrape a bit, and you have a safe drink to finish the meal. It is clearly not as nice as real rice, but it keeps you fed on the trail.\"\nCooking brown and white rice\nPortion size. Plan on 1/2 to 3/4 cup of uncooked rice per adult.\nFor white rice, follow the 1-2-3 rule of thumb. In general, 1 cup of uncooked long grain white rice (about 1/2 pound) + 2 cups boiling liquid = 3 cups finished rice and serves 3-4 people. Add 1/2 teaspoon of table salt and 1 tablespoon butter to the liquid.\nStovetop cooking. Put the liquid, salt, and butter in a saucepan with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil. Add the rice, pouring it in slowly so that each grain is engulfed in water rather than just dumping it in. This will help keep it from clumping. Stir briefly and dial back the heat to a slow simmer, on low. Cover with a tight lid so little steam will escape and simmer 15 minutes for white rice, 45 minutes for brown rice and wild rice. Do not lift the lid and do not stir. After it is done, taste it. If it is too crunchy, cook for another 2-4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes, fluff with a fork and serve.\nCooking tips. The basic concept for rice cookery is the same for all types except arborio rice. Exact cooking times can vary depending on your rice source, altitude, and if you like it crunchy or soft.\nDo not wash. Most white rice sold in the US is enriched. Rinsing or washing it removes much of the stuff that makes it healty. If you wash arborio rice you risk removing the starched that make the creamy sauce. That said, washing rice does make it a bit fluffier.\nMeasure carefully and use a timer. Rice is not very hard and it is not very forgiving. Get your measurements and timing right.\nOven cooking. Rice is often used in casseroles and stews cooked in the oven. Cook white rice at 350\u00b0F for 30 minutes, brown and wild rice for 60 minutes.\nMicrowave cooking. Don't try to cook more than one cup at a time in the microwave. Put the rice, liquid, and salt, in a microwave safe bowl and stir. Top with the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and poke three holes in the plastic with a knife tip to allow steam to escape. Cook on high power for 12 minutes. Cook brown and wild rice for 30 minutes. Let it sit for 5 minutes, remove the plastic being careful not to steam clean your eyebrows, and taste. If needed, cook a few minutes longer. If there is excess water, drain it in a strainer. Fluff with a fork, add salt, pepper, and butter to taste, and serve.\nRice cooker cooking. Rice cookers have a heating element and an inner pan that sits above the heat and make rice cookery practically brainless. The cooker senses when the rice is done and alerts you. Some can hold the rice and keep it warm for a short while. Mine has a glass lid, and I like that. Follow the directions on your cooker.\nAbout the cooking liquid. Rice absorbs a lot of liquid when prepared and can be cooked in water as well as other liquids such as broths, stocks, soups, stews, and juices. If you use a flavorful liquid like soup or broth, you may want to skip the salt in the recipe since soups and broths often have salt in them. You can always add it later but you can't take it away. If you want to cook rice in fruit juice, dilute the juice one to one with water\nAdd-ins. If you wish, you can add onion, peas, carrots, or other vegetables, even bits of cooked meat, when you add the rice. Add fresh herbs when you remove it from the heat and let them steam during the 5 minute rest.\nBrown the rice to amp it up. Before cooking, rice can be browned in a thin layer of oil to produce a richer nuttier flavor.\nServing. Put butter or fresh oil on the table if you wish. A pat of butter can practically glows on the palate when mixed in rice.\nLeftovers. Leftover rice can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week or frozen for up to 6 months. In fact, it makes sense to cook lots of brown rice when you are preparing a meal and freeze whatever you don't use. Then you can have brown rice for dinner any night in a hurry. To reheat, add 2-3 tablespoons of water per cup of rice and heat in a saucepan over a medium heat, fluffing frequently with a fork. To reheat in the microwave, add the water, cover with plastic wrap, poke three holes in the cover, and nuke it for 1 minute on high. Or use it for fried rice or rice pudding.\nCooking brown rice and wild rice\nAdd 1/4 cup more liquid to brown rice for a total of 2 1/4 cups liquid to 1 cup of rice. Add 1 cup more for wild rice for a total of 3 cups of liquid to 1 cup of rice. Do not wash brown rice, but you should lightly rinse wild rice.\nWild Rice\nNative to North America, most \"wild\" rice is actually cultivated just like other rice although you can sometimes find truly wild wild rice (that's wild rice in the picture above). You can tell the difference by looking at the price. Wild wild rice, most of which is handpicked in Minnesota, is 2-3 times as expensive. It's good, but not worth it IMHO.\nBomba Rice\nBomba is a short grain from Spain that is ideally suited for paella because it is especially good at absorbing the flavorful cooking liquid, up to three times its volume.\nArborio Rice\nThis variety absorbs a lot of liquid and retains its shape so it is best used for making risotto, the Italian rice dish that can be a meal in itself. Risotto is made by adding stock or broth and other flavorful liquids which it gladly absorbs. It clings to itself and makes a creamy, rich binding sauce while retaining a chewy texture. You should never rinse arborio rice or you will remove the starches that make it creamy.\nArborio rice drinks about 4.5 cups of liquid per cup of uncooked rice, and takes about 30 minutes. It should be cooked over a low temp on the stovetop, uncovered, and stirred almost constantly. Creative chefs find all sorts of fun things to put in the liquid. The best risotto I ever made had a roasted red pepper that I liquefied in a blender in the liquid.\nArborio rice can be used to make paella , just don't stir it while it is cooking.\nRice Mixes\nMany manufacturers make some fun and convenient rice mixes packaged with herbs and spices. They are quick and have saved me many nights.\nHere are some good videos of rice dishes\nThis page was revised 10/26/2009\n"}]]}
