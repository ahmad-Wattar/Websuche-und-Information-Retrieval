Eighty percent of the population will experience an episode of low back pain during their lifetime, and once an episode is experienced, there is a likelihood that the back pain may become episodic. For this reason, it is important to understand some of the activities that may exacerbate or prolong an episode of back pain, and what to expect when you seek conservative medical management and physical therapy.\nThere is a belief by most patients that back pain occurs as a result of a traumatic event, for example, as a result of some sport activity or lifting something heavy. Most often, however, low back pain begins for no specific reason. Often, a patient may relate an event that occurred several days before the low back pain actually began. With further investigation, it can be determined that it is the poor postures and positions in which the person is engaged after the activity that aggravates or causes the back pain, not the physical activity itself. For that reason, it is important to learn proper postures during sitting, lifting and bending, and methods to minimize the likelihood of experiencing low back pain.\nA Typical Example:\nA patient, a 40 year-old male, who comes to PT with a complaint of low back pain for about two weeks that began for no apparent reason. The patient states that he was sitting at his office and noticed his back was starting to bother him. He reports that his pain is worsened with prolonged sitting or driving and feels better when walking. He states he has been unable to garden due to the pain, but when he works out at the gym or plays basketball, he feels good. During the week, he has much more pain than on the weekend. He has no complaints of pain when sleeping and wakes up feeling good. He finds that toward the end of his workday where he primarily sits at a computer, his pain is worsened.\nDuring the PT Exam, the therapist may have identified specific movements that help to decrease the back pain. Given the history described above, activities that cause the low back to flex, or bend forward, increase this patient's pain. That includes sitting for long periods of time (the low back is flexed when you sit, especially when slouched) and when gardening, where the back is also bending forward. When this patient walks or plays basketball, he feels good, indicating that activities where the low back is erect and moving toward extension (bending \"backwards\") decrease the pain. Therefore, extension movements were most likely found to decrease this patient's pain during the PT exam, while flexion movements aggravated his symptoms.\nThe patient would then be instructed in specific exercises that require the back to bend backwards, in order to alleviate the pain. The patient would be instructed to perform these regularly throughout the day to prevent the onset of pain and also to alleviate the back pain should it develop. This patient would also be instructed to temporarily avoid those activities that aggravate his symptoms, which are primarily flexion activities, like slouched sitting or gardening.\nCorrecting Sitting Posture and Instruction in Proper Lifting Techniques\nThe therapist may have identified poor, or slouched sitting posture during the initial examination, which is most often the case, especially with a patient history as described above. The PT can instruct this patient in proper sitting posture using a lumbar roll, which is a special pillow designed to maintain the \"lordotic curve,\" or hollow, in the low back. This correction of sitting posture assists in minimizing the onset of pain. The instruction would also include applying the concept of posture correction to sitting in a car, at the office, and any other place specific to the patient's daily routine. Interrupting prolonged sitting posture with breaks to walk to the fax machine or to the copier on a regular basis would also be appropriate.\nInstruction in proper bending and lifting should also be provided. With a history as described above, activities that require repetitive or sustained bending, like gardening, aggravate the patient's symptoms. These activities should be temporarily avoided until the pain is under control. As the person is able to resume bending, education in proper bending and lifting techniques should be provided in order to prevent the onset of low back pain during this episode as well as to prevent future episodes.\nEven though there are specific activities this patient should avoid, there are a multitude of activities in which this patient could participate pain free. Since this patient feels good while playing basketball and when working out at the gym, these activities should continue. However, it is critical that AFTER the patient exercises, the patient should be cautious to maintain good sitting posture, as it is often the case that a patient will feel good while exercising, but develop low back pain a few hours later when sedentary.\nAerobic Conditioning\nOnce pain-control techniques are well understood, a patient should quickly progress to an aerobic conditioning program. It has been found that aerobic activity assists in bringing nutrients to structures in the spine. Some of these structures, like the disc, have a relatively poor blood supply and rely on body movements and aerobic activity to circulate nutrients to these structures. When a person is sedentary, less of these nutrients are able to get to the structures in the spine to keep them healthy.\nAerobic-conditioning activities should be chosen based on a patient's interest, availability, and coincide with the type of problem that the person has. Generally, a walking program, elliptical trainer, and upright bicycle are good choices. The program should be performed at least three times a week for thirty to forty minutes each session.\nStrengthening and Flexibility Exercises\nOnce the pain is under control, spine and lower extremity flexibility exercises should be initiated. In the above example, this patient needed to avoid activities that required him to bend forward because they aggravated his pain. Once the pain is stabilized, however, his ability to bend forward may be limited and stiff due to avoidance of this activity. Therefore, restoring flexion movement is critical to return the patient to full activities. Additionally, any limitation of flexibility of the legs should also be addressed, as tightness in these muscles may inhibit a person's ability to maintain certain postures and positions necessary to control back pain.\nAs the pain in the back stabilizes, strengthening exercises should also be incorporated into the PT program. The trunk muscles themselves, the abdominals and spine extensors, should be directly strengthened. Additionally, activities that require the trunk to maintain a stable position, while strengthening the upper and lower body, should also be included. Leg strengthening is important as well, so that a person can properly lift objects from the floor using their legs muscles rather than those of the back. A home program of strengthening exercises should also be included that are easy to do and require minimal equipment.\nMinimizing \"Bed Rest\"\nGone are the days of prolonged bed rest. Most often, even with acute back pain, engaging in proper movements and postures as well as a progressive return to activities has been found to be much more successful in terms of controlling low back pain and allowing a return to normal activities more quickly.\nUse of Passive Modalities\nAlthough the emphasis of a good back rehab program is returning to function and activity while learning to control the symptoms of low back pain, there are instances where the use of \"passive modalities\" is indicated. In most cases, passive modalities should be used in conjunction with other, more active forms of physical therapy during treatment. Modalities can be utilized early in the course of physical therapy care to help control pain. However, as the physical therapy program progresses, the focus should move away from the use of modalities and include a progressive increase in activity and exercise and instruction in self-treatment techniques.\nPassive modalities are described as the application of some form of cold, heat, or electricity to the body to assist in pain management. These modalities are referred to as \"passive,\" as the recipient does not have to actively participate. The modality is applied while the patient is at rest. The most common forms of heat include moist hot packs and ultrasound. Cold treatments, or cryotherapy, can be used to minimize pain as well. This can be administered in the form of cold packs and ice massage to the low back. Fluoromethane is a spray that can also be applied to the skin by the therapist, and is usually followed by a series of therapist-assisted stretches.\nElectric stimulation can also be used to control pain. Some specific types include TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation) and microcurrent. In cases where TENS has been found to be helpful in controlling pain, especially chronic pain, a portable TENS unit can be obtained for home use.\nConclusion\nAlthough this discussion is by no means exhaustive of the type of physical therapy treatments available for low back pain, a program that is active in nature and geared toward instructing the patient in self care techniques and back injury prevention are key ingredients in returning a person to a pain-free, active and healthy lifestyle.\nReprinted with Permission\n925 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia PA 19107-4216\n(215) 955-3458\n"}, {"score": 3093.726, "uuid": "5504bcf0-d4fe-5410-8165-cea8c5d12ffe", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-14-16764", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/chronic-pain/physical-therapy-chronic-pain", "page_rank": 1.2143466e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> <em>for</em> Chronic <em>Pain</em>", "snippet": "Are you eager to start exercising but feel your <em>pain</em> <em>is</em> limiting that? <em>What</em> would be most helpful to learn in <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>?

Passive treatments help to relax you and your body. They're called passive because you don't have to actively participate.\nYour physical therapy program may start with passive treatments, but the goal is to get into active treatments. These are therapeutic exercises that strengthen your body and help you deal with the chronic pain.\nPassive physical therapy treatments include:\nDeep Tissue Massage : This technique targets spasms and chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress. You could also have spasms or muscle tension because of strains or sprains. The therapist uses direct pressure and friction to try to release the tension in your soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles).\nHot and Cold Therapies : Your physical therapist will alternate between hot and cold therapies. By using heat, the physical therapist seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood flow brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to remove waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing.\nCold therapy, also called cryotherapy, slows circulation, helping to reduce inflammation, muscle spasms, and pain. You may have a cold pack placed upon the target area, or even be given an ice massage. Another cryotherapy option is a spray called fluoromethane that cools the tissues. After cold therapy, your therapist may work with you to stretch the affected muscles.\nTENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) : A TENS machine stimulates your muscles through variable (but safe) intensities of electrical current. TENS helps reduce muscle spasms, and it may increase your body's production of endorphins, your natural pain killers. The TENS equipment your physical therapist uses is relatively large. However, a smaller machine for \"at home\" use is also available. Whether large or small, a TENS unit can be a helpful therapy.\nUltrasound : By increasing blood circulation, an ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, cramping, swelling, stiffness, and pain. It does this by sending sound waves deep into your muscle tissues, creating a gentle heat that enhances circulation and healing.\nPassive therapies, such as those listed above, are generally done in conjunction with active therapies. In the active part of physical therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your joints move).\nRemember: Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking into consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable for another person with chronic pain, especially since chronic pain is such a subjective, personal experience.\nOther Aspects of Physical Therapy\nIf needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate ergonomic principles into your daily activities. This is all part of the \"self-care\" or \"self-treatment\" aspect of physical therapy: through physical therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take better care of your body.\nYour physical therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program for you. As you can read in the Exercise and Chronic Pain article, staying active is an important part of chronic pain treatment. The physical therapist can help you figure out the best type of exercise for you.\nUpdated on: 12/10/09\n"}, {"score": 3078.136, "uuid": "5f21493f-c53b-52c8-b56d-51efd9183e1c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0703wb-82-09177", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/back-pain/upper-back-pain/physical-therapy-relieve-upper-back-pain", "page_rank": 1.196863e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> to Relieve Upper <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em>", "snippet": "<em>For</em> upper <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> caused by soft tissue tension, massage <em>is</em> very beneficial. * Hot and cold <em>therapies</em>: Your <em>physical</em> therapist will alternate between hot and cold <em>therapies</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Passive Treatments\nYour physical therapist may give you passive treatments.\nDeep tissue massage: This technique targets spasms and chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress.

This pervasive condition has many root causes, each requiring specific treatments. Some patients require physical therapy, some require surgery, and others require both.\nAnd with today's growing emphasis on treatments that are less invasive and cost effective, physical therapy is becoming a valid alternative for many.\nCertified physical therapists go through a regimen of training qualifying them to safely perform certain rehabilitative treatments with goals of reducing pain and regaining function. Much of their work also involves education of the patient. Their therapies involve successive movements, each building upon the other.\nHow Physical Therapists Work\nMany types of physical therapy exist. The cornerstones of treatment are therapeutic exercise and functional training, notes Andrew Guccione, senior vice president for practice and research at the American Physical Therapy Association.\nOften this involves a program combining manual technique and also graded exercises to increase the range of motion and muscle ability, using weights and other devices. Occupational therapy is another emphasis of physical therapy engaged to either help repair or lessen the effects of certain back conditions that hinder normal activities. Therapy can take place in an outpatient clinic, the patient's home, a hospital, the workplace, a wound center, a skilled nursing facility, or rehab center. Very often, rehab centers look like mini-gymnasiums, only with specialized equipment calibrated to measure progress.\nNick Pesce, physical therapist (PT), owner, and administrator of Momentum Rehab, describes physical therapy as the science of evaluating, diagnosing, and treating patients who have impairments, functional limitations, disabilities or changes in health resulting from disease, injury or other causes.\n\"PTs use various tests and measures to identify the causes of difficulties and to track progress of treatment,\" he says. \"They use physical methods, modalities, and education to alleviate pain and regain function.\" These include forms of heat, cold, and electrotherapy to help alleviate pain, decrease swelling, increase strength, and promote healing. Methods include therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, functional training, and use of assistive devices and adaptive equipment to increase strength, range of motion, endurance, wound healing, and functional independence. Another goal is to decrease pain, swelling, and muscle spasms.\nPTs first do a comprehensive evaluation, Pesce explains. \"Education is a large part of treatment - showing and explaining to the patients what is wrong to help them better manage their neck and/or back. We train the patient in body mechanics, posture, and activity modification.\"\nMore specifically, Pesce notes, PTs treat initial pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms with heat and cold, electrotherapy, manual therapy (soft tissue and spinal mobilizations), and light specific exercise. As pain decreases, they focus on regaining range of motion, strength, and endurance, while encouraging correct body mechanics and postures. Final stages of back care include regaining muscular control and reaction time to help prevent further injury.\nSpecialists Work Together to Help the Patient Heal\nPhysical therapists usually work closely with the patient's physician to coordinate care. Physical therapy differs from chiropractic or osteopathy, Pesce says. \"There is much overlap in the care these practitioners provide, and the professions are evolving and their approaches are changing,\" Pesce says. Osteopathy began as a hands-on profession, which used soft tissue mobilization and spinal manipulation, but now, doctors of osteopathy (DOs) are related to MDs in that they prescribe medicine and have many privileges that MDs have. DOs focus on preventive health care and receive specialized training in the musculoskeletal system, according to the American Osteopathic Association. They emphasize understanding ways an injury or illness in one part of the body can affect another part of the body.\nDOs also use their hands to diagnose injuries and illness and encourage the body's natural tendency to heal. Using osteopathic manipulative treatment, they move muscles and joints with stretching, gentle pressure, and resistance, according to the association. Chiropractic clinics traditionally placed an emphasis on spinal adjustments, using manipulations of the spine to adjust the position of the vertebrae. That would stem from a viewpoint that back pain sufferers could have part of their vertebrae out of proper position, placing pressure on a nerve.\n\"Chiropractic physicians are portal of entry health care providers who are specialists in conservative treatment of spine complaints,\" says Richard Cole of Cole Pain Therapy Group. They use spinal manipulation along with rehabilitation and therapeutic modes in their treatment approach, he says, and have diagnostic responsibilities. They can refer patients on a case-by-case basis to physical therapists and surgeons. Chiropractors also counsel patients on lifestyle modification, exercise and diet.\nCole notes that modern physical therapy also has additional roles in spine assessment, prevention and treatment. PTs also uses spinal mobilizations or manipulations as a tool, in concert with a physician, with a primary objective of regaining motion if a spinal joint is tight. All practitioners often emphasize use of specific exercises and education. Some of the hallmarks of physical therapy in particular are that it offers active and resistive exercise, range of motion and isometric exercises, along with prevention programs to avert recurring problems, notes Angie Whitfield, director of marketing at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics.\n\"What I find in my practice of physical therapy is that it is the educational and therapeutic exercise portion of the treatment has the long-lasting effects,\" says Susan Pearson, a physical therapist. \"I recall a quote from one of my educational classes, saying: 'Treat you and I will help you today - teach you and I will be helping you tomorrow.'\"\nPhysical therapists must graduate from an accredited school of physical therapy, then pass national boards and be licensed by the state. Today, almost all schools are training PTs on at least master's degree levels. The clinical doctorate is known as the DPT degree. Physical Therapy Assistants must complete a two-year college education program and may work only under the direction and supervision of a physical therapist, according to the American Physical Therapy Association, another medical organization bound by a code of ethics.\nNowadays, all credible spine care providers are moving to kindred, though specific modes of treatment. The focus of conservative spine care has moved from passive care (simple bed rest) to active care.\n\"The choice of a therapist can be critical to the successful conclusion of a conservative treatment program,\" says Mark Temme, director and chief therapist of OrthoMemphis Physical Therapy. \"Manual skills are essential.

I went to see\u00a0many Doctors all over Florida\u00a0with\u00a0a copy of my MRI results showing multiple herniated and bulging discs in my lumbar spine.\u00a0Not one of them said they could help me and they all told me I needed\u00a0surgery on my low back. After 8 months of severe pain, no sleep, and numbness /\u00a0tingling in my right leg, I contacted my daughter in Georgia. I also called my church to put me on their prayer list. My daughter told me she used to work for this excellent chiropractor\u00a0who helped many people get healed without surgery.\u00a0So, I contacted Dr. Ryan Moorman and he spoke with me for an extended period over the phone. He was very understanding and listened\u00a0to my every concern and told me that he\u00a0believed that he could help me. Finally, the first person who gave\u00a0me hope and felt that\u00a0I could get better without surgery. I drove 5 hours to see Dr. Moorman the next Monday and he read my MRI results. He looked at my MRI and said to me for the first time in 8 months that not only could he get me out of pain, but my injury could actually heal. He advised me to undergo a series of painless non-surgical spinal decompression therapy treatments called VAX-D. After only 2 treatments I could feel the sensation in my right leg for the first time in 8 months. I was able to sit, stand and walk without the severe pain and numbness in my leg. I was finally able to get some sleep without pain and without pain medications. I feel Dr. Moorman has been a blessing to me when no one gave me any hope. I feel great and feel like I am living again! I have finished 3 weeks of treatment and close to 100% better without surgery. I would recommend anyone who is considering having back surgery to please contact Dr. Ryan Moorman and his staff at Care Medical Center first. He helped me and he can help you too.

Spasms prevent muscle motion at the affected level, which is one of the reasons people with fibromyalgia experience a decreased range of motion. Physical therapy techniques, including deep tissue massage, will help you use your muscles more effectively. This treatment may be combined with heat or cold therapies to boost the benefits.\nHeat Therapy: Heat therapy is one of the most preferred methods of reducing chronic aches and pains associated with fibromyalgia. Heat triggers the body's natural healing process by relaxing your muscles and speeding up blood flow to the affected area. Extra blood delivers extra oxygen and nutrients. Blood also removes waste byproducts from muscle spasms.\nHeat may not completely eliminate the source of your pain, but it can effectively reduce your pain. This therapy is used in a couple of ways\u2014through dry heat (a heating pad or a dry, hot towel) or moist heat (steam heat or a moist, warm cloth).\nWhen using heat therapy on your own after physical therapy ends, never overheat painful areas. If you're using a heating pad, set it to low or medium. When using a hot towel, touch it first to make sure it's not too hot. Excessive heat may not only exacerbate your fibromyalgia pain but also potentially cause burns.\nHydrotherapy: As the name suggests, hydrotherapy involves water. As a passive treatment, hydrotherapy may simply involve sitting in a whirlpool bath to relieve pain, relax muscles, and condition your body without adding unnecessary stress.\nElectric Muscle Stimulation: Electric muscle stimulation sounds intense, but it really isn't painful. This technique reduces muscle spasms and is generally believed to trigger the release of endorphins, which are your body's natural pain killers.\nUltrasound: This therapy uses sound waves to create a gentle heat that increases blood circulation to your deep tissues. Ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, inflammation, stiffness, and pain and is most effective in relieving range of motion limitations in chronic pain sufferers, as opposed to those with acute inflammatory conditions.\nActive Treatments\nActive treatments help address core stability, flexibility, strength, and joint movement. An exercise program may also be prescribed to achieve optimal results. This will not only curb recurrent pain but will also benefit your overall health. Your physical therapist will work with you to develop a program based on your specific symptoms and health history.\nActive treatments include:\nCore stability: Your core (abdominal) muscles have a greater impact on your overall health than you may think. Strong core muscles serve as good allies to your back muscles in supporting your spine. It's called the core because it's the central powerhouse of your body. Naturally, a healthy core provides your body with a strong, stable center point.\nMuscle flexibility and strengthening: Your range of motion will likely be restricted if you're experiencing fibromyalgia pain. Using customized stretching and strengthening exercises, your physical therapist will help you lengthen and strengthen your muscles, and improve joint movement. Strong, lean muscles better handle pain.\nHydrotherapy: Water-based exercises may be recommended to provide gentle aerobic conditioning.\nYour physical therapist will teach you self-care principles so you understand how to best treat your symptoms. The ultimate goal is for you to develop the knowledge to help control your symptoms. It's essential that you learn the exercises and continue them after the formal therapy ends. If you fail to keep with a fitness regimen, you won't enjoy long-term results from your physical therapy. By taking care of your back on your own, you'll reduce further fibromyalgia pain.\nUpdated on: 01/04/10\n"}, {"score": 2619.93, "uuid": "27e7e8ff-a03e-5f93-8544-dfb15625698a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-53-26806", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/kyphosis/physical-therapy-kyphosis", "page_rank": 1.2128489e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> <em>for</em> Kyphosis", "snippet": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> <em>for</em> Kyphosis Caused by Spinal Fractures <em>Physical</em> <em>therapy</em> won&#x27;t correct the kyphotic curve caused by spinal fractures, but to prevent more fractures, it may be useful <em>for</em> you to learn good (<em>or</em> <em>better</em>) posture.", "explanation": null, "document": "Kyphosis Center\nPhysical Therapy for Scheuermann's Kyphosis\nPhysical therapy is often used at the same time as bracing. Because the brace supports so much of the spine, some believe that wearing the brace can weaken the muscles. To avoid this, you may have to go to physical therapy. Otherwise, when the brace comes off, the muscles may not be able to support the spine very well, and the spine may still curve too much.\nThe physical therapist will also help you with your flexibility and range of motion (how well your joints move). Many patients with Scheuermann's kyphosis also have very tight hamstring muscles (muscles on the back of your upper leg). Physical therapy can help alleviate those tight muscles, too, as you work on increasing the flexibility of the hamstrings.\nPhysical Therapy for Kyphosis Caused by Spinal Fractures\nPhysical therapy won't correct the kyphotic curve caused by spinal fractures, but to prevent more fractures, it may be useful for you to learn good (or better) posture.

Although its health claims include the treatment of multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia , arthritis, insomnia , inflammation , and even cancer and heart disease, there is little scientific evidence for magnetic therapy's effectiveness.\nHow Does Magnetic Therapy Work?\nMagnet therapy takes many different forms. In some cases, magnets are applied to illness-affected areas with the help of wraps, shoe inserts, self-adhesive strips, belts, or \"magnetic jewelry\" like bracelets, necklaces, and earrings. Other products include magnetic mattress pads and blankets, as well as magnetic-field-generating machines and even magnet-conditioned water.\nSince scientific support for its use is so limited, it's difficult to determine how magnetic therapy might promote healing. However, proponents maintain that magnets can stimulate circulation, relax the blood vessels, increase endorphin levels, reduce muscle tension, and normalize metabolic functioning.\nMagnetic Therapy Research\nEven though claims that magnetic therapy can treat diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis are unfounded, there is some evidence that it may help relieve pain related to these chronic conditions:\n1) Arthritis\nIn a 2004 study of 194 adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, researchers found that those who wore magnetic bracelets for 12 weeks had a decrease in arthritis-associated pain. Meanwhile, a 2001 study of 64 people with rheumatoid arthritis of the knee showed that 68% of those who used magnetic therapy reported feeling better or much better after one week.\nLearn about other natural solutions for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis .\n2) Chronic Pelvic Pain\nFor a 2002 study of 32 women with chronic pelvic pain, one group of patients had active or placebo magnets applied to their abdomens for 24 hours a day. After four weeks of continuous use, those who received the active magnets reported significantly lower pain levels than at the start of the study.\n3) Fibromyalgia\nAfter six weeks of sleeping on magnetized mattress pads, 13 women with fibromyalgia reported significantly less pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and next-day tiredness. A control group of 12 women (who slept on non-magnetized mattresses) had smaller improvements in pain, sleep, fatigue, and tiredness. The study's authors note that improvements in both groups might have been due to use of a better mattress pad.\nMore Science on Magnetic Therapy\nThere is also evidence that magnetic therapy may help reduce neck pain, post-polio pain, and diabetic foot pain. But in studies on the use of magnetic therapy for relief of chronic low back pain and wrist pain related to carpal tunnel syndrome , researchers found magnets no more effective than placebo treatments.\nMagnetic therapy may show promise in the treatment of female urinary continence, however: In a 2004 study of 24 patients, 58% of participants showed improvement after eight weeks of receiving twice-weekly magnetic stimulation of the pelvic floor.\nCautions\nIf you're undergoing radiology, it's important to avoid the use of magnetic devices. Pregnant women and people with cardiac pacemakers should also forego magnetic therapy.\nIn addition, it's important to consult a healthcare professional about the condition you're seeking to alleviate through magnetic therapy, rather than letting a potential serious health problem go untreated.\nSources:\nBrown CS, Ling FW, Wan JY, Pilla AA. \"Efficacy of static magnetic field therapy in chronic pelvic pain: a double-blind pilot study.\" American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology 2002 187(6):1581-7.\nChandi DD, Groenendijk PM, Venema PL. \"Functional extracorporeal magnetic stimulation as a treatment for female urinary incontinence: 'the chair'.\" BJU International 2004;93(4):539-42.\nColbert AP, et al. \"Magnetic mattress pad use in patients with fibromyalgia: a randomized double-blind pilot study.\" Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation 1999;13:19-31.\nSegal NA, Toda Y, Huston J, Saeki Y, Shimizu M, Fuchs H, Shimaoka Y, Holcomb R, McLean MJ. \"Two configurations of static magnetic fields for treating rheumatoid arthritis of the knee: a double-blind clinical trial.\" Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 2001 82(10):1453-60.\nTim Harlow, Colin Greaves, Adrian White, Liz Brown, Anna Hart, Edzard Ernst. \"Randomised controlled trial of magnetic bracelets for relieving pain in osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.\" British Medical Journal 2004;329:1450-1454.\nRelated Articles\n"}, {"score": 2594.688, "uuid": "0ed8f718-015b-5fd2-bc74-b06e2b2a88ed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1509wb-07-18189", "target_hostname": "www.back2action.com", "target_uri": "http://www.back2action.com/meet-the-staff/", "page_rank": 1.5086863e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Back</em> to Action - <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "We enjoy all types of outdoor activities that Colorado <em>is</em> famous <em>for</em>, watching my sons play lacrosse and baseball, and searching <em>for</em> the best dog parks and hiking spots <em>for</em> our 3 dogs.

These are tiny glue-like bonds that form in the support structures of the pelvis, back, and hip after a surgery, fall, accident, or other tissue damage. Adhesions can bind together like nylon ropes and pull the structures of the back or hip out of proper alignment. Clear Passage Physical TherapySM has had more than two decades of success decreasing the adhesions that cause chronic hip or back pain. All treatment is without surgery or drugs.\nChronic back pain treatment\nChronic back and hip pain can affect all aspects of a person\u2019s life as well as the lives of families and friends. Back and hip pain that has persisted for more than three months is considered chronic. Symptoms may include back or leg pain when standing, walking or sitting, and prolonged morning stiffness. Some people report concurrent sacroiliac or tailbone pain.\nClear Passage Physical Therapy was born as a chronic pain clinic. For several years, 60% of our patients were low back pain patients who had failed to find relief elsewhere. Over the last two decades, we have become experts at treating chronic back pain. Many of our patients have been searching for relief for years before they find us. For most chronic back pain patients, the search for pain relief ends with good or total resolution at one of our clinics.\nTreatment methods vary considerably. Many people do not obtain pain resolution after conservative treatment such as traditional physical therapy or medications. Chiropractic care may help temporarily, but unless we treat the strong, underlying adhesions that pull bony structures out of balance, pain resolution does not occur.\nVIDEO: Watch a patient share her experience with treatment for chronic pain wih the Wurn Technique\u00ae\nMost physicians agree that surgery is a treatment of last resort. While surgery can address adhesions and other mechanical problems, surgery also causes more adhesions to form. We suspect that new adhesion formation is one reason that some people do not obtain lasting pain relief after one or more surgeries. In fact, some people find their pain worsens after surgery.\nTwo important elements in low back pain are biomechanical and soft tissue dysfunctions of the sacral joints. The sacrum is the body\u2019s center of gravity and stability, simultaneously negotiating forces transferred from above and below it. A complex series of ligaments attach the sacrum to the two large pelvic bones (the ilia), at the sacroiliac joints. In doing so, they help provide a stable transition between the upper and lower body. The sacrum also forms a joint with the fifth lumbar vertebra, the lumbosacral junction, at the base of the spine.\nThe sacroiliac joints contribute significantly to the stability of the low back, and the lumbosacral junction contributes greatly to low back mobility. Together, these joints and their support ligaments support the entire body above the pelvis. They represent significant structural and functional units when we walk, bend, lift, twist, or perform most activities of daily living.\nWe find a very high correlation among dysfunctions of the sacroiliac joints, the lumbosacral junction, and low back pain.\nHip Pain and Dysfunction Treatment\nPosterior view of the lower back, with support ligaments\nImproper pelvic balance can cause chronic back pain\nChronic sciatic, sacroiliac, and hip pain can affect all aspects of a person\u2019s life as well as the lives of families and friends.

A complex series of ligaments attach the sacrum to the two large pelvic bones (the ilia) at the sacroiliac joints. In doing so, they help provide a stable transition between the upper and lower body.

Together, these joints and their support ligaments support the entire body above the pelvis. Their function is vital with every step we take, as we transition our upper body weight from side to side. In fact, they represent significant structural and functional units when we walk, bend, lift, twist, or perform most activities of daily living. We find a very high correlation among dysfunctions of the sacroiliac joints and pain in the sacrum, sacroiliac, or hips.\nHow structures are pulled out of balance\nAll of these structural elements are held together by collagenous soft tissues, such as fascia and ligaments. Collagen is extremely strong, with a tensile strength that has been measured at nearly 2,000 pounds per square inch. When bones and ligaments are in balance, we generally function well, without pain. Yet, if the pelvis, sacrum, and low back are out of alignment, adhesions can form, pulling these structural elements out of their normal balance. When this happens, instability and pain are the near-inevitable result.\nTrauma, injury, surgery, or even years of poor posture can cause the body to create additional collagen as a response to inflammation. This new collagen forms glue-like adhesions, binding structures that should be mobile. Once the inflammation has passed, these collagenous adhesions remain in the body as a permanent by-product of healing.\nClear Passage therapists are experts at decreasing and freeing the excess collagen fibers and adhesions that form during the healing process. This has been the focus of our work for most of the last two decades. As we decrease the collagenous bonds pulling your pelvis and low back out of alignment, mobility returns and pain generally decreases significantly. Freed of the glue-like adhesions, most patients find that they can move as they did years ago, before they had pain.\nOur goal is to decrease your pain first, then restore your function. As pain begins to resolve, we work to restore alignment, balance, and mobility to the low back, sacrum, sciatic, and hip areas. As symptoms begin to resolve, we realign these structures with your legs (below) and your trunk (above) to allow your body to become more balanced, symmetrical, and functional.

The modern chiropractor has considerable expertise with <em>backs</em>, muscles, and bones.", "explanation": null, "document": "Chiropractic Therapy\nWhat is chiropractic?\nChiropractic, that is, treatment that uses the hands to manipulate the body, remains one of the most widely used forms of manual medicine. (The word \"chiropractic\" comes from Greek roots meaning \"done by hand.\") Although it was formally introduced in 1895, chiropractic, along with osteopathy, follows the tradition of hands-on manipulation that dates back to ancient systems of treatment in China, India, and Egypt. Originally, chiropractic therapy focused entirely on the spine and on the notion that minor slippages (called subluxations) of vertebrae would pinch spinal nerves and lead to a variety of diseases. Although this concept is now considered incomplete and somewhat obsolete, today's chiropractors still concentrate on spinal manipulation as a means of relieving pain, including chronic low back pain, neck pain, tension headaches and, sometimes, pain in the knees, shoulders and elbows.\nWhat is chiropractic therapy used for?\nBack pain ranks among the most common problems that bring people to chiropractors. In fact, according to Michael Menke, a chiropractor who works with the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, one out of every three people who suffers from low back pain seeks chiropractic care, making it the most utilized healthcare practice outside of conventional medicine.\nChiropractic spinal manipulation has now had about three decades of very active research, and hundreds of studies have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals examining its clinical usefulness. Spinal manipulation has been found to be effective in the treatment of low back pain (particularly chronic pain), neck pain, muscle tension headaches, and several other conditions. Performed properly, it can relieve musculoskeletal discomfort as well as improve the circulation of blood.\nThere are also uncontrolled case reports of successful chiropractic treatment for middle ear infections, bedwetting and asthma. To date, these reports have not been critically examined. The persistence of these stories among chiropractic clinicians suggests that occasionally patients with these conditions receive benefit from chiropractic intervention, though each patient must be examined on a case-by-case basis. More research and clinical trials are needed to confirm which of these conditions respond favorably to chiropractic management.\nWhat should one expect on a visit to a chiropractor?\nThere are, in fact, many forms of chiropractic manipulation. All of them focus on correcting structural misalignments in the body to alleviate discomfort. Upon entering a chiropractic office, you may immediately be seen by the practitioner, or you may first be seen by a massage therapist, physical therapist or trainer. Health care practitioners who work with chiropractors will often perform soft-tissue mobilization techniques such as massage or trigger point therapy in addition to using other techniques like ultrasound and laser-guided therapy, applying ice or heat to areas of discomfort or using traction.\nWhen receiving a chiropractic manipulation, patients typically will lie or sit on a table that can be configured in various positions allowing the practitioner to access different parts of the body. The method most used and typically associated with chiropractors is known as the \"dynamic thrust\" method: a low speed, high force movement (often accompanied by a popping or cracking sound) used to adjust and realign the vertebrae. This technique may cause a feeling of anxiety followed by relief and contentment; however, in some individuals it can cause discomfort and, rarely, injury.\nAdditionally, there are low-force, high-speed chiropractic techniques available that can yield positive results. One of these is known as the Activator method. Practitioners trained in this modality use a handheld device incorporating a tension spring and plunger that produces a pulse of low force at high speed.\nChiropractic sessions using this technique are safer and less painful than those employing dynamic thrust manipulations. Because the head is kept in a neutral position, rather than turned or twisted, there is minimal risk of injury. This method is also quick - typically, a patient can be assessed and treated in less than 15 minutes. As with other chiropractic techniques, there may be immediate pain relief, but best results often come from several adjustments over a period of two weeks or more.\nAre there any side effects or indications where chiropractic therapy should be avoided?\nChiropractic therapy is not recommended for people with serious bone problems, such as osteoporosis , bone or joint infections, bone cancer, acute rheumatoid arthritis and diseases of the spinal cord or bone marrow. The rare complications that have been reported from chiropractic care have primarily occurred from the traditional high pressure, low speed manipulation. Other chiropractic methods, such as the Activator Method, utilize techniques that may be more appropriate for children and the elderly.\nIs there a governing body that oversees or credentials practioners in chiropractic therapy?\nThe modern chiropractor has considerable expertise with backs, muscles, and bones. But chiropractors are also trained to recognize other general health care problems, to give general health advice, and refer you to medical physicians when appropriate. The typical chiropractic curriculum takes about four and one-half years at a licensed chiropractic school, after completing required undergraduate college pre-requisites. It includes many of the same courses that medical students are required to attend. The medical and chiropractic professions differ in their respective requirements for completing residencies and specialty training.\nThere are state statutes that govern chiropractic therapy. Each state has a Board of Chiropractic Examiners. In order to practice chiropractic, one must pass a board certification process specific to the state in which he or she will be practicing. Governmental health care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Federal and State Worker's Compensation programs all recognize chiropractic and compensate for treatment. Federal student loan assistance is also available to students of chiropractic.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) has taken a leading role in examining chiropractic and other \"alternative medicines\" through its National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (then named the Office of Alternative Medicine) in 1992. It continues to fund studies and review clinical outcomes.\nHow does one find a chiropractor?\nTo find a good chiropractor, ask for recommendations from friends, family members or from your primary care physician. Make sure any practitioner you choose has a degree from an accredited four-year chiropractic college. Avoid anyone who tries to lock you into long-term treatment or asks you to sign a contract. You can also look for chiropractors in your area via the American Chiropractic Association, the International Chiropractors Association, or by locating a specially trained Activator Methods Chiropractor.\nAre there other therapies that might work well in conjunction with chiropractic therapy?\nMassage therapy that focuses on eliminating muscle spasm and trigger points - areas of irritability in the muscle that may feel like lumps or knots - can be a useful adjunct with chiropractic therapy, and is sometimes used in a chiropractor's office prior to treatment. This technique applies concentrated pressure to trigger points that are often painful and can sometimes lead to referred pain in other parts of the body. Application of sufficient pressure to these areas for a long enough period of time (usually 45-60 seconds) can allow these tight places in the muscles to relax with subsequent improvement in pain and muscle tightness. Stretching techniques and exercises at home can often help to normalize muscle anatomy and its attachment to bones. Used in conjunction with chiropractic treatment, this can allow maximum benefit from the adjustments and often help prevent recurrence of symptoms.\nWhat is Dr. Weil's view of chiropractic therapy?\nDr. Weil believes that chiropractic theory, stressing the importance of the spine on general mind and body health, and the accompanying manipulative techniques, may be of benefit in the treatment of several conditions, particularly for back and neck pain. If you haven't tried chiropractic and have chronic back or neck pain, a few sessions could prove beneficial. If treated for more than six visits, or longer than two-to-three weeks without a change in your condition or you get worse, your chiropractic treatment may not be the correct or ideal approach for your problem. You may discuss this with your chiropractor, seek the advice of another chiropractor, or try another healthcare professional. Dr. Weil also recommends avoiding or at least minimizing the routine use of X-rays by chiropractors to diagnose spinal misalignment.\nA chiropractor who looks beyond the spine can be a useful resource for restoring and preserving health. For a specific complaint, feeling better is the sign of successful treatment. Excellence in chiropractic practice includes recommending lifestyle changes, including home-based exercises, stress-reduction techniques and sound dietary advice that may include the prudent use of supplements. Treatment should leave you feeling more competent to care for yourself, and most of all, it should result in your feeling better promptly.\nThe Activator method has undergone clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy. Dr. Weil has found these low-force treatments to be reliable and safe, and recommends them to his patients, particularly for use in the pediatric population and in the elderly.\nDr. Weil's Vitamin Advisor\nReceive Your FREE Personalized Vitamin Recommendation & Supplement Plan Today!\nFree Vitamin Recommendation\nLet Dr. Weil customize a free vitamin & supplement plan for you.

It may not always be the best choice, and it may not work for everyone. But most people will get great results if the massage therapist has a good understanding of the human body, muscle imbalances, and how to work with them. A word of caution: Massage therapy should never be considered a substitute for proper medical attention.\nAs a massage therapist for the past 10 years, I have watched massage therapy grow in popularity and credibility to the point where the practice is now commonplace for those who suffer from back pain. There is no denying the positive effects massage can have on the body. Most massage therapists use a variety of techniques during a session, such as energy techniques and stretching, along with traditional massage. The Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami has coordinated over 100 studies that document the therapeutic effects of massage. One study on massage and back pain found that massage decreased back pain and depression while also improving sleep and range of motion for most joints.\nWhat to look for in a massage therapist\nAs in many other professions, there are varying degrees of training and qualifications a massage therapist can have. It is up to you to find one who is trained in techniques that actually address issues of back pain. Some of the more popular styles of massage for back pain are: orthopedic massage, medical massage, and something called St. John's Technique. It would also be a good idea to look for a massage therapist who has comprehensive knowledge of muscle imbalances relating to back pain. Good luck finding one, because they are rare.\nHow does massage therapy provide relief?\nYou probably have heard that massage improves circulation, right? But exactly what does that mean? Well, throughout our bodies we have a clear fluid that circulates around the body tissues called \u0093lymph.\u0094 At the same time, we may have inflammation, which is an immune response to injury or infection that causes pain, redness, heat, and swelling in the affected area - in our muscles, around our muscles, even in our joints. When lymph and inflammation start to accumulate in the body, the excess fluid will put pressure on blood vessels and our circulation will decrease, limiting blood flow to that area. As the pressure increases, it irritates the nerves, which will cause you to have pain. By helping the body remove excess lymph and inflammation, massage therapy can make your blood flow better, which will reduce the pressure that is irritating the nerves and get rid of your pain.\nAnd as if that were not enough, massage provides a number of other benefits: relaxing the muscles, improved range of motion, improved sleep, and increased production of endorphins, which will improve your mood. Is it any wonder you feel like a million bucks after a massage?\nIs massage all you need to get relief?\nAs helpful as it is, massage has a very limited scope and cannot fully address your condition. It's great for removing inflammation and providing relaxation, but back pain is a physical condition that requires a physical solution. Sure, a massage therapist may stretch your body a little. But that's not a substitute for identifying muscle imbalances and postural dysfunctions and then developing a very specific and very targeted action plan to correct them and restore the body's harmony.\nIf massage is part of an overall plan that includes working with a trained expert in muscle imbalances and postural dysfunctions, then you may be on to something. Unfortunately, most people don't go this route. In my opinion, the ones who do will get the best and fastest results.\nIs massage right for everyone?\nOf course not. There are a number reasons why massage might not be right for you. Please review this list as you consider massage as an option.\n1 Fever\n"}, {"score": 2540.0708, "uuid": "cbb0d94a-c30e-59d6-8469-944617bb4dd8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1712wb-45-17416", "target_hostname": "www.rebuildyourback.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rebuildyourback.com/category/physical-therapy", "page_rank": 1.5111223e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> | Rebuild Your <em>Back</em>", "snippet": "A physician should always be consulted <em>for</em> any health problem.

Many patients are seeking relief from various causes of back pain including accidents, sport injuries and muscle strains. Other complaints include pain in the neck, arms and legs, and headaches .\nWhat is chiropractic care?\nChiropractors use hands-on spinal manipulation and other complementary treatments, the theory being that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable the body to heal itself without surgery or medication . Manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event such as falling or by repetitive stress such as sitting without proper back support.\nChiropractic is primarily used as a pain relief alternative for muscles, joints, bones and connective tissue such as cartilage, ligaments and tendons. It is sometimes used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment.\nA chiropractor in the UK must take and pass a course accredited by the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) and then be registered with the GCC.\nWhat does chiropractic care for back pain involve?\nA chiropractor first records your medical history and then performs a physical examination. He or she may use lab tests or diagnostic imaging to determine if treatment is appropriate for your back pain.\nThe treatment plan may involve one or more manual adjustments in which the chiropractor manipulates the joints, using a controlled sudden force to improve range and quality of motion. Many chiropractors also incorporate nutritional counselling and exercise /rehabilitation into the treatment plan. The goals of chiropractic care include the restoration of function and prevention of injury in addition to back pain relief.\nWhat are the benefits and risks of chiropractic care?\nSpinal manipulation and chiropractic care is considered a safe effective treatment for acute lower back pain - the type of sudden injury that results from moving furniture or from a sudden jarring in sport. Acute back pain, which is more common than chronic pain, lasts no more than six weeks and typically gets better on its own.\nResearch has also shown chiropractic to be helpful in treating neck pain and headaches. Osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia also respond to the moderate pressure used by both chiropractors and practitioners of deep tissue massage.\nStudies have not confirmed the effectiveness of prolotherapy or sclerotherapy for pain relief, used by some chiropractors, osteopaths and medical doctors to treat chronic back pain - the type of pain that may come on suddenly or gradually and lasts for more than three months. The therapy involves injections to strengthen loosely connected tendons and ligaments.\nPeople who have osteoporosis, spinal cord compression or inflammatory arthritis , or who take blood-thinning medications, should not undergo spinal manipulation.\nAll treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis of your back pain. The chiropractor should be well informed regarding your medical history including ongoing medical conditions, current medications, traumatic/surgical history and lifestyle factors. Although rare, there have been cases in which treatment worsened a slipped disc, or neck manipulation resulted in a stroke or spinal cord injury. To be safe always inform your doctor whenever you use chiropractic or other pain relief alternatives.\nNext Article:\nView Article Sources\nSOURCES: WebMD A-Z Health Guide: \"Chiropractic.\" WebMD Medical News: Massage, Chiropractic Top Medical Alternatives, Alternative Medicines Rated in Consumer Reports Survey.

Blood helps heal the area by delivering extra oxygen and nutrients. Blood also removes waste byproducts from muscle spasms.\nConversely, cold therapy (also called cryotherapy) slows circulation. This reduces inflammation, muscle spasms and pain. Your physical therapist may place an ice pack on the target area, give you an ice massage, or even use a spray known as fluoromethane to cool inflamed tissues.\nHydrotherapy : As the name suggests, hydrotherapy involves water. As a passive treatment, hydrotherapy may involve simply sitting in a whirlpool bath or warm shower. Hydrotherapy gently relieves pain and relaxes muscles.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS) : A TENS machine uses an electrical current to stimulate your muscles. It sounds intense, but it really isn't painful. Electrodes taped to your skin send a tiny electrical current to key points on the nerve pathway. TENS reduces muscle spasms and is generally believed to trigger the release of endorphins, which are your body's natural pain killers.\nTraction: The goal of traction is to reduce the effects of gravity on the spine. By gently pulling apart the bones, the intent is to reduce the disc herniation. The analogy is much like a flat tire \"disappearing\" when you put a jack under the car and take pressure off the tire. It can be performed in the cervical or lumbar spine.\nActive Treatments\nActive treatments help address flexibility, posture, strength, core stability, and joint movement. An exercise program may also be prescribed to achieve optimal results. This will not only curb recurrent pain but will also benefit your overall health. Your physical therapist will work with you to develop a program based on your specific diagnosis and health history.\nCore stability: Many people don't realize how important a strong core is to their spinal health. Your core (abdominal) muscles help your back muscles support your spine. When your core muscles are weak, it puts extra pressure on your back muscles. Your physical therapist may teach you core stabilizing exercises to strengthen your back.\nFlexibility: Learning proper stretching and flexibility techniques will prepare you for aerobic and strength exercises. Flexibility helps your body move easier by warding off stiffness.\nHydrotherapy: In contrast to simply sitting in a hot tub or bath like its passive counterpart, active hydrotherapy may involve water aerobics to help condition your body without unnecessary stress.\nMuscle strengthening: Strong muscles are a great support system for your spine and better handle pain.\nYour physical therapist will teach you ways to condition and strengthen your back to help prevent future pain. Your physical therapist will teach you self-care principles so you understand how to best treat your symptoms. The ultimate goal is for you to develop the knowledge to maintain a pain-free lifestyle. It's essential that you learn how to exercise and condition your back after the formal therapy ends.

Electrodes taped to your skin send a tiny electrical current to key points on the nerve pathway. TENS is generally believed to trigger the release of endorphins, which are your body's natural pain killers.\nUltrasound: This therapy uses sound waves to create a gentle heat that increases blood circulation to your deep tissues. Ultrasound helps reduce inflammation, stiffness, and pain. This passive therapy also improves your range of motion, which will likely be limited due to your rheumatoid arthritis pain.\nActive Treatments\nExercise is the cornerstone of any rheumatoid arthritis physical therapy program. Once you complete your course of passive treatments, your physical therapist will develop an active program specifically for you.Active treatments, which include regular exercise, help address flexibility, strength, and joint movement. This will not only curb recurrent pain but will also improve your overall health and help you lose weight, if necessary. Your physical therapist will work with you to develop a program based on your specific symptoms and health history.\nWatch a slideshow of rheumatologist-approved exercises for rheumatoid arthritis .\nActive treatments include:\nMuscle flexibility and strengthening: Your range of motion will likely be restricted if you have rheumatoid arthritis. Using customized stretching and strengthening exercises, your physical therapist will help you lengthen and strengthen your muscles, and improve joint movement. Strong, lean muscles better handle pain.\nAerobic exercise: Aerobic exercises, such as walking and biking, are ideal for RA sufferers because they strengthen your spine without putting unnecessary stress on your joints. Aerobic exercises will also help you lose weight, and a few less pounds will take pressure off your tired joints.\nHydrotherapy: Water-based exercises may be recommended to provide gentle aerobic conditioning.\nYour physical therapist will teach you \"self-care\" principles so you understand how to best treat your rheumatoid arthritis pain. The ultimate goal is for you to develop the knowledge to help control your symptoms yourself, without the direct supervision of a physical therapist. It's essential that you learn the exercises and continue them after the formal therapy ends. If you keep with a fitness program, you have a much better chance of enjoying the long-term benefits of your physical therapy.\nUpdated on: 06/20/11\n"}, {"score": 2495.2678, "uuid": "45847bbf-920a-591f-bbdb-068ced9b0f65", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1717wb-40-26512", "target_hostname": "www.caremedicalcenter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.caremedicalcenter.com/AUTO_ACCIDENTS.html", "page_rank": 1.3755113e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Care Medical Center - <em>Chiropractic</em>, <em>Pain</em> Managment &amp; <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "Whether you have been in an car accident, personal injury <em>or</em> hurt on the job, calling Care Medical Center <em>is</em> a wise decision.

Minimally invasive spine procedures will typically spare most or all of these muscles so patients can recover maximal function.3 The techniques for segmental stabilization is supported by many therapists as an essential part of spine programs, especially when disc pathology has been involved, such as a herniated disc or degenerative disc disease.3\nThe two muscle groups that fire first to stabilize the spine are multifidus and tranversus abdominus. Studies have shown delayed contraction of these muscles in patients with lumbar pain .15,3 There is evidence multifidus atrophies at the level of a disc herniation.1 Most importantly, the recovery of this muscle function must be specifically retrained as it does not occur automatically when the disc pathology is resolved.2\nMany large muscle groups allow people to function in daily activities without activating spine stabilizers much, if at all. This lack of muscular support in the spine may in part account for the frequency of degenerative disease seen in the population.\nTraining of the multifidus and transverses abdominus requires concentration on the part of the patient. Biofeedback devices such as surface EMG or pressure sensing devices can be very helpful. Transversus abdominus is recruited by drawing the abdomen in, creating a pressure toward the back of lumbar spine. Patients may be instructed to do the same movement they would do as if trying to button jeans that are too small.\nThe patient also can learn to practice the motion lying on their back, creating a downward pressure with the lumbar spine, increasing the reading on a partially inflated blood pressure cuff or other pressure sensing device ( Figure 1 ). Once they are able to do this, they would try to maintain the same pressure while doing various arm and leg movements, training the muscles to maintain spinal stability during those movements.\nThey also can lie face down and practice the same function by lessening the pressure on the device; i.e. pulling the abdomen away from the cuff ( Figure 2 ). Again, once they can perform this motion, limb movements can be added to create more challenge.4,3\nThe goal of this training is to provide enough practice and repetition so the function of these muscles is automatic and will start to occur during all other activities and exercise.5,16,6\nStrength training with resistance exercises\nAfter spine stabilization training has begun, adding strength training with resistance exercises is helpful for functional movement.17,18 Specific strength training studies have shown resolution of some spine pathologies with conservative (nonsurgical) care.18\nIt is recommended the patient has spine stabilization capabilities and symptoms under control before increasing this.5 Strength training may be done earlier using \u201cdecompression\u201d strength training exercises as shown in Figure 3 .\nRebuilding Stamina through Cardiovascular Training\nBoth lack of strength and endurance have been shown to be related to incidence in low back pain. Deconditioning occurs rapidly in individual\u2019s aerobic levels when they become inactive. This often manifests itself as fatigue, which can lead to more inactivity, creating a downward spiral for many patients.\nLevel of oxygen consumption, or MET level, has been shown to be one of the closest physical predictors of successful outcome of lumbar surgery.19 This makes the patient\u2019s home walking program very important. If walking is limited by sensitivity to weight bearing or other joint problems, therapists can help the patient find a feasible alternative (e.g. pool therapy or low impact exercise equipment).\nIt is helpful to test patient\u2019s progress with MET level, which is done most simply by tracking distance with a six or twelve minute walk. Other cardiovascular testing and training procedures are covered, with evidence included in the American College of Sports Medicine manual on testing.20\nRegaining Mobility and Flexibility\nAt times, patients who have leg pain ( sciatica ) from a herniated disc will have excessive tension along the sciatic nerve down the back of the leg. Overcoming this tension with specific gentle stretching and/or soft tissue mobilization is starting to be recognized as an important rehabilitation component.21\nVideos\nWorking on the mobility of various joint areas that a given nerve pathway may cross can be helpful for restoring full excursion of that pathway. For example; with typical sciatica, there is often significant tightness in calf muscles, hamstrings and hip rotators. The individual joint areas of the ankle, knee and hip can be worked individually, then added together to minimize tension produced in surrounding structures. The neural structures can have more capability to move with normal function.\nEven when a surgery is minimally invasive and has produced immediate pain relief for the patient, a concerted effort at re-conditioning through physical therapy is still an important aspect of the patient\u2019s recovery. Improving strength, flexibility and aerobic conditioning will prevent or at least minimize the chances of any recurrent back or leg pain .\nMore Resources in the Exercise Center\nArticle written by:\n"}, {"score": 2388.5037, "uuid": "6236007c-5c4f-5852-a7ed-433872c3362e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-54-04940", "target_hostname": "www.clearpassage.com", "target_uri": "http://www.clearpassage.com/pain/coccyx-tailbone.php", "page_rank": 1.4551967e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Tailbone <em>Pain</em> - Coccyx <em>Pain</em> - Clear Passage <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "Faculty: Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine &quot;The Wurn Technique\u00ae <em>is</em> a breakthrough <em>for</em> physicians and women who have known <em>for</em> so long that there was something <em>better</em> out there <em>for</em> treatment of chronic <em>pain</em>.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "Home Chronic Pain Tailbone Pain\nRelieve Your Tailbone Pain - No Drugs or Surgery\nOur clinics have successfully treated most cases of chronic tailbone pain (coccydynia or coccygodynia) for over twenty years. This delicate area of the body may be subjected to repeat traumas through life from falls and chronic seated postures. Pelvic surgery, as well as physical and sexual abuse, are other causes of tailbone pain. When the body heals, the ligaments that attach to the tailbone may become adhered, causing recurring symptoms that range from uncomfortable to totally debilitating. Clear Passage Physical Therapy\u00ae has over two decades of experience evaluating and successfully treating tailbone pain (coccyx pain), without drugs or surgery.\nLigaments of the pelvis, sacrum, and coccyx can all have a profound effect on tailbone pain.\nTailbone pain can affect all aspects of a person\u2019s life as well as the lives of families and friends. Tailbone pain that has persisted for more than three months is considered chronic. Symptoms may include difficulty with sitting, painful intercourse (for women), constipation, and even severe headaches. Some people report concurrent low back .\nA fall, surgery, or accident can move the tailbone out of its normal place, causing constipation, tailbone, or low back pain.\nIn all of these situations, the coccyx may be pushed into an awkward angle. The result may be moderate to debilitating tailbone pain, often spreading into the low back, hip, or neighboring structures. Reproductive function can also be affected by this mechanism. Examples of problems can include inability to have an orgasm or difficulty maintaining an erection, decreased libido, and\u00a0 infertility.\nClear Passage Physical Therapy has successfully treated tailbone pain (coccydynia or coccygodynia) since 1989. Over the last two decades, we have become experts at treating this \u00a0condition. Most of our tailbone pain patients have searched for years to find relief, before finding us. For most of them, the search for pain relief ends with good or total resolution at one of our clinics.\nFew clinics or physicians offer treatment for tailbone pain,\u00a0other than medications to mask the pain. Chiropractic care may help temporarily, but unless we treat the strong, underlying adhesions that pull bony structures out of balance, pain resolution does not occur.\nMost physicians agree that surgery\u00a0is a treatment of last resort. While surgery can address adhesions and other mechanical problems, surgery also causes more adhesions to form. One surgical option includes removing part of the tailbone. This has brought relief for some; for others, it has brought a lifetime of debilitating pain.\nDoctors comment on the Wurn Technique\u00ae\nand the book Miracle Moms, Better Sex, Less Pain\n\"The Wurn Technique\u00ae makes sense: to put 'hands on' the problem and nurture the body's innate desire to heal.\"\nDr. Leslie Mendoza Temple, Medical Director, Integrative Medicine\nFaculty: Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine\n\"The Wurn Technique\u00ae is a breakthrough for physicians and women who have known for so long that there was something better out there for treatment of chronic pain.\"\nDr. Scott Miles, Gynecologist, Medical Director\nMiles Ahead Health and Wellness, Indianapolis, IN\n\"The Wurn's work is exciting, exhilarating, ground breaking, and amazing.\"\nDr. Scott Miles, Gynecologist, Medical Director\nMiles Ahead Health and Wellness, Indianapolis, IN\n"}, {"score": 2387.731, "uuid": "7ff3950a-b442-507d-a363-670b19617f2d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-02-08810", "target_hostname": "www.myfortworthchiropractor.net", "target_uri": "http://www.myfortworthchiropractor.net/index.php?p=140423&hideBanner", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Fort Worth|<em>Therapy</em> Center Fort Worth", "snippet": "One thing you need to know <em>is</em> <em>Chiropractic</em> gets you inline helps you feel <em>better</em> but stabilizing the muscles around the spine and extremities <em>is</em> paramount at our office.

Click Here Now\n7 key benefits of inversion for the back pain sufferer\nWhile relieving your back pain is your primary reason for considering inversion therapy, there are a number of additional benefits many people experience with a regular program of inversion. Here are 7 good reasons to use inversion therapy:\nMaintains your height. Regularly inverting will help you avoid the \u201cshrinkage\u201d that naturally occurs as a result of gravity over a lifetime.\nImproves circulation. When you\u2019re inverted, your blood circulation is aided by gravity rather than having to work against it. In addition, with inversion, gravity helps the lymphatic system clear faster, easing the aches and pains of stiff muscles.\nRelieves stress. Everyone knows that a full-body stretch is rejuvenating! An inversion table provides the same feeling of relaxation as a yoga class \u2013 with a lot less effort. Many people find that they sleep better with regular inversion therapy.\nHeightens mental alertness. Any upside-down activity increases the supply of oxygen to the brain, which many experts believe helps maintain mental sharpness.\nIncreases flexibility and range of motion. With inversion, your joints stay healthy and supple, meaning you can remain as active as you were in your younger years.\nImproves posture. The stretching that comes with reversing the force of gravity on your body helps you sit, stand, and move with more ease and grace.\nRealigns the spine after workouts. Running and other aerobic activities inevitably compress your spine \u2013 often unevenly. One-sided activities such as golf or tennis often pull the spine out of alignment. During inversion, minor misalignments often correct themselves naturally.\n5 ultra-challenging activities you can do on an inversion table\nIf the 7 hidden benefits were not enough to make you want to consider using inversion, here are 5 exercises you can do at every session:\nInverted Squats. In the full inverted position, you can use your glutes and hamstrings to pull yourself up; the motion would be simply trying to bend your legs at your knees. Because the inverted squat is very challenging and isolates the glutes and hamstrings, most back pain sufferers first need to strengthen their glutes and hamstrings.\nInverted Crunch. In the full inverted position, place your hands on your chest and use your abs to lift your upper body about one-third of the way up.\nInverted sit-up. In the full inverted position, extend your arms as if you were reaching for your feet and try to touch your feet; some experts say that one inverted sit-up is equivalent to 10 regular sit-ups.\nIncrease the decompression. In the full inverted position, grab the table legs and pull down; this way you can increase and control the amount of decompression if you want or need more.\nInverted Rotation. In the full inverted position, reach with the opposite hand to the table legs and pull yourself into rotation; you can then switch hands and do the same for the opposite side.\nHow to get started\nLet\u2019s take a look at what a back pain sufferer will go through in a typical session. First, you do not need to go into full inversion to get the benefits. (Note: It will take time before you will be able to tolerate full inversion.) Here is a simple guide for beginners:\nFirst 2 Weeks: Adjust the table to go to 20-30 degrees for 1 to 2 minutes, once or twice a day. Slowly increase your time until you become comfortable with the process and the position. The best way to tell if you\u2019re getting used to the inversion table is whether or not you can relax while you\u2019re using it.\nPartial Inversion after 2 weeks: This is considered anything up to 60 degrees, which is parallel with the rear legs of the table. See if you can work your way up to 15 minutes, once or twice a day. There are two basic ways to invert:\nStatic inversion: This is when you hold yourself at the desired angle and do not move from that position.\nIntermittent Inversion: This involves using a rocking motion, alternating 20 to 30 seconds in the inverted position and 20 to 30 seconds in the upright position. Some people believe that it is the pumping action that delivers the best results. You will have to experiment to see which way is most comfortable and works best for you.\nFull Inversion after 2 weeks: This is when your body is completely upside down and hanging freely. Full inversion is the position you need to be in to do the 5 ultra exercises listed above. The amount of time you spend is up to you, but 5 to 15 minutes twice a day is recommended. The amount of time it takes for you to tolerate full inversion will depend on your ability to accommodate to the position; everyone is different so go slow.\nOne last safety tip\nWhile inversion has been proven to be beneficial, it is best to start slow \u2013 that is, at a low angle for short amounts of time. Going straight into full inversion will make you sore. So please resist the temptation to go into full inversion day one.\nOne last success tip\nBe patient and consistent with its use, the inversion table is a device that can be used for a lifetime to support optimal health. So make a habit of using it on a consistent basis, the research supports the use and your body will reap the benefits.\nWARNING!!!

We include a thorough evaluation of the biomechanics of headache symptoms. We look beyond the cranium and evaluate tightness and asymmetry at the neck, shoulders, back and even tailbone \u2013 important, often overlooked areas in recurring headaches. Clear Passage Physical TherapySM has over two decades of experience discovering and eliminating the causes of chronic or recurring headache pain, without drugs.\nNearly 45 million people in the United States live with chronic headaches. About seven million report debilitating headaches that last for hours at a time, at least every two days. It is estimated that 157 million workdays are lost due to headaches and two billion dollars are spent on over-the-counter painkillers to treat headache symptoms each year. Yet most headache sufferers are not content to merely treat symptoms; they want to treat the cause of the pain that takes so much quality from their lives. In short, they want a permanent solution to their pain.\nAt Clear Passage Physical Therapy, we have been very successful treating chronic and recurring headaches. Many of our patients have been searching for relief for years before they find us. Some have several physicians, but still find themselves in the emergency room often, due to recurring, debilitating headaches. For most patients suffering from chronic headaches, the search for relief ends with good to total resolution at one of our clinics.\nTreatment methods vary considerably, and many people do not obtain pain resolution after conservative treatment such as traditional physical therapy or medications. Chiropractic care may help for a while, but unless we address the strong, underlying adhesions that pull the cranial structures out of balance, resolution of chronic headache pain does not occur. Injections such as nerve blocks may address the symptoms, but do little to treat the cause of the headaches. Surgery for headaches is extremely rare, and considered a treatment of last resort.\nThe primary goal of our manual therapy ( Wurn Technique\u00ae )\u00a0is to increase mobility and decrease pain. We are highly skilled in using our hands to palpate tightened areas of the head, neck, and back until the tensions release. This appears to reduce adhesions, decrease pain, and improve mobility. For more detailed information on how treatment works and how it feels, see \u201c treatment philosophy ,\u201d \u201c what we believe,\u201d and \u201cwhat treatment is like.\u201d\nHow headaches become chronic\nWhile some headaches are caused by medical conditions such as hormonal or endocrine imbalances, we find that most recurring headaches are caused or exacerbated by mechanical factors. These include muscle tension of the facial, cranial, neck, and chewing muscles and restricted cranial bone mobility. Muscles in spasm may impair circulation within the head and neck, due to their pressure on blood vessels, causing pain. Compression of blood vessels at the base of the skull can cause headaches as blood flow is slowed from leaving the enclosed skull. Any of these conditions may be exacerbated by poor or chronic work postures. Adhesions caused by inflammation at the head, neck, or related structures can be a direct cause of headaches, as strong glue-like bonds pull on pain sensitive structures within the head.\nPatients with mechanical headache pain often report that they feel a place in their head or neck \u201cwhere the headache starts, or resides.\u201d We generally find this patient feedback to be accurate and important. It helps us examine the mechanical forces that cause or impact chronic headaches, and relieve them with unique hands-on techniques, without surgery or drugs.\nBiomechanics of the head and neck\nMuscles in the neck and base of the skull tend to become thickened by adhesions, as we age\nThe head is comprised of 28 bones that articulate with each other, much like continental shelves on the earth\u2019s surface. Some bones define the surface of our skull, while others go deep into our head where they articulate with other cranial bones, connective tissue, the brain itself and various glands (pituitary, hypothalamus, etc.). The central nervous system lies within the tree-trunk shaped structure (spinal cord) which connects most of the major nerves of our body to our brain. This entire structure is surrounded by strong connective tissues which act as protector and shock absorber, as our spinal cord joins and infuses with the tissues of the brain. From the brain, the spinal cord and its protective fascial sleeve travels down through the vertebrae to its anchor at the coccyx.\nThus, the head is composed of remarkable and complex pain-sensitive structures, all surrounded and infused with very strong connective tissues called fascia. Our body\u2019s fascia is actually a continuous weave, a very strong three-dimensional \u2018sweater\u2019 that runs from the top of our head through our neck, shoulders, back, and down to our feet.\nThe head rests at the top of the spine within this strong fascial sweater. Restricted tissues below the head may create unusual pressures on the structures of our head and neck, causing or perpetuating headaches. Restrictions anywhere in the fascial sweater that surrounds and infuses our brain (and the other structures of our body) can create a straight-jacket effect, squeezing pain-sensitive structures within our neck and head, causing headaches.\nFor this reason, we take a full-body approach when evaluating chronic headaches. In doing so, we find that headaches often accompany the stooped, forward head posture common to certain professions, such as dentists, hairdressers, and people who work in front of computers.\nIn essence, the head must adapt its position in space\u00a0according to the position of the much larger structures below it \u2013 the spine, back, and pelvis. Thus chronic or recurring headaches are frequently the result of sustained muscle contraction, compensatory postures, and fascial pulls or joint restrictions further down the body. For this reason, cranial imbalances may occur from structural imbalance in the pelvis, sacrum, lumbosacral junction, or base of the skull. We find a major contributory factor to headaches to be mechanical and soft tissue dysfunction of the mid-back, where thick, tight mid-back muscles create a strong pull at the base of the skull and into the head.\nFurther down the spine, we find that dysfunctions of the sacral joints (in the pelvis) and surrounding musculature and fascia (connective tissue) may also contribute to chronic headaches. Strong connections from the low and mid-back can pull through the neck to the base of the skull, causing or perpetuating headaches. Unless these tissues are freed from their patterns of spasm and myofascial adhesions, the headaches will continue, and eventually worsen.\nStrong attachments of the spinal cord to the tailbone (coccyx) can cause a significant pull up the spinal cord to its attachment at the base of the skull. Thus, when a person falls onto her/his tailbone, or has a physical trauma there (auto accident, physical or sexual abuse) the tailbone can be pushed forward. When that happens, the spinal cord is pulled down sharply, often creating a strong pull on its next attachment at the base of the skull, causing headaches.\nClear Passage therapists are experts\u00a0at balancing and freeing the mechanical forces which cause and perpetuate headaches. As we decrease the restricted tissues within your head, neck, back and pelvis, mobility returns and pain generally decreases significantly. Freed of the glue-like adhesions, most patients find their cycle of recurring headaches to be significantly improved or completely eliminated after therapy. As pain begins to resolve, we work to restore alignment, balance, and mobility to the entire body, so that headaches do not return.

For patients with an acute injury or condition, Anodyne\u00ae Therapy helps to decrease pain, reduce stiffness and muscle spasm and increase circulation directly to the affected area of your body. Some chronic diseases and conditions can limit blood flow to the tiny vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the nerves in your peripherals - arms, hands, legs, and feet - resulting in pain. Anodyne\u00ae Therapy treatments increase circulation by dilating these vessels, which indirectly reduces pain caused by lack of blood flow.\n51% of Anodyne Therapy patients reduced or eliminated their use of pain medications.5\nWill the pain stay away?\nIf you have an acute or temporary problem, more than likely, you will not require ongoing treatments. If you have a chronic condition causing your pain or circulatory problem, clinical treatment with Anodyne\u00ae Therapy will not be a cure, but rather a an ongoing treatment for your condition.

Anodyne\u00ae Therapy is an Infrared Light Therapy device that can be applied to any area of the body and is indicated for temporarily increasing circulation and reducing pain, stiffness and muscle spasm. Healthcare Providers that add Anodyne\u00ae Therapy to their treatment programs can better address the source of many types of acute and chronic pain, instead of just treating the symptoms.\nWhat might you experience during treatment?\nTypically, patients will receive treatments with an Anodyne\u00ae Therapy System in conjunction with a therapy plan of care. It is important not to discontinue your treatment plan until you are discharged or have spoken with your therapist. There are no known side effects of Anodyne\u00ae Therapy, however, please be aware of the following points:\nPatients normally feel a soothing warmth. If the Pads feel too warm, tell your Anodyne\u00ae Provider right away so the intensity can be adjusted.\nYour skin in the treatment area may be slightly pink after treatment. This is a sign of increased circulation and should disappear within a few hours. If this persists longer than a few hours, notify your Anodyne\u00ae Provider at your next session.\nYou may feel some tingling or minor pain at first. Again, this is a sign of increased circulation. Your Anodyne\u00ae Provider can adjust their protocol. If these feelings do not go away within a few weeks, talk to your Anodyne\u00ae Provider.\nIf you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugars regularly, as you are likely beginning a new exercise program. Please note, the use of Anodyne\u00ae Therapy alone does not cause hypoglycemia.\nYou may need a home system to STAY better.\nIf you experience relief with Anodyne\u00ae Therapy, and you have an acute injury or problem, more than likely, you will not require ongoing treatments. If you have a chronic condition causing your pain or circulatory problem, clinical treatment with Anodyne\u00ae Therapy will not be a cure, but rather a drug-free treatment for your condition.\nAffordable Anodyne\u00ae home systems are available for continuing pain relief in the privacy and comfort of your home.

Patient Satisfaction Survey\nLaser Therapy\nHigh Power Laser Therapy has already helped thousands of people get long-term relief without drugs, needles, side effects, pain or surgery. In clinical studies patients receiving Laser Therapy have experienced a significant reduction in pain. There have been world-wide research efforts undertaken to better understand the many therapeutic benefits of Laser Therapy. In fact, a recent review of over 2500 articles in the medical literature indicated that many acute and chronic conditions may be improved or eliminated with therapeutic lasers.\nLaser Light Therapy is used by St. Tereiza Physical Therapy as an effective treatment for numerous acute and chronic pain. The application of light therapy is used for soft tissue repair and regeneration. Low level lasers send cold light through skin layers to soft tissue cells to stimulate blood flow and cell metabolism. The laser light directs biostimulative energy to the body's injured cells in a specific location where the cells transform this energy into chemical energy promoting natural healing and pain relief through tissue repair.\nSt. Tereiza Physical Therapy has had great success at treating all of the previously mentioned pains. Laser Light Therapy has shown promising results and only takes a couple sessions to feel the difference!\nWhat is Laser or Light Therapy?\nLow-level and LED therapy or \"photobiomodulation\" is the use of specific wavelengths of light (red and near infrared) to create therapeutic effects. These effects include improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling.

This article talks about the variety of non-medication treatments available for people with back pain. Contact PhysioFit for an assessment and specific treatment plan for your low back pain.\nThere are a wide variety of treatment options available for the patient with low back pain that don't rely on medications. There's spinal manipulation, acupuncture, massage, nerve stimulation, biofeedback, yoga, behavioral counseling, lumbar supports, and much, much more. This article is designed to assist physicians and patients in understanding what's out there and how and when to use it.\nIt's clear that most low back pain is not life-threatening. It might hurt but it won't harm you. It is called self-limiting because it goes away after a few days to weeks. The diagnosis is often nonspecific mechanical low back pain. That's a fancy way of saying, we don't really know exactly what's causing the problem. We just know it isn't a fracture, infection, tumor, or other serious pathologic process.\nSpecific treatment beyond staying active and modifying activities (don't do things that make it hurt!) isn't really needed. More and more research is pointing to depression as a major factor. But whether back pain is a symptom of depression or depression develops after back pain becomes chronic is still undecided.\nWhen back pain persists beyond a couple of weeks up to a month further testing can be done to make sure there isn't something else going on. When testing has ruled out any serious underlying pathology, then what? Should the patient try chiropractic care? Physical Therapy? A massage? Maybe acupuncture?\nWell, this is where the evidence is lacking to help us direct and guide patients. Studies show that manipulation performed by a chiropractor or Physical Therapist can be helpful for acute low back pain. Massage and acupuncture also seem to have some benefit in terms of enhancing healing. Long-term effects are not as likely (i.e., these techniques don't prevent future episodes of back pain).\nPhysical Therapists can often identify problems with posture, movement, and alignment that may contribute to the development and recurrence of low back pain. An individually designed rehab program can help restore spinal alignment, normal muscle function, and motor coordination. Many therapists combine traditional approaches with other physical modalities such as yoga, Pilates, and/or relaxation techniques to aid in recovery and then maintain spinal health.\nWhat about those folks who just don't seem to get better no matter what they try? When that happens, it's time to go back to the drawing board. Physicians are encouraged to review the case for anything that might be missing. Taking a closer look at the patient's personal goals, activity limitations, work issues, attitudes, and beliefs might help pinpoint the next step.\nSometimes behavioral or psychologic help is needed. Catastrophizing or dramatizing life events (including pain) can lead to more intense pain that doesn't go away. Behavioral specialists are trained to help people literally change their minds -- change the way they think because these maladaptive thoughts are contributing to the persistence in painful symptoms.\nPeople who start avoiding certain movements or stop moving to avoid any chance the pain will start up again are experiencing something called fear avoidance behaviors. That's another dimension to chronic back pain that must be addressed. Behavioral specialists working with Physical Therapists can help patients overcome this trigger for back pain.\nWhen low back pain becomes chronic and many of these nonpharmacologic (without medication) techniques are tried but fail, then a team of specialists combine various approaches to create a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Medications for pain control and antidepressants may be used. A program of intense, graded activity and exercise supervised by a Physical Therapist is supported by behavioral counseling to help patients prepare mentally to cope with their pain and the intensity of the program.\nThere isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to low back pain. But evidence from studies so far support clinical practice guidelines such as were outlined in this overview article focusing on nonpharmacologic treatment approaches. Patients must work with their physicians to find the program that works best for them and stick with it. When one approach doesn't seem to fit the bill, then it may be time to try another or to combine several methods together.\nPatients need to be advised that acute low back pain is often self-limiting. Give it time and stay active. Rest may help in the first couple of days, but don't stay in bed. When acute pain doesn't go away with this approach and chronic pain develops instead, expect to work hard to overcome this problem.\nA cure doesn't always take place. At that point, it becomes a matter of pain management. But patients can function and even regain a measure of quality of life when pain persists. Don't give in and don't give up. There are many alternative approaches that can help you stay active at home and at work -- despite the pain.\nReference: Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH. Nonpharmacological Treatment for Low Back Pain.

Add to this improper sitting, lifting, or reaching\u2014and the normal wear and tear of working and playing\u2014and you have the perfect recipe for back pain. That\u2019s why back pain is the 2nd most common reason for visits to the doctor\u2019s office, outnumbered only by upper-respiratory infections. In fact, some experts say, as many as 80% of us will experience a back\u00a0problem at some time in our lives.\nBack injuries are a part of everyday life. They can cause a sharp pain or a dull ache and can be accompanied by a tingling, numbness, or burning sensation. You may also feel weakness, pain, or tingling in your pelvis and upper leg\u2014a condition known as sciatica. The spine is quite good at dealing with back injuries. Minor injuries usually heal within a day or two. Some pain, however, continues. What makes it last longer is not entirely understood, but researchers suspect that stress, mood changes, and the fear of further injury may prevent patients from being active and exacerbate the pain.\nTips for Back Pain Prevention:\nMaintain a healthy diet and weight.\nRemain active\u2014under the supervision of your doctor of chiropractic.\nAvoid prolonged inactivity or bed rest.\nWarm up or stretch before exercising or other physical activities, such as gardening.\nMaintain proper posture.\nWear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.\nSleep on a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curve in your spine.\nLift with your knees, keep the object close to your body, and do not twist when lifting.\nQuit smoking. Smoking impairs blood flow, resulting in oxygen and nutrient deprivation to spinal tissues.\nWork with your doctor of chiropractic to ensure that your workstation is ergonomically correct.\nChiropractic Treatment for Back Pain\nIf you experience back pain, consult your doctor of chiropractic. More than 30 million Americans sought chiropractic care last year alone. Past studies have indicated that consumers are very happy with the chiropractic care they receive.\nWith a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the human body, doctors of chiropractic make diagnoses and take steps to correct problems using spinal adjustments, dietary and lifestyle advice, and other natural tools. Spinal manipulation\u2014the primary form of treatment performed by doctors of chiropractic\u2014is a recommended option for back pain treatment, rated as such by many state and workers\u2019 compensation guidelines.\nResearch has shown that manipulative therapy and spinal manipulation are not only safe and effective, but can cut costs and get workers back on the job faster than other treatments. A recent medical study has also pointed out that manual manipulation offers better short-term relief of chronic back pain than medication.\nReferences; Vallfors B.

These effects include improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling. Laser Therapy has been widely utilized in Europe by physical therapists, nurses and doctors as far back as the 1970's. Now, after FDA clearance in 2002, Laser Therapy is being used extensively in the United States.\nPatient Benefits of Laser Therapy\nLaser Therapy is proven to biostimulate tissue repair and growth. The Laser accelerates wound healing and decreases inflammation, pain, and scar tissue formation. In the management of chronic pain Class IV Laser Therapy can provide dramatic results, is non-addictive and virtually free of side effects.\nHas effectiveness been demonstrated scientifically?\nYes. There are thousands of published studies demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of Laser Therapy. Among these, there are more than one hundred rigorously controlled, scientific studies that document the effectiveness of laser for many clinical conditions.\nCellular Effects of Laser Therapy\nDuring Laser Therapy the infrared laser light interacts with tissues at the cellular level and metabolic activity increases within the cell, improving the transport of nutrients across the cell membrane. This initiates the production of cellular energy (ATP) that leads to a cascade of beneficial effects, increasing cellular function and health.\nLaser Therapeutic Effects\nDuring each painless treatment laser energy increases circulation, drawing water, oxygen, and nutrients to the damaged area. This creates an optimal healing environment that reduces inflammation, swelling, muscle spasms, stiffness, and pain. As the injured area returns to normal, function is restored and pain is relieved.\nK-Laser Advanced Technology\nK-Laser is leading the way in pain management, tissue repair, safe treatments, and fast treatment times. We are the premier laser company in the USA to offer:\nDual-Wavelength Beam that Penetrates Deep into the Tissue\nContinuous & Modulating Frequencies to Promote Pain Control and Healing\nSuperPulse Mode for Deeper Therapeutic Penetration\nHigh Power Delivering Larger Doses, Resulting in Shorter Treatment Times\nPresets that Result in More Consistent and Safe Treatment Outcomes\nDual Wavelength/Dual Frequencies\nThe K-Laser was the first to employ dual infrared wavelengths simultaneously of 800nm and 970nm. These Dual Wavelengths are more efficient, healing the tissue while also aiding in pain relief. Combining the K-Laser's Dual Frequencies of Continuous Wave and Modulation assures that each treatment you receive will be from the most advanced Class IV Laser Therapy technology. In addition, the K-Laser SuperPulse treats deeper conditions very effectively.\nNumerous studies show that Laser Therapy can help with:\nTendinopathies\n"}, {"score": 2329.1455, "uuid": "c1d51cf0-3330-5e6a-843d-615d06c5e420", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-18-04125", "target_hostname": "www.massagetoday.com", "target_uri": "http://www.massagetoday.com/archives/2004/06/01.html", "page_rank": 1.1724803e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Newsweek Validates Complementary and Alternative <em>Therapies</em> <em>for</em> <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em>", "snippet": "Newsweek Validates Complementary and Alternative <em>Therapies</em> <em>for</em> <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> Chalk up one more point <em>for</em> the publishers of Newsweek.", "explanation": null, "document": "June, 2004, Vol. 04, Issue 06\nNewsweek Validates Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Back Pain\nBy Editorial Staff\nChalk up one more point for the publishers of Newsweek. The magazine devoted nearly half of its Dec. 18, 2002 issue to \"The Science of Alternative Medicine,\" a series of articles that looked at the most popular forms of complementary and alternative care, and the April 26, 2004 issue goes one step further in its promotion of alternative therapies in treating back pain.\nIn a cover story, \"The Great Back Debate,\" editor Claudia Kalb explores the role back pain has played in American society.\nWhile the article examines some surgical options used to treat back pain, it also gives a favorable review of massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, and other forms of alternative care.\nBack pain is a universal problem; according to the article, an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. population will suffer from back pain at least once, making it the second most common reason for seeing a doctor, following coughs and other respiratory infections. Between medical bills, disability payments, and lost productivity and time at work, the costs of back pain add up to more than $100 billion per year.\nOne of the reasons back pain is so common, Kalb asserts, is because of the spine's delicate nature. \"Like an expensive, but temperamental sports car, the human spine is beautifully designed and maddeningly unreliable,\" she writes. To complicate matters further, myriad conditions can cause back pain, including physical injuries like degenerated discs, compressed nerves, muscle tears and spasms, and ligament or tendon injuries, as well as psychological issues like depression and anxiety. Small wonder, then, that Kalb labels back pain a \"mystifying mix of physical symptoms and psychological underpinnings.\"\nAmericans try invasive and costly remedies to treat their pain. The article notes that between 1996 and 2001, spinal-fusion surgery procedures (which cost approximately $34,000 each) increased by 77 percent. In 2001 alone, more than 250,000 spinal-fusion surgeries were performed, the vast majority employed to treat disc problems; however, fusion surgery was originally developed to correct serious instabilities and deformities of the spine, not to treat damaged or herniated discs. As a result, Kalb notes, \"many of these procedures simply don't work.\" The lackluster results seen in spinal-fusion cases and other types of surgery have caused some practitioners to consider simpler, less invasive forms of care.\nWe've come to the point where we have to think out of the box,\" said Dr. David Eisenberg, the head of the Osher Institute at Harvard Medical School. \"The time is now.\" Even experienced spine surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Goldstein of the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases has cautioned that doctors need to be more selective about choosing candidates for spinal fusion surgery, and that \"not everyone who has disc degeneration should have an operation.\"\nSo, what's a person with back pain to do? For millions of Americans, the choice has become some form of complementary and alternative medicine, including massage. According to the article, \"Massage has seen an increasing number of addicted patients...research shows it can help knead out persistent pain; one study even found that patients took fewer medications during treatment.\"\nThe Hospital for Special Surgery in New York employs a variety of alternative health care options, including massage therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, tai chi, personal trainers and rehabilitation specialists; providers work together for the good of the patient. The facility, which sees about 13,000 patients a year, many of them with bad backs, uses \"any noninvasive approach they can find\" to relieve pain.\nAs alternative forms of back pain care have increased, so has the amount of research into these therapies. Dr. Dan Cherkin, a researcher at the Center for Health Studies in Seattle, Wash., has conducted several large trials on the effectiveness of chiropractic, massage and acupuncture for back pain.\nAnd Dr. Eisenberg is leading a study funded by the National Institutes of Health, using chiropractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists, neurologists, orthopedists and other practitioners, to see if there are more efficient and cost-effective ways of treating back pain from a multidisciplinary perspective.\"\nAfter centuries of agony, humanity could certainly use some relief\" from back pain, Kalb concludes. \"But more important than the success of any given treatment is the good news that both back pain sufferers and the medical establishment are embracing bold new ways to think about that most exquisite and frustrating work of art: the spine.\"\nIf nothing else, the Newsweek story illustrates the value of complementary and alternative therapies in the treatment of back pain.\nAccording to the World Press Group, Newsweek is one of the most widely read publications in the world; it is distributed in more than 190 countries and six languages, and has a weekly circulation of approximately 4.4 million (3.85 million in the United States).\nRead \"The Great Back Debate\" Online\nIf you didn't pick up a copy of the April 26 issue of Newsweek at your local newsstand, fear not: The magazine has a partnership with the Microsoft Network and NBC that allows people to view its stories on the Internet via www.msnbc.com .\nCopies of \"The Great Back Debate,\" along with interactive features such as online polls and audio clips, are available www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4767268/\nReference\n\"The Great American Back Debate.\" Newsweek, April 26, 2004.\nTo report inappropriate ads, click here .\nArchives\n"}], [{"score": 2325.141, "uuid": "aa0bccc5-0a2f-588e-9bb3-af215971d8ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-67-01813", "target_hostname": "ptsphysicaltherapy.com", "target_uri": "http://ptsphysicaltherapy.com/2007/06/08/seven-secrets-for-a-pain-free-life/", "page_rank": 1.1817545e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Specialists : Seven Secrets <em>For</em> A <em>Pain</em> Free Life", "snippet": "\u201cBut <em>what</em> if I have already tried <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>?\u201d Do not be fooled! <em>Physical</em> <em>therapy</em> can come in many shapes and sizes.

(To learn more about how acupuncture can help your painful condition, stay tuned for the special offer at the conclusion of this report.)\nNow let\u2019s talk about a third pain relief strategy, reducing stress.\nSecret #3: Reduce your Stress, Reduce Your Pain\nYour body\u2019s healing processes are enhanced when you put it in a \u201cstress-free\u201d environment. Think about how you feel when you step into a spa or on vacation. Now think about how you feel when driving in freeway traffic. You see, there are many factors, including psychological ones that affect how your body responds to its surroundings.\nWhen it comes to pain, everyone may experience pain but not everyone perceives pain the same way.\nStress is a big psychological factor that can intensify the perception of pain. Think about what it does on a physiological level. When you are under stress, your muscles tend to become tense, blood vessels constrict cutting off circulation. This may result in a headache or create \u201cpainful trigger points\u201d in already tender tissues.\nOn an emotional level, stress may cause you to interpret your situation as being more difficult, and may make you avoid certain types of activities, because you\u2019re afraid it\u2019s going to make your pain worse.\nHere are a couple easy stress reducing strategies:\nPlan daily distractions. If possible, distract yourself with enjoyable activities such as spending time with friends, watching a movie, or listening to music. Participate in something pleasurable and it may shift the focus away from your pain.\nJust breathe. Another strategy is to unwind. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, visualization, massage, yoga, and Tai Chi. These practices have been proven to be effective.\nFinally, some people have found stress relief by joining a support group or by getting individual counseling on how to best cope with their stress or ailment.\nBottom Line: Create an environment that helps your body cope better with pain. Stress-management strategies have been proven to be effective in decreasing pain, however keep in mind that different methods work for different people.\nMoving on to number four . . .\nSecret #4- Why Exercise Is Important\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. I am in so much pain that I can\u2019t even move. How do you expect me to exercise if I am in pain? It will make me feel worse!\nI understand your dilemma. If you are in acute pain, sometimes the best thing is to rest and avoid activity however this is only a temporary solution. Over time, not moving can actually make your condition worse.\nYour body was designed to move no matter what state of health you\u2019re in. Inactivity will result in muscle weakness and atrophy, diminished bone density, decreased energy level, weaken your heart, create stiffness in the joints, and speed up the aging process. The more inactive you are, the more your body will degenerate.\nIn contrast, regular exercise will keep joints flexible and strong, improve your circulation and blood flow, and strengthen your muscles to support your structure. As a result, you will be more able to deal with arthritic pain and flare-up.\nPlus, physical activity promotes the release of mood-enhancing chemicals in the body that can help diminish the perception of pain.\nThere are three types of exercise recommended for people experiencing joint pain:\nFlexibility exercises. These involve stretches that can help enhance range of motion.\nThe second is cardiovascular or aerobic workouts which include walking, water exercises, and bicycling.\nThe third is strength conditioning which includes isometric or progressive resistance training.\nIf you want to start a fitness program but have a painful condition that prevents you from exercising, here are the steps you need to take:\nTalk to your doctor and make sure you are cleared for exercise.\nConsult with a physical therapist. They are experts in prescribing corrective exercises for various conditions. Remember not all exercises are right for everyone. If one type of exercise does not work for you, there are always other options as you will see at the end of this special report.\nSecret #5: Decrease Your Pain Risk By Improving Your Diet\nThis may come as no surprise to you but if you\u2019re overweight and de-conditioned, your joints take a major hit, because of the increased poundage that your joints have to carry.\nAlthough there may be plenty of weight loss programs out on the market, keep in mind that the most scientifically proven method is regular physical activity and a nutritious, well-balanced diet.\nOn the flip side, losing weight by starving yourself with a poor diet and inactivity can exacerbate pain. This extreme can throw your hormone levels off. Normal hormone levels keep your internal organs in balance, help combat aches and pains, and activate the body\u2019s own healing systems.\nA steady diet of sugar, starch, animal fat and processed food creates an increase in internal inflammation. This negatively affects the immune system and sets the body up for disease and pain. However, limiting your intake of animal protein and saturated fat, and beefing up on foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals can help reduce your pain threshold.\nThis leads us to #6 secret . . . supplements.\nSecret # 6: How Dietary Supplements Enhance Pain Relief\nJoint and muscle pain is often the result of tissue damage. There are many factors that lead to soft tissue and cartilage breakdown: age, inactivity, excess weight, over activity, injury, and genetics.\nCartilage lacks a direct blood supply. It relies on nutrients found in joint fluid to nourish cartilage cells and maintain its structure. When this process is affected by one or more of the factors mentioned above, cartilage can deteriorate and no longer provide sufficient joint protection. Once the cartilage degenerates, the bone begins to wear down. This will cause severe pain since bone tissue contains thousands of pain receptors.\nThere are two types of dietary supplements that can be effective in relieving pain associated with osteoarthritis \u2014 Chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine.\nGlucosamine stimulates cartilage productions while chondroitin sulfate inhibits enzymes that break down cartilage. This will slow the progression of cartilage deterioration as well as reduce joint pan.\nAs with most supplements, there needs to be more research done to determine long-term safety and effectiveness. Side effects of chondroitin are rare. People with bleeding disorders or those taking blood thinners should consult with their doctor before taking the supplement.\nChoosing a quality supplement can be difficult however I\u2019ve done some research for you. If you are interested in learning more about how to choose a supplement just go to our website www.PTSphysicaltherapy.com and type in the key word- supplement- in the search box. Or you can go directly to the nutritional supplements page.\nSecret #7: Pain Relief with TENS\nSticking your finger in an electric socket could be a way of distracting your pain but a safer and less painful way to block pain is using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, or more commonly referred to as TENS. This uses electrical stimulation to control pain. During the treatment, low-voltage electrical current is delivered through electrodes that are placed on the skin near the source of pain. The electricity from the electrodes stimulates the nerves in the painful area and sends signals to the brain that \u201cscramble\u201d or block the pain signals, offering short-term pain relief.\nEven though this type of treatment is temporary and doesn\u2019t actually \u201ccure\u201d the problem, it can be an effective way to manage your pain while seeking other alternatives. TENS is often used during physical therapy and acupuncture treatments. You can rent or purchase a TENS device for home use as long as you get a doctor\u2019s prescription.\nThe Bottom Line . . . Have a Healthy Lifestyle\nThe simplest, yet often the most challenging, strategy for pain relief involves eating right, getting enough sleep, exercising, and reducing stress. In some cases, combining alternative treatments with drug therapy can be the best strategy. Pain medication does not have to be ruled out altogether. The ideal goal of pain relief treatment in the first place, is not just to alleviate suffering, but to decrease pain enough so that you are able to enjoy life and stay active and healthy.\nAll this information was great but what do I do now?\nCombining all seven treatment approaches can be costly and time consuming. However time is of the essence in managing your pain.

For others, who may be sensitized to the type of sound and paranoid about further injury and pain, these sounds can almost be traumatic.\nCold packs or ice may be used independently or alternately with hot packs to reduce swelling and tension in the tissues surrounding and supporting the vertebrae.\nA number of forms of electrical therapy, including the TENS machine and electrical stimulation acupuncture may also be used to stimulate and relax nerves and muscles in an attempt to break up spasm frozen tissues which can pull vertebrae out of their healthful position and result in nerve pinching leading to inflammation and organ dysfunction.\nHot packs and other heat therapies, as well as other types of therapy that increase vasodilation and circulation to facilitate new tissue formation and damaged tissue removal may also be used. These promote the deposition and formation of collagen and the repair of tissues may also be added. Use of Infrared heat accomplishes a similar result.\nUltrasound therapy uses high-frequency sound waves that can penetrate one to four inches, causing vasodilation, increased circulation, and increased heat, while promoting collagen synthesis and deposition to form new tissue.\nTraction stretches the spinal muscles and ligaments, decompresses compromised or irritated spinal nerve roots, and increases the biomechanical function of degenerative spinal and discopathic conditions. \"The most popular forms of chiropractic-applied traction are cervical intermittent and lumbar flexion-distraction techniques,\nExercises for muscle stretching and strengthening, are frequently advocated in order to strengthen muscles supporting connective tissues which have been damaged and to provide a balance between opposing muscle groups where one has been developed to the disadvantage of another. Stretched tendons and ligaments seldom shrink back to their more healthful length so additional muscle support is a less invasive and less costly for of correction than surgery.\nPNF, or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, involves techniques to improve muscle and joint function. The treatment is geared toward treating the whole body.\nTherabands and Swiss ball activities, which are very effective in rehabilitation, along with other low-tech, inexpensive equipment like trampolines, balance boards, and BOSU balls are also advocated by some practitioners.\nExercise tubing [including swimming pool flotation noodles]:\nResistive-motion exercise using simple exercise tubes is also available at almost any athletic store. Exercise tubing has been shown to offer pain relief and improve strength and conditioning for patients recovering from many joint injuries. With a couple of sessions' instruction in the chiropractic office, the patient can be taught to use exercise tubing for almost any upper - and lower - body strengthening exercise. They're portable, simple to use, and don't take up nearly as much space as free weights.\nA flat bench, a stationary bike, and Foot Levelers or Synergy wall tubing systems and any tabletop or stand-alone upper-body ergometer may also be used to assist in particular muscle development for the purpose of greater support of the skeletal structure in a balanced manner.\nAlignment of the spine and nutritional counseling.\nIn addition to the above physical orientation chiropractic adjustment AND one or more facilitative and remedial therapies, chiropractors have long integrated one of several forms of nutritional support approaches.\nAn old and most common form of nutritional advice is to rationalize what is expected to be of benefit to the client as an extension of published research associated to the symptoms of the individual. There are extreme difficulties and inefficiencies with this approach for it follows the authoritarian conservative approach to medicine and health which assumes that all humans are clones of one another. Without a consideration of blood and metabolic type, gender, age, build, and the often promotional and idiosyncratic misuse of statistics, supplements are often prescribed which are inadequate or excessive in dosage, unbalanced in association with each other, and often costly and useless.\nIn the field of nutrition, every week brings new reports of findings which extend our awareness about specific food ingredients. Sometimes, new research reveals the fallacies of decades old associations or months old pseudo-scientific releases. As environmental deterioration becomes pervasive and industrial farming persistently exhausts the soils and contaminates our crops with thousands of airborne and seeded chemicals --- we increasingly require nutritional supplementation just to maintain a previously normal level of nutrition. Yet, each of us experiences different levels of stress and cope in different degrees and manners with stress. Energies demanded for coping create demand for nutrients according to the type of stress. Our nutritional requirements are continuously changing.\nMuscle testing to determine the most efficient food combinations and supplement dosages has been advocated by health professionals since the late 1970's. Unfortunately, this simple skill cannot be patented and sold and so few practitioners make any effort to learn it for their own use as they cannot sell it to their clients. Development of the skill also requires a degree of patience, persistence, and self-awareness --- which is difficult to encourage in a culture focused on aggressive, fast-paced, competitive, materialistic obsession. Individualized eating profiles also conflicts with the cultural pattern of shared meals in which one combination of foods has been prepared for all.\nIndividualized selection of foods and supplemental nutrients is the only way to effectively consume the best balance to recover, maintain, and enhance one's health. With foods occupying the significance of medicinal herbs, personal preference for selection on the basis of popularity, taste, or cost --- often becomes irrelevant. Still, one must make the selections from what is available to one and obtainable with the resources at hand. This self-direction and self-restraint requires a discerning ability to use muscle testing which one can easily and quickly confirm to be accurate and note distorted by the desires or fears of one's Ego [Personal values], and SuperEgo [Social values].\nThe use of Spiritual Guidance to determine food selection and supplement dosages and inclusion is another way to attain efficient and relevant nutrition. This requires even more self-direction, self-restraint, awareness, persistence, and independence than the use of muscle testing if one is to maintain accuracy in results. The benefit is that it can be much more widely applied both beyond oneself and beyond the simple questions of nutrition.\nMany chiropractors who have augmented their practice with nutritional supplements at an earlier time, have now abandoned this to the many health food stores and websites which compete for the business and often have staff who may be more familiar with some of the newer supplements, studies, and theories. Rather than maintaining an expensive and extensive stock of supplements which will likely have a low turnover, and thus a high storage cost --- many practitioners have abandoned this attempt at increasing the permanence of their chiropractic manipulations to the adoption of other modalities.\nGentle alignment of the spine and other bones.\nJohn McTimoney founded the McTimoney method of chiropractic in Banbury, Britain, in 1951.\nhttp://www.mctimoney-college.ac.uk/\nMcTimoney, an adherent of Palmer's holistic view of chiropractic, believed that subluxations impair nerve function and affect the correct functioning of the body. His approach altered to a \"whole body\" one. He came to the view that although the spine was the primary source of misalignments, or subluxations, the other joints of the body could also be put out of alignment by everyday stresses and strains, and that, in order to achieve a complete realignment, all the joints of the body should be treated -not just the spine. McTimoney also treated animals with his technique and is considered to be a pioneer in this field.\nThe same techniques as other chiropractors are used, but in a much more gentle way. They favor a technique known as the \"toggle-recoil\" thrust. In this, the practitioner pushes the joint in the desired direction with one rapid movement and then releases it. The tendons and ligaments of the joint are stretched by the rapid push and their natural elasticity is thought to assist the bones to realign as they recoil when released.\nMcTimoney practitioners examine and treat the entire body in the course of each session to ensure correct skeletal alignment. They rarely use X-rays or other diagnostic tools, preferring to rely on what they feel with their hands.\nMcTimoney Chiropractic is seen as a safer option than ordinary chiropractic because of its lighter touch.\nAlignment of the spine and energy balancing.\nBio-Kinetics , http://www.biokineticshealth.com\n\"We as human organisms are a series of interacting multidimensional subtle energy systems, and if these energy systems become imbalanced there may be resulting pathological symptoms which manifest on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual planes.\"\nFrom introduction by Gabriel Cousens, M.D., to\nVibrational Medicine: New Choices for Healing Ourselves,\nby Richard Gerber, M.D.\nThe Bio-Kinetics procedures were developed over the past thirty-plus years by Dr. Lawrence E. Newsum of Rancho Palos Verdes, California. With the help of colleague, Dr. Donald Baune, a Chiropractic Neurologist, he was able to compile the information explaining how it works, and develop a concise and teachable program.\nBio-Kinetics, through a unique and patented process, works to gently activate, stimulate and synchronize areas of the brain, nerve system and body that are subconsciously reacting to stored stress-memory patterns, causing dysfunction and dis-ease.\nBio-Kinetics is based on neuro-physiological insights and discoveries that make it possible to release accumulated biological stress, eliminate negative stress reactions and correct stored cellular stress memories anywhere in the body and mind.\n[The manner in which Bio-Kinetics describes \"stress reactions\" and \"stress memories\" is very similar to how I have found regular energy blocks to be my Balancing Therapy, outlined elsewhere on Earthtym.]\nThe human brain is a complex electro-chemical organ, producing chemicals from nerve cell frequencies. Chemical imbalances come from frequency imbalances. Stress-memories result in negative frequency imbalances throughout the brain/body system that then trigger a cascade of events leading to dysfunction and, eventually disease. In this way, stress-reactions cause INTERFERENCE with the normal Brain/Body communication system, and cause INTERFERENCE with the flow of energy in, around and through the body.\nEliminating The Effects Of Stress:\nDiscoveries from fields of neurology, neuro-physiology, psycho-neuro-immunology, endocrinology and chiropractic have revealed insights into how this system works. A healthy body comes from a healthy brain, and a healthy brain comes from a healthy, active body. The brain needs stimulation from the body to function properly, and the body needs proper communication from the brain to function properly. This new understanding has made it possible to develop protocols to update the body's reaction to stress, re-program the stress response, and re-connect the communication pathways between the brain and body.\nBio-Kinetics unique and patented approach finds hidden stress reaction patterns, then using the small hand-held New-Stim instrument, mechanically stimulates specific neuro-receptor pathways triggering a nerve response into the brain that interrupts the abnormal patterns and normalizes the frequencies within the brain.\nBio-Kinetics utilizes very specific contact points in the atlanto-occipital area as its primary window into the nervous system because the distribution of neuro-receptors is the highest in this region, allowing for precise brain activation.\nWith the procedures developed in 2004, Bio-Kinetics can be performed in 3-7 minutes to clear physical problems (spinal problems, musculo-skeletal problems, organ malfunctions, etc.), chemical sensitivities (allergies), emotional stress patterns and electromagnetic frequency interference on most people.\n[Much of this approach utilizes muscle testing and the use of the point impact Stim instrument. As in all forms of chiropractic, it cannot remove sources of toxins in the body or toxin buildup from chemicals and heavy metals. It can increase the awareness of and discernment of the Reptilian Structure to specific parasitic forms, such as viruses and fungi.]\nAlignment of the spine and homeopathic treatment.\nThe integration of homeopathic and chiropractic can be a very effective approach, although it usually is not. This result is neither a reflection of the positive contribution possible with either towards enhanced health.\nHomeopathy is usually, in my experience, applied by the practitioner interviewing the client and then selecting the one remedy which correlates in descriptive principle to the symptoms noted. In the reference available to the practitioner, both in paper manual form and computer analysis software, the description of the person so afflicted as to benefit from a specific remedy can be highly defined.\nThis rational association of two apparent similar facts, symptom and description, have a tendency to be incorrect and wasteful. Second and third visits may elicit more detail and symptoms and more remedies to apply. If the problem is indeed related to a very specific traumatic event, it may be resolved by the use of one remedy.\nMuscle testing to determine the most efficient remedy and strength/quantity of dosages has been advocated by health professionals since the late 1970's. Unfortunately, this simple skill cannot be patented and sold and so few practitioners make any effort to learn it for their own use as they cannot sell it to their clients. Development of the skill also requires a degree of patience, persistence, and self-awareness --- which is difficult to encourage in a culture focused on aggressive, fast-paced, competitive, materialistic obsession. Individualized treatment profiles also conflicts with the cultural pattern of formulaic prescribing in which one remedy has been prescribed for apparent singular symptoms\nIndividualized selection of remedies is the only way to effectively address what may be one, or a combination of trauma induced patterns, and enhance one's health. With remedies occupying an authoritarian predictable association to symptoms, an openness to the possibility of multiple influences indicating one or more symptoms and one to many remedies simultaneously --- often becomes irrelevant to the simplicity seeking rational brain.\nThis becomes ever more difficult when the reality becomes known that there are hundreds of homeopathic remedies which can be ordered in at least 3 different potencies. The cost of a partial set often ranges to as much or more than $10,000. Which client is going to withstand the rigorous muscle testing endurance session while perhaps 5 remedies in 3 differing strengths are confirmed for choice? Simply easier to guess, by association, and call it rational.\nThe use of Spiritual Guidance to determine remedy selection and strength/quantity of dosages is a way to attain efficient and relevant treatment. This requires even more self-direction, self-restraint, awareness, persistence, and independence than the use of muscle testing if one is to maintain accuracy in results. The benefit is that it can be much more widely applied both beyond oneself and beyond the simple questions of a regular interview.\nCombinations of remedies may be indicated for symptoms being expressed by a multiple of influences, of which most are hidden from the consciousness of the patient, themselves. If the patient is Not Aware of this relevant information, how can they share it? If diagnosis depends upon shared information, how can such be possible when that information is either unavailable to the patient, or, embarrassing or shameful to the person?\nAlignment of the spine with a focus on one area.\nUpper Cervical , http://www.tna-support.org/newlook/uppercervical.htm, or,\nNUCCA , or, atlas subluxation complex.\nThe atlas is a single, 2 oz. doughnut-shaped vertebra at the top of the spine. Trillions of nerve fibers from the brainstem travel through the small opening in atlas and flow down into the spinal column. Because of the smallness of the opening and because of the atlas\u0092 close proximity to the brain stem, if the atlas has moved out of position even one degree, two very serious things can result.\nThe repositioning of the atlas vertebrae is done by hand or by instrument. Depending on the doctor\u0092s technique, it feels like a light tap, a brisk thrust, or a soft massage at the side of the neck as the atlas is moved precisely back into its correct position. It is completely \u0093underwhelming.\u0094\nThis approach is particularly beneficial to the treatment of whiplash and other head trauma injuries. There are few young adults, and fewer mature persons, who have not experienced accidental, or intentional, physical shock to the head or upper back. This may begin as early as a forceps delivery, a disciplinary slap to the head, a fall, a punch, wrestling holds or whips, sudden vehicle stops, emotional tension from particular forms of fear or anxiety, or many other possibilities.\nAs usual in chiropractic application, the therapist is likely to be committed to their form of chiropractic as a panacea for all ills. This attitude, allows, or leaves them in a state of profound denial and ignorance about more complex forms of illness, like multiple chronic burdens, and prevents a more constructive referral to other services when such could prove beneficial. One should NOT be surprised at this, for this characteristic applies to most practices of healthcare and medicine, whether conventional or alternative.\nAlignment of the spine with acupuncture preparation.\nSome chiropractors begin their treatment with the use of acupuncture needles. These are placed to reduce the muscle tension and inflammation which usually attends subluxated vertebrae and pinched nerves. It is a method which is drug free and allows the body to begin correction while the practitioner is adjusting another client. This is often used in place of an initial hand massage, TENS electro-stimulation, or Thumper mechanical massage. For those who choose this direction, they often find it more effective and efficient than the alternatives.\nAlignment of the spine with hypnotic enhancement.\nNetwork Chiropractic , http://www.10ac.com/network_chiropractic.htm\nAlso known as: Network Spinal Analysis (NSA), and the Somato-Respiratory Integration (SRI) methodology.\nNetwork chiropractic is an approach that has been developed by Donald Epstein, D.C. It extends chiropractic's traditional adjustment techniques and works with the body's Reptilian Intelligence. Its uniqueness lies in its use of a unified system of 12 techniques with special attention to their timing and sequencing. Using light, gentle movements, practitioners adjust each vertebra in relationship to the rest of the spine, on the belief that spine protects an essential channel of energy and information to the body.\nDr. Epstein's system of Network Spinal Analysis (NSA) integrates points of agreement from diverse chiropractic approaches. He observed from clinical experience that not all subluxations of the spine are the same. He found two types of subluxations: structural (arising from physical stresses), and facilitated (arising from emotional stresses).\nNetwork chiropractic combines a variety of chiropractic techniques to enable the practitioner to adjust subluxations with the precise amount and type of force suggested by clinical findings. This is different from attempting to match the vertebra being adjusted to a specific technique. The difference lies in the sequence of the adjustments and the networking of the various methods.\nNetwork chiropractic may be performed on a group of patients, simultaneously within a large treatment area in which the positive statements of one person encourages the others present to expect a similar positive outcome for themselves. In ALL areas of healthcare, where positive expectation is encouraged, rather than being allowed to present itself, there is a potential for placebo self-healing to occur, in addition to any improvements resulting from the applications carried out by the therapist. The true test of effectiveness is when a patient experiences dramatic improvement in some area of their health, through the process utilized by the therapist, WITHOUT statements of expectation being made.\nFree EXAM , available in the USA, 866-697-1740\nThis page almost did not happen.\nThe practice of chiropractic is very diverse and personalized to the practitioner.\nDuring the 1950's my parents were progressive in their accessing of Alternative healthcare options when conservative approaches failed. That proved often enough, successful, such as when I had a severe intestinal parasite problem which could neither be effectively diagnosed nor treated by the regional General Practitioner/Surgeon. My parents were also receptive to therapies which had proven to be successful for others. Some of those were of questionable benefit; others were health enhancing.\nAlso in the 1950's, we drove 40 miles to see a chiropractor who was also an early adopter of nutritional supplements and organic farming and produce. As a child, I was unaware of what his profession was, other than some form of doctor. The fellow we periodically visited checked our spinal alignment and made adjustments as were indicated.\nIn the mid-1970's, following a lower back injury which resulted in much pain unaided by conventional approaches and medications, I returned to chiropractic. I was not working in a city. I provided services to clients in a territory that was 500 miles wide by 400 miles with few major roads. The local chiropractor came to practice in the region one day each week from his city clinic. I was out of the office for less than 40 minutes when I was back in just as much pain. I paid attention to the movements he made with my back to effect the pain relieving adjustment.\nI developed a keen awareness about lifting correctly.\nBy the end of the 5th treatment, I could usually adjust my back myself. To enable me to function and continue working, I fitted out the back of my Chevy Blazer with wooden boxes, I could make into a platform. The boxes carried my tools and supplies. I could lay on top of the platform they made and make the adjustments and/or rest, regardless of the weather conditions outside. I adjusted my back 2 to 4 times each day. After 20 treatments, and my regular contributions, I was pain free.\nSeveral months later, a driver on recreational drugs ran into my car, wrote it off, and left me in a coma. When I regained consciousness, I had sustained my first severe whiplash. Again, I returned to chiropractic after conventional pain medications in huge doses were useless and deep massage and ultrasonic heat physiotherapy of minor benefit. I was out of the chiropractic office for less than 10 minutes when I was back in just as much pain.\nI paid attention to the movements he made with my neck to effect the pain relieving adjustment. By the end of the 3rd treatment, I could usually adjust my neck myself. To enable me to function and continue working, I adjusted my neck 3 to 9 times each day. What did I have to lose? A week of pain and disability and the potential to be laid off or terminated. It took me 7 years to fully recover, partly by learning better coping skills. Many of these are noted on the Earthtym pages.\nIn the early 1980's, part of my recovery from the chronic neck problems and recurring back problems came when I moved into Toronto. Chiropractors could only provide treatments several times each week at that time. I was fortunate to find 2 chiropractors with different added skills which assisted in my mentoring. From the one, I learned Touch-for-Health kinesiology. From the other, I learned an early form of Balancing using Bach Remedies and muscle testing. For a time, I attended both of them, giving me a total of up to 4 treatments per week. As the latter assisted in releasing the energy blocks supporting the whiplash and lower back injuries, I gradually required fewer and fewer treatments.\nBy the late 1980's, I was becoming hypersensitive to many things and the environmental and physical stresses of my work were resulting in chronic pains again. I was fortunate to be able to attend a nearby chiropractor, yet the benefits were short lived. This prompted me to find an enhanced health region in which I prepared to build a subdivision for professionals affected in such ways. With the research I did into materials and Spiritual Guidance, I began developing the Balancing Therapy outlined on Earthtym. By using this approach and extending it, I found I could release energy blocks AND sensitivities. Newfound health did not last long.\nIn the early 1990's, I was once again struck by another driver such that I sustained a second severe whiplash. After the lengthy and frustrating legal experience connected with the first, I chose the more positive stress approach of a faster settlement and putting the incident behind me. This time, I also had the skills to both release energy blocks developed from the experience as well as prevent the development of energy blocks as an extension of the stresses involved in recovery. With very little chiropractic intervention, I recovered a lot in 3 months, and fully in 9 months.\nDuring the late 1990's and 2000, it proved necessary for me to move my residence-office 5 times. Each time, I was largely responsible for lifting and carrying to and from a truck or other vehicle several tons of books and reference materials packed into stacking crates. In each case, all of the work had to be completed within a 24 hour period. For someone with a prior severe lower back injury, this was theoretically impossible. Much of the interim times were spent in the low physical activity work of planning and providing therapy, or otherwise working from a desk, as well as recovering from some form of chronic debilitating illness. Most of the time, the use of tension bandages, a back support, and a steady pace --- together with Balancing Therapy --- resulted in no lingering discomfort nor chiropractic requirement.\nIn 2000, after the multiple movement of my resources and belongings to the stairs, down the stairs into a vehicle, from the vehicle into a house and down stairs, as well as from a truck up a stairs to a storage platform --- my back had sustained too much. With several organ systems dysfunctioning and chronic pain, I was back again at a chiropractor's office, with an emergency. This time, results were slower as all the muscle involved were often in spasm. Together with a keen eye on preventing energy block building, and with a resorting to Qi Gong / Acupuncture, the combination with chiropractic lead to a resolution after 7 months.\nDuring 2001/2002, I was fortunate to have my office in a chiropractic clinic. The Balancing Therapy I provided enabled individuals with chronic problems not resolved by massage therapy, chiropractic, or homeopathy --- to dramatically improve in their health, and on a wider scale. The chiropractor allowed me to utilize his extensive supply of homeopathics for integration into the treatment of a few of my clients with very complex and compelling influences on their health. Utilizing standard homeopathic remedies together with the Bach Flower Remedies I used for Balancing, proved highly effective and delivered near immediate results.\nDuring 2002, there were minor periods during which I used chiropractic services in Australia associated with chronic illness and travelling (moving heavy suitcases). In the latter 4 months of the year, chiropractic, balancing, and massage services were used to help recover from my third severe whiplash injury. Keeping the energy blocks at bay, I fully recovered this time in 3 months, in spite of major challenges in my work and social life.\nDuring 2003 to 2005, there were a variety of periods during which I benefited from chiropractic treatments to help cope with the chronic illnesses I was repeatedly challenged with. These chiropractic approaches were by different practitioners who used different forms of chiropractic or integrated different additional modalities. They ranged from 2 to 8 sessions. Spiritually Guided supplements and other therapies were utilized concurrently together with the occasional requirement for Balancing with Bach Flower Remedies.\nAs is noted in the main article above, there are MANY varieties of chiropractic. Not all are suitable for every person and some can be Very beneficial to many persons for specific problems. The basic form of chiropractic RELIEVES symptoms. Recovery and cure is subject to some of many other options, being effectively integrated with the chiropractic, which is why so many chiropractors include other modalities in their practice.\n"}, {"score": 2313.489, "uuid": "6affa66d-acf0-539f-8932-651e70be1041", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-08-16308", "target_hostname": "holisticvetpetcare.com", "target_uri": "http://holisticvetpetcare.com/healing-chiropractic-therapy.htm", "page_rank": 1.1822566e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "healing with <em>chiropractic</em> <em>therapy</em>", "snippet": "Besides <em>pain</em> and impaired movement, <em>what</em> other health problems can result from this condition and why <em>is</em> <em>Chiropractic</em> <em>Therapy</em> necessary?

The nature of animals is that some time in their lives, there has been an injury to vertebrae, associated muscles, tendons and ligaments. This can be due to trauma by another animal in fighting, or running into an object, or jumping off and not landing squarely on all fours, or even torquing the body off center to take weight off a painful extremity. Whatever the mechanism, the vertebrae have been misaligned, muscles put into spasm, ligaments and tendons strained or torn. If not adjusted and supported, these vertebrae attract calcium ions and soon calcification deposits develop, and/or abnormal wearing of joint surfaces of associated front or hind leg with resulting crippling arthritis and impairment of movement.\nBesides pain and impaired movement, what other health problems can result from this condition and why is Chiropractic Therapy necessary?\nPhysically, impairment of associated organ structures and function via the vertebral spinal sensory and motor abilities to these organs.\nEnergetically, imbalanced and weakened acupuncture energy (or the Life Force, Chi) in the Bladder Meridian that flows bilaterally down the dorsal right and left sides of the vertebrae from the animal\u2019s head, down entire back to the toes of both hind legs. This impaired energy produces blockages and weaknesses in the associated physical organs and their functions.\nPHYSICAL MISALIGNMENT AND CHI FLOW BLOCKAGES\nThe most frequent misaligned vertebra is the first neck bone, the atlas. In dogs this is pulled out of place by misuse of collars and leashes. Pulling from a collar can easily pull this neck bone out of alignment either by jerking on the leash to one side or another, or by the dog suddenly lurching laterally against the collar. It is far better to attach a leash to a harness than a collar. Since every vertebrae is attached to one another, a cascading affect occurs of rotating any or several other vertebrae and the sacroiliac out of alignment. In horses, pulling against a halter laterally or even up and down can misalign this atlas. Spinal nerves in the neck or cervical area can affect the throat, thyroid, and the Wallerian Ring of tonsils, the first area of defense against inhaled and ingested infective agents and chemicals, and these nerves can contribute to shoulder and front leg lameness. In the chest or thoracic vertebrae associated spinal nerves can affect the heart, lungs, and circulation. The upper thoracics can also cause front leg lameness. The lower thoracics and upper lumbars affect internal organs of digestion, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and stomach; of excretion, kidneys; and immune system, the spleen and bone marrow. The lower lumbars affect the bowel or Large Intestine; the sacroiliac, the Small Intestine and Urinary Bladder functions. The Sciatic Nerve, a plexus formed by multiple spinal nerves coming from the lower lumbar and sacral vertebrae innervate the hind legs, carrying sensory and motor impulses. Much hind limb paralysis can be due to subluxation of these vertebrae putting pressure on the lower spinal cord and Sciatic nerves.\nSee inserted picture of Bladder Meridians:\nWHAT TO DO?\n1.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Seek the services of a qualified veterinarian who does chiropractic therapy; or have your veterinarian write a referral letter for your animal to be seen by a chiropractor who does services for people.\nIf neither is available, purchase the book, \u201c The Well-Adjusted Dog\u201d a self- help book for dog and cat owners with great pictures and simple language.\nPurchase a Healing Halter for your dog, cat or horse. Many times this alone will relieve muscle spasm and allow the vertebrae to align themselves. This will also help balance and strengthen the Chi in all affected organs, joints, tendons and ligaments.\nAdminister my Custom Homeopathy Muscle spasm 50MX: 4 tabs every hour for first day, then 6 x daily as needed. Massaging with warm wet towels, the area of muscle spasm.\nAdminister oral oxygen (Aerobic O7) 15 drops twice daily by mouth or in the drinking water to super oxygenate the cramped muscles and increase nerve, tendon and ligament healing.\n3.

The nature of animals is that some time in their lives, there has been an injury to vertebrae, associated muscles, tendons and ligaments. This can be due to trauma by another animal in fighting, or running into an object, or jumping off and not landing squarely on all fours, or even torquing the body off center to take weight off a painful extremity. Whatever the mechanism, the vertebrae have been misaligned, muscles put into spasm, ligaments and tendons strained or torn. If not adjusted and supported, these vertebrae attract calcium ions and soon calcification deposits develop, and/or abnormal wearing of joint surfaces of associated front or hind leg with resulting crippling arthritis and impairment of movement.\nBesides pain and impaired movement, what other health problems can result from this condition and why is Chiropractic Therapy necessary?\nPhysically, impairment of associated organ structures and function via the vertebral spinal sensory and motor abilities to these organs.\nEnergetically, imbalanced and weakened acupuncture energy (or the Life Force, Chi) in the Bladder Meridian that flows bilaterally down the dorsal right and left sides of the vertebrae from the animal\u2019s head, down entire back to the toes of both hind legs. This impaired energy produces blockages and weaknesses in the associated physical organs and their functions.\nPHYSICAL MISALIGNMENT AND CHI FLOW BLOCKAGES\nThe most frequent misaligned vertebra is the first neck bone, the atlas. In dogs this is pulled out of place by misuse of collars and leashes. Pulling from a collar can easily pull this neck bone out of alignment either by jerking on the leash to one side or another, or by the dog suddenly lurching laterally against the collar. It is far better to attach a leash to a harness than a collar. Since every vertebrae is attached to one another, a cascading affect occurs of rotating any or several other vertebrae and the sacroiliac out of alignment. In horses, pulling against a halter laterally or even up and down can misalign this atlas. Spinal nerves in the neck or cervical area can affect the throat, thyroid, and the Wallerian Ring of tonsils, the first area of defense against inhaled and ingested infective agents and chemicals, and these nerves can contribute to shoulder and front leg lameness. In the chest or thoracic vertebrae associated spinal nerves can affect the heart, lungs, and circulation. The upper thoracics can also cause front leg lameness. The lower thoracics and upper lumbars affect internal organs of digestion, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and stomach; of excretion, kidneys; and immune system, the spleen and bone marrow. The lower lumbars affect the bowel or Large Intestine; the sacroiliac, the Small Intestine and Urinary Bladder functions. The Sciatic Nerve, a plexus formed by multiple spinal nerves coming from the lower lumbar and sacral vertebrae innervate the hind legs, carrying sensory and motor impulses. Much hind limb paralysis can be due to subluxation of these vertebrae putting pressure on the lower spinal cord and Sciatic nerves.\nSee inserted picture of Bladder Meridians:\nWHAT TO DO?\n1.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Seek the services of a qualified veterinarian who does chiropractic therapy; or have your veterinarian write a referral letter for your animal to be seen by a chiropractor who does services for people.\nIf neither is available, purchase the book, \u201c The Well-Adjusted Dog\u201d a self- help book for dog and cat owners with great pictures and simple language.\nPurchase a Healing Halter for your dog, cat or horse.

What are the possibilities?\u00a0 This depends on whether you are just concerned with treating the end result of your health issues being the back pain, or more concerned to address it wholistically, closer to its cause.\u00a0 Amongst your many options, there are two categories.\u00a0 Do you want to have you pain \u201ctreated\u201d as an unrelated entity to the rest of your body?\u00a0 This can be done with a drug or procedure to go to the site of pain and try to fix it there and then.\u00a0 Your other option is a more wholistic natural, measurable and sustainable approach?\nYou can have the back pain \u201ctreated\u201d by needles, drugs, hot or cold packs, rubbing it, stretching it, as well as many forms of hands on therapies.\u00a0 These are primarily aimed at the area of pain, considering this to be where the problems starts and ends.\u00a0 What if the back pain is only the end result of a series of other issues?\u00a0 It could be coming from your organs, like kidneys, or referred pain from another body area.\u00a0 It could be referred from other body parts.\u00a0 It could be your back pain is the result of your lifestyle the needs to be modified.\nDo you know what is scarier than back pain?\u00a0 What if you have a back problem and DON\u2019T feel it?\u00a0 Without being able to feel it, the condition can worsen, so by the time you do feel it, you are in the more advanced stages of the condition.\u00a0 What if your back pain was a way your body used to communicate that you need to make some changes in you r life?.\nWe use a contemporary uniquely natural, measurable and sustainable approach to back pain.\u00a0 Our system does not \u201ctreat\u201d the back pain.\u00a0 Here the person is looked at as a whole, considering many lifestyle factors.\u00a0 After using our comprehensive assessment procedures, our approach is not to treat anything, rather to help the body to better become aware of itself, and adapt in a more healthy manner.\u00a0 Here the pain is considered in context of your whole life.\u00a0 Using a wholistic approach like this, can lead to more sustainable changes.\n"}, {"score": 2289.2393, "uuid": "22ad3e67-bf68-5390-908a-b1d9b7a0a6ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1707wb-72-15384", "target_hostname": "www.acatoday.org", "target_uri": "http://www.acatoday.org/content_css.cfm?CID=1420", "page_rank": 1.1758309e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "ACA - <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> and <em>Chiropractic</em>", "snippet": "Add to this improper sitting, lifting, <em>or</em> reaching\u2014and the normal wear and tear of working and playing\u2014and you have the perfect recipe <em>for</em> <em>back</em> <em>pain</em>.

Add to this improper sitting, lifting, or reaching\u2014and the normal wear and tear of working and playing\u2014and you have the perfect recipe for back pain. That\u2019s why back pain is the 2nd most common reason for visits to the doctor\u2019s office, outnumbered only by upper-respiratory infections. In fact, some experts say, as many as 80% of us will experience a back problem at some time in our lives.1\nBack injuries are a part of everyday life. They can cause a sharp pain or a dull ache and can be accompanied by a tingling, numbness, or burning sensation. You may also feel weakness, pain, or tingling in your pelvis and upper leg\u2014a condition known as sciatica. The spine is quite good at dealing with back injuries. Minor injuries usually heal within a day or two. Some pain, however, continues. What makes it last longer is not entirely understood, but researchers suspect that stress, mood changes, and the fear of further injury may prevent patients from being active and exacerbate the pain.\nTips for Back Pain Prevention:\nMaintain a healthy diet and weight.\nRemain active\u2014under the supervision of your doctor of chiropractic.\nAvoid prolonged inactivity or bed rest.\nWarm up or stretch before exercising or other physical activities, such as gardening.\nMaintain proper posture.\nWear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.\nSleep on a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curve in your spine.\nLift with your knees, keep the object close to your body, and do not twist when lifting.\nQuit smoking. Smoking impairs blood flow, resulting in oxygen and nutrient deprivation to spinal tissues.\nWork with your doctor of chiropractic to ensure that your workstation is ergonomically correct.\nChiropractic Treatment for Back Pain\nIf you experience back pain, consult your doctor of chiropractic. More than 30 million Americans sought chiropractic care last year alone. Past studies have indicated that consumers are very happy with the chiropractic care they receive.\nWith a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the human body, doctors of chiropractic make diagnoses and take steps to correct problems using spinal adjustments, dietary and lifestyle advice, and other natural tools. Spinal manipulation\u2014the primary form of treatment performed by doctors of chiropractic\u2014is a recommended option for back pain treatment, rated as such by many state and workers\u2019 compensation guidelines.\nResearch has shown that manipulative therapy and spinal manipulation are not only safe and effective, but can cut costs and get workers back on the job faster than other treatments. A recent medical study has also pointed out that manual manipulation offers better short-term relief of chronic back pain than medication.2\nWhen choosing a doctor of chiropractic:\nBe sure the chiropractor has attended an accredited chiropractic college.\nMake sure the chiropractor is licensed to practice in your state. After graduating from an accredited chiropractic college, doctors of chiropractic must pass rigorous state and national board exams before they can practice.\nTalk to your friends, family, and co-workers. The best referrals often come from satisfied patients.\nTalk to the doctor. The chiropractor should be willing to answer your questions and should talk freely with you about your concerns and course of treatment.\nReferences\n1. Vallfors B.

According to his beliefs, the effects of the musculoskeletal system, in particular the spine, on the nervous system has an effect on the body\u2019s overall health. Misalignments of the vertebrae in the spine are believed to lead to health problems because they prevent normal nerve functions. Chiropractors, therefore, use hands-on manipulation techniques to correctly align the spine so as to alleviate a variety of problems.\nChiropractic treatment technique primarily involves manipulation of the spine with emphasis on careful movement of the vertebrae, in order to allow for a wider range of motion than before manipulation takes place.\u00a0 Chiropractors are highly trained professionals who are able to assess exactly how far a patient\u2019s range of movement extends without damaging the joints.\nChiropractors specialise in musculoskeletal problems, mainly those of the back and neck and primarily involve manual therapy through massage and manipulation, but they also treat a wide range of problems in soft tissue and conditions relating to the nervous system. For instance, Chiropractic has been the subject of much research and found to be helpful with conditions such as: low back pain, fibromyalgia and headaches, whiplash after car accidents, asthma in children and colic in babies.\nSome practitioners focus on muscular or skeletal issues; others hold that spinal manipulation can be used to alleviate many other disorders like middle-ear infections, diabetes or cancer.\nWhat to expect\nThe initial examination by a trained chiropractor is to determine the root of your problem; this often includes a hands-on examination. The chiropractor will look at your posture, observe you carrying out a range of movements, noting in particular the mobility of the spine (although chiropractic treatment works on all joints, muscles and nerves of the body). Together with taking a full medical history and relevant information about any accidents or surgery and about your lifestyle, before any treatment is carried out, an x-ray may be taken to confirm an accurate diagnosis (chiropractors are qualified to take x-rays).\nYou\u2019ll be asked to strip down to your underwear. You may be asked to stand, sit or lie on a couch for treatment.\nAfter a very careful assessment, usually some manual therapy is applied to the problem areas of the back. The chiropractor may turn the upper spine one way and the lower spine the other way to reveal which vertebrae need adjustment.\u00a0 At the end of the range of movement, a quick but firm thrust at exactly the right place is given, to direct a physical force into the spine, to allow the joint to spring back into position. Sometimes a click or crack can be heard; this sound is gases in the synovial fluid \u2013 fluid that lubricates the vertebrae, which has built up, bursting with a popping or clicking sound. It may be disconcerting at first, but ought not to be painful.\nOther techniques employed by the chiropractor may include soft tissue massage to aid back strengthening and help alleviate pain and discomfort, and \u2018dry needling\u2019 which is similar to acupuncture, or a relatively new procedure electrical stimulation.\nYou may be given a set of rehabilitative exercises, including stretching to improve mobility together with some nutritional advice and possible vitamin recommendations and lifestyle changes.\u00a0 These are all tailor-made for each patient.\nSome people feel better instantly, others experience aching or stiffness, later the same day or the next day, until the body settles down after the manipulation. You may need five or six visits over a few weeks, more for chronic conditions.\nThe effects & benefits\nThe three main areas that Chiropractic can improve are:\nFunction \u2013 the way each part of your body operates\nAlignment \u2013 ensuring that all your muscular and bone systems are correctly brought into line\nMobility \u2013 how flexible you are and how easily you can move.\nIn the process of aligning the spine, stress and strain on the body\u2019s nervous system is released, which should alleviate the pain. The areas where a relieving effect can be felt include:\nBack pain (from which, incidentally, more than half the UK population will suffer form at some time in their lives).\nNeck pain (a common location for stress-related pain, and for instance, whiplash after a high-impact crash in a car).\nChest or abdominal pain (related to anxiety or any other conditions)\nShoulder, arm or wrist pain,\nInjuries to the leg, knee, ankle or foot (either through accident or long-term wear and tear)\nMigraine or headache\nAfter-effects of falls, accidents, sudden impact or surgical operations.\nChiropractic is a gentle, skilled hands-on approach which makes slight but specific adjustments to improve the mobility of the back which helps to improve the efficiency of the nervous system.\nIf a patient has a chronic or acute back problem, it is not always possible to correct or alleviate the pain in just one visit. Also you may need to carry out a set of corrective exercises in between visits.\u00a0 Even if a series of visits are necessary, you should definitely feel the benefit of a chiropractor\u2019s manipulation and adjustments after the first visit. Chiropractic techniques work without the use of drugs, which can often mask - rather than alleviate - pain, and work on the root cause of the pain with any given back problem the benefits can give long lasting and resolve problems.\u00a0\u00a0 In some cases there is a need to re-educate our posture or understand the way we use our backs in order to make eradicate or minimise pain in our lives.\nChiropractors in the UK undergo a four-year undergraduate and one-year post graduate course, which means patients presenting with a variety of muscular-skeletal problems can be assured of being in the hands \u2013 literally - of highly qualified healthcare professionals.\u00a0 It is also reassuring to know that all chiropractors are regulated by law and must be registered and approved by the General Chiropractic Council within the United Kingdom.\nFeatured Chiropractic Therapists\n"}], [{"score": 2277.28, "uuid": "827496b9-82cf-5e40-ac63-95d868a33952", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1704wb-57-30711", "target_hostname": "www.cherrycreekwellnesscenter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cherrycreekwellnesscenter.com/Services/Physical-Therapy/FAQs.php", "page_rank": 1.1815814e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> FAQs | <em>Physical</em> Therapist Facts Denver", "snippet": "If you are not sure <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em> <em>is</em> right <em>for</em> you, one of our therapists would be happy to discuss your situation with you. <em>What</em> kind of treatments does <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em> entail?", "explanation": null, "document": "Decreased range of motion\nWhat kind of treatments does physical therapy entail?\nPhysical therapists use various methods,\u00a0such as stretching the joint structures, massage,\u00a0and exercises to retrain muscles that have stopped working properly. Sometimes treatment will include\u00a0electrical stimulation to reduce pain or swelling or stimulate a muscle to contract; ultrasound to provide deep heat; and traction to\u00a0stretch the neck or low back region.\nIs physical therapy painful?\nPhysical therapy should not be painful. However, some techniques may cause mild, brief\u00a0discomfort during stretching or soft-tissue manipulation. Tell your therapist if you have\u00a0discomfort so he or\u00a0she\u00a0can adjust the treatment to\u00a0make it more comfortable.\nDoes health insurance cover physical therapy? What would I have to pay?\nMost health insurance plans cover physical therapy. Usually, each visit requires\u00a0a deductible and/or a co-payment or co-insurance. CCWC expects co-payments to be paid at each visit. Any remaining amounts not covered by your insurance company will be billed to you. We send out bills monthly, but often can't send you a bill until your insurance company has paid. Because many insurance companies delay paying us, we are not always able to get bills out to our patients as soon as we would like. If you have any questions about your bill, or if you have outstanding visits not yet paid by your insurance company, please do not hesitate to contact us.\nDo I need to be referred by my doctor?\nExcept for Medicare, most insurance plans\u00a0do not require a doctor\u2019s referral to start physical therapy. You can start your care with a physical therapist, and if he or she\u00a0finds reasons that indicate medical care, the therapist will\u00a0refer you to your primary care physician, urgent care center or the emergency room, depending on your problem. If you do not have a primary care physician, we can recommend one.\nWhat do I need to bring?\nOn your initial visit, please bring your doctor\u2019s prescription for physical therapy (if you have one), any applicable insurance referrals or referral numbers, your insurance card and any other appropriate billing information. If you have\u00a0operative reports, MRI or X-ray results, you may bring those as well. Also bring\u00a0any braces, splints or crutches that you use.\nWhat should I wear?\nAll physical therapy exams are private. We recommend that you\u00a0wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing. You may want to wear or bring shorts if we are treating an ankle or knee. We\u00a0have cloth gowns available if needed.\nWill I have to disrobe for any part of my treatment?\nIn some cases, your therapist may ask you\u00a0to change into a gown, similar to what you might wear at a doctor's office, to provide effective treatment and protect your own clothing. Women\u2019s health patients may need to disrobe for part of the treatment session. However, your therapist will take great care to keep you covered\u00a0appropriately.\nHow long is each visit?\nYour first visit \u2014 the initial evaluation \u2014 takes about 45-60 minutes. It generally also includes some treatment unless your evaluation was very complex. Follow-up visits will take between 30-60 minutes depending on your condition and where you are in your course of therapy.\nHow often are my treatments?\nAfter the initial evaluation, your physical therapist will determine the frequency and duration of your treatment\u00a0in coordination with your physician. How often and how long you need treatment\u00a0depend on the type and severity of\u00a0your condition. However, most patients come to therapy two or\u00a0three times a week at first and then less often as their condition improves.\nWhat should I expect during my initial visit?\nOn your first visit, the physical therapist will perform a thorough evaluation lasting approximately 45-60 minutes. She or he will collect\u00a0your medical\u00a0history and the history of your condition, perform an assessment of your posture, conduct neurological screening and other tests and measures to gain a\u00a0 specific understanding of your condition. Your physical therapist will use the information to decide on the probable outcome of your conditon and determine your treatment.She or\u00a0he will develop\u00a0a physical therapy rehabilitation program based on the problems identified and your personal goals.\nHow many visits will it take me to feel better?\nThis will depend on your diagnosis, prognosis and condition at the time you begin rehabilitation therapy. Generally, we can make you feel better in one to three\u00a0visits and get you to your goals within\u00a0eight visits. However,\u00a0patients recovering from surgery, those in severe pain or those with longstanding conditions may require significantly more visits.\nDo you do X-rays?\nNo. Physical therapists are not permitted to perform X-rays. However, if you have had X-rays, MRI scans or any other diagnostic imaging, please bring the report with you. This information will be helpful in planning your care.\nCan you prescribe medication?\nNo. Physical therapists are not licensed to prescribe medicine. However, if you are taking medicine, please let us know what you are taking, becasue many drugs affect the choice of treatments we use.\nWhat is a physical therapist assistant?\nPhysical therapist assistants, or PTAs, are skilled health care providers who work under the supervision of physical therapists.\u00a0PTAs help\u00a0the physical therapist\u00a0implement treatment programs, train patients in exercises and activities of daily living, conduct treatments and report to the physical therapist on the patient's responses.\nDo you provide any special services for women?\nYes. Physical therapy can be effective for prenatal and postpartum pain and dysfunction, after gynecological surgery, for incontinence / pelvic floor weakness and pelvic pain. Therapy for these conditions often consists of strengthening exercises and muscle stimulation. We have female physical therapists who are specially trained in this area of physical therapy.\nWhat can I do to get better while I'm at home?\nYour physical therapy treatment will include a home program that you carry out independently. Your\u00a0therapist will tailor a home program to help you improve your\u00a0condition and helps prevent your problem from coming back.\nWill I need follow-up or maintenance care?\nThe answer depends on the physical therapist's examination and evaluation. As you near the end of your course of physical therapy, your therapist will be better able to answer this question. Most patients need some type of maintenance plan. This is usually a home program provided by your PT. We also have several wellness options to help you stay healthy, prevent the reccurrence of your current problem and the development of new problems.\nThese options include\u00a0massage therapy, Pilates (private sessions and classes) and personal training. All of these practitioners work closely with our physical therapists and can\u00a0help develop a wellness program specific to you and your needs. Please ask your therapist about what CCWC has\u00a0to offer\u00a0once you finish your course of physical therapy.\nWhat if I need to return to physical therapy?\nIf your problem returns after you leave physical therapy, give us a call\nand schedule another appointment with your Therapist. They can do a quick re-evaluation and determine if you just need a little more time in therapy or if you need to be referred back to your doctor. In some cases, you will need to obtain a new prescription from your doctor depending on your health insurance. Our front office staff should be able to assist you in determining if you need one.\nWhat is my responsibility in physical therapy?\nYou are ultimately responsible for your success in\u00a0your physical therapy program. Your physical therapist can't do it without your active participation. We can provide you with the tools to recover and stay healthy, but we ask that you cooperate by following through with\u00a0your home exercise programs and instructions.\nIs it OK to ask my doctor about physical therapy?\nAbsolutely! You can give your doctor a call or see him/her for an evaluation before or after coming to physical therapy. If your physician is not sure that physical therapy could help your condition, we invite him or her\u00a0to contact us to discuss your situation and what we offer. If you have a problem that you think can be helped with physical therapy, give us a call\n. After discussing your\u00a0problem, we can give you an\u00a0idea as to whether it can be managed by physical therapy.\nHow do I arrange an appointment?\nSimply call our office at 303-333-3493 and select the clinic most convenient for you.

They also become part of your medical record. Multiple missed visits may result in discharge from care, with a note to your physician.\nLet us know when you will return to see your physician. We\u00a0will prepare a progress report and send it to your physician so she/he has\u00a0for your visit.\nHow is Cherry Creek Wellness Center different from other physical therapy clinics? Why choose CCWC?\nMany physical therapy clinics have their therapists see multiple patients at one time. At CCWC, you see your physical therapist individually, and you always see the same physical therapist.\nAll of our physical therapists have extensive training in manual therapy, soft-tissue treatment and Pilates. Our therapists continually\u00a0expand their education and are always learning.

Alicia Swan has been a phenomenal help and blessing to me, working not only on getting my joints and muscles moving again, but perhaps even more so in rebuilding my confidence and changing my mindset about reinjuring my lower back. The benefits were immediately felt, and I have seen steady and, to my mind at least, remarkable progress since then. Alicia has been amazing in building up a program for me and graciously supportive through all of it. To me, it has been life altering. I feel better than I have in several years, and, while not pain free, I now know what to do about it and how to keep that beast in its proper cage. In addition to Alicia, the entire staff were supportive and friendly. I would highly recommend any of them to you, these people know what they are doing.\nGary Menger\nBernardine, words alone can not fully express the tremendous gratitude I have for both you and the entire staff at Newbury Park Physical Therapy in getting me back into shape after not ONE but TWO total hip replacement operations (both sides) last year.

I was now 52 years old and not happy about finding someone new. I came across an advertisement of Dr. Chickara's who was just starting his practice in Freehold and offering a complementary consultation. We met and had a long conversation about my condition. I was very interested because his method of treatment is very \"hands on\" which is what I was familiar with. Over the last 3 years of being with Dr. Chickara, I not only respect his knowledge but the fact that is also concerned about his patient's overall well being. I never feel dismissed or rushed but comfortable in knowing he and his staff are truly concerned. There are times when I leave his office after being treated and not feeling well and he has called to find out how I am.\nDr. Chickara is always finding new ways to improve his patients well being with updated equipment and technology. He takes the time to explain each new piece of equipment and always makes it clear that he will do what you are comfortable with or whenever you are ready to try something new.\nMy husband and I are truly grateful for having found Dr. Chickara. We have recommended him to several of our friends and family and they have nothing but praise for the level of care they received.\nWe thank you Dr. Chickara.

It will provide you with answers to some commonly asked questions in advance of your first visit. If you have a different question that need an immediate response please ask us by phone or email.\nWhat should I expect on my first visit?\nOn your first visit, your physical therapist will perform an evaluation to determine what deficits and/or problems you have that can be addressed with physical therapy. The evaluation involves a thorough history, objective testing and measuring, following which your physical therapist will form an opinion about the specific cause of your problems. A treatment program will be developed aimed at resolving the problems identified, as well as to attain the goals set by the physical therapist in conjunction with the patient.\nWhat types of treatment may I receive?\nThe treatment you receive in physical therapy will depend upon what the physical therapist finds in the evaluation. Our treatment programs are mechanically oriented with a non-dependent therapeutic approach. We emphasize mobilization, self-treatment, and therapeutic exercise to go right to the structure at fault and resolve the problem. We do not emphasize \"feel good\" modalities, such as massage, ultrasound, heat, electrical stimulation, etc., which usually do little to address the underlying pathology and can cause patient dependence. We do utilize modalities as needed to assist us with anti-inflammatory effects, etc.\nHow long will my visit last?\nTreatment time will vary according to what the physical therapist finds in the evaluation. There is no specific time limit for physical therapy. Whatever is found to be appropriate during the evaluation will become part of the patient's program and the program will be updated as appropriate as the patient improves. On average, most physical therapy treatments last about 1 hour with somewhat longer time being necessary for this first visit because of the time required to do an examination.\nHow is my progress measured?\nBecause your physical therapist will perform a meticulous evaluation, quantifying and qualifying all the deficits and problems you are presenting with, re-evaluation, and re-measurement to determine progress are typically done. You will be re-evaluated on a periodic basis, the frequency of which will depend upon your diagnosis and the chronicity of the problem. In general, patients are re-evaluated at 2 to 6 week intervals. Additionally, you need to always make the therapist aware of any follow-up visits you may have scheduled with your physician. This way we can keep them updated on your progress in physical therapy.\nHow will you communicate with my physician?\nYour physical therapist will communicate with your physician most commonly by written report. The physical therapist will send a complete written report outlining the findings of their initial evaluation as well as their assessment of the problem and an outline of the general treatment and frequency with which they intend to see you. The physical therapist will continue to update your physician with written reports as appropriate and most specifically prior to your return to the physician. This is why it is so important that you let your therapist know if you have an appointment with your physician. Additionally, the therapist will, as they feel appropriate, contact the physician by phone if they have a specific concern or question. At the end of your treatment the physical therapist will send a follow-up report to your physician with final information as to your status at the time of discharge from physical therapy.\nWill I need follow-up or maintenance care?\nOur goal is to resolve your problem completely so that you don't require continual follow-up or maintenance care. Infrequently, there are some patients who do require follow-up care or re-assessment on a periodic basis, but that would be discussed with you once you are in physical therapy or at discharge.\nWhat if I need to return to physical therapy?\nIf you have a recurrent problem after your discharge from physical therapy, a possible return to physical therapy will depend on a number of factors. It depends on if there was a re-injury of the same problem, how long it has been since you were last in physical therapy and how long it's been since you saw the physician, among other things. In general, if you are discharged from physical therapy and feel the need to return, you should contact the physical therapist who treated you. They will review your chart and advise you of what should be done after speaking with you.\nWhen is the best time to start physical therapy?\nIn general starting physical therapy should be done as early as possible. Initiating physical therapy early will reduce the overall treatment time that you will require by not allowing the problem to become chronic. If you are in pain and or you are in an acute state, your program will be modified according to your signs and symptoms. What is done for you in physical therapy depends on the clinical stage you are presenting in, not just the diagnosis. Therefore, your care will be modified according to the signs and symptoms during any acute, subacute, or chronic phases of your problem.\nIs it OK to ask my doctor about physical therapy?\nAbsolutely. If you have a problem that you think can be helped with physical therapy, feel free to give us a call. After speaking with you about your specific problem, we can give you a better idea if it is something that is treatable with physical therapy. You can also give your doctor a call. If not sure, he/she is welcome to contact us as well. In today's healthcare environment, if you feel physical therapy can be helpful to you, you may need to stress your feelings to the doctor you are seeing.\nWill my insurance cover physical therapy?\nBecause of today's health care environment and the wide variety of plans available, although most insurance companies do cover physical therapy, how many visits they cover may vary. Please review our billing and insurance participation section on this web site and if you have additional questions regarding your specific insurance coverage give us a call.\n"}, {"score": 2259.998, "uuid": "3b6d1ee3-3b76-5e98-993c-d4856edd4175", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0702wb-40-23334", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/treatments/physical-therapy/physical-therapy-questions-answers", "page_rank": 1.1777117e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>: Questions and Answers", "snippet": "<em>Physical</em> <em>therapy</em> <em>is</em> often prescribed <em>for</em> patients following spine surgery, to treat soft tissue trauma, nerve inflammation&#x2F;injury, muscle spasms, fractures, arthritis, and many other problems.

Patients learn about how their spine works, proper body mechanics, common disorders and their causes, benefits of good posture, importance of physical fitness and its relationship to injury and disease prevention.\nWho are physical therapists?\nPhysical therapists are licensed healthcare professionals. Prior to practicing, they must obtain either a bachelor's or master's degree in physical therapy and pass an examination to be licensed. Their didactic and clinical training includes (but is not limited to) anatomy, kinesiology (study of movement), study of disease and injury, healing and recovery, and a myriad of therapeutic treatment techniques. Therapists practice in hospitals, outpatient clinics, rehab centers, home healthcare agencies (serving homebound patients), and private practice.\nWhat does the physical therapist do?\nThe physical therapist talks to the patient and evaluates their condition by testing joint motion, muscle strength, cardiovascular function, reflexes, and functional skills. If a physician referred the patient, the therapist will review the prescription along with the patient's records. After necessary information has been gathered, the physical therapist designs a treatment plan to fit the patient's needs and goals. The therapist and patient will work together as a team toward wellness.\nIs physical therapy painful?\nSometimes PT is uncomfortable or painful. However, the therapist has treatments available that can help minimize pain. As muscles are stretched and exercised, it is only natural to experience some soreness. As therapy progresses, range of motion increases, strength and soreness diminishes. In general, patients feel better following therapy and look forward to the next session.\nHow long does a therapy session last?\nThe amount of time needed depends on the type of therapy involved. For example, it may take one patient longer to complete their therapeutic exercises than another. Also, as a patient makes progress, their treatment plan is adjusted.\nUpdated on: 01/12/10\n"}, {"score": 2242.3313, "uuid": "17b959fd-dddc-5a5e-894e-1c70b564b551", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-42-21846", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/degenerative-disc/physical-therapy-degenerative-disc-disease", "page_rank": 1.2439328e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> <em>for</em> Degenerative Disc Disease", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> all part of the &quot;self-care&quot; <em>or</em> &quot;self-treatment&quot; aspect of <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>: Through <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take <em>better</em> care of your body. Your <em>physical</em> therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program <em>for</em> you.", "explanation": null, "document": "What is a Physical Therapist?\nDeep tissue massage: This technique targets spasms and chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress. You could also have spasms or muscle tension because of strains or sprains. The therapist uses direct pressure and friction to try to release the tension in your soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles).\nHot and cold therapies: Your physical therapist will alternate between hot and cold therapies. By using heat, the physical therapist seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood flow brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to remove waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing.\nCold therapy, also called cryotherapy, slows circulation, helping to reduce inflammation, muscle spasms, and pain. You may have a cold pack placed upon the target area, or even be given an ice massage. Another cryotherapy option is a spray called fluoromethane that cools the tissues. After cold therapy, your therapist may work with you to stretch the affected muscles.\nSpinal traction: By stretching the back, spinal traction works to alleviate pain caused by muscle tightness or compressed nerves. The therapist can do that manually (by using his or her own body) or mechanically (with special machines). Especially if your nerve is being pinched by the foramen\u2014the area where the nerve exits the spinal canal\u2014your therapist may try traction. It's thought to widen the foramen by stretching the spine to readjust the vertebrae.\nActive Treatments\nIn the active part of physical therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your joints move). Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking into consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable for another person with DDD.\nDDD won't ever entirely \"go away\"\u2014once your discs start to degenerate, you can't reverse that process\u2014and because of that, your physical therapist will help you learn how to work around it and how to limit the pain. You'll learn about body mechanics and how to avoid positions that cause pain.\nIf needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate ergonomic principles into your daily activities. This is all part of the \"self-care\" or \"self-treatment\" aspect of physical therapy: Through physical therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take better care of your body.\nYour physical therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program for you. The goals may include: strengthening abdominal and back muscles, increasing muscle endurance (so that your stronger muscles can work harder longer), and getting your body to carry your weight more efficiently. An exercise program comes with another bonus\u2014it may help you lose weight. Extra weight can exacerbate pain from DDD, so if you need to lose weight, your physical therapist can work with you to set goals and then follow through.\nUpdated on: 06/16/11\n"}, {"score": 2258.0342, "uuid": "ac0e0f7a-f1d5-5fd5-847d-89c899708c05", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1506wb-88-10188", "target_hostname": "www.fischerphysicaltherapy.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fischerphysicaltherapy.com/faq", "page_rank": 1.4294698e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Fischer <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> | Faq", "snippet": "I&#x27;ve heard a lot about massage and <em>chiropractic</em>, but <em>what</em> <em>is</em> <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>? <em>Physical</em> Therapists are professionally educated at a university level and hold a Bachelors, Masters, <em>or</em> Doctorate degree in <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>. They are licensed in the state they practice.", "explanation": null, "document": "22. Will I need to do exercises as part of my physical therapy program?\nYes. For best results, we typically prescribe exercises which can be done at home or at work to address the long-lasting issues of muscle balance, stabilization, and posture that are often a significant contribution. Exercises given for this purpose are customized for the individual needs of each patient.\n23. I work out regularly at the gym with a personal trainer and yoga instructor. I have been given some stretches to perform for my chronic muscle tension. What is the difference between personal trainers or yoga instructors and physical therapists?\nPhysical therapists receive a degree from an accredited university and pursue extensive education on how to treat a variety of diagnoses. In addition, physical therapists must pass an extensive board exam and be licensed in the state where they practice. Physical Therapist's place special emphasis on the influence of many physiological systems' contribution to health and dysfunction.\n24. Do you treat the part of me that hurts or the whole body?\nWe evaluate the entire body with each patient on a variety of levels. We look at not just direct influences to your pain but also the more hidden, indirect ones. It is common for us to treat parts of the body distant from the source of the pain to create optimal outcomes. The vast array of these interventions is essential to good care and lasting results.\n25. When is my condition considered chronic? Is chronic pain something you just have to live with? How can Fischer Physical Therapy help?\nChronic pain is that pain which no longer serves a biological function, thus providing no real physical purpose. Pain is generally classified as \"chronic\" after it fails to resolve after 3 months.\nChronic pain is complex and is often misunderstood. People who experience chronic pain may be led to believe it is \"in their heads\" or it can only be managed with pain relievers.\nAt Fischer Physical Therapy, we have seen consistent and long-term improvements and resolution of a multitude of chronic pain conditions, including headaches and spine-related problems. For this to occur, treatments must involve skilled, specific hands-on interventions which gradually progress into active movement. A holistic approach is essential. Our physical therapists routinely progress chronic pain patients out of pain and on a road to a vital and active lifestyle.\n26. How does your hands-on manual therapy approach influence the healing process?\nThe manual therapy approaches we use are highly specific to the needs of the body on many levels. Skilled hands are the best \"tools\" on earth to both assess and correct dysfunctions in the body. Exercise approaches alone do not have the ability to address problems with the same specificity. Additionally, the manual techniques we use are much more specialized than traditional massage. A complete listing of the manual techniques we use can be found on our services page.\nWe use an eclectic approach often integrating several techniques in each treatment. Primal Reflex Release Technique provides us an amazing way to assess and balance the autonomic nervous system by releasing dysfunctional reflex activity which is related to your pain. Other techniques remove barriers to joint/fascial mobility and restore natural energy flow. The end result is improved circulation, enhanced tissue oxygenation, removal of waste products, detoxification, elimination of spasm, and positive hormonal influence.\n"}, {"score": 2255.6216, "uuid": "11aba31b-dc6e-52c0-b081-685cffeeb058", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1211wb-98-05958", "target_hostname": "www.drshanab.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drshanab.com/services/Microcurrent_Therapy.htm", "page_rank": 1.355846e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Microcurrent <em>Therapy</em>, Bridgeview <em>Chiropractic</em>, IL", "snippet": "Electrical muscle stimulation <em>is</em> excellent <em>for</em> acute <em>or</em> chronic <em>pain</em>, as well as strains <em>or</em> sprains of the muscles, joints, and soft tissues of the spine and extremities.", "explanation": null, "document": "Our Services\nMicrocurrent Therapy\nMicrocurrent Therapy is an exceptional way to help heal the body, namely soft tissues.

You've gone to your internist. You've gotten a diagnosis and possibly medications and an injection. Still it hurts. You're ready to try just about anything. Alternative therapies are effective and can often be used in conjunction with conventional medical treatments .\nJust as conventional medical treatment must be individualized, alternative therapies tend to lend themselves to specific conditions. Some of my patients use several and they say that each therapy helps in its own way.\nMusculoskeletal Pain: The most common and shortest-term back pain is often caused by the out-of-condition back doing normal things, or the conditioned back doing extraordinary things. If you've strained a muscle or aren't properly aligned, alternative therapies such as physical therapy (PT), Feldenkrais, and yoga will gradually soothe you. Feldenkrais (which is minimal movement, analogous to minimal music) promotes proper use of the proper muscles. Massage may also be a good idea, but be careful; if you have a neurological problem, massage may make you worse.\nHerniated Disk: The McKenzie technique of physical therapy works to draw the offending material from behind the vertebrae, where the nerves are, and out of harm's way over 75 percent of the time. Even large disk herniations that may suggest a need for surgery can respond to physical therapy within a few weeks. By properly arching the back, a partial vacuum develops in front of the herniation. The disk reacts by moving the herniated material toward the vacuum, lowering pressure on the nerve. While you're waiting for McKenzie physical therapy to work its magic, acupuncture can reduce the pain.\nPiriformis Syndrome: This is a combination of muscles and nerves. The piriformis muscle in the buttock contracts and compresses the sciatic nerve, so the symptoms are neurological -- sciatica -- but the cause is in the muscle. After a steroid injection, yoga and physical therapy are quite effective in stretching the muscle and teaching you to relax it yourself. Acupuncture can sometimes expedite the healing process.\nSacroiliac Joint Derangement: The last lumbar vertebra fits into the sacrum, and the sacrum fits into the iliac bones, the two bones that wrap around the pelvis. When there is misalignment, there is lots of severe pain. Most establishment doctors aren't as good at diagnosing and treating this as osteopaths, chiropractors and PTs., so it might be a good idea to go to these professionals. Acupuncture, Feldenkrais and yoga can augment injections, pain patches and non-steroidals.\nSpondylolisthesis: In Greek: 'listhesis' means slipping. In your back, one vertebra slides out of alignment. It usually slips forward, but sometimes back or to one side or the other. It's a radiological diagnosis, and state-of-the-art EMG techniques can determine if that's your problem. PT to strengthen abdominal muscles (front back and sides) and possibly an abdominal binder are good treatments, but some yoga also helps, as does Alexander Technique, which can work wonders with posture.\nSpinal Stenosis: This is where the canal inside the spine gets too narrow, compressing nerves. You may need an MRI to be sure of the diagnosis. Posture is the best conservative solution -- Alexander Technique is probably the single best treatment, though PT is helpful too. Stenosis may worsen inexorably over time, and then it's one condition where surgery may be the best option.\nArthritis: The little joints in the spine -- the facets -- have the components that are structurally like knees and shoulders, which are other favorite sites for arthritis. And like knees and shoulders, facet joints are also vulnerable to intense pain. You can't stop arthritis, but you can slow it down. Conventional non-steroidals and more sophisticated anti-inflammatories are a great help, as is acupuncture. There are physical therapists who specialize in this condition. Yoga will improve your range of motion, and there are some good studies that suggest yoga is an effective anti-inflammatory.\nChronic Pain\nYour back is killing you. You've gone to your internist.

I feel like a truck ran over me when I wake up in the morning. These are the most common complaints of patients suffering from a condition known as fibromyalgia. In addition to widespread pain, patients with fibromyalgia also report a wide range of other symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, depression, stiffness, and mental fog to name just a few.\nPatients with fibromyalgia feel sensations like touch and temperature (hot and cold) louder and longer than people who don't have fibromyalgia. Normal sensations feel uncomfortable or even painful to them. And the awareness of those sensations lasts longer than in other folks.\nTwenty years ago, fibromyalgia was recognized by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as a real biologic problem and not just an imagined or psychologic disorder. That brought an increased attention to this condition. Since then, many studies have been done to understand the underlying basis for the problem and to find a way to effectively treat it.\nIn this report, two physicians from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine present an in-depth update on the latest findings in the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia. Let's start with what causes it. In a nutshell, we still don't know. The pathology has been narrowed down to an abnormal processing of pain signals. It appears that the entire nervous system and its connections to other systems is involved.\nStudies have shown there are neuroendocrine, biochemical, and genetic abnormalities. But not all fibromyalgia patients have the same symptoms, responses to pain or other stimuli, genetic links, or altered hormones. So, finding one treatment that will be equally effective for everyone remains a challenge.\nStress seems to have a role in fibromyalgia. Symptoms are certainly aggravated or made worse by emotional, psychologic, or physical stress. There's some evidence that communication between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands is altered in patients with fibromyalgia. The proper functioning of these three areas is essential to a normal response to stress that doesn't lead to physiologic dysfunction.\nMost experts agree that a combined approach using medications, cognitive and behavioral therapy, exercise, and complementary approaches is best. This mode of treatment is referred to as multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary. Scientists are still working to identify what form of treatment, in what order, and combined with what other treatments results in the most favorable outcomes.\nPhysicians are advised to listen to the patient's report of symptoms and choose treatments that will reduce (or eliminate) the most bothersome ones first. So far, studies have shown that exercise is a key therapy for everyone. Too much, too soon can aggravate symptoms. Patients are carefully guided by a Physical Therapist through a progressive but individualized program of strength training, endurance, and flexibility.\nExercise is combined with medications, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acupuncture or hypnotherapy, and biofeedback/relaxation training. If these methods don't help (or don't help enough), then the patient may want to try chiropractic care, massage therapy, or Physical Therapy modalities such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation.\nThere are several different types of medications used with fibromyalgia patients. Most of these work at the level of the nervous system to alter pain signals. These include antidepressants, antiepileptics, analgesics (pain relievers), and sometimes muscle relaxants. It may take some time to find the right drug in the most effective dose to calm symptoms without adding unwanted side effects. The use of vitamin supplements, hormones, herbs, and thyroid medication are under investigation.\nWhatever treatment approach is taken, patients must be questioned about results to measure a response to treatment. For example, surveys of pain levels (frequency, intensity, and duration) and assessment of tender points are often used to measure outcomes.\nMost treatment is by trial and error. If the chosen treatment isn't having the desired effect(s), then something else can be tried. Any reduction in global pain score and tender points is a step in the right direction. Improved mood, better sleep patterns, fewer headaches, and improved quality of life are all much appreciated by these patients.\nReference:Cheryl Bernstein, MD, and Dawn Marcus, MD.

I never imagined that I would be out of back pain. I had been suffering with it for so long I believed that was the way it was going to be for the rest of my life. When I was referred to your office I did have doubts. I had supposedly seen a McKenzie therapist before- boy, was I wrong. The methods you used were definitely more involved. You and your staff were all very kind and caring. You have given my life back to my family and me. Thank you!\nI had lower back pain on and off for 10 years. The last 2 years I have been in constant pain. I had seen a chiropractor, a neurosurgeon, and a physical therapist and have had steroid injections. With all that, I had little to no relief of pain and it was getting worse. In October 2011 I was told by my neurosurgeon that my only option was to do a spinal fusion. I was devastated. I'm in my mid-thirties and had no choices except surgery. I was referred to Maccio Physical Therapy by my sister who works with Mr. Maccio's wife. With some hesitation I scheduled an appointment. After a few appointments I started to get relief: I was amazed. I had a little set back and I started to get discouraged. Mr. Maccio never gave up; he was very patient, kind and caring. The methods that Mr. Maccio taught were very different from the prior treatment I had. He has given me the tools so I can control and manage my back pain myself. This is the greatest feeling of accomplishment. I just want to let other people know that you always have options, and should always get more than one opinion before making a major decision such as surgery. I am so glad that I did.\"\nKeri 1/12\nBack\n\"When I came to Maccio, it had been more than two years since my back surgery - and I still hadn't recovered. I reherniated the same disc I had surgery on and I was in so much pain I could not sit for the length of a movie. My surgeon told me to 'Cultivate couch activities' and said I should give up on skiing and hiking - my favorite pastimes. I asked him if physical therapy would help, and he said it was useless. But I couldn't bear the thought of never hiking again, and it hurt too much to even walk up a paved hill. When my cousin said the McKenzie Method worked for her, I gave Maccio a call...and in less than a month I can move again! I went to movies and actually enjoyed them instead of getting up to stand in back. I started running again. Finally, I went on a 24-hour road trip and faithfully did my stretches at every rest stop - and my back never hurt! Now, I'm slowly increasing core strength and I intend to return to hiking slowly and carefully, but with the confidence of knowing that the McKenzie exercises will immediately be able to resolve any pain I feel. These exercises have given me back my life.\"\nKathleen\n\"In August of 2010, I was in a car accident and experienced bad pain in my lower back. I was referred to a neurosurgeon by the emergency room. After X-Rays, MRIs, and CT scans I was sent to physical therapy. By December, I was no better. My primary doctor sent me to a chiropractor. I felt relief from that for a few hours after the appointment but by the evening, my normal back pain returned. I went back to the neurosurgeon in May of 2011 and said the pain was still there and now radiating down my leg, and something needs to be done. I was told that I should try steroid injections. I had a CT scan after the injections didn't help either and was told I needed a spinal fusion. I saw my primary doctor again and she referred me to a second neurosurgeon who said surgery wouldn't help. After a weekend of complete confusion, I asked my primary to send me to a third neurosurgeon for one last opinion. He said surgery wouldn't help me and said I needed physical therapy again. I was skeptical since I had already tried it for five months and it did nothing for me, but I went anyway. I called Maccio Physical Therapy and had an appointment the same week. After two days, the pain in my leg was gone and after three weeks of the McKenzie Method, I am close to having my normal life back with my two-year-old son! I'm so grateful I went for a second and third opinion! Maccio has really helped me to get my quality of life back to what it was last spring!\"\nKristi\nWhen one of my kidneys was removed because of cancer I could no longer take the anti-inflammatory medications I had used for avoiding pain due to arthritis in my spine. Several doctors recommended pain medications that would preclude my driving or operating machinery and therefore cause a complete change in the way I live. Other doctors prescribed physical therapy which I had tried without success. I found Joe Maccio's clinic on the McKenzie Method website and soon afterward I began treatment.\nThe McKenzie Method is simple. The exercises are not the kind of thing I had expected to find based on past experiences with physical therapy. Joe introduced me to an easy, comfortable, end effective method of improving my physical abilities and controlling pain without my having to use medications which would force me to change my lifestyle. Based in my experience, I advise anyone whose doctor recommends the McKenzie Method to follow that advice. I can report that people at Maccio Physical Therapy were kind, caring, and professional in all aspects of my experience at their clinic. I am nearly pain-free and I am able to do many of the things that bring pleasure and satisfaction into my life. I take particular pleasure in thanking Joe and all of the staff at Maccio Physical Therapy for enabling me to continue in a productive and comfortable life.\nRichard\nFirst of all, I would like to thank my doctor for suggesting physical therapy to eliminate the pain in my left leg which was getting worse each morning and also keeping me awake when the pain surfaced at 3 AM. This pain in the leg was somehow connected to the low back pain which I thought I had to live with. After 10 or so sessions of physical therapy at Maccio Physical Therapy, I am a new person. With help, I am now able to climb stairs easily one foot after the other. The low back pain is gone as well as the leg pain. I was guided through exercises using my core body which improved my walking greatly. I feel very good now and would recommend Maccio for anyone needing physical therapy. Incidentally, I am 83-years-old but now I feel like a new 60, pain free!\nIrene\nI came for back and leg pain from spinal stenosis and the pain was so bad, I couldn't even walk. I was helped by Ruth and Joe and what they gave me to do really helped lessen my pain. If I hadn't had physical therapy, I would probably never be able to walk without a walker or cane again. Thanks to these people, they were really great and got me back on my feet again.\nRosalind\nBefore starting physical therapy, my mobility was limited, and I spent much of my time lying down. This very much limited my physical work, remodeling, construction, etc. Nothing prior to PT worked, as I had injections in my SI joint and L4-L5 joints in my back. They had no effect and were expensive! I had no more than 20 minutes of relief after chiropractic adjustments. The only positive treatment has been PT. I had stopped taking any pain medication and my blood levels are back to normal. I can't tell enough people how professional and helpful physical therapy has been.\nPaul\nI began the McKenzie Method of physical therapy on May 14th, 2010. My primary physician recommended that I do this to alleviate the back and leg pain I was having from degenerative disc disease. My pain level was at a 10! I learned about the centralization techniques to get the pain out of my leg and into my back. After only 8 visits, I had completely centralized and I was pain-free! This technique will now be part of a new lifestyle for me.\nPatricia\nI could not sit, I could not stand nor walk without a helping hand--all bent over with awful pain. I thought I'd never walk again. There was treatment abroad known as PT--Good for the young, but not for me. 'Not so, not so,' said my new friend Joe. 'Just do as we say and you'll be good to go.' Knee pulls and leg stretch and time on the stim. Fancy machines and rocking and bends. Over and over, it was always the same. 'Til one fine day, I ditched the cane!. So while PT's an option for the young and the bold. Thank God it is here for we who are old!\nGeraldine\nAfter two years of recurring back episodes, my primary physician urged me to try Maccio Physical Therapy. After a very short time, I've experienced a relief I haven't had in quite some time. However, the aspect of my rehab that really makes me happy is knowing I have the tools to control my back pain if it ever comes again. Great, friendly, knowledgeable staff!\nJohn\nFor the past 6 weeks. I've been undergoing physical therapy with Maccio. Since this treatment I have stopped taking pills because I can use stretches to subside the pain. My quality of life both physically and mentally have improved over the last six weeks. I've been suffering with this pain for five months now and I feel that I'm having great results with this physical therapy!\nDavid\nAs I have never gone through physical therapy, I was pleasantly surprised to find that now I can do all my normal routine daily activities. Following my exercises each day, I found the pain lessening each day until it was gone! I will continue the recommended exercises as Joe Jr. mentioned to avoid any further problems. Hopefully I will be able to get on with my life thanks to Joe.\nMichelle\nIn first coming to Maccio PT, I was in a lot of pain doing everyday things that were necessary to function such as sitting, standing, and sleeping. After being hit by a car, my lower back really crippled me. Progressing through physical therapy, my back became better, but my hip began to become very uncomfortable. This was discouraging, but Maccio PT kept the mood and motivation high. They didn't give up and now the problem is fixed! Now I feel much better and I am working to get my strength back and resume my previous active lifestyle.\nMadelyn\nMy doctor had prescribed pain medication that did not work and I had the option to do pain management or physical therapy. When I first came for physical therapy, I had my doubts that it would work. My pain was so severe I couldn't sit or sleep. Some exercises worked great, others did not. Once we found the exercises that would help, I couldn't believe the changes! I was able to sit without any pain and my walking is comfortable again. I'm so happy I went with physical therapy, I never thought I'd be pain-free again and the exercises worked unbelievably well. I would definitely recommend Maccio Physical Therpay.\nJoAnn\nNeck\nI have been in constant pain for over 10 years due to trauma to my neck. Pain and reduced mobility affected everything I did. Under the care of a neurosurgeon, I began injections in the disks to reduce swelling and relieve pain in my neck. I met Joe at a health fair at just about the same time. The injections seemed to cause more pain so I stopped going for the shots after the second round and kept with the physical therapy. I now am pain free and have more mobility that I have had in years.\nDean\nWhen I first visited Maccio Physical Therapy, I was suffering from headaches and an aching lower back. I had been involved in a car accident a week prior to my visit and my body still had not recovered from the tossing is sustained. I came to see Joe because I was referred by a doctor friend in Chicago - Joe practices the McKenzie method and teaches patients to care for themselves. I liked being an active partner in my recovery. I am now headache free. My lower back doesn't hurt. I am mindful of my posture and have tools to practice if I find myself in discomfort. Thank you!\nStacey\nWith physical therapy, my terrible headaches have gone! I was really down about them when they told me I was too old for an operation. I am so glad PT was suggested. I was here for the McKenzie Method for my back and it worked. Thank you all so much!\nJoan\nExtremity\nWhen I first started therapy, I was ready to quit my job and just give up on all activities that involved using my left hand and arm. I was in such severe pain that I thought I would need pain medication and surgery. Who would believe that all I had to do was stretch and exercise the muscles in my neck and shoulders! In a couple of months, my pain was nil and my posture had improved significantly! Thanks to all.\nDonna\nI was diagnosed with a shoulder impingement which caused loss of range of motion in my elbow from an injury many years ago. Upon completing PT, both conditions are vastly improved thanks to a series of simple, quick exercises. I think the underlying conditions were accurately diagnosed and the treatments effective. I was relieved I will not have to resort to more radical treatments, like surgery. I addition, I was advised of corrections and modifications to my free weight workouts, this has improved the safety and efficiency of the training.\nElliot\nI've suffered from plantar fasciitis for two years. The worst time of day was always getting out of bed and I'd hobble around for 15-20 minutes until the pain subsided. When I went to an appointment with Joe Maccio for a separate issue, I mentioned my plantar fasciitis and how frustrated I had become with the persistence of the condition. Joe gave me an exercise to do each hour and one day later, I was got out of bed with no pain. Relief finally! Thanks!\nPatricia\nBalance and Vestibular\nWhen I first came to physical therapy I was falling on a regular basis over a period of about 6 months. This had significantly altered my ability to function and I was very apprehensive. After completing my physical therapy, my balance and stability have greatly improved and my scores have increased by 79%. This has resulted in a renewed confidence in my ability to walk and carry on in my daily life.\nRuth\nAfter a recommendation from my physician to Maccio Phsycial Therapy with a diagnosis of vertigo, I am happy to say I am absolutely satisfied with the results. I was given an appointment the same day, tested and treated. At the second visit, my dizziness is completely gone! I would highly recommend Joe Maccio and his associates for their expertise, professionalism, and personal concern to the patient.\nLynne\nWhen I came here I was very unsteady on my feed due to vertigo - and I though nothing could improve it. Now, after coming to Maccio's, I can do many things without becoming disoriented. In fact, my goal is to be able to play golf this summer! Thank you for getting me back my life like it was before!\nMillie\n"}, {"score": 2236.1494, "uuid": "1de6a55f-7910-5fe5-a56d-2f7d75087019", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500wb-70-01384", "target_hostname": "www.brillpt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.brillpt.com/testimonials", "page_rank": 1.6822419e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Brill <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> | Testimonials", "snippet": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Home \u2022 <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> New York City \u2022 <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Manhattan \u2022 <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Midtown NYC \u2022 <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Downtown NYC \u2022 Sitemap", "explanation": null, "document": "Testimonials\n\"Congratulations on the release of your book. It is amazing because you are amazing and your commitment to people and their well being is so powerful! My back is doing GREAT!!! I can\u0092t thank you enough. You are going to change more lives.\"\nNiya\nNew York, NY\n\"I am a 51 year old male who purchased your book by mistake. I didn't realize it was for women until I got home, but thought I'd give the core exercises a try anyway. I'm not making this up and what I'll tell you is absolutely true. For several years I have truly suffered from low back pain from an injury incurred while squatting heavy weights (I was a powerlifter).\nThis pain was constant and severely debilitating, and interfered in every aspect of my life. ONE SINGLE SESSION of the core exercises relieved that pain COMPLETELY for several hours until I had been standing in a bookstore for about an hour. But it was not nearly as intense. Day 2 - pain free again. I don't know how to thank you for this. I am so happy.\"\nMike Georges\n\"I arrived at the door of Brill Physical Therapy about two years ago. Khaled Nasr was assigned to my torn meniscus and my extra 50 pounds. With gentle encouragement and patience, Khaled set small goals for me, goals which were achievable and manageable. He allowed me to experience what it would feel like to once again be physically fit and strong, and encouraged me to be proud of these accomplishments. He also showed me the full color Google images of knee replacement surgery, without editorial commentary. It worked. So two years and 50 pounds lighter, much stronger, very fit and with a knee that will withstand fencing lessons, I am forever grateful to him.\"\nK. McCarthy\n\"Just had to praise Peggy's wonderful book. The exercises are wonderful and I really do feel much, much better.\"\n-Donna\nEasley, SC\n\"I read The Core Program and started doing the exercises 4 weeks ago. I have to say that for me this is truly the best thing since 'sliced bread'. The reason I chose to do this was because I was always feeling drained and tired. It really worried me because quite often even lifting my arms in the shower to wash my hair seemed like way too much effort (I'm only 37). After reading the first chapter of your book on Amazon.com, I just had to try it and have found that the program lives up to its promises.\nAfter the first 'workout' I already had more energy and it just keeps getting better everyday. And as a wonderful bonus, I notice my body is getting toned up everywhere. All I can say is THANK YOU! I feel awesome now and sail through my days with tons of energy - this is exactly what I needed! I had originally borrowed your book from the library, but have since purchased it and am telling everyone about how beneficial your program is and how easy it is to do.\"\n-Frances\nHillsburgh, ON\n\"I found your book, The Core Program to be amazing and very informative. Some exercises I had been doing I will now eliminate due your explanation of the harmful effects they cause.\"\n-Carolyn\nLos Angeles, CA\n\"I have just begun to read your book, and I am very impressed! Thank you for your contribution to womens' health.\"\n-Kay\nMartinez, GA\n\"My sisters and I have all bought your books. Your exercises have helped me tremendously. I have had several discs in my neck that slip out of place very easily and give me a nonstop headache for several days in a row. Doing the core program has strengthened my neck and back and the headaches are far less frequent. Whenever my neck starts to feel stiff I just do your program and it takes care of it.\"\n-Jan\nLaguna Niguel, CA\n\"I am writing to thank you PROFUSELY for solving my neck and shoulder pain that has been around since the birth of my daughter 14 months ago. I have been to chiropractors, rheumatologists and orthopods. I have taken Alexander Method classes and thought my Pilates and Yoga could solve the stiffness and nagging pain I felt each day. Nothing seemed to help, and I was beginning to think it would never go away.\nThrough your excellent information on physiology and clear instruction of the Core program, in one week I have felt a major difference in my posture, the pain and \"knots\" are gone and I even sleep well!\nThank goodness you were on the Today Show! I just happened to turn it on right when you were demonstrating the chin retraction. What a simple thing that makes a world of change! Again, Thank You Peggy for tackling an issue that women needed to know about. Now only if more Doc's would read it too...\"\n-Stephanie\nSeattle, WA\n\"Dear Mrs. Brill:\nI hope you don't mind my e-mailing you about my experience with your Core Program. I know that what I am about to say sounds too good to be true, but please believe me that it is.\nI am a 54-year-old woman; my primary fitness activity is figure skating (five days a week for about two hours a day). I skated when I was younger and just took it up again two years ago after I retired. Since then, I've experienced chronic pain in both hips, low-level for the most part but very pronounced when putting weight on one leg (as in climbing stairs) and when lying in bed at night.\nEvery night the pain would wake me periodically and I would continually shift positions in an attempt to get some relief. A series of chiropractic visits did nothing to relieve the pain. I assumed it was some type of osteoarthritic condition or inflammation of the hip joint caused by my skating (like ballet, figure skating requires good turn-out in the hip socket and significantly engages the piriformis and other buttocks muscles) and was resigned to living with it.\nOK, here's the hard-to-believe part: I purchased your book on Tuesday (9/25) and did the \"core foundation\" exercises. That night, I slept through the night with absolutely no hip pain. I've continued the exercises daily and now have experienced three consecutive pain-free nights. Nor do I experience pain when I climb stairs, onto the running board of my car, etc.\nNeedless to say, I will continue with your program and hope to eventually work my way up to the highest level. I don't understand how the exercises could, after a single session, provide such dramatic relief, but they unquestionably did so. Another reason I will stick with your program is that -- quite apart from pain relief -- I suspect that strengthening my core muscles will significantly enhance my figure skating. Maybe I'll write you another testimonial sometime in the future when I see those results!\"\nThank you so much for your book.\n-Cheers,\n"}, {"score": 2230.1038, "uuid": "ce7efb92-7e57-53a4-9a02-a057b2a89e1b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-52-09770", "target_hostname": "dynamicptmichigan.com", "target_uri": "http://dynamicptmichigan.com/13.php?subfolder=18&article=118", "page_rank": 1.176774e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> News", "snippet": "18 and 60 years of age to either <em>chiropractic</em> <em>or</em> <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em> (PT) <em>for</em> treatment of LBP <em>or</em> neck <em>pain</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Landmark Study: Direct Access to PTs Associated With Lower Costs, Fewer Visits [ more ]\nGetting Fit Without the Pain [ more ]\nPhysical Therapy for Individuals with Parkinson's Disease: A Paradigm Shift [ more ]\nGreat leadership & career opportunity!

Eighty percent of all people experience low back pain (LBP) at some point in their lives.1 Back symptoms are the most frequent reason to seek consultation with orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons; they are the second leading reason for physician visits.2 In the United Kingdom, each year 7% of the adult population will consult with their general practitioner for LBP.3 In their systematic literature review on the prevalence of LBP in adults, Loney and Stratford4 found that 19.2+/-9.6 % of people questioned had LBP at the time of survey. The percentage of people with LBP in the year prior to the survey was 32.37+/-23.6%. Based on one US and one Canadian study they estimated mean point prevalence for LBP in North American adults at 5.6%. In other words, 10 of every 178 million North American adults experience LBP in any given day.4 In the US, the total yearly costs associated with LBP, including both direct health care costs, and indirect costs of work loss and disability payments have been estimated to exceed 50 billion dollars.2 Three-fourths of patients taken off work due to LBP have sufficiently recovered to return to work within 6 to 8 weeks, but 2 to 3% of patients develop chronic disabling LBP lasting more than one year.5 Of all worker\u2019s compensation claimants, a relatively small percentage of 10 to 25% accounts for the majority (70 to 87%) of medical and disability benefit costs.5\nDespite this high prevalence of LBP and the astronomical costs associated with this problem a number of myths continues to circulate about LBP. Fritz6 mentioned 3 common misconceptions. Her LBP myth #1 is that \u201cmost people get better no matter what we do.\u201d Practitioners have generally assumed that the natural history of LBP is relatively benign: 80 to 90% of patients with LBP are expected to recover in about 6 weeks, irrespective of the administration or type of treatment.1 In a prospective trial Skargren et al7 randomly allocated 323 patients between 18 and 60 years of age to either chiropractic or physical therapy (PT) for treatment of LBP or neck pain. Among other variables, they researched recurrence and seeking of additional health care. Only 19% in the chiropractic group and 18% of patients in the PT group reported no recurrence at a 12 month follow-up; nearly 60% of patients reported 2 or more recurrences. Fifty-nine percent of chiropractic patients and 41% of PT patients sought additional care, but only 36% and 29%, respectively, returned to their initial provider. Croft et al3 studied 463 adults aged 18 to 75, who consulted with their general practitioner for mechanical LBP. Of these patients, 59% did not consult again with their general practitioner, 32% consulted again within 3 months after the initial visit, and 8% consulted again after the 3 month period. The authors conducted follow-up interviews with 218 patients. Of those interviewed within 1 to 2 weeks after the initial visit, 2% reported having no pain or disability. At 3 months this number increased to 21%. At 12 months only 25% of those interviewed reported no complaints. These studies indicate that LBP may not be as benign and self-limiting as has been assumed, possibly because a large percentage of patients is lost to follow-up as they do not return to their original provider despite continued or recurrent complaints. This is extremely well illustrated by the Croft et al3 study in which the physician might erroneously assume that after 3 months 92% of patients no longer has LBP, even though follow-up showed continued complaints in 75% of (the admittedly smaller sample of) those interviewed.\nLBP myth #2 is that \u201cthe situation is improving.Taylor et al reviewed the National Hospital Discharge Survey data for the 1979 to 1990 period to investigate variations in inpatient management of mechanical LBP in patients 20 years or older. They found an increase in low back surgery from 147,500 in 1979 to 279,000 in 1990. Adjusted for population growth this meant an increase from 102 to 158 low back surgeries per 100,000 adults. Non-fusion surgery increased by 47%; surgeries involving fusion increased with 100%. Not only have back surgery rates risen sharply, Fritz6 noted that chronic LBP disability has also risen dramatically in the past 25 years.\nLBP myth #3 is that \u201cthe medical community knows how to approach the problem.\u201d6 Controversy clearly exists regarding the most appropriate treatment for LBP. Taylor et al2 found that in the 1988 to 1990 period annual LBP surgery rates varied widely between the different geographical locations in the US: 113 per 100,000 adults in the western US, 131 in the Northeast, 157 in the Midwest, and 171 in the South. Reported LBP prevalence in these 4 areas was nearly identical. This wide geographical variation despite similar prevalence indicates that the choice for surgical management of LBP is far from uniform.\nThe extensive personal and societal impact of LBP is obvious. The natural history of LBP may not be as benign as previously assumed. Research appears consistent with the interpretation that 90% of patients will have stopped consulting with their initial or any provider and are thus lost to follow-up rather than having no more pain or disability. A small percentage of patients develop chronic disabling pain and these patients become responsible for the majority of costs. Early identification and appropriate intervention could have a major impact on costs. The medical profession does not appear to have a uniform answer to LBP: increasing surgery rates and wide geographic variation in management strategies need not necessarily be interpreted as a sign of increased treatment success. Mielenz et al8 investigated 1580 patients with acute LBP initially seen by 208 randomly selected health care providers (orthopaedic surgeons, primary care providers, chiropractors) in North Carolina. A PT saw 199 (12.8%) of the patients, by referral or direct access. The PT patients had higher baseline scores on the Roland-Morris Questionnaire. This instrument describes the impact of LBP on various functional activities; higher scores indicate higher levels of disability. Location of pain also played a role in referral: patients with LBP and pain below the knee in one or both legs were more likely to be referred to PT. This study seems to indicate that the referral of choice for patients with more severe acute LBP is PT rather than medical, surgical, or chiropractic treatment. A natural history less benign than previously assumed, an increase in chronic LBP-related disability, seemingly inadequate surgical treatment options, and PT as the referral of choice for more involved LBP patients makes in-depth knowledge of all aspects of LBP a necessity for every PT involved in treating these patients. In this monograph we will review the anatomy and biomechanics of the lumbopelvic region. Monograph 11.2.4. will deal with changes as a result of aging, pathology affecting the lumbopelvic region, diagnosis, and PT treatment. It will also contain the case studies that will illustrate application of this information to patient management.\n"}, {"score": 2224.4023, "uuid": "8b681ac8-dfaf-5d94-871e-8395fc5b947a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-26-19184", "target_hostname": "www.chiro.org", "target_uri": "http://www.chiro.org/LINKS/lowback.shtml", "page_rank": 1.836878e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "LOW <em>BACK</em> <em>PAIN</em> &amp; <em>CHIROPRACTIC</em> Page", "snippet": "Advice- Think Before You Lift <em>What</em> <em>is</em> the Natural History <em>for</em> Lower <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em>?

Recommendations for management of acute LBP emphasized patient education, with short-term use of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or spinal manipulation therapy. For chronic LBP, the addition of back exercises, behavioral therapy, and short-term opioid analgesics was suggested.\nMedicine (CAM) for Back Pain: A National Survey\nJournal of the American Board of Family Medicine 2010 (May); \u00a0 23 (3): \u00a0354\u009662 ~ FULL TEXT\nThis new reports on interviews with 31,044 individuals who used CAM for low back pain.

American Medical Association 2010 (Apr 7); \u00a0 303 (13): \u00a0 1259\u00961265 ~ FULL TEXT\nThere is a lack of evidence-based support for the efficacy of complex fusion surgeries over conservative surgical decompression for elderly stenosis patients. There is, however, a significant financial incentive to both hospitals and surgeons to perform the complex fusions. Spinal stenosis is the most frequent cause for spinal surgery in the elderly. There has been a slight decrease in these surgeries between 2002 and 2007. However, there has also been an overall 15 fold increase in the more complex spinal fusions (360 degree spine fusions). Deyo et. al. in yesterday\u0092s issue (April 7, 2010) of the Journal of the American Medical Association concludes that \u0093It is unclear why more complex operations are increasing. It seems implausible that the number of patients with the most complex spinal pathology increased 15-fold in just 6 years. The introduction and marketing of new surgical devices and the influence of key opinion leaders may stimulate more invasive surgery, even in the absence of new indications\u0085financial incentives to hospitals and surgeons for more complex procedures may play a role\u0085\u0094 There is a significant difference in mean hospital costs for simple decompression versus complex surgical fusion. The cost of decompression is $23,724 compared to an average of $80,888 for complex fusion. Despite the much higher cost, there is no evidence of superior outcomes and there is greater morbidity associated with the complex fusion. The surgeon is typically reimbursed only $600 to $800 for simple decompression and approximately ten times more, $6,000 to $8,000 for the complex fusion.\nManagement of Chronic Low Back Pain in Active Individuals\nCurr Sports Med Rep 2010 (Jan); \u00a0 9 (1): \u00a0 60\u009666\nThe best available evidence currently suggests that in the absence of serious spinal pathology, nonspinal causes, or progressive or severe neurologic deficits, the management of chronic LBP should focus on patient education, self-care, common analgesics, and back exercises. Short-term pain relief may be obtained from spinal manipulative therapy or acupuncture. For patients with psychological comorbidities, adjunctive analgesics, behavioral therapy, or multidisciplinary rehabilitation also may be appropriate. Given the importance of active participation in recovery, patient preference should be sought to help select from among the recommended treatment options.\nSpinal Manipulation Compared with Back School and with Individually Delivered Physiotherapy for the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Trial with One-year Follow-up\nClin Rehabil 2010 (Jan); \u00a0 24 (1): \u00a0 26\u009636\nResearchers followed patients with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disk herniation treated after a diagnosis-based clinical decision rule. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a multidisciplinary, integrated clinic that includes chiropractic and physical therapy health care services. Data on 49 consecutive patients were collected at baseline, at the end of conservative, nonsurgical treatment and a mean of 14.5 months after cessation of treatment. Disability was measured using the Bournemouth Disability Questionnaire (BDQ) and pain using the Numerical Rating Scale for pain. Fear beliefs were measured with the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). Patients also self-rated improvement. Mean duration of complaint was 60.5 weeks. Mean self-rated improvement at the end of treatment was 77.5%. Improvement was described as \"good\" or \"excellent\" in nearly 90% of patients.\nA Nonsurgical Approach to the Management of Patients With Lumbar Radiculopathy Secondary to Herniated Disk: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study With Follow-Up\nJ Manipulative Physiol Ther 2009 (Nov); \u00a0 32 (9): \u00a0 723\u0096733\nA randomized trial by researchers at an outpatient rehabilitation department in Italy involving 210 patients with chronic, nonspecific low back pain compared the effects of spinal manipulation, physiotherapy and back school. The participants were 210 patients (140 women and 70 men) with chronic, non-specific low back pain, average age 59. Back school and individual physiotherapy were scheduled as 15 1-hour-sessions for 3 weeks. Back school included group exercise and education/ergonomics. Individual physiotherapy included exercise, passive mobilization and soft-tissue treatment. Spinal manipulation included 4-6 20-minute sessions once-a-week. Spinal manipulation provided better short and long-term functional improvement, and more pain relief in the follow-up than either back school or individual physiotherapy.\nLow Back Pain Guidelines from Around the World\nA new addition is the Danish Institute's Low Back Pain Guidelines, available in HTML or Adobe Acrobat. This section also includes recommendations from the California Industrial Medical Council, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the 1994 AHCPR guides, the \"Mercy Conference Document\", and the New Zealand \"Psychosocial Yellow Flags\" Page\nConsumer Reports: Chiropractic Top Rated Treatment for Back Pain\nConsumer Reports ~ May 2009\nA study in the May issue of Consumer Reports shows that hands-on therapies were tops among treatments for relief of back pain. The study, which surveyed more than 14,000 consumers, was conducted by the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. The report states that, \u0093eighty-eight percent of those who tried chiropractic manipulation said it helped a lot, and 59 percent were \u0091completely\u0092 or \u0091very\u0092 satisfied with their chiropractor.\u0094\nDoctors Likely to Encounter Children With Musculoskeletal Complaints Have Low Confidence in Their Clinical Skills\nThe Journal of Pediatrics 2009 (Feb); \u00a0 154 (2): \u00a0 267\u0096271\nQuestionnaires, filled out by a broad spectrum of medical providers in England [Primary Care (n = 75), Pediatrics (n = 39), Emergency (n = 39), Orthopedics (n = 40), and experienced doctors in Primary Care (n = 93), and Pediatrics (n = 60).], revealed that 74% of them scored their personal confidence in pediatric musculoskeletal clinical assessment as \"no\" to \"low\".\nReport From a Consensus Process\nJ Manipulative Physiol Ther 2008 (Nov); \u00a0 31 (9): \u00a0 651\u0096658\nA broad-based panel of experienced chiropractors was able to reach a high level (80%) of consensus regarding specific aspects of the chiropractic approach to care for patients with low back pain, based on both the scientific evidence and their clinical experience.\nLeg Complaints: A Literature Synthesis\nJ Manipulative Physiol Ther 2008 (Nov); \u00a0 31 (9): \u00a0 659\u0096674\nAs much or more evidence exists for the use of spinal manipulation to reduce symptoms and improve function in patients with chronic LBP as for use in acute and subacute LBP. Use of exercise in conjunction with manipulation is likely to speed and improve outcomes as well as minimize episodic recurrence. There was less evidence for the use of manipulation for patients with LBP and radiating leg pain, sciatica, or radiculopathy.\nSpinal Manipulation for Low-Back Pain\nNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)\nLow-back pain is a common condition that can be difficult to treat. Spinal manipulationThe application of controlled force to a joint, moving it beyond the normal range of motion in an effort to aid in restoring health. Manipulation may be performed as a part of other therapies or whole medical systems, including chiropractic medicine, massage, and naturopathy. is among the treatment options used by people with low-back pain in attempts to relieve pain and improve functioning. It is performed by chiropractors and other health care professionals such as physical therapists, osteopaths, and some conventional medical doctors. This fact sheet summarizes the current scientific knowledge about the effects of spinal manipulation on low-back pain.\nPrimary Care: Inception Cohort Study\nBritish Medical Journal 2008 (Jul 7); \u00a0 337: \u00a0 a171 ~ FULL TEXT\nThis study contradicts Clinical Practice Guidelines that suggest that recovery from an episode of recent onset low back pain is usually rapid and complete. Their findings with 973 consecutive primary care patients was that recovery was slow for most patients, and almost 1/3 of patients did not recover within one year.\nA Comparison Between Chiropractic Management and Pain Clinic Management for Chronic Low-back Pain in a National Health Service Outpatient Clinic\nJ Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2008 (Jun); \u00a0 14 (5): \u00a0 465\u0096473\nAt 8 weeks, the mean improvement in RMDQ was 5.5 points greater for the chiropractic group than for the pain-clinic group. Reduction in mean pain intensity at week 8 was 1.8 points greater for the chiropractic group than for the pain-clinic group. This study suggests that chiropractic management administered in an NHS setting may be effective for reducing levels of disability and perceived pain during the period of treatment for a sub-population of patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP).\non Dysmenorrhea\nJ Manipulative Physiol Ther 2008 (Mar); \u00a0 31 (3): \u00a0 237\u0096246 ~ FULL TEXT\nThis prospective case series suggests the possibility that menstrual pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea may be alleviated by treating motion segment restrictions of the lumbosacral spine with a drop table technique. The research team needs to conduct a well-designed feasibility trial to further evaluate the effectiveness of this specific spinal manipulative technique for primary dysmenorrhea.\nDiagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain: A Joint Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society\nAnnals of Internal Medicine 2007 (Oct 2); \u00a0 147 (7): \u00a0 478\u0096491 ~ FULL TEXT\nLow back pain is the fifth most common reason for all physician visits in the United States [1, 2]. Approximately one quarter of U.S. adults reported having low back pain lasting at least 1 whole day in the past 3 months [2], and 7.6% reported at least 1 episode of severe acute low back pain (see Glossary) within a 1-year period [3]. Low back pain is also very costly: Total incremental direct health care costs attributable to low back pain in the U.S. were estimated at $26.3 billion in 1998 [4]. In addition, indirect costs related to days lost from work are substantial, with approximately 2% of the U.S. work force compensated for back injuries each year [5]. You will enjoy these recommendations because their ONLY recommendation for active treatment of acute low back pain is spinal adjusting (manipulation).\nNonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: A Review of the Evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline\nAnnals of Internal Medicine 2007 (Oct 2); \u00a0 147 (7): \u00a0 492\u0096504 ~ FULL TEXT\nTherapies with good evidence of moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute low back pain are cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation.\nIntegrating Connective Tissue and Nervous System Mechanisms\nMedical Hypotheses 2007 (Jan); \u00a0 68 (1): \u00a0 74-80 ~ FULL TEXT\nAlthough chronic low back pain (cLBP) is increasingly recognized as a complex syndrome with multifactorial etiology, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the development of chronic pain in this condition remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that pain-related fear leads to a cycle of decreased movement, connective tissue remodeling, inflammation, nervous system sensitization and further decreased mobility. In addition to providing a new, testable framework for future mechanistic studies of cLBP, the integration of connective tissue and nervous system plasticity into the model will potentially illuminate the mechanisms of a variety of treatments that may reverse these abnormalities by applying mechanical forces to soft tissues (e.g. physical therapy, massage, chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture), by changing specific movement patterns (e.g. movement therapies, yoga) or more generally by increasing activity levels (e.g. recreational exercise). You will also enjoy Dr. Dan Murphy's Key Points.\nA Prospective Study of a Young Population\nBMC Musculoskelet Disord 2006 (Mar 16); \u00a0 7: \u00a0 29 ~ FULL TEXT\nYour chiropractic care may be working out \u0093kinks\u0094 in your lower back that have been around a lot longer than you realize. This new study of 10,000 Danish residents shows a link between adolescent and adult low back pain (LBP). Researchers studied twins born between 1972 and 1982 by sending out questionnaires in 1994 and again in 2002. The outcomes showed that a high percentage of those who had LBP in 1994 still suffered from LBP in 2002. They also found that those with persistent LBP were 4.5 times more likely than the average person to have future LBP episodes!\nHormonal and Reproductive Factors Are Associated with Chronic Low Back Pain and Chronic Upper Extremity Pain in Women -- The MORGEN Study\nSPINE (Phila Pa 1976) 2006 (Jun 1); \u00a0 31 (13): \u00a0 1496-1502\nAlthough LBP is suggested to be linked to hormonal and reproductive factors in women, results from previous studies are inconclusive. For this reason, a cross-sectional study of 11,428 Dutch women aged 20-59 years was accomplished. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between hormonal and reproductive factors (independent variables) and, respectively, chronic LBP, chronic UEP (upper extremity pain) and combined chronic LBP/UEP. Past pregnancy, young maternal age at first birth, duration of oral contraceptive use, and use of estrogens during menopause were associated with chronic LBP, while young age at menarche was associated with chronic UEP. Irregular or prolonged menstruation and hysterectomy were associated both with chronic LBP and chronic UEP. No positive associations were found for current pregnancy and number of children.\n"}, {"score": 2221.3906, "uuid": "7fab5ca2-266a-53b9-b9fb-848d627fb04f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-17-28486", "target_hostname": "www.choiceptc.com", "target_uri": "http://www.choiceptc.com/faq", "page_rank": 1.6570302e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Choice <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "<em>Pain</em> intensity, <em>what</em> aggravates and eases the problem.

Unlike some clinics, where you see someone different each visit, we feel it is very important to develop a one-on-one relationship with you to maintain continuity of care. Since only one physical therapist knows your problems best, he/she is the one that will be working closely with you to speed your recovery.\nAre there physical therapy specialists?\nOrthopedic Physical Therapy - Probably the most common physical therapy specialist is the orthopedic specialist. These specialists care for post-surgical patients, arthritis, tendinitis/tendinosus, fracture rehabilitation, muscle sprains and strains, neck and back pain, hip and knee problems, shoulder, elbow, and wrist conditions. Some are board certified as Orthopedic Certified Specialists (OCS).\nManual Therapy - Manual therapy is a broad term that describes a variety of hands-on treatment techniques that are applied to movement dysfunctions. Grade five mobilizations, Mulligan mobilizations with movement, Maitland and Kaltenborn techniques, functional technique, neural mobilization, joint mobilization, craniosacral therapy, strain/counter strain, myofascial release, etc. These are some of the more popular manual therapy techniques. Many manual therapists will take continuing education courses, obtain certifications in manual therapy, and will sit for board certification from the American Physical Therapy Association and other organizations. Most physical therapists incorporate manual therapy techniques as a part of a complete treatment plan.\nGeriatric Physical Therapy - Some therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of seniors. As the body ages, a variety of challenges arise. We stiffen, we lose strength, our balance skills decline, our bones become brittle (osteoporosis), our endurance decreases, and we take longer to recover from injuries. Balance and fall prevention are of paramount importance to the therapist who is working with seniors and some clinics are solely dedicated to caring for those with balance problems. Most physical therapists work with seniors/geriatric patients. Some have obtained additional education, have passed a board examination, and have earned the Geriatric Certified Specialist (GCS) title.\nSports Rehabilitation - Experts in assisting with recovery after injury and surgery. Many sports specialists help with retraining the athlete utilizing running, throwing, jumping, and sport-specific programs to name a few. A therapist with the Sports Certified Specialist (SCS) title has passed a board certified test.\nFitness and Wellness - Physical therapists are well trained to help with your fitness needs and wellness programs. If you need an exercise program, have trouble with your weight, are concerned about osteoporosis, have an issue with diabetes, or you would like to learn how to prevent falls, physical therapists can help. The previous examples are just a few of the many programs physical therapists offer.\nHand Therapy - Most physical therapists are well trained to treat hand and wrist conditions. Some therapists have taken additional courses and training and have passed a hand therapy certification examination. These therapists are called Certified Hand Therapists (CHTs).\nWomen's Health - Some therapists specialize in women's issues such as pregnancy problems, pelvic pain, and incontinence. Special treatment is available for women who have these problems. Many that suffer from incontinence do so needlessly. A physical therapist may be able to help.\nIndustrial Rehabilitation - Specialists in industrial rehabilitation help with those that have suffered on-the-job injuries. Moreover, they will evaluate work tasks, fabricate assistive devices, evaluate your ergonomic situation, and help redesign work flow/tasks to decrease the incidence of injury. Often, industrial rehabilitation specialists will evaluate your ability to perform certain job tasks with a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE).\nPediatric Physical Therapy - Pediatric therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of children. They may assist with kids who suffer from cerebral palsy, developmental disorders, neurological disorders, and/or orthopedic problems. A Pediatric Certified Specialist (PCS) is a board certification that some may obtain from the American Physical Therapy Association.\nAquatic Physical Therapy - Aquatic therapy takes advantage of the physical properties of water to assist with the rehabilitative process. Buoyancy, turbulence, hydrostatic pressure, and thermal properties of water can assist with the rehabilitation of a patient. Those suffering from chronic pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lumbar fusion surgery, or with a limited weight-bearing status are just a few of the many different patient populations that can benefit from aquatic therapy.\nCardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation - A small percentage of physical therapists practice in this discipline. Those that pass the board certification have the title of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Certified Specialist (CCS) work with patients who have had heart attacks, bypass surgeries, angioplasty, breathing problems, emphysema, and other heart/lung related conditions. Physical therapists are well equipped to work with these types of patients because many of them have orthopedic ailments that limit their ability to function. In other words, a physical therapist can address the heart and lung problems as well as the muscle problems that are concurrently present.\nNeurological, Spinal Cord Injury, and Traumatic Brain Injury Rehab - A large portion of physical therapists work with patients who suffer from these conditions. Functional retraining including, walking, wheelchair use, getting in and out of bed or chairs (transfer training), moving in bed (bed mobility), and retraining patients to use their shoulders, arms, and hands are just some of the services these therapists provide to those with neurological involvement. A certified specialist holds a Neurologic Certified Specialist title (NCS).\nBalance, Dizziness, and Vertigo Rehabilitation - Many suffer from dizziness or BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). Some clinics specialize in the rehabilitation of patients with vertigo. Patient education, strengthening, safety awareness, posture and balance exercise, walking exercise, and special techniques that affect sensory and balance centers of the brain and limbs are all important components of a rehabilitation program.\nAmputee Rehabilitation - many physical therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of amputees. Caring for the injured limb, functional and walking training, training in the use of assistive devices (crutches, canes, prosthetic limbs, etc.) are all provided by a therapist who specializes in care for amputees.\nWound Care - Some therapists specialize in the treatment and care of wounds. This is accomplished by the removal of unviable tissue (debridement), the application of special dressings and prescription drugs/ointments, and the use of ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and aquatic modalities to promote healing. Exercise and patient education are also routine components of a wound care program.\nECS (Clinical Electrophysiologic Certified Specialist) - A physical therapist who is board certified to perform electroneurophysiology examinations such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography.\nLymphedema Rehabilitation - We take it for granted but a special component of the circulatory system, the lymph system, helps filter and drain fluid from our arms and legs. When this drainage system is damaged, painful swelling can result. Some therapists specialize in the treatment of lymphedema as it is called. Special positioning, massage and bandaging techniques are utilized by the lymphedema specialist.\nOsteoporosis Rehabilitation and Prevention - Some practitioners specialize in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis patients. Working in concert with your medical doctor, the therapist will often design a specialized weight-bearing and resistance training program for those with this silent disease.\nIs physical therapy painful?\nFor many patients, one of the primary objectives is pain relief. This is frequently accomplished with hands-on techniques, modalities such as ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and/or heat or cold therapy. Movement often provides pain relief as well. Your physical therapist will provide you with the appropriate exercises not only for pain relief but to recover range of motion, strength, and endurance.\nIn some cases, physical therapy techniques can be painful. For example, recovering knee range of motion after total knee replacement or shoulder range of motion after shoulder surgery may be painful. Your physical therapist will utilize a variety of techniques to help maximize your treatment goals. It is important that you communicate the intensity, frequency, and duration of pain to your therapist. Without this information, it is difficult for the therapist to adjust your treatment plan.\nWhat types of treatments will I receive?\nThere are dozens of different types of treatment interventions. Here is a list of treatment interventions:\nActive Range of Motion (AROM) - the patient lifts or moves a body part through range of motion against gravity. AROM is usually one of the first modalities prescribed for arthritis.\nActive Assistive Range of Motion (AAROM) - therapist-assisted active range of motion. This is usually prescribed for gentle stretching or strengthening for a very weak body part.\nStationary Bicycle - with or without resistance. This is usually prescribed for improving the strength and/or range of motion of the back or lower extremities as well as cardiovascular endurance.\nGait or Walking Training - the analysis of walking problems by visually examining the interaction of the low back and the joints of the thighs, legs, and feet during the various stages of walking, including initial contact, loading response, mid stance, terminal stance, pre swing, mid swing, and terminal swing. Many back, thigh, leg, ankle, and foot problems may be caused by or manifest themselves in subtle gait abnormalities.\nIsometrics - muscle contraction without joint movement. This is usually prescribed for strengthening without stressing or damaging the joint (e.g., arthritis, or exercises to be performed in a cast, or right after surgery if recommended by the therapist/doctor).\nIsotonics- muscle(s) contracting through the ROM with resistance. This is usually prescribed for strengthening.\nSoft Tissue Mobilization - therapeutic massage of body tissue performed with the hands. Soft tissue mobilization may be used for muscle relaxation, to decrease swelling, to decrease scar tissue adhesions, and for pain relief.\nMobilization - hands-on therapeutic procedures intended to increase soft tissue or joint mobility. Mobilization is usually prescribed to increase mobility, delaying progressive stiffness, and to relieve pain. There are many types of mobilization techniques including Maitland, Kaltenborn, Isometric Mobilizations, etc.\nProprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) - a system of manually resisted exercises performed in diagonal patterns that mimic functional movements. PNF was initially used in developmentally and neurologically impaired patients but now is used in almost every aspect of neuromuscular retraining from athletes in sports facilities to the very weak in hospitals and nursing homes.\nPosture Training - instruction in the correct biomechanical alignment of the body to reduce undue strain on muscles, joints, ligaments, discs, and other soft tissues. There is an ideal posture, but most people do not have ideal posture. Therapists educate patients about the importance of improving posture with daily activities. Stretching and strengthening exercises may be prescribed to facilitate postural improvement and to prevent further disability and future recurrences of problems.\nProgressive Resistive Exercises (PRE) - exercises that gradually increase in resistance (weights) and in repetitions. PRE is usually prescribed for reeducation of muscles and strengthening. Weights, rubber bands, and body weight can be used as resistance.\nPassive Range of Motion (PROM) - the patient or therapist moves the body part through a range of motion without the use of the muscles that \"actively\" move the joint(s).\nStretching/Flexibility Exercise - exercise designed to lengthen muscle(s) or soft tissue. Stretching exercises are usually prescribed to improve the flexibility of muscles that have tightened due to disuse or in compensation to pain, spasm or immobilization.\nCryotherapy or Cold Therapy - used to cause vasoconstriction (the blood vessels constrict or decrease their diameter) to reduce the amount of fluid that leaks out of the capillaries into the tissue spaces (swelling) in response to injury of tissue. Ice or cold is used most frequently in acute injuries, but also an effective pain reliever for even the most chronic pain.\nNeuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) - the application of electrical stimulation to aid in improving strength (e.g., the quadriceps muscle after knee surgery or injury). NMES is also used to decrease pain and swelling and to relieve muscle spasm.\nNeck Traction - a gentle longitudinal/axial pull on the neck, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous for relief of neck pain, to decrease muscle spasm and facilitate unloading of the spine.\nHeat - heat is recommended to decrease chronic pain, relax muscles, and for pain relief. It should not be used with an acute or \"new\" injury.\nIontophoresis - medications are propelled through the skin by an electrical charge. This modality works on the physical concept that like charges repel each other, therefore, a positively charged medication will be repelled through the skin to the underlying tissues by the positively charged pad of an iontophoresis machine. Iontophoresis is usually prescribed for injuries such as shoulder or elbow bursitis.\nPelvic Traction - the longitudinal/axial pull on the lumbar spine, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous. Pelvic traction may be helpful for the relief of low back pain and muscle spasm.\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) - a relatively low voltage applied over painful areas through small self-adhesive electrodes. The electrical stimulation \"disguises\" or \"overrides\" the sensation of pain. It is a small, portable unit, used in intervals, to control pain and reduce dependence on drugs. It is usually prescribed for relief of pain.\nUltrasound - ultrasound uses a high frequency sound wave emitted from the sound head when electricity is passed through a quartz crystal. The sound waves cause the vibration of water molecules deep within tissue causing a heating effect. When the sound waves are pulsed, they cause a vibration of the tissue rather than heating. The stream of sound waves helps with nutrition exchange at the cellular level and healing. Studies have shown that ultrasound is helpful for ligament healing and clinically, for carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle spasm.\nWhirlpool - immersion of a body part into water with small \"agitators\" to provide a gentle massaging motion. A warm whirlpool provides relief from pain and muscle spasm and is often preparatory to stretching or exercise. Cold whirlpool is used to decrease inflammation and swelling.\nWill I get a massage at physical therapy?\nMassage may be part of your treatment. Rehabilitation specialists are trained in a variety of techniques that may help with your recovery. Deep tissue techniques may be part of the rehabilitative process. Massage is used for three reasons typically - to facilitate venous return from a swollen area, to relax a tight muscle, or to relieve pain. Contrary to common thought, massage does not increase circulation.\n"}, {"score": 2218.8643, "uuid": "dbd604bc-67cd-5047-846f-151b4f3efdba", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-69-10328", "target_hostname": "www.choiceptc.com", "target_uri": "http://www.choiceptc.com/index.php?page=faq", "page_rank": 1.1804575e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Choice <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "<em>Pain</em> intensity, <em>what</em> aggravates and eases the problem. How this <em>is</em> impacting your daily activities <em>or</em> your functional limitations.", "explanation": null, "document": "Who will see me?\nYou will be evaluated by one of our licensed and highly trained physical therapists and he/she will also treat you during subsequent visits. Unlike some clinics, where you see someone different each visit, we feel it is very important to develop a one-on-one relationship with you to maintain continuity of care. Since only one physical therapist knows your problems best, he/she is the one that will be working closely with you to speed your recovery.\nAre there physical therapy specialists?\nOrthopedic Physical Therapy - Probably the most common physical therapy specialist is the orthopedic specialist. These specialists care for post-surgical patients, arthritis, tendinitis/tendinosus, fracture rehabilitation, muscle sprains and strains, neck and back pain, hip and knee problems, shoulder, elbow, and wrist conditions. Some are board certified as Orthopedic Certified Specialists (OCS).\nManual Therapy - Manual therapy is a broad term that describes a variety of hands-on treatment techniques that are applied to movement dysfunctions. Grade five mobilizations, Mulligan mobilizations with movement, Maitland and Kaltenborn techniques, functional technique, neural mobilization, joint mobilization, craniosacral therapy, strain/counter strain, myofascial release, etc. These are some of the more popular manual therapy techniques. Many manual therapists will take continuing education courses, obtain certifications in manual therapy, and will sit for board certification from the American Physical Therapy Association and other organizations. Most physical therapists incorporate manual therapy techniques as a part of a complete treatment plan.\nGeriatric Physical Therapy - Some therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of seniors. As the body ages, a variety of challenges arise. We stiffen, we lose strength, our balance skills decline, our bones become brittle (osteoporosis), our endurance decreases, and we take longer to recover from injuries. Balance and fall prevention are of paramount importance to the therapist who is working with seniors and some clinics are solely dedicated to caring for those with balance problems. Most physical therapists work with seniors/geriatric patients. Some have obtained additional education, have passed a board examination, and have earned the Geriatric Certified Specialist (GCS) title.\nSports Rehabilitation - Experts in assisting with recovery after injury and surgery. Many sports specialists help with retraining the athlete utilizing running, throwing, jumping, and sport-specific programs to name a few. A therapist with the Sports Certified Specialist (SCS) title has passed a board certified test.\nFitness and Wellness - Physical therapists are well trained to help with your fitness needs and wellness programs. If you need an exercise program, have trouble with your weight, are concerned about osteoporosis, have an issue with diabetes, or you would like to learn how to prevent falls, physical therapists can help. The previous examples are just a few of the many programs physical therapists offer.\nHand Therapy - Most physical therapists are well trained to treat hand and wrist conditions. Some therapists have taken additional courses and training and have passed a hand therapy certification examination. These therapists are called Certified Hand Therapists (CHTs).\nWomen's Health - Some therapists specialize in women's issues such as pregnancy problems, pelvic pain, and incontinence. Special treatment is available for women who have these problems. Many that suffer from incontinence do so needlessly. A physical therapist may be able to help.\nIndustrial Rehabilitation - Specialists in industrial rehabilitation help with those that have suffered on-the-job injuries. Moreover, they will evaluate work tasks, fabricate assistive devices, evaluate your ergonomic situation, and help redesign work flow/tasks to decrease the incidence of injury. Often, industrial rehabilitation specialists will evaluate your ability to perform certain job tasks with a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE).\nPediatric Physical Therapy - Pediatric therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of children. They may assist with kids who suffer from cerebral palsy, developmental disorders, neurological disorders, and/or orthopedic problems. A Pediatric Certified Specialist (PCS) is a board certification that some may obtain from the American Physical Therapy Association.\nAquatic Physical Therapy - Aquatic therapy takes advantage of the physical properties of water to assist with the rehabilitative process. Buoyancy, turbulence, hydrostatic pressure, and thermal properties of water can assist with the rehabilitation of a patient. Those suffering from chronic pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lumbar fusion surgery, or with a limited weight-bearing status are just a few of the many different patient populations that can benefit from aquatic therapy.\nCardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation - A small percentage of physical therapists practice in this discipline. Those that pass the board certification have the title of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Certified Specialist (CCS) work with patients who have had heart attacks, bypass surgeries, angioplasty, breathing problems, emphysema, and other heart/lung related conditions. Physical therapists are well equipped to work with these types of patients because many of them have orthopedic ailments that limit their ability to function. In other words, a physical therapist can address the heart and lung problems as well as the muscle problems that are concurrently present.\nNeurological, Spinal Cord Injury, and Traumatic Brain Injury Rehab - A large portion of physical therapists work with patients who suffer from these conditions. Functional retraining including, walking, wheelchair use, getting in and out of bed or chairs (transfer training), moving in bed (bed mobility), and retraining patients to use their shoulders, arms, and hands are just some of the services these therapists provide to those with neurological involvement. A certified specialist holds a Neurologic Certified Specialist title (NCS).\nBalance, Dizziness, and Vertigo Rehabilitation - Many suffer from dizziness or BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). Some clinics specialize in the rehabilitation of patients with vertigo. Patient education, strengthening, safety awareness, posture and balance exercise, walking exercise, and special techniques that affect sensory and balance centers of the brain and limbs are all important components of a rehabilitation program.\nAmputee Rehabilitation - many physical therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of amputees. Caring for the injured limb, functional and walking training, training in the use of assistive devices (crutches, canes, prosthetic limbs, etc.) are all provided by a therapist who specializes in care for amputees.\nWound Care - Some therapists specialize in the treatment and care of wounds. This is accomplished by the removal of unviable tissue (debridement), the application of special dressings and prescription drugs/ointments, and the use of ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and aquatic modalities to promote healing. Exercise and patient education are also routine components of a wound care program.\nECS (Clinical Electrophysiologic Certified Specialist) - A physical therapist who is board certified to perform electroneurophysiology examinations such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography.\nLymphedema Rehabilitation - We take it for granted but a special component of the circulatory system, the lymph system, helps filter and drain fluid from our arms and legs. When this drainage system is damaged, painful swelling can result. Some therapists specialize in the treatment of lymphedema as it is called. Special positioning, massage and bandaging techniques are utilized by the lymphedema specialist.\nOsteoporosis Rehabilitation and Prevention - Some practitioners specialize in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis patients. Working in concert with your medical doctor, the therapist will often design a specialized weight-bearing and resistance training program for those with this silent disease.\nIs physical therapy painful?\nFor many patients, one of the primary objectives is pain relief. This is frequently accomplished with hands-on techniques, modalities such as ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and/or heat or cold therapy. Movement often provides pain relief as well. Your physical therapist will provide you with the appropriate exercises not only for pain relief but to recover range of motion, strength, and endurance.\nIn some cases, physical therapy techniques can be painful. For example, recovering knee range of motion after total knee replacement or shoulder range of motion after shoulder surgery may be painful. Your physical therapist will utilize a variety of techniques to help maximize your treatment goals. It is important that you communicate the intensity, frequency, and duration of pain to your therapist. Without this information, it is difficult for the therapist to adjust your treatment plan.\nWhat types of treatments will I receive?\nThere are dozens of different types of treatment interventions. Here is a list of treatment interventions:\nActive Range of Motion (AROM) - the patient lifts or moves a body part through range of motion against gravity. AROM is usually one of the first modalities prescribed for arthritis.\nActive Assistive Range of Motion (AAROM) - therapist-assisted active range of motion. This is usually prescribed for gentle stretching or strengthening for a very weak body part.\nStationary Bicycle - with or without resistance. This is usually prescribed for improving the strength and/or range of motion of the back or lower extremities as well as cardiovascular endurance.\nGait or Walking Training - the analysis of walking problems by visually examining the interaction of the low back and the joints of the thighs, legs, and feet during the various stages of walking, including initial contact, loading response, mid stance, terminal stance, pre swing, mid swing, and terminal swing. Many back, thigh, leg, ankle, and foot problems may be caused by or manifest themselves in subtle gait abnormalities.\nIsometrics - muscle contraction without joint movement. This is usually prescribed for strengthening without stressing or damaging the joint (e.g., arthritis, or exercises to be performed in a cast, or right after surgery if recommended by the therapist/doctor).\nIsotonics- muscle(s) contracting through the ROM with resistance. This is usually prescribed for strengthening.\nSoft Tissue Mobilization - therapeutic massage of body tissue performed with the hands. Soft tissue mobilization may be used for muscle relaxation, to decrease swelling, to decrease scar tissue adhesions, and for pain relief.\nMobilization - hands-on therapeutic procedures intended to increase soft tissue or joint mobility. Mobilization is usually prescribed to increase mobility, delaying progressive stiffness, and to relieve pain. There are many types of mobilization techniques including Maitland, Kaltenborn, Isometric Mobilizations, etc.\nProprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) - a system of manually resisted exercises performed in diagonal patterns that mimic functional movements. PNF was initially used in developmentally and neurologically impaired patients but now is used in almost every aspect of neuromuscular retraining from athletes in sports facilities to the very weak in hospitals and nursing homes.\nPosture Training - instruction in the correct biomechanical alignment of the body to reduce undue strain on muscles, joints, ligaments, discs, and other soft tissues. There is an ideal posture, but most people do not have ideal posture. Therapists educate patients about the importance of improving posture with daily activities. Stretching and strengthening exercises may be prescribed to facilitate postural improvement and to prevent further disability and future recurrences of problems.\nProgressive Resistive Exercises (PRE) - exercises that gradually increase in resistance (weights) and in repetitions. PRE is usually prescribed for reeducation of muscles and strengthening. Weights, rubber bands, and body weight can be used as resistance.\nPassive Range of Motion (PROM) - the patient or therapist moves the body part through a range of motion without the use of the muscles that \"actively\" move the joint(s).\nStretching/Flexibility Exercise - exercise designed to lengthen muscle(s) or soft tissue. Stretching exercises are usually prescribed to improve the flexibility of muscles that have tightened due to disuse or in compensation to pain, spasm or immobilization.\nCryotherapy or Cold Therapy - used to cause vasoconstriction (the blood vessels constrict or decrease their diameter) to reduce the amount of fluid that leaks out of the capillaries into the tissue spaces (swelling) in response to injury of tissue. Ice or cold is used most frequently in acute injuries, but also an effective pain reliever for even the most chronic pain.\nNeuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) - the application of electrical stimulation to aid in improving strength (e.g., the quadriceps muscle after knee surgery or injury). NMES is also used to decrease pain and swelling and to relieve muscle spasm.\nNeck Traction - a gentle longitudinal/axial pull on the neck, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous for relief of neck pain, to decrease muscle spasm and facilitate unloading of the spine.\nHeat - heat is recommended to decrease chronic pain, relax muscles, and for pain relief. It should not be used with an acute or \"new\" injury.\nIontophoresis - medications are propelled through the skin by an electrical charge. This modality works on the physical concept that like charges repel each other, therefore, a positively charged medication will be repelled through the skin to the underlying tissues by the positively charged pad of an iontophoresis machine. Iontophoresis is usually prescribed for injuries such as shoulder or elbow bursitis.\nPelvic Traction - the longitudinal/axial pull on the lumbar spine, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous. Pelvic traction may be helpful for the relief of low back pain and muscle spasm.\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) - a relatively low voltage applied over painful areas through small self-adhesive electrodes. The electrical stimulation \"disguises\" or \"overrides\" the sensation of pain. It is a small, portable unit, used in intervals, to control pain and reduce dependence on drugs. It is usually prescribed for relief of pain.\nUltrasound - ultrasound uses a high frequency sound wave emitted from the sound head when electricity is passed through a quartz crystal. The sound waves cause the vibration of water molecules deep within tissue causing a heating effect. When the sound waves are pulsed, they cause a vibration of the tissue rather than heating. The stream of sound waves helps with nutrition exchange at the cellular level and healing.

Just like anything else, it depends on your perspective AND the expectations of your client or patient. A chiropractor is likely to respond that that is the only way they can perform an adjustment. A cardiologist may say that she has no need to touch the patient. Exercise professionals may say that it helps facilitate what they are doing with their clients.\nThe power of the human touch cannot be underestimated. To the client/patient it may bring a sense of connection with you, confidence in your ability and reassurance. The opposite may be experienced by the patient whose doctor provides a diagnosis only through oral communication and visual observation and never touches the patient.\nI believe that some good and some bad come from the hands on approach. The chiropractors, physical therapists and massage therapists clearly have a need to contact their patients with their hands to practice their disciplines. The hands are used as both an assessment tool and to deliver an intervention. The accuracy of a skilled practitioner is used for reducing joint subluxations, mobilizing joints and relaxing and manipulating soft tissue. All of which have been scientifically proven to be beneficial to the patient.\nThe exercise professional may need to place their hands on the client for assessment purposes such as measuring body composition or pelvic landmarks. Some trainers will also use their hands to provide manual resistance for certain exercises and over-pressure to aid in flexibility. And at times, the hands are placed on the client to guide them through desired movement patterns.\nWith so much to gain how can there be a downside? What if the question was not what was provided to the patient with contact but instead, what is the patient being deprived of? And this question can completely change our perspective on the \u201chands on\u201d approach to care.\nWhatever is provided to the patient/client by the practitioner removes the need for the patient/client to do it themself. We obviously don\u2019t want people going around adjusting or attempting to adjust their own necks or manipulating their own gleno-humeral joints. We do want an attitude and belief system that ALL practitioners are simply adjuncts to the individual\u2019s own abilities. We are facilitators.\nCould chiropractic care and manual therapy create learned helplessness? Do clinics relying predominantly on passive modalities like ultrasound and electrical stimulation fool the patient (and themselves) that the modality is making them better? Is a client psychologically and emotionally dependent on the trainer if she refuses to work out unless the trainer takes her through a workout?\nIf I ask a client what he does regularly for his health and he tells me chiropractic care, I respond by telling him that is what the chiropractor is doing for his health care. I then ask again, \u201cWhat are YOU doing?\u201d\nCould this kind of learned helplessness and dependency even be contributing to the obesity epidemic? It may not be that big of a leap from the dependent patient to the obese individual. If my healthcare consists solely of people doing something to me, how can I be expected to eat right and exercise on my own? The psychosocial behavior of anyone who is not responsible or response-able for their own musculoskeletal health will ultimately suffer from comorbidities.\nThis certainly is not a knock on any kind of manual care. I\u2019ve personally benefitted from chiropractic care, manual physical therapy, acupuncture and Structural Integration. Of course I also have a specific corrective exercise strategy I follow along with my general fitness routine.\nI believe one of the greatest gifts we give our corrective exercise clients at Function First is the ability to produce the same result at home that we produce with them in our facility. That is why we only need to see our clients once a week. They are expected to continue with their home program daily. If they don\u2019t do their homework-they are fired. This is an expectation of all our clients before they begin with us for a corrective exercise program.\nFor this reason, the referral from me to a chiropractor is much easier than the referral from the chiropractor to Function First. Our clients are already engaged in a comprehensive corrective exercise program. The chiropractic or other manual care is an adjunct to the exercises and can often help us expedite the results.\nA referral to Function First often requires a complete paradigm shift for the person referred to us. They now have to go to work on themselves. And quite frankly, many long-term recipients of manual care just aren\u2019t willing to do that.\nWe might say people are lazy and don\u2019t want to do the work. Or, can we say that people have been conditioned that they don\u2019t need to do the work?\n"}, {"score": 2218.04, "uuid": "fc5fb0db-78cf-58c0-bb4b-7ff576a95a91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-68-14674", "target_hostname": "www.sttereizapt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sttereizapt.com/faq", "page_rank": 1.5712267e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Saint Tereiza <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "<em>Pain</em> intensity, <em>what</em> aggravates and eases the problem.

A warm whirlpool provides relief from pain and muscle spasm and is often preparatory to stretching or exercise. Cold whirlpool is used to decrease inflammation and swelling.\nWill I get a massage at physical therapy?\nMassage may be part of your treatment. Rehabilitation specialists are trained in a variety of techniques that may help with your recovery. Deep tissue techniques may be part of the rehabilitative process. Massage is used for three reasons typically - to facilitate venous return from a swollen area, to relax a tight muscle, or to relieve pain. Contrary to common thought, massage does not increase circulation.\n"}, {"score": 2217.9585, "uuid": "07c8b472-61a6-5774-8257-a1d790688ca6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1209wb-13-06870", "target_hostname": "www.sttereizapt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sttereizapt.com/index.php?page=faq", "page_rank": 1.1793482e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Saint Tereiza <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "<em>Pain</em> intensity, <em>what</em> aggravates and eases the problem. How this <em>is</em> impacting your daily activities <em>or</em> your functional limitations.", "explanation": null, "document": "Who will see me?\nYou will be evaluated by one of our licensed and highly trained physical therapists and he/she will also treat you during subsequent visits. Unlike some clinics, where you see someone different each visit, we feel it is very important to develop a one-on-one relationship with you to maintain continuity of care. Since only one physical therapist knows your problems best, he/she is the one that will be working closely with you to speed your recovery.\nAre there physical therapy specialists?\nOrthopedic Physical Therapy - Probably the most common physical therapy specialist is the orthopedic specialist. These specialists care for post-surgical patients, arthritis, tendinitis/tendinosus, fracture rehabilitation, muscle sprains and strains, neck and back pain, hip and knee problems, shoulder, elbow, and wrist conditions. Some are board certified as Orthopedic Certified Specialists (OCS).\nManual Therapy - Manual therapy is a broad term that describes a variety of hands-on treatment techniques that are applied to movement dysfunctions. Grade five mobilizations, Mulligan mobilizations with movement, Maitland and Kaltenborn techniques, functional technique, neural mobilization, joint mobilization, craniosacral therapy, strain/counter strain, myofascial release, etc. These are some of the more popular manual therapy techniques. Many manual therapists will take continuing education courses, obtain certifications in manual therapy, and will sit for board certification from the American Physical Therapy Association and other organizations. Most physical therapists incorporate manual therapy techniques as a part of a complete treatment plan.\nGeriatric Physical Therapy - Some therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of seniors. As the body ages, a variety of challenges arise. We stiffen, we lose strength, our balance skills decline, our bones become brittle (osteoporosis), our endurance decreases, and we take longer to recover from injuries. Balance and fall prevention are of paramount importance to the therapist who is working with seniors and some clinics are solely dedicated to caring for those with balance problems. Most physical therapists work with seniors/geriatric patients. Some have obtained additional education, have passed a board examination, and have earned the Geriatric Certified Specialist (GCS) title.\nSports Rehabilitation - Experts in assisting with recovery after injury and surgery. Many sports specialists help with retraining the athlete utilizing running, throwing, jumping, and sport-specific programs to name a few. A therapist with the Sports Certified Specialist (SCS) title has passed a board certified test.\nFitness and Wellness - Physical therapists are well trained to help with your fitness needs and wellness programs. If you need an exercise program, have trouble with your weight, are concerned about osteoporosis, have an issue with diabetes, or you would like to learn how to prevent falls, physical therapists can help. The previous examples are just a few of the many programs physical therapists offer.\nHand Therapy - Most physical therapists are well trained to treat hand and wrist conditions. Some therapists have taken additional courses and training and have passed a hand therapy certification examination. These therapists are called Certified Hand Therapists (CHTs).\nWomen's Health - Some therapists specialize in women's issues such as pregnancy problems, pelvic pain, and incontinence. Special treatment is available for women who have these problems. Many that suffer from incontinence do so needlessly. A physical therapist may be able to help.\nIndustrial Rehabilitation - Specialists in industrial rehabilitation help with those that have suffered on-the-job injuries. Moreover, they will evaluate work tasks, fabricate assistive devices, evaluate your ergonomic situation, and help redesign work flow/tasks to decrease the incidence of injury. Often, industrial rehabilitation specialists will evaluate your ability to perform certain job tasks with a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE).\nPediatric Physical Therapy - Pediatric therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of children. They may assist with kids who suffer from cerebral palsy, developmental disorders, neurological disorders, and/or orthopedic problems. A Pediatric Certified Specialist (PCS) is a board certification that some may obtain from the American Physical Therapy Association.\nAquatic Physical Therapy - Aquatic therapy takes advantage of the physical properties of water to assist with the rehabilitative process. Buoyancy, turbulence, hydrostatic pressure, and thermal properties of water can assist with the rehabilitation of a patient. Those suffering from chronic pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lumbar fusion surgery, or with a limited weight-bearing status are just a few of the many different patient populations that can benefit from aquatic therapy.\nCardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation - A small percentage of physical therapists practice in this discipline. Those that pass the board certification have the title of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Certified Specialist (CCS) work with patients who have had heart attacks, bypass surgeries, angioplasty, breathing problems, emphysema, and other heart/lung related conditions. Physical therapists are well equipped to work with these types of patients because many of them have orthopedic ailments that limit their ability to function. In other words, a physical therapist can address the heart and lung problems as well as the muscle problems that are concurrently present.\nNeurological, Spinal Cord Injury, and Traumatic Brain Injury Rehab - A large portion of physical therapists work with patients who suffer from these conditions. Functional retraining including, walking, wheelchair use, getting in and out of bed or chairs (transfer training), moving in bed (bed mobility), and retraining patients to use their shoulders, arms, and hands are just some of the services these therapists provide to those with neurological involvement. A certified specialist holds a Neurologic Certified Specialist title (NCS).\nBalance, Dizziness, and Vertigo Rehabilitation - Many suffer from dizziness or BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). Some clinics specialize in the rehabilitation of patients with vertigo. Patient education, strengthening, safety awareness, posture and balance exercise, walking exercise, and special techniques that affect sensory and balance centers of the brain and limbs are all important components of a rehabilitation program.\nAmputee Rehabilitation - many physical therapists specialize in the rehabilitation of amputees. Caring for the injured limb, functional and walking training, training in the use of assistive devices (crutches, canes, prosthetic limbs, etc.) are all provided by a therapist who specializes in care for amputees.\nWound Care - Some therapists specialize in the treatment and care of wounds. This is accomplished by the removal of unviable tissue (debridement), the application of special dressings and prescription drugs/ointments, and the use of ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and aquatic modalities to promote healing. Exercise and patient education are also routine components of a wound care program.\nECS (Clinical Electrophysiologic Certified Specialist) - A physical therapist who is board certified to perform electroneurophysiology examinations such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography.\nLymphedema Rehabilitation - We take it for granted but a special component of the circulatory system, the lymph system, helps filter and drain fluid from our arms and legs. When this drainage system is damaged, painful swelling can result. Some therapists specialize in the treatment of lymphedema as it is called. Special positioning, massage and bandaging techniques are utilized by the lymphedema specialist.\nOsteoporosis Rehabilitation and Prevention - Some practitioners specialize in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis patients. Working in concert with your medical doctor, the therapist will often design a specialized weight-bearing and resistance training program for those with this silent disease.\nIs physical therapy painful?\nFor many patients, one of the primary objectives is pain relief. This is frequently accomplished with hands-on techniques, modalities such as ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and/or heat or cold therapy. Movement often provides pain relief as well. Your physical therapist will provide you with the appropriate exercises not only for pain relief but to recover range of motion, strength, and endurance.\nIn some cases, physical therapy techniques can be painful. For example, recovering knee range of motion after total knee replacement or shoulder range of motion after shoulder surgery may be painful. Your physical therapist will utilize a variety of techniques to help maximize your treatment goals. It is important that you communicate the intensity, frequency, and duration of pain to your therapist. Without this information, it is difficult for the therapist to adjust your treatment plan.\nWhat types of treatments will I receive?\nThere are dozens of different types of treatment interventions. Here is a list of treatment interventions:\nActive Range of Motion (AROM) - the patient lifts or moves a body part through range of motion against gravity. AROM is usually one of the first modalities prescribed for arthritis.\nActive Assistive Range of Motion (AAROM) - therapist-assisted active range of motion. This is usually prescribed for gentle stretching or strengthening for a very weak body part.\nStationary Bicycle - with or without resistance. This is usually prescribed for improving the strength and/or range of motion of the back or lower extremities as well as cardiovascular endurance.\nGait or Walking Training - the analysis of walking problems by visually examining the interaction of the low back and the joints of the thighs, legs, and feet during the various stages of walking, including initial contact, loading response, mid stance, terminal stance, pre swing, mid swing, and terminal swing. Many back, thigh, leg, ankle, and foot problems may be caused by or manifest themselves in subtle gait abnormalities.\nIsometrics - muscle contraction without joint movement. This is usually prescribed for strengthening without stressing or damaging the joint (e.g., arthritis, or exercises to be performed in a cast, or right after surgery if recommended by the therapist/doctor).\nIsotonics- muscle(s) contracting through the ROM with resistance. This is usually prescribed for strengthening.\nSoft Tissue Mobilization - therapeutic massage of body tissue performed with the hands. Soft tissue mobilization may be used for muscle relaxation, to decrease swelling, to decrease scar tissue adhesions, and for pain relief.\nMobilization - hands-on therapeutic procedures intended to increase soft tissue or joint mobility. Mobilization is usually prescribed to increase mobility, delaying progressive stiffness, and to relieve pain. There are many types of mobilization techniques including Maitland, Kaltenborn, Isometric Mobilizations, etc.\nProprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) - a system of manually resisted exercises performed in diagonal patterns that mimic functional movements. PNF was initially used in developmentally and neurologically impaired patients but now is used in almost every aspect of neuromuscular retraining from athletes in sports facilities to the very weak in hospitals and nursing homes.\nPosture Training - instruction in the correct biomechanical alignment of the body to reduce undue strain on muscles, joints, ligaments, discs, and other soft tissues. There is an ideal posture, but most people do not have ideal posture. Therapists educate patients about the importance of improving posture with daily activities. Stretching and strengthening exercises may be prescribed to facilitate postural improvement and to prevent further disability and future recurrences of problems.\nProgressive Resistive Exercises (PRE) - exercises that gradually increase in resistance (weights) and in repetitions. PRE is usually prescribed for reeducation of muscles and strengthening. Weights, rubber bands, and body weight can be used as resistance.\nPassive Range of Motion (PROM) - the patient or therapist moves the body part through a range of motion without the use of the muscles that \"actively\" move the joint(s).\nStretching/Flexibility Exercise - exercise designed to lengthen muscle(s) or soft tissue. Stretching exercises are usually prescribed to improve the flexibility of muscles that have tightened due to disuse or in compensation to pain, spasm or immobilization.\nCryotherapy or Cold Therapy - used to cause vasoconstriction (the blood vessels constrict or decrease their diameter) to reduce the amount of fluid that leaks out of the capillaries into the tissue spaces (swelling) in response to injury of tissue. Ice or cold is used most frequently in acute injuries, but also an effective pain reliever for even the most chronic pain.\nNeuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) - the application of electrical stimulation to aid in improving strength (e.g., the quadriceps muscle after knee surgery or injury). NMES is also used to decrease pain and swelling and to relieve muscle spasm.\nNeck Traction - a gentle longitudinal/axial pull on the neck, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous for relief of neck pain, to decrease muscle spasm and facilitate unloading of the spine.\nHeat - heat is recommended to decrease chronic pain, relax muscles, and for pain relief. It should not be used with an acute or \"new\" injury.\nIontophoresis - medications are propelled through the skin by an electrical charge. This modality works on the physical concept that like charges repel each other, therefore, a positively charged medication will be repelled through the skin to the underlying tissues by the positively charged pad of an iontophoresis machine. Iontophoresis is usually prescribed for injuries such as shoulder or elbow bursitis.\nPelvic Traction - the longitudinal/axial pull on the lumbar spine, either manual or mechanical, intermittent or continuous. Pelvic traction may be helpful for the relief of low back pain and muscle spasm.\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) - a relatively low voltage applied over painful areas through small self-adhesive electrodes. The electrical stimulation \"disguises\" or \"overrides\" the sensation of pain. It is a small, portable unit, used in intervals, to control pain and reduce dependence on drugs. It is usually prescribed for relief of pain.\nUltrasound - ultrasound uses a high frequency sound wave emitted from the sound head when electricity is passed through a quartz crystal. The sound waves cause the vibration of water molecules deep within tissue causing a heating effect. When the sound waves are pulsed, they cause a vibration of the tissue rather than heating. The stream of sound waves helps with nutrition exchange at the cellular level and healing. Studies have shown that ultrasound is helpful for ligament healing and clinically, for carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle spasm.\nWhirlpool - immersion of a body part into water with small \"agitators\" to provide a gentle massaging motion. A warm whirlpool provides relief from pain and muscle spasm and is often preparatory to stretching or exercise. Cold whirlpool is used to decrease inflammation and swelling.\nWill I get a massage at physical therapy?\nMassage may be part of your treatment. Rehabilitation specialists are trained in a variety of techniques that may help with your recovery. Deep tissue techniques may be part of the rehabilitative process. Massage is used for three reasons typically - to facilitate venous return from a swollen area, to relax a tight muscle, or to relieve pain.

It is easy to assume to that the elderly don\u2019t have the same tensions as the young, but that isn\u2019t true. Senior citizens face a wide variety of mental and emotional problems ranging from loneliness, depression and isolation. Also, their bodies often carry the ill-effects of a lifetime of work and stress.\nAs massage therapy evolves and becomes more specific, a recent advancement in the field is geriatric massage therapy. This kind of massage is targeted specially at senior citizens. It usually includes 30 minute to hour-long sessions in a facility, a senior citizens\u2019 home, or residence. The geriatric massage therapist starts with helping the patient to passively stretch his or her shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. Soft massage strokes are then applied to various parts of the body, and the therapist is careful not to press too hard. The therapist may often focus on the back, and the aim is to improve cardiovascular health and circulation.\nThe benefits of geriatric massage therapy can be many for a senior citizen. The most immediate benefit is decreasing the stiffness of the body and reducing inflammation. Like all massages, this one too helps with improving blood circulation and posture. This in itself has many related health benefits, and because of this a geriatric massage once a week is an effective preventive therapy. For those citizens who suffer from age-related ailments like arthritis, diabetes or Parkinson, massage can improve the circulation of lymphatic fluid, providing some relief from these problems.\nYet another, deeper benefit from this massage is immeasurable. The massage helps senior citizens with physical and emotional problems connect with other people. This helps them fight feelings of isolation, restlessness, and uselessness that many of the elderly have. Any good massage therapist develops a strong emotional and physical bond with the patient, and this can greatly benefit the elderly. This sort of physical activity provides older people with emotional and mental support that can help them live the sunsets of their lives with strength and dignity.\nMassage therapy is particularly valuable for the aches and pains associated with growing older. Currently, with the drastic rise in the number of aging baby-boomers, many massage therapists are opting to learn massage techniques that are specifically designed to help the elderly achieve mind-body harmony. This age-specific massage is either called senior\u2019s massage or geriatric massage.\nSenior massage doesn\u2019t differ much in technique compared to massage for regular adults. However the techniques used must keep in mind that an aging body requires a little extra tender loving care. Specially trained geriatric massage therapists are aware that an elderly body must be positioned carefully on a massage table, compared to a healthy 30-year-old body. Great care is taken in the positioning of an elderly client, and once positioned on the massage table, a senior will rarely ever be asked to move, as is so typical with other types of massage.\nSenior massage sessions will typically range from 30-mintues to an hour. However, when mobility is an issue for example the client is wheelchair-bound the massage therapist will be forced to adapt and the massage can take longer. For example, if the client is bound to a wheelchair, the massage therapist will administer massage to the client right in the chair.\nGeriatric massage practitioners will often spend more time on the hands and feet of their clients \u2013 especially if the client doesn\u2019t walk or have full use of their hands. In cases such as these, a hand or foot massage can enhance body awareness, sensation and circulation in certain parts of an aging body.\nThe benefits of geriatric massage are numerous. Massage does the usual for seniors by encouraging circulation, decreasing muscular stiffness, and helping to decrease inflammation that may rest in the joints. However, it also treats so many of the typical conditions that arise with age \u2013 such as muscular stiffness, arthritis, skin discoloration, muscle and bone deterioration, tendonitis, bursitis, and respiratory problems such as asthma and emphysema.\nFurthermore, the benefits of enjoying the simple pleasure of human touch and company for just a brief period of time is priceless for many lonely and depressed seniors. Careful massage can help provide the elderly with symptomatic relief and enable seniors to extend the vitality in their lives.\nGeriatric massage is a growing practice within the field of Massage Therapy. It focuses on the specific needs of the aging population in the prevention, assessment and treatment of the joints and soft tissue systems of the body. In some cases the objective is to maintain or enhance optimal functioning in healthy soft tissues, at other times, pain relief and specific dysfunction and disease is addressed.\nThe need for physical touch and its benefits are another important reason why people are using geriatric massage. In general, the field of geriatrics is one of increasing focus as we have more people entering the older adult years than in any time in history. Many services are aimed at meeting the needs of this population with a focus on increasing quality of life. Geriatric massage can be performed by most massage therapists by modifying their existing techniques and positioning to meet the needs of this population. As massage therapists, we do not diagnose medical conditions and therefore it is very important to work as part of a multidisciplinary team to ensure that a person is receiving medical care to diagnose any signs and symptoms that are occurring in the older adult years.\u00a0 If you are looking for such a team, you may contact Total Health Systems of Macomb County for a consultation today.\nRESOURCES:\n"}, {"score": 2196.3872, "uuid": "ec9fe113-4013-523b-9711-2559595862f4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1714wb-84-15844", "target_hostname": "hitsphere.com", "target_uri": "http://hitsphere.com/category/social-tags/physical-therapy", "page_rank": 1.1878688e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>therapy</em> | Healthcare IT", "snippet": "<em>for</em> low <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> <em>is</em> Not Rocket Science, and could have HUGE implications <em>for</em> our society.

I explained how to access information from journals and blogs without searching the net. I even discussed which journals and blogs you may want to follow and why. But, to truly engage, retain, critique, and apply this information to our clinical practices and research we must move beyond just reading. We need to discuss and analyze and integrate\u2026.but\u2026\nHow do we do this when we are sitting by ourselves on a computer? There are a variety of built in tools that we can utilize to accomplish this within Google Reader, in the comments sections of blogs, via Twitter and Facebook. Most of the technology presented in this post series can be linked and utilized simultaneously. All of this from you office, laptop, tablet, or smart phone. In this post, I have bolded words, phrases, or concepts that I think are important throughout this post. This includes the concept of \u201cpushing\u201d information, modifying a tweet, micro-blogging, and discussion via blog comments.\nThe exact topic of blogs and the discussions stemming from them was recently written about on the CasesBlog: Medical and Health Blog . In the post, Blogging is good for you \u2013 and for most people who read blogs it is stated:\nThe back-and-forth between bloggers resembles the informal chats, in university hallways and coffee rooms, that have always stimulated economic research, argues Paul Krugman, a Nobel-prize winning economist who blogs at the New York Times. But moving the conversation online means that far more people can take part.\nThe post links to an article from the Economist Website titled Economic Blogs: A less dismal debate . Interestingly, they assert that papers that are blogged about and/or authors who blog may be considered more respected:\nAcademic papers cited by bloggers are far more likely to be downloaded. Blogging economists are regarded more highly than non-bloggers with the same publishing record.\nI wonder if in the future, features such as track back or blog presence will be utilized to calculate a journal\u2019s impact factor or rate researchers and academics.\nTWITTER, with it\u2019s 140 character limit for tweets and profile descriptions, is truly a micro-blogging medium. Everyone who is on Twitter is a micro-blogger. It forces succinct communication. Twitter offers a variety of opportunities and ways to access and discuss information. Obviously, you can read the tweets and go to the links that others post. You can reply to tweets to initiate a dialogue. RE-TWEET is when you tweet someone else\u2019s tweet with RT before their twitter handle (name).\nHere I re-tweeted @BodyinMind's link about research and blogging. The link is the article I mention earlier in the post.\nNow, you can also tweet a MODIFIED\u00a0TWEET (MT). Essentially, with an MT you are changing or editing the content or message of a tweet. Below is an original tweet about manual therapy from @DenverDPT regarding manual therapy effects from the 2011 AAOMPT Annual Conference:\nI then modified the phrasing and content to deliver a\u00a0similar, but more specific message based on my understanding of manual therapy. I preceded the tweet with MT to communicate that I had modified an original tweet by Denver Lancaster.\nI view FACEBOOK as a personal mini-blog. Links, videos, and articles can be posted with ease.\u00a0Similar\u00a0to a blog, friends can comment and discuss. Through pages, individuals can connect on a specific topic, cause, or organization. For example, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists has a Facebook Page: AAOMPT Facebook Page . Beyond networking and professional connection, Facebook is an also a means to access, read, and talk about information.\nIt is not necessary to have your own BLOG to utilize the medium to discuss and learn. You can utilize BLOG COMMENTS to write your insights and questions. If you disagree with a conclusion you can formulate a more thorough, researched response. Often, I find myself more intrigued and challenged by the discussion that happens in the comments section of a blog post. Especially if you do not publish your own blog, posting well researched and thoughtful comments is essentially blogging! You can have online discussion with links to other blogs, research articles, and online resources with the blog\u2019s author and\u00a0commentors. Professionals, researchers, and students from across the world can have in-depth, passionate debates at their convenience. Want to stay plugged into a debate? Many blogs offer the option to SUBSCRIBE TO COMMENTS via e-mail or RSS. You will automatically be alerted when a new comment is posted.\nAfter dabbling in blog engagement, you may even desire to publish your own blog. This process is actually quite simple. There are many free resources including Blogger and WordPress . Blogger is Google\u2019s free blog hosting service. A very professional looking blog can be started in an afternoon utilizing free templates and helpful layout designs. As I have mentioned previously, I am disappointed in the lack of blogs surrounding neurologic and acute care physical therapist practice. I remain hopeful that this segment will grow.\nPUSHING is an interesting concept in the current social media landscape. All of us has experienced pushing whether we realize it or not. E-mail is a pushing service. Information is pushed to our in-box, and we push information to others. As discussed in previous posts, we utilize Google Reader to have information pushed directly to one location (our RSS Reader). Further, information chosen specifically by our Facebook friends and the tweeps we follow on Twitter is pushed automatically to our news feeds. Conversely, we can push information between our social media accounts through certain applications or linkages. For example, I have a twitter application that allows me to push any tweet to my Facebook account by putting the hashtag (#) FB at the end of my tweet > #fb.\nSome pushing and linking features are automatically available. You can \u201clike\u201d an item on Google Reader and then make comments. Then, individuals who follow you on Google Reader can see your comments. Information can be pushed or shared directly from Google Reader to Facebook and Twitter (via the \u201cSend To\u201d button). A post can also be made directly to Google+. There is even a button to e-mail the link!\nMost journals are now publishing content and articles online before the print version of the journal is available. E-PUB AHEAD OF PRINT simply means that article was electronically published online ahead of the print version. Journals, including Physical Therapy Journal, even have RSS feeds for E-Pub content. Now, people can blog, comment, Tweet, and Facebook about articles before the print version is published. By the time someone who subscribes to a print journal reads an article, it has probably arlready been shared, critiqued, analyzed, and discussed for weeks to MONTHS.\nInterestingly, as widgets and applications evolve the line between various forms of social media and Web2.0 principles becomes more blurred. For example, Twitter feeds and tweets can be seamlessly integrated on the sidebar of a blog. Applications allow for the automatic pushing of tweets to Facebook profiles. And with tools such as HootSuite you can control both from one dashboard. Many Twitter applications allow the scheduling of Tweets into the future, so you do not overload followers with 1,249 tweets in 5.9 seconds. Facebook also allows users to create a badge, or snapshot, to have the sidebar of blogs.\nImagine networks of students, researchers, and clinicians connecting through Google Reader, Twitter, Facebook, and blogs to diseminate and discuss research, blog posts, newspaper articles, and legislation. Imagine the proliferation of professional networking, learning, and discussion. The potential exists for clinicians to\u00a0collaborate\u00a0remotely on patient care and research projects.\u00a0If you have not already, check out PHYSIOPEDIA . Physio-pedia is the model for the future fusion of technology with education, learning, and research.\nAll of these tools have the ability to elevate our individual knowledge base, care delivery, and research. On a grand scale, it gives us the opportunity to improve professional growth and patient care for all regardless of geographical location. I imagine technology integration and colloboration as the basis for the future of \u201ccontinuing education\u201d and professional learning\u2026\nI envision a future where professionals from across the globe are accessing, disseminating, discussing, critiquing, and even performing research and clinical practice.\nIn the next post, I will illustrate these principles from a real life scenario. As a preview, I responded to a Tweet that linked to a performance and injury risk reduction program aimed at decreasing ACL injury rate AND improving performance.\u00a0In that interaction, I utilized and pushed an article via Google Reader to Twitter. I was able to engage in a virtual conversation with a handful of individuals regarding the topic. After I present the interaction,\u00a0I will discuss and analyze the encounter and research evidence surrounding the specific topic of ACL injury risk reduction and performance improvement.\nJanuary 14,2012\nLeveraging Technology IV: Blogs\nSo, this series has had a long, long hiatus between posts for which I apologize!!

Pain tells us something is wrong in the structure or function of our body and that we need to do something about it. Because pain is such a strong motivator for action, it is considered one of the body\u2019s most important protective mechanisms.\nDefinitions of Pain\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defined pain as \u201can unpleasant, subjective, sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\u201d (1979). Pain, however, is much more than a physical sensation caused by a single entity. It is subjective and highly individual, a complex mechanism with physical, emotional, and cognitive components.\nPain cannot be objectively measured in the same way as, for example, the chemical content of urine or the oxygen content level of blood. Only the person who is suffering knows how the experience feels. For these reasons, McCaffery defined pain as \u201cwhatever the experiencing person says it is and whenever he says it does\u201d (1979). The American Pain Society goes further by stating that it is \u201cnot the responsibility of clients to prove they are in pain; it is the nurse\u2019s responsibility to accept the client\u2019s report of pain\u201d (2005).\nPain alters the quality of life more than any other health-related problem. It interferes with sleep, mobility, nutrition, thought, sexual activity, emotional well-being, creativity, and self-actualization. Surprisingly, even though pain is such an important obstacle to comfort, it is one of the least understood, most undertreated, and oft-discounted problems of healthcare providers and their clients. For this reason, some nurses and therapists add comfort to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of basic human needs (1968). The American Pain Society goes further, declaring the relief of pain a \u201cbasic human right\u201d (2005).\nTraditionally, pain was considered merely a physical symptom of illness or injury, a simple stimulus-response mechanism. Though the historic role of nurses and therapists has been to relieve pain and suffering, there has been little understanding of the complexity of pain and only limited ways to manage it. Recent research shows pain to be a distinct disorder, with physical, emotional, and cognitive components. This view of pain has broadened our understanding of pain and given us new ways to understand its characteristics.\nPAIN-RELATED TERMINOLOGY\nAlgesia: Sensitivity to pain.\nBreakthrough pain: Transitory increase in pain to a level greater than the client\u2019s well-controlled baseline level (McCaffery & Pasero, 2003).\nHyperalgesia: Excessive sensitivity to pain.\nIdiopathic pain: Chronic pain for which there is no identifiable psychological or physical cause.\nIntractable pain: Pain that is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, and nursing measures (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nPain threshold: Amount of pain required before individuals feel the pain. The lower the threshold, the less pain they can endure; the higher the threshold, the more pain they can endure.\nPain tolerance: Maximum amount and duration of pain a person can endure. Tolerance varies widely among people and is influenced by emotions and cultural background.\nPain syndrome: A group of symptoms of which pain is the critical element, such as headaches and post-herpetic neuralgia.\nPhantom limb pain: Pain that occurs in a limb after it is removed or as a result of severe damage to the affected nerve plexus due to perceptual disruption in the brain.\nPsychogenic pain: Chronic pain with no identified organic explanation.\nRadiating pain: Pain that begins at one place and extends out into nearby tissues.\nReferred pain: Pain that is felt at a different location than where tissue was damaged. This phenomenon occurs because pain fibers in the damaged area synapse near fibers from other areas of the body; for example, a myocardial infarction may create referred pain in the left shoulder.\nTypes of Pain\nPain is classified as acute and chronic. Acute pain has an identifiable cause and occurs soon after an injury to tissues in the body, such as bone, skin, or muscle. Acute pain is protective in that it motivates a person to take action. Its onset may be sudden or slow, and its intensity may vary from mild to severe. Acute pain is temporary and subsides as healing takes place. Severe acute pain activates the sympathetic nervous system, causing diaphoresis, increased respiratory and pulse rates, and elevated blood pressure.\nChronic pain lasts beyond an expected healing phase, is non-protective in that it serves no function, and may not have an identifiable cause (Patterson, 2007). When pain goes on more than 6 months, it moves from being a \u201csymptom\u201d to a \u201ccondition.\u201d Chronic pain afflicts more than 1 in 5 Americans and is one of the most pervasive and thorny medical conditions in the United States. Such pain is described as nonmalignant (noncancerous), malignant (cancerous), and intractable.\nNonmalignant, noncancerous chronic pain typically accompanies such conditions as osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathy. The lack of purpose and uncertainty of duration of such pain may lead to depression, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, apathy, learned helplessness, and other psychosocial consequences. If it is severe, chronic pain\u2014like prolonged stress\u2014activates the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in muscle tension, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and failure of body defenses.\nMalignant, cancerous chronic pain may be due to tumor progression, invasive procedures, infection, toxicities of treatment, and physical limitations. Such pain may be felt at the tumor site or some distance from it. Since clients with cancer may experience both chronic and acute pain, caregivers need to investigate immediately any new pain in these clients.\nIntractable chronic pain is pain from any cause that is resistant to medical, surgical, and nursing measures. Persistent and ongoing, intractable chronic pain may be psychogenic in nature (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nSources of Pain\nThe sources of pain are divided into three main categories: nociceptor, non-nociceptor, and psychogenic.\nNociceptor pain results when tissue damage produces a pain-producing stimulus that sends an electrical impulse across a pain receptor (nociceptor) by way of a nerve fiber to the central nervous system. Nociceptor pain is further divided into visceral and somatic pain.\nVisceral pain results from stimulation of nociceptors in the abdominal cavity and thorax.\nSomatic pain is divided into deep somatic and cutaneous pain. Deep somatic pain arises from bones, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. Cutaneous pain originates in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Some body tissues, such as the brain and lung, have no nociceptors, and some tissues have many.\nNon-nociceptor (neuropathic) pain is caused by direct injury to structures of the nervous system.\nPsychogenic pain is pain for which there is little or no physical evidence of organic disease or identified injury to tissues in the body. Lack of evidence, however, does not mean clients are malingering or that they are not suffering.\nPHYSIOLOGIC SOURCES OF PAIN\nSource: Adapted with permission from Ignatavicius et al., 1999.\nNociceptor: Visceral\nOrgans and linings of body cavities\nMechanism\nPoorly localized, diffuse, deep, cramping or splitting\nSources of acute pain\nChest tubes, abdominal tube drains, bladder and intestinal distention\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nPancreatitis, liver metastases, colitis\nCutaneous: skin and sub-cutaneous tissues\nDeep somatic: blood, muscle, blood vessels, connective tissue\nMechanism\nIncisional pain, insertion sites of tubes and drains, wound complications, orthopedic procedures, skeletal muscle spasms\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nBony metastases, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, peripheral vascular disease\nNon-nociceptor: Neuropathic\nNerve fibers, spinal cord, and central nervous system\nMechanism\nNon-nociceptive injury to nervous system structures\nCharacteristics\nGeneralized along distribution of damaged nervous structures\nSources of acute pain\nPoorly localized: shooting, burning, fiery, shock-like, sharp, painful numbness\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNervous tissue injury due to diabetes, HIV, chemotherapy, neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, trauma, surgery\nPsychogenic\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNonorganic psychological factors\nPhysiology of Pain\nThough a person is not consciously aware of the process, the experience of pain involves a complex sequence of biochemical and electrical events or processes beginning with tissue damage and followed by transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation.\nTISSUE DAMAGE\nWhen tissue is damaged, there is an immediate release of inflammatory chemicals called excitatory neurotransmitters, such as histamine and bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator. Increased blood in the area causes the injured area to swell, redden, and become tender. The bradykinin stimulates the release of prostaglandins and substance P, a potent neurotransmitter that enhances the movement of impulses across nerve synapses.\nTRANSDUCTION AND TRANSMISSION\nTransduction occurs as the energy of the stimulus is converted to electrical energy. Transmission of the stimulus takes place when this energy crosses into a nociceptor at the end of an afferent nerve fiber. Two types of peripheral nerve fibers conduct painful stimuli: the fast, myelinated A-delta fibers and the very small, slow, unmyelinated C-fibers. A-fibers send sharp, distinct sensations that localize the source of the pain and detect its intensity. C-fibers relay impulses that are poorly localized, burning, and persistent. For example, after burning a finger, a person initially feels a sharp localized pain as a result of A-fiber transmission. Within a few seconds the pain becomes more diffuse and widespread as a result of C-fiber transmission.\nPain stimuli travel quickly to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where the \u201cgating\u201d mechanism (discussed below) occurs. Pain impulses then cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and ascend to the higher centers in the brain via the spinothalamic tracts and on to the thalamus and higher centers of the brain, including the reticular formation, limbic system, and somatosensory cortex.\nNeurologic transmission of pain stimuli. (Illustration by Jason McAlexander. \u00a9 2005, Wild Iris Medical Education.\nPERCEPTION\nWhen pain stimuli reach the cerebral cortex, the brain interprets the signal; processes information from experiences, knowledge, and cultural associations; and perceives pain. Thus, perception is the awareness of pain. The somatosensory cortex identifies the location and intensity of pain, and the associated cortex determines how an individual interprets its meaning.\nMODULATION\nOnce the brain perceives the pain, the body releases neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins), serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. These chemicals hinder the transmission of pain and help produce an analgesic, pain-relieving effect. This inhibition of the pain impulse is called modulation. The descending paths of the efferent fibers extend from the cortex down to the spinal cord and may influence pain impulses at the level of the spinal cord.\nGATE-CONTROL THEORY\nMelzack and Wall proposed the gate-control theory to explain the relationship between pain and the emotions (1982). According to the theory, a gating mechanism occurs when a pain impulse travels to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. There, trigger (T) cells influence the transmission of pain impulses. When their activity is inhibited, the gate closes and impulses are less likely to be transmitted to the brain. This mechanism is controlled by descending nerve fibers from the thalamus and cerebral cortex, areas of the brain that regulate thought and emotions. The gate-control theory helps explain how thoughts and emotions modify the perception of pain and why interventions, such as imagery and distraction, help relieve it.\nFactors That Influence Pain\nThe perception of pain is influenced by physiologic, psychological, and cultural factors, all of which caregivers need to consider.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS\nAge\nAge affects the way people respond to pain. It influences both the development and decline of the nervous system. Aging affects the whole body, causing many painful degenerative disorders (such as osteoarthritis), secondary injuries (such as skin abrasions and fractures), and a host of common surgical procedures (such as cataract and hip replacement). Age also affects the way families and caregivers respond to complaints of pain. The following table gives a brief overview of the perception of pain relative to age. (The management of pain in children and older adults will be discussed in greater depth later in this course.)\nAGE AND THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN\nAge\nPain Perception\nPre-term infants\nHave anatomical and functional ability to process pain by mid to late gestation; seem to have greater sensitivity to pain than term infants or children\nNewborn infants\nResponse to pain is inborn and does not require prior learning; respond to pain with behaviors such as crying, grimacing, moving body\nInfants, 1 month\nCan metabolize analgesics and anesthesia effectively; can recognize caregiver as comforter\nToddlers/Preschoolers\nCan describe pain, its location and intensity; respond to pain by crying, anger, sadness; may consider pain a punishment; may hold someone accountable for pain and remember experiences in a certain location, such as a clinic\nSchool-age children\nMay try to be brave when facing a painful procedure; may regress to an earlier stage of development; seek understanding of reasons for pain\nAdolescents\nMay be slow to acknowledge pain; may consider showing signs of pain a weakness; may regress to earlier stages of development with persistent pain\nAdults\u00c2\nFear of pain may prevent some from seeking care; may believe admission of pain is a weakness and inappropriate for age or sex; may consider pain a punishment for moral failure\nOlder adults\nMay have decreased sensations or perceptions of pain; may consider pain an inevitable part of aging; chronic pain may produce anorexia, lethargy, depression; may not report pain due to fear of expense, possible treatment, dependency; often describe pain in nonmedical terms such as \u201churt\u201d or \u201cache\u201d; may fear addiction to analgesics; may not want to bother nurses or be a \u201cbad patient\u201d\nFatigue\nFatigue decreases coping abilities and heightens the perception of pain. When people are exhausted from physical activity, stress, and lack of sleep, their perception of pain may be heightened and their coping skills diminished. Thus, sleep and rest from physical, emotional, and social demands are important measures to manage pain more effectively.\nGenetic Makeup\nRecent research suggests that sensitivity to and tolerance for pain may a genetically linked trait (Ruda et al., 2000). This finding does not negate the need to manage pain adequately, regardless of inherited traits.\nMemory\nMemory of painful experiences, especially experiences that occurred as a very young child, may increase sensitivity and decrease tolerance to pain. For example, even young children remember the pain of an immunization at the doctor\u2019s office and henceforth may be afraid to visit the doctor again.\nStress Response\nResearch has shown that \u201csevere, unrelieved pain can cause an overwhelming stress response in both pre-term and full-term infants which can lead to serious complications and even death\u201d (Pasero, 2004). In recent years, post-traumatic stress syndrome has been the subject of extensive research, both as to its cause and its treatment (Hamilton, 2008).\nHealing\nRecent research suggests that unrelieved acute pain slows postoperative wound healing (McGuire, 2006). This evidence is not surprising, given our increasing knowledge of the effect of stress on the human body.\nNeurologic Function\nAny factor that interrupts or interferes with normal pain transmission affects the awareness and response of clients to pain and places them at risk for injury. Analgesics, sedatives, and alcohol depress the functioning of the central nervous system. Some diseases, such as leprosy, damage peripheral nerves, decrease sensitivity to touch and pain, and render sufferers more vulnerable to injury.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS\nFear and Anxiety\nThe relationship between pain and fear is convoluted and complex. Fear tends to increase the perception of pain, and pain increases feelings of fear and anxiety. This connection occurs in the brain because painful stimuli activate portions of the limbic system believed to control emotional reactions. People who are seriously injured or critically ill often experience both pain and heightened levels of anxiety due to their feelings of helplessness and lack of control. Caregivers need to address both pain and anxiety and use all appropriate measures to relieve suffering.\nCoping\nPeople manage pain and other stressors of life in different ways. Some see themselves as self-sufficient, internally controlled, and independent. As a result, they may deny pain or be slow to admit they are suffering. Others see themselves as insufficient, externally controlled, and dependent on others to treat their pain. Self-sufficient, internally controlled people may do better with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), whereas dependent, externally controlled individuals may prefer nurse-administered analgesia. No matter what the coping style, it is the responsibility of caregivers to relieve pain.\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nCultural beliefs and values affect the way people respond to pain. As children they learn what is and what is not acceptable behavior when experiencing pain. In some cultures, any expression of pain is considered cowardly and shameful. In others, noisy demonstrations of pain are expected and acceptable. The meaning of pain itself may be markedly different in different cultures. Some ethnic groups see pain as a punishment for wrongdoing. Others see pain as a test of faith. And still others view pain as a challenge to be overcome. Recent immigrants to America are more likely to view pain from their cultural roots. Regardless of an individual\u2019s language, religion, or situation, nurses and therapists respect every person and strive to alleviate pain and suffering.\nSTANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nBecause pain management is so important to the provision of quality healthcare, many organizations have developed standards by which professional practice is measured. Two such organizations are the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\nJoint Commission\nThe Joint Commission is an independent organization that accredits and certifies more than 17,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the United States. It evaluates how well these healthcare providers meet published standards of care, including their management of pain. The federal government accepts Joint Commission\u2013accredited facilities as qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.\nRegarding pain management, the Joint Commission Resources states:\nEach and every patient has a right to the assessment and management of pain. Hospitals must develop policies and procedures which address the organization\u2019s expectations of pain management in support of their mission and philosophy of care. Patients and their families also need education regarding their role in pain management. Developing a comprehensive and coordinated pain management program can be made easier by accessing good practices. From policies and procedures for the different types of pain (acute, chronic, etc.) to training assistants (including pre- and post-tests) to assessment tools, good practices can assist your organization to provide a comprehensive approach to pain management that meets the intent of the standards and, at the same time, achieves positive outcomes for patient (Joint Commission Resources, Inc., 2009).\nThe JCAHO Standards of Pain Management are listed below.\nJCAHO STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT\nTo meet the Joint Commission standards, accredited facilities must have policies in place to meet the following requirements:\nRecognize patients\u2019 rights to assessment and management of pain.\nAssess the nature and intensity of pain in all patients.\nEstablish safe medication, prescription, and ordering procedures.\nEnsure competency and orient new staff in pain assessment and management.\nMonitor patients post-procedure and reassess patient problems appropriately.\nEducate patients on the role of pain management in treatment.\nAddress patients\u2019 needs for symptom management in the discharge planning process.\nCollect data to monitor performance.\nSource: Partners against Pain, 2007.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics is a professional organization dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. As such, its committees develop guidelines, positions, and programs to support the mission of the organization. The AAP guidelines for pain management conclude with the strategies listed below.\nAAP GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on the assessment and management of acute pain in infants, children, and adolescents concludes with the following recommended strategies:\nExpand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric pain management principles and techniques.\nProvide a calm environment for procedures in order to reduce distress-producing stimulation.\nUse appropriate pain assessment tools and techniques.\nAnticipate predictable painful experiences; intervene, and monitor accordingly.\nUse a multimodal (pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral, and physical) approach to pain management and use a multidisciplinary approach when possible.\nInvolve families and tailor interventions to the individual child.\nAdvocate for child-specific research in pain management and Food and Drug Administration evaluation of analgesics for children.\nAdvocate for the effective use of pain medication for children to ensure compassionate and competent management of pain.\nSource: American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001.\nPAIN AND THE NURSING PROCESS\nThe nursing process includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation. To manage pain responsibly, nurses use each step of the nursing process.\nBasic to every strategy for managing pain is showing respect for the validity of a client\u2019s experience of pain. To communicate respect, nurses:\nAcknowledge pain and take action to manage it.\nGive accurate information to reduce anxiety and facilitate relief of pain.\nReduce environmental stressors that add to the experience of pain.\nEncourage disclosure of feelings and fears.\nProvide privacy and maintain confidentiality.\nAssessing Pain\nPain is a red flag. It tells us there is a problem somewhere in the body that is crying out for attention. In fact, pain is such an important indicator of health, its assessment has been called the \u201cfifth vital sign,\u201d joining temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. Even so, until we know more about a specific pain, we cannot fix it. To do this, nurses and therapists must gather information from as many sources as possible, especially the primary source, the person in pain. This investigation includes obtaining a comprehensive pain history, making observations of behaviors, performing an appropriate physical examination, and consulting with other healthcare professionals.\nPAIN HISTORY\nA pain history is obtained from written documents and from interviews with the person in pain, family members, and other caregivers. It asks specific questions about the location, intensity, quality, and history of the pain, as shown in the following box. In some facilities these questions are printed on an assessment form, with space for answers to be recorded beside each question. Later sections of this course discuss the assessment of pain in children and special populations.\nOBTAINING A PAIN HISTORY\nLocation: Where is your pain? Ask client to point to the area of pain.\nIntensity: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, how much pain would you say you are experiencing? If your pain were a temperature, how cold or hot would it be (warm, hot, blistering)? If your pain were a sound, how loud would it be (silent, quiet, strident, booming)?\nQuality: In your own words, tell me what your pain feels like. (worms under the skin, shooting, needle pricking, tingling, etc.).\nChronology/pattern: When did the pain start? Does your pain come and go? How often? How long does it last?\nPrecipitating factors: What triggers the pain, or what makes it worse?\nAlleviating factors: What measures have you found that lessen or relieve the pain? What pain medications do you use? How much and how often?\nAssociated symptoms: Do you have other symptoms before, during, or after your pain begins (dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and shortness of breath)?\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS\nMost people who suffer pain usually show it either by verbal complaint or nonverbal behaviors. The following table lists some typical behaviors nurses may observe when they assess people in pain.\nNONVERBAL BEHAVIORS INDICATING PAIN\nWidely opened eyes or mouth\nCrying\nFocus on pain relief measures\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nWhen clients complain of pain or show it by their behavior, health professionals need to take action to find the cause. Assessment is most effective if the pain history interview and behavioral observations are conducted at the same time as the physical examination. For example, if a client complains of acute pain on the sole of a foot, the nurse or therapist visually examines the foot for unusual signs, observes the person for behavioral cues of pain, and asks about the onset, intensity, quality, and pattern of the pain and what makes it worse or better. If the cause is not identified immediately, the client is referred for further assessment.\nDiagnosing Pain\nAn accurate diagnosis depends on an appropriate assessment that focuses on the exact nature of the pain. The more specific the diagnosis, the more effective interventions can be. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has identified two primary diagnoses for pain: acute and chronic. A complete nursing diagnosis, however, goes further. After identifying whether the pain is acute or chronic, it adds \u201crelated to\u201d the medical diagnosis. For example, \u201cchronic pain related to osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d Then, it adds \u201cmanifested by\u201d and lists the various symptoms experienced by the client or signs confirmed by objective data. Thus, a complete diagnosis might be \u201cchronic pain, related to osteoarthritis, manifested by stabbing pain in the left hip with weight-bearing.\u201d\nThe advantage of clear, specific information is that it leads to more effective interventions. In this case, an appropriate intervention might be an assistive devise such as a cane or walker and referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.\nPlanning and Goal Setting\nDuring the planning stage, nurses and therapists synthesize information from many sources and, together with the physician, plan appropriate interventions. The goal of these interventions is to relieve pain and facilitate the highest possible level of functioning. Practically speaking, this means identifying what activity the pain is preventing and the best way to achieve a return of function. For the client described above with chronic hip pain, the activity the pain is preventing is mobility.\nPlanning interventions means working in partnership with clients and physicians to provide specific measures to manage the pain. These interventions may be independent or collaborative. Independent nursing actions fall within the scope of nursing practice and include controlling the environment, giving emotional support, and providing comfort. Collaborative nursing actions involve cooperative interventions with other members of the healthcare team, such as physical therapists, pharmacists, and physicians.\nGoal setting involves the identification of attainable objectives and reasonable priorities. Because every person is different, the nurse or therapist discusses various alternatives with the client, and together they set priorities. For example, after consulting an orthopedic surgeon, the person with osteoarthritis may decide to delay hip replacement surgery and maintain mobility as long as possible with the aid of a cane and analgesics for pain.\nInterventions\nPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nThere are two primary groups of pain medications: nonopioids and opioids. A third group of drugs called adjuvants or co-analgesics address symptoms that often accompany pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasm, anorexia, and depression.\nNonopioid Analgesics\nNonopioid analgesics relieve pain by acting on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site to decrease the level of inflammatory mediators. This group of analgesics includes drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and ibuprofen (Motrin). The specific actions and dosages of these analgesics vary. Generally speaking, however, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects and are useful for mild to moderate pain.\nWith the exception of acetaminophen, most nonopioids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs are especially effective when the primary cause of pain is inflammation, as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and bone cancer. When tissue is damaged, a series of biochemical events leads to the release of prostaglandin, which causes edema, inflammation, and pain. Two isoenzymes\u2014cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)\u2014play an important part in this biochemical process. Drugs that inhibit their action, especially that of COX-2, reduce prostaglandin production and the inflammation it creates. However, these drugs must be used with caution because the safety of long-term use has not been verified. The following table lists some common nonopioid analgesics.\nCOMMON NONOPIOID ANALGESICS\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis; lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs\nAspirin\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis, general pain; antipyretic; inhibits platelet aggregation, causing bleeding\nIbuprofen (Motrin)\n400 mg q 4\u20136 hr\nUsed for osteoarthritis; antipyretic; multiple brand names; available as liquid\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nUsed for gout; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic\nNaproxen (Naprosyn)\n500 mg initial dose, then 250 mg q 6\u20138 hr\nUsed for gout, headaches; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic; available in liquid preparation\nOpioid Analgesics\nOpioid (narcotic, CNS-acting) analgesics are derivatives of opium and include such drugs as morphine, codeine, and methadone. These drugs modify the perception of pain and provide a sense of euphoria by binding to specific opiate receptors throughout the central nervous system. Opiate receptors have various names, typically denoted by Greek letters such as mu (\u03bc), kappa (\u03ba), and sigma (\u03c3). Many of the characteristics of particular opioids relate to the receptor to which they bind. For example, morphine binds to m receptors and follow m receptor control.\nOpioid analgesics are classified as full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed agonist-antagonists. Full agonists bind to \u03bc receptor sites, block pain impulses, and produce maximum pain control\u2014an \u201cagonist effect.\u201d Full agonists include such drugs as morphine (Kadian, Avinza, Rylomine intranasal), meperidine (Demerol), fentanyl (Duragesic patch, Fentanyl oralets), oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), and hydromorphine (Dilaudid).\nPartial agonists produce a lesser response than full agonists and include such drugs as buprenorphine (Buprenex) and nalbuphine (Nubain). Mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics include such drugs as pentazocine hydrochloride (Talwin) and butorphanol tartrate (Stadol). An antagonist is a drug that competes with opioid receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) is such a drug. It is used for opioid overdoses and physical dependency.\nThe primary action of opioids (narcotics) is to alleviate moderate to severe pain. Many of the unwanted effects of this class of drugs are related to their actions on systems of the body other than the central nervous system (CNS), causing such effects as constipation and respiratory depression. The following table lists some common opioid side effects and preventative measures.\nOPIOID ADVERSE EFFECTS AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nBody System\nMonitor blood pressure and heart rate\nCNS\nSedation, disorientation, euphoria, dysphoria, light-headedness, lower seizure threshold, tremors\nInform client that tolerance may develop over 3\u20135 days; administer stimulants as needed\nGastrointestinal\nOffer anti-emetic; change analgesic; increase fluid and fiber intake; increase exercise; administer laxatives\nGenitourinary\nCatheterize as needed; administer opioid antagonist\nIntegumentary\nApply cool packs or lotion; administer antihistamine\nRespiratory\nRespiratory depression; aggravation of asthma\nMonitor respirations closely; administer opioid antagonist such as naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan)\nSome medications combine nonopioid with opioid analgesics in one tablet to offer two different levels of pain relief\u2014acting both on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site and at the level of the central nervous system. Acetaminophen with codeine is such a medication.\nDrug Tolerance and Dependence\nDrug tolerance is a physiologic condition in which humans require larger and larger doses of drugs to provide the same effect as provided by the original dose. The first sign of tolerance is a decrease in the duration of the analgesic effect. This condition is followed by a decrease in total analgesic effect. Decreasing the time between doses or increasing the dosage may help overcome tolerance. Even so, drug tolerance is not the only reason drugs become less effective. They may be less effective because there is advancing tissue damage, thus greater pain.\nPseudotolerance is the need to increase opioid dosage for reasons other than the physical adaptation of continuous use. These other needs include drug-to-drug interaction, drug-to-food interaction, increased physical activity, psychological dependence (addiction), and changes in opioid formulation.\nPhysical dependence is a physiologic adaptation of tissues to the drug. If a person who is physically dependent on opioids abruptly stops using them, withdrawal symptoms occur. These symptoms result from an autonomic nervous system response and may include excessive yawning, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, delirium, and convulsions. When opioid analgesics are to be discontinued, physical withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or eliminated by a slow reduction of dose.\nPsychological dependence (addiction) is the compulsive use of a substance characterized by a continuous craving for a drug\u2019s nonanalgesic emotional effects. Opioids (narcotics) with an affinity for both m and s receptor sites produce euphoria and hallucinations. Thus, these drugs are the most frequently abused opioids. When people take opioids to relieve pain, tolerance and physical dependence may occur, but addiction will not necessarily follow. Psychological dependence is far more complex and involves emotional, social, and cultural issues. (Pain management in clients with addictive disease is discussed further later in this course.)\nPseudoaddiction is a term used to describe people who, because of severe, unrelieved pain, focus on finding relief. As a consequence, they seem preoccupied with obtaining opioids. This preoccupation is not truly \u201cdrug-seeking\u201d but \u201crelief-seeking.\u201d Their quest for opioids is directly related to inadequate pain relief caused by an inappropriate opioid or inadequate doses spaced too far apart.\nAdjuvant Analgesics\nAdjuvant analgesics (co-analgesics) are drugs that were developed for uses other than pain but have been found to enhance the effects of analgesics. Caregivers need to remember that these are \u201chelper drugs,\u201d not substitutes for analgesics. Clients in pain still need analgesics. The following table describes some common adjuvant analgesics.\nCOMMON ADJUVANT (CO-ANALGESIC) DRUGS\nAntidepressants: Tricyclics and serotonin, reuptake inhibitors\nBurning, neuropathic pain; improves sleep, enhances mood and analgesic effects\nAnti-epileptic drugs\nNeuralgic and neuropathic pain (sharp, prickling, shooting pain)\nAntispasmodic\nAnxiolytic drugs: Benzodiazepines, buspirone, venlafaxine\nAnxiety and sedation\nNeuralgic pain and diabetic neuropathic pain\nPsychostimulants\nOffsets sedating side effects and enhances analgesic effects of opioids\nSteroids\nInflammatory and chronic pain of cancer, malignant spinal cord compression, headaches, and arthritis\nPlacebos\nA placebo is a \u201csugar pill,\u201d an inactive substance prescribed as if it were an effective dose of a medication. Research has found that placebos produce hoped-for results in 30% to 50% of the people who take them (Thompson, 2000). This so-called \u201cplacebo effect\u201d has been exploited for centuries by hucksters and charlatans who sell tonics, treatments, and gadgets to people in pain. Because their purpose is to deceive and strip clients of the right to make informed decisions, legitimate medical practice does not use placebos. Such acts violate the ethical principles of honesty and autonomy. The only exception to this prohibition is when subjects give prior consent for the possible use of placebos in research studies.\nWorld Health Organization Pain Management Ladder\nBecause of widespread misconceptions about treatment of chronic pain and addiction, in 1990 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a three-step pain management ladder based on the intensity of pain.\nMild pain (intensity 1\u20133 on the 0\u201310 standard): Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nMild to moderate pain (intensity 4\u20136): Use combination medications such as oxycodone and acetaminophen and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nModerate to severe pain (intensity 7\u201310): Use potent opioids such as morphine, fentanylm methadone, and adjuvants.\nTo prevent undertreatment of malignant cancer pain, some authorities recommend a different approach. They begin the treatment of malignant cancer pain with strong opioids, providing immediate relief, then slowly reduce the type and dosage until pain relief is achieved at the lower level (Jackson & Stanford, 2003).\nRoutes of Administration\nAnalgesics can be administered by many routes. Each has advantages and disadvantages as well as indications and contraindications. The overriding considerations are effectiveness and safety. The table below lists some of the most common routes for the administration of analgesic drugs.\nANALGESIC DRUG ADMINISTRATION\nContraindications\nOral (per os = PO)\nPreferred route due to lower cost and convenience; may be prepared as powders, capsules, tablets, liquids, or lozenges\nGastrointestinal irritation; inability to swallow; need for more potent analgesic\nRectal (R)\nInability to take oral drugs; can be self-administered; longer duration than oral\nAnal or rectal lesions, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia\nIntramuscular (IM)\nNeed for prolonged pain relief; absorption may be poor; possible muscle or nerve damage; costly\nIntravenous (IV) bolus\nOffers most rapid pain relief (5\u201315 min) but lasts less than 60 min\nRequires IV access; gives only brief pain relief when prolonged relief is needed\nContinuous intravenous (IV) infusion\nGives constant opioid blood level when other methods are ineffective\nRequires infusion pumps with alarms and close monitoring\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA)\nAllows predetermined IV bolus of analgesic when client desires pain relief\nRequires IV access, client cooperation, close supervision; does not give continuous pain relief\nSubcutaneous (SC) opioid infusion\nContinuous, prolonged parenteral opioids when IV not possible; allows home use\nRequires site change every 7 days of 27-gauge butterfly needle; potential site irritation\nIntraspinal (neuraxial), intrathecal, epidural, subarachnoid, intraventricular\nLabor contractions; also intractable pain when client cannot tolerate systemic opioids by other routes\nRequires expert insertion of catheter into intended space; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nRegional nerve blocks\nContinuous or single dose analgesic for acute and chronic pain; used for trauma, burns, and labor\nRequires expert insertion of catheter to specific nerve root; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nTopical (cream-laden anesthetic)\nAnalgesic for needle sticks, venipuncture, dermatitis, and insect stings\nMust be applied 30\u201360 min in advance of need\nTransdermal skin patch\nContinuous dose of opioid; allows home use\nCostly; when body temperature is over 102\u00b0F, absorption is accelerated\nNasal sprays\nAlternative to IV, IM, and oral opioid administration; rapid onset of action\nNasal exudates or mucosal swelling may prevent consistent absorption\nPrinciples for the Use of Analgesics\nTo guide caregivers, the American Pain Society (2005) identifies thirteen principles regarding the use of analgesics to control pain:\nIndividualize the route, dosage, and schedule of analgesics medications.\nAdminister analgesics on a regular basis if pain is present most of the day.\nKnow the dose and time course of several opioid analgesic preparations:\nAsk client about prior experience with certain drugs.\nGive preference to long-acting, sustained-release opioids such as OxyContin, which provides up to 12 hours of analgesia; Kadian and Avinza, controlled-release morphine preparations which provide up to 24 hours of pain relief; and transdermal fentanyl, which provides up to 3 days of pain relief.\nAvoid the adverse effects of emesis by giving anti-emetics.\nRotate opioids to compensate for tolerance.\nUse rapid-onset opioids when necessary.\nUse concentrated dosage forms when injection volume must be minimized.\nGive infants and children adequate opioid doses.\nFollow clients closely, particularly when beginning or changing analgesics.\nWhen changing to a new opioid or a different route, first use equianalgesic doses to estimate the new dose. Then, modify the estimate, based on the clinical situation and the specific drug.\nRecognize and treat side effects, such as sedation, constipation, nausea, itching, respiratory depression, by doing the following:\nChange the dose or route of the same drug to maintain constant blood levels.\nTry different opioids analgesics.\nConsider multi-drug and multi-modal therapy.\nAdd another drug that counteracts the adverse effects, such as a stimulant for sedation.\nUse an administration route that minimizes drug concentrations at the site producing the side effect, such as intraspinal instead of oral when appropriate.\nDo not use meperidine (Demerol) because of neurotoxicity risk or mixed agonist-antagonists (Talwin) because of psychotomimetic effects.\nDo not use placebos to assess the nature of pain.\nMonitor for the development of tolerance and treat appropriately. Increased pain may be due to progressive disease, new pathology, skipped doses, or other causes.\nExpect physical dependence and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nDo not diagnose patients as \u201copioid addicted\u201d solely because of opioid dependence.\nBe alert to the psychological state of the client.\nNONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nAlthough there are myriad drugs to relieve pain, all have some risk and cost. Fortunately, there are many nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce pain, especially when used in conjunction with pharmacologic measures. Described as physical and cognitive-behavioral interventions, many of these approaches are noninvasive, low-risk, inexpensive, easily performed and taught, and within the scope of nursing practice. Physical interventions give comfort, increase mobility, and alter physiologic responses. Cognitive-behavioral interventions alter the perception of pain, reduce fear, give a greater sense of control, and are considered holistic nursing practice.\nPhysical Interventions\nComfort measures such as clean and smooth sheets, soft and supportive pillows, warm blankets, and a soothing environment have been used by nurses throughout history to relieve pain and suffering. These measures may be difficult to provide in the noisy, mechanized healthcare facilities of today. Nonetheless, they are important to the mental and physical well-being of patients.\nPosition change and movement are well-known pain-relieving interventions. Moving the body, even a small amount, relieves muscle spasm and provides a degree of pain relief. So important is movement of the body to health, an entire profession has developed specializing in physical therapy. However, nurses need not wait for a specialist to offer these important pain-relieving interventions.\nMassage relieves muscle spasm, improves circulation, and provides cutaneous stimulation. While there are many different massage techniques, they all involve rubbing the skin in various patterns and degrees of pressure. Once considered an expected part of basic nursing care, backrubs offer an important noninvasive way to relieve pain and provide comfort.\nApplications of hot and cold are effective pain-relieving measures when used appropriately. Heat decreases muscle spasm and increases blood flow to an area. Cold decreases blood flow, edema, and inflammation and may decrease muscle spasm and pain. Many devices are available to provide hot and cold, including electric heating pads, patches, and ice packs. Soaks and baths relieve muscle spasm and are an important means of providing comfort.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) provides a continuous, mild electric current via 2 to 4 electrodes placed on the skin near a painful site. The stimulator is a small, battery-operated devise worn by the client. Experienced as a tingling sensation, TENS works by stimulating large nerve fibers to close the \u201cgate\u201d in the spinal cord. It also may stimulate endorphin production. TENS may be used for acute postoperative pain or for chronic conditions such as low back pain, phantom limb pain, and neuralgia.\nSurgical interventions may be recommended when severe pain persists despite medical treatment. If pain is due to a known condition, such as osteoarthritis of a joint, joint replacement surgery may be offered. When specific interventions are not available and conservative measures do not relieve pain, surgical interruption of pain pathways may be undertaken. Rhizotomy and cordotomy are two such procedures. In a rhizotomy the surgeon destroys dorsal posterior nerve roots as they enter the spinal cord, either by delivering neurolytic chemicals, heat, or extreme cold by way of a catheter or by performing a laminectomy, isolating the nerve roots, and directly destroying the nerve. A chordotomy is more extensive than a rhizotomy, involving resection of the spinothalamic tract. Both procedures cause permanent loss of pain and thermal sensations, however they may also cause paralysis due to motor nerve damage.\nCognitive-Behavioral Interventions\nRelaxation exercises are useful ways to reduce anxiety, decrease muscle tension, and lower blood pressure and heart rate. They induce a state of altered consciousness and give individuals a sense of control and peace of mind. Meditation, yoga, and other such interventions may effectively relieve pain. One such exercise involves controlled breathing. A coach speaks in a calm, clear voice, suggesting the subject begin by breathing slowly and diaphragmatically, allowing the abdomen to rise slowly and the chest to expand fully. Then, the coach suggests the subject locate an area of muscle tension, contract the muscles in that area, and then relax them. As the subject relaxes, pain perception and anxiety diminish.\nGuided imagery is similar to relaxation exercises in that a coach leads subjects in a calm, clear voice, often beginning with a relaxation exercise. The coach then suggests subjects imagine themselves in some peaceful place where they experience various sensory pleasures such as the warmth of the sun, the sound of ocean waves, and the smell of salt water. The purpose of the exercise is to provide an experience of relaxation and relief from stress and pain.\nDistraction diverts the attention of individuals away from painful stimuli. When people focus on something that gives pleasure, they are less likely to feel acute pain. This phenomenon occurs because the reticular activating system briefly inhibits the awareness of pain. Distraction works best for short acute pain, such as a needle stick. Such things as listening to music, watching an intense scene on television, or describing something of special interest may temporarily distract a person from pain. Distraction, however, does not work for chronic, long-term pain.\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and other stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. It is displayed as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch these signals, they learn to control their responses.\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\nTo relieve their pain, an increasing number of people in the United States are also turning to theories and practices outside the realm of conventional Western medicine. In 1991, the federal government established the Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1998, the agency became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), making the center one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. NCCAM defines CAM as \u201ca group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not currently part of conventional medicine\u201d (NCCAM, 2009a).\nThe mission of NCCAM is to explore \u201ccomplementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science\u2026and [to] disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals\u201d (NCCAM, 2007). In this context, \u201ccomplementary\u201d describes practices used in conjunction with or to supplement conventional medical treatments, and \u201calternative\u201d means those that are used independently or in place of conventional medicine. Practitioners of such techniques and practices often use the term holistic because they view health and illness as affecting the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit.\nThe major categories of complementary and alternative medicine are:\nBiologic (herbal mixtures; macrobiotic diets; orthomolecular, such as megadoses of vitamins, magnesium, melatonin, etc.)\nEnergy fields (acupuncture, therapeutic touch, pulse fields, Reiki, etc.)\nManipulative and body-based (chiropractic, lymphatic drainage, reflexology, aromatherapy, deep-muscle massage, shiatsu, etc.)\nMind-body (biofeedback, hypnosis, art therapy, prayer, etc.) (Diluzio\u00c2\u00a0 & Spillane 2002)\nBiologic. Plants have been used to treat human ailments throughout history. Their therapeutic effects are due to the chemical compounds they contain. Such chemicals may be administered to patients by giving some part of a plant or by extracting or synthesizing the essential chemical. When prepared in a purified form, the dose is more precise than it can be from a plant. Some common active chemicals originally derived from plants are: digitaloid found in the foxglove plant (digitalis), saponins found in sarsaparilla (irritant laxatives), alkaloids found in nightshades (atropine), and alkaloids found in the opium poppy (morphine) (McGuigan & Krug, 1942).\nEnergy fields. Such healing measures are based on theories about unseen forces in the human body. Acupuncture, for instance, is based on an ancient Chinese theory that two opposing forces, yin and yang, move along meridians in the body. When these forces are out of balance, pain and illness result. There are at least 350 acupuncture points by which energy flows are accessible. The theory posits that by stimulating these points with very fine needles, the energy flow can be rebalanced and pain relieved (Mayo Clinic, 2009; NCCAM, 2009b).\nChiropractic is a healthcare approach that focuses on the relationship between the body\u2019s structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014and its functioning. Although practitioners may use a variety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems and supporting the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself. People seek chiropractic care primarily for pain conditions such as back pain, neck pain, and headache. Side effects and risks depend on the type of chiropractic treatment used. Ongoing research is looking at effects of chiropractic treatment approaches, how they might work, and diseases and conditions for which they may be most helpful. (NCCAM, 2009c.)\nOsteopathy is a medical specialty that combines traditional and nontraditional medicine. Practitioners, called doctor of osteopathy (DO), practice traditional, science-based medicine, and are licensed to perform surgery and prescribe drugs. They \u201ctake a holistic view of the body as an integrated system and approach prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by way of the musculoskeletal system\u201d (Asher, 2007).\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and some stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. The machine displays information as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch the signals, they learn to control their responses.\nEvaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions\nEvaluation is one of the most critical phases of the nursing process. It tells us the degree to which an intervention achieved an expected outcome. If the expected outcome is pain reduction, evaluation tells us if the intervention did, in fact, reduce pain and if so, how much and at what cost in time, treasure, and long-term effects.\nTo find out, we gather data from the best source of information, the client, or the second-best source, the client\u2019s caregivers. To be of value, the information must address the aspects of pain that were noted before the intervention, including the location, intensity, quality, and duration of the pain. In addition, data is gathered about adverse effects of an intervention, such as an allergic reaction, hypotension, or respiratory depression.\nSuch feedback is essential if we are to revise the plan of care effectively. A positive evaluation means that an intervention was successful and probably should be continued. A negative evaluation means that an intervention was not satisfactory and should be changed. Hence the adage \u201cnegative feedback makes for change.\u201d\nCommunicating, Documenting, and Teaching\nCommunication about pain and the response of clients to interventions is facilitated by accurate and thorough documentation. This communication needs to be conveyed from nurse to nurse, shift to shift, and nurse to other responsible healthcare providers. Various tools have been devised to facilitate this communication, including pain flow sheets, running diaries, and bedside computer charting, called \u201cpoint-of-care.\u201d When communicating information about pain, it is important to describe the time and exact nature of an intervention, including details such as an analgesic and dose administered, level of pain before and after the intervention, and any adverse effect that follows, such as respiratory depression. The more specific and timely a report, the more effective the evaluation.\nBecause pain is a potent motivator for change, people who suffer are vulnerable to all manner of fake gadgets and magical cures. It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to give patients accurate information about medications, devices, physical activities, and psychological strategies in clear, understandable ways. Such teaching empowers those who suffer and demonstrates genuine concern, accurate empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and respect.\nPAIN MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN\nUnbelievable as it may seem, only recently has the medical profession taken seriously the pain and suffering of infants and children. Not long ago, newborn infants were circumcised without anesthesia or analgesia, and seriously injured children were given pain medication \u201cas needed.\u201d Happily, such undertreatment of pain in children is changing as a result of research by caring nurses and other healthcare professionals. Better assessment tools, new pharmaceuticals, and innovative delivery systems are contributing to these advances.\nResearch has shown that neonates and infants do feel and remember pain. In fact, by 6 months of age, when children are taken to places where they had experienced pain, they demonstrate anticipatory fear (Pasero, 2004). One study measured the long-term effect of newborn circumcision without analgesia on behavioral response to immunizations. When pain was measured by observable indicators such as facial expression, length of crying, and body movement, 4- to 6-month-old infants circumcised without analgesia had higher pain scores than those circumcised with analgesia (Anand, 1997).\nOther research found some children so traumatized by past injections that were intended to relieve pain that they were afraid to admit having present pain (Stevens, 1999). These and other studies have corrected many misconceptions about pain in infants and children, as described in the table below.\nMISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT PAIN IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN\nMisconceptions\nCorrect Information\nPreterm infants are less sensitive to pain than term infants and older children due to an immature nervous system.\nPreterm infants have the anatomical and functional ability to process pain and an even greater sensitivity to pain than term infants.\nInfants and children have a diminished perception of pain and no memory of its occurrence.\nPerception of pain is present with the first insult, requires no prior experience, and is remembered.\nInfants are incapable of expressing pain.\nAlthough infants cannot verbalize pain, they give physical signs and behavioral cues.\nPain in infants cannot be assessed accurately.\nBehavioral cues and physiologic signs of pain can be reliably and validly assessed; facial expressions are the most valid indicators.\nAnesthetics and analgesics cannot be given to neonates and infants because of an immature ability to eliminate drugs.\nInfants older than 1 month metabolize drugs in the same way as older infants and children.\nOpioids are too dangerous to give to infants and children because of the risk of addiction and other adverse effects.\nAdverse effects of opioid and nonopioids can be minimized by careful monitoring, drug titration, and weaning.\nInfants and children tolerate pain well and become accustomed to pain.\nPain is pain, whether it occurs in an infant, child, or adult.\nPostoperatively, children should not receive the next analgesic dose until they show obvious signs of pain.\nOpioids are most effective if administered as a continuous infusion rather than \u201cas needed,\u201d thus avoiding the need of children to complain.\nInfants and children cry or complain at the slightest discomfort even when they are not in pain.\nOften children are afraid to complaint of pain because their fear of an injection is greater than their pain.\nCommunicating with Children and Adolescents\nTo manage pain effectively in children and adolescents, nurses and other healthcare professionals need to be able to communicate with them. Such communication must be appropriate to age and stage of development. The following table describes some approaches that can be used to refine a nurses\u2019s interactions with children and, at the same time, model effective communication skills for family members.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\nAge and Stage\n"}, {"score": 2174.267, "uuid": "aa64318e-a322-54e5-bf27-3f8ddda1a92b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-49-24139", "target_hostname": "www.nursingceu.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nursingceu.com/courses/282/index_pt.html", "page_rank": 1.2052649e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Pain</em> Management <em>for</em> Oregon Health Professionals | <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Continuing", "snippet": "People seek <em>chiropractic</em> care primarily <em>for</em> <em>pain</em> conditions such as <em>back</em> <em>pain</em>, neck <em>pain</em>, and headache.

Pain tells us something is wrong in the structure or function of our body and that we need to do something about it. Because pain is such a strong motivator for action, it is considered one of the body\u2019s most important protective mechanisms.\nDefinitions of Pain\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defined pain as \u201can unpleasant, subjective, sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\u201d (1979). Pain, however, is much more than a physical sensation caused by a single entity. It is subjective and highly individual, a complex mechanism with physical, emotional, and cognitive components.\nPain cannot be objectively measured in the same way as, for example, the chemical content of urine or the oxygen content level of blood. Only the person who is suffering knows how the experience feels. For these reasons, McCaffery defined pain as \u201cwhatever the experiencing person says it is and whenever he says it does\u201d (1979). The American Pain Society goes further by stating that it is \u201cnot the responsibility of clients to prove they are in pain; it is the nurse\u2019s responsibility to accept the client\u2019s report of pain\u201d (2005).\nPain alters the quality of life more than any other health-related problem. It interferes with sleep, mobility, nutrition, thought, sexual activity, emotional well-being, creativity, and self-actualization. Surprisingly, even though pain is such an important obstacle to comfort, it is one of the least understood, most undertreated, and oft-discounted problems of healthcare providers and their clients. For this reason, some nurses and therapists add comfort to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of basic human needs (1968). The American Pain Society goes further, declaring the relief of pain a \u201cbasic human right\u201d (2005).\nTraditionally, pain was considered merely a physical symptom of illness or injury, a simple stimulus-response mechanism. Though the historic role of nurses and therapists has been to relieve pain and suffering, there has been little understanding of the complexity of pain and only limited ways to manage it. Recent research shows pain to be a distinct disorder, with physical, emotional, and cognitive components. This view of pain has broadened our understanding of pain and given us new ways to understand its characteristics.\nPAIN-RELATED TERMINOLOGY\nAlgesia: Sensitivity to pain.\nBreakthrough pain: Transitory increase in pain to a level greater than the client\u2019s well-controlled baseline level (McCaffery & Pasero, 2003).\nHyperalgesia: Excessive sensitivity to pain.\nIdiopathic pain: Chronic pain for which there is no identifiable psychological or physical cause.\nIntractable pain: Pain that is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, and nursing measures (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nPain threshold: Amount of pain required before individuals feel the pain. The lower the threshold, the less pain they can endure; the higher the threshold, the more pain they can endure.\nPain tolerance: Maximum amount and duration of pain a person can endure. Tolerance varies widely among people and is influenced by emotions and cultural background.\nPain syndrome: A group of symptoms of which pain is the critical element, such as headaches and post-herpetic neuralgia.\nPhantom limb pain: Pain that occurs in a limb after it is removed or as a result of severe damage to the affected nerve plexus due to perceptual disruption in the brain.\nPsychogenic pain: Chronic pain with no identified organic explanation.\nRadiating pain: Pain that begins at one place and extends out into nearby tissues.\nReferred pain: Pain that is felt at a different location than where tissue was damaged. This phenomenon occurs because pain fibers in the damaged area synapse near fibers from other areas of the body; for example, a myocardial infarction may create referred pain in the left shoulder.\nTypes of Pain\nPain is classified as acute and chronic. Acute pain has an identifiable cause and occurs soon after an injury to tissues in the body, such as bone, skin, or muscle. Acute pain is protective in that it motivates a person to take action. Its onset may be sudden or slow, and its intensity may vary from mild to severe. Acute pain is temporary and subsides as healing takes place. Severe acute pain activates the sympathetic nervous system, causing diaphoresis, increased respiratory and pulse rates, and elevated blood pressure.\nChronic pain lasts beyond an expected healing phase, is non-protective in that it serves no function, and may not have an identifiable cause (Patterson, 2007). When pain goes on more than 6 months, it moves from being a \u201csymptom\u201d to a \u201ccondition.\u201d Chronic pain afflicts more than 1 in 5 Americans and is one of the most pervasive and thorny medical conditions in the United States. Such pain is described as nonmalignant (noncancerous), malignant (cancerous), and intractable.\nNonmalignant, noncancerous chronic pain typically accompanies such conditions as osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathy. The lack of purpose and uncertainty of duration of such pain may lead to depression, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, apathy, learned helplessness, and other psychosocial consequences. If it is severe, chronic pain\u2014like prolonged stress\u2014activates the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in muscle tension, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and failure of body defenses.\nMalignant, cancerous chronic pain may be due to tumor progression, invasive procedures, infection, toxicities of treatment, and physical limitations. Such pain may be felt at the tumor site or some distance from it. Since clients with cancer may experience both chronic and acute pain, caregivers need to investigate immediately any new pain in these clients.\nIntractable chronic pain is pain from any cause that is resistant to medical, surgical, and nursing measures. Persistent and ongoing, intractable chronic pain may be psychogenic in nature (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nSources of Pain\nThe sources of pain are divided into three main categories: nociceptor, non-nociceptor, and psychogenic.\nNociceptor pain results when tissue damage produces a pain-producing stimulus that sends an electrical impulse across a pain receptor (nociceptor) by way of a nerve fiber to the central nervous system. Nociceptor pain is further divided into visceral and somatic pain.\nVisceral pain results from stimulation of nociceptors in the abdominal cavity and thorax.\nSomatic pain is divided into deep somatic and cutaneous pain. Deep somatic pain arises from bones, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. Cutaneous pain originates in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Some body tissues, such as the brain and lung, have no nociceptors, and some tissues have many.\nNon-nociceptor (neuropathic) pain is caused by direct injury to structures of the nervous system.\nPsychogenic pain is pain for which there is little or no physical evidence of organic disease or identified injury to tissues in the body. Lack of evidence, however, does not mean clients are malingering or that they are not suffering.\nPHYSIOLOGIC SOURCES OF PAIN\nSource: Adapted with permission from Ignatavicius et al., 1999.\nNociceptor: Visceral\nOrgans and linings of body cavities\nMechanism\nPoorly localized, diffuse, deep, cramping or splitting\nSources of acute pain\nChest tubes, abdominal tube drains, bladder and intestinal distention\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nPancreatitis, liver metastases, colitis\nCutaneous: skin and sub-cutaneous tissues\nDeep somatic: blood, muscle, blood vessels, connective tissue\nMechanism\nIncisional pain, insertion sites of tubes and drains, wound complications, orthopedic procedures, skeletal muscle spasms\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nBony metastases, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, peripheral vascular disease\nNon-nociceptor: Neuropathic\nNerve fibers, spinal cord, and central nervous system\nMechanism\nNon-nociceptive injury to nervous system structures\nCharacteristics\nGeneralized along distribution of damaged nervous structures\nSources of acute pain\nPoorly localized: shooting, burning, fiery, shock-like, sharp, painful numbness\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNervous tissue injury due to diabetes, HIV, chemotherapy, neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, trauma, surgery\nPsychogenic\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNonorganic psychological factors\nPhysiology of Pain\nThough a person is not consciously aware of the process, the experience of pain involves a complex sequence of biochemical and electrical events or processes beginning with tissue damage and followed by transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation.\nTISSUE DAMAGE\nWhen tissue is damaged, there is an immediate release of inflammatory chemicals called excitatory neurotransmitters, such as histamine and bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator. Increased blood in the area causes the injured area to swell, redden, and become tender. The bradykinin stimulates the release of prostaglandins and substance P, a potent neurotransmitter that enhances the movement of impulses across nerve synapses.\nTRANSDUCTION AND TRANSMISSION\nTransduction occurs as the energy of the stimulus is converted to electrical energy. Transmission of the stimulus takes place when this energy crosses into a nociceptor at the end of an afferent nerve fiber. Two types of peripheral nerve fibers conduct painful stimuli: the fast, myelinated A-delta fibers and the very small, slow, unmyelinated C-fibers. A-fibers send sharp, distinct sensations that localize the source of the pain and detect its intensity. C-fibers relay impulses that are poorly localized, burning, and persistent. For example, after burning a finger, a person initially feels a sharp localized pain as a result of A-fiber transmission. Within a few seconds the pain becomes more diffuse and widespread as a result of C-fiber transmission.\nPain stimuli travel quickly to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where the \u201cgating\u201d mechanism (discussed below) occurs. Pain impulses then cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and ascend to the higher centers in the brain via the spinothalamic tracts and on to the thalamus and higher centers of the brain, including the reticular formation, limbic system, and somatosensory cortex.\nNeurologic transmission of pain stimuli. (Illustration by Jason McAlexander. \u00a9 2005, Wild Iris Medical Education.\nPERCEPTION\nWhen pain stimuli reach the cerebral cortex, the brain interprets the signal; processes information from experiences, knowledge, and cultural associations; and perceives pain. Thus, perception is the awareness of pain. The somatosensory cortex identifies the location and intensity of pain, and the associated cortex determines how an individual interprets its meaning.\nMODULATION\nOnce the brain perceives the pain, the body releases neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins), serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. These chemicals hinder the transmission of pain and help produce an analgesic, pain-relieving effect. This inhibition of the pain impulse is called modulation. The descending paths of the efferent fibers extend from the cortex down to the spinal cord and may influence pain impulses at the level of the spinal cord.\nGATE-CONTROL THEORY\nMelzack and Wall proposed the gate-control theory to explain the relationship between pain and the emotions (1982). According to the theory, a gating mechanism occurs when a pain impulse travels to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. There, trigger (T) cells influence the transmission of pain impulses. When their activity is inhibited, the gate closes and impulses are less likely to be transmitted to the brain. This mechanism is controlled by descending nerve fibers from the thalamus and cerebral cortex, areas of the brain that regulate thought and emotions. The gate-control theory helps explain how thoughts and emotions modify the perception of pain and why interventions, such as imagery and distraction, help relieve it.\nFactors That Influence Pain\nThe perception of pain is influenced by physiologic, psychological, and cultural factors, all of which caregivers need to consider.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS\nAge\nAge affects the way people respond to pain. It influences both the development and decline of the nervous system. Aging affects the whole body, causing many painful degenerative disorders (such as osteoarthritis), secondary injuries (such as skin abrasions and fractures), and a host of common surgical procedures (such as cataract and hip replacement). Age also affects the way families and caregivers respond to complaints of pain. The following table gives a brief overview of the perception of pain relative to age. (The management of pain in children and older adults will be discussed in greater depth later in this course.)\nAGE AND THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN\nAge\nPain Perception\nPre-term infants\nHave anatomical and functional ability to process pain by mid to late gestation; seem to have greater sensitivity to pain than term infants or children\nNewborn infants\nResponse to pain is inborn and does not require prior learning; respond to pain with behaviors such as crying, grimacing, moving body\nInfants, 1 month\nCan metabolize analgesics and anesthesia effectively; can recognize caregiver as comforter\nToddlers/Preschoolers\nCan describe pain, its location and intensity; respond to pain by crying, anger, sadness; may consider pain a punishment; may hold someone accountable for pain and remember experiences in a certain location, such as a clinic\nSchool-age children\nMay try to be brave when facing a painful procedure; may regress to an earlier stage of development; seek understanding of reasons for pain\nAdolescents\nMay be slow to acknowledge pain; may consider showing signs of pain a weakness; may regress to earlier stages of development with persistent pain\nAdults\u00c2\nFear of pain may prevent some from seeking care; may believe admission of pain is a weakness and inappropriate for age or sex; may consider pain a punishment for moral failure\nOlder adults\nMay have decreased sensations or perceptions of pain; may consider pain an inevitable part of aging; chronic pain may produce anorexia, lethargy, depression; may not report pain due to fear of expense, possible treatment, dependency; often describe pain in nonmedical terms such as \u201churt\u201d or \u201cache\u201d; may fear addiction to analgesics; may not want to bother nurses or be a \u201cbad patient\u201d\nFatigue\nFatigue decreases coping abilities and heightens the perception of pain. When people are exhausted from physical activity, stress, and lack of sleep, their perception of pain may be heightened and their coping skills diminished. Thus, sleep and rest from physical, emotional, and social demands are important measures to manage pain more effectively.\nGenetic Makeup\nRecent research suggests that sensitivity to and tolerance for pain may a genetically linked trait (Ruda et al., 2000). This finding does not negate the need to manage pain adequately, regardless of inherited traits.\nMemory\nMemory of painful experiences, especially experiences that occurred as a very young child, may increase sensitivity and decrease tolerance to pain. For example, even young children remember the pain of an immunization at the doctor\u2019s office and henceforth may be afraid to visit the doctor again.\nStress Response\nResearch has shown that \u201csevere, unrelieved pain can cause an overwhelming stress response in both pre-term and full-term infants which can lead to serious complications and even death\u201d (Pasero, 2004). In recent years, post-traumatic stress syndrome has been the subject of extensive research, both as to its cause and its treatment (Hamilton, 2008).\nHealing\nRecent research suggests that unrelieved acute pain slows postoperative wound healing (McGuire, 2006). This evidence is not surprising, given our increasing knowledge of the effect of stress on the human body.\nNeurologic Function\nAny factor that interrupts or interferes with normal pain transmission affects the awareness and response of clients to pain and places them at risk for injury. Analgesics, sedatives, and alcohol depress the functioning of the central nervous system. Some diseases, such as leprosy, damage peripheral nerves, decrease sensitivity to touch and pain, and render sufferers more vulnerable to injury.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS\nFear and Anxiety\nThe relationship between pain and fear is convoluted and complex. Fear tends to increase the perception of pain, and pain increases feelings of fear and anxiety. This connection occurs in the brain because painful stimuli activate portions of the limbic system believed to control emotional reactions. People who are seriously injured or critically ill often experience both pain and heightened levels of anxiety due to their feelings of helplessness and lack of control. Caregivers need to address both pain and anxiety and use all appropriate measures to relieve suffering.\nCoping\nPeople manage pain and other stressors of life in different ways. Some see themselves as self-sufficient, internally controlled, and independent. As a result, they may deny pain or be slow to admit they are suffering. Others see themselves as insufficient, externally controlled, and dependent on others to treat their pain. Self-sufficient, internally controlled people may do better with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), whereas dependent, externally controlled individuals may prefer nurse-administered analgesia. No matter what the coping style, it is the responsibility of caregivers to relieve pain.\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nCultural beliefs and values affect the way people respond to pain. As children they learn what is and what is not acceptable behavior when experiencing pain. In some cultures, any expression of pain is considered cowardly and shameful. In others, noisy demonstrations of pain are expected and acceptable. The meaning of pain itself may be markedly different in different cultures. Some ethnic groups see pain as a punishment for wrongdoing. Others see pain as a test of faith. And still others view pain as a challenge to be overcome. Recent immigrants to America are more likely to view pain from their cultural roots. Regardless of an individual\u2019s language, religion, or situation, nurses and therapists respect every person and strive to alleviate pain and suffering.\nSTANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nBecause pain management is so important to the provision of quality healthcare, many organizations have developed standards by which professional practice is measured. Two such organizations are the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\nJoint Commission\nThe Joint Commission is an independent organization that accredits and certifies more than 17,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the United States. It evaluates how well these healthcare providers meet published standards of care, including their management of pain. The federal government accepts Joint Commission\u2013accredited facilities as qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.\nRegarding pain management, the Joint Commission Resources states:\nEach and every patient has a right to the assessment and management of pain. Hospitals must develop policies and procedures which address the organization\u2019s expectations of pain management in support of their mission and philosophy of care. Patients and their families also need education regarding their role in pain management. Developing a comprehensive and coordinated pain management program can be made easier by accessing good practices. From policies and procedures for the different types of pain (acute, chronic, etc.) to training assistants (including pre- and post-tests) to assessment tools, good practices can assist your organization to provide a comprehensive approach to pain management that meets the intent of the standards and, at the same time, achieves positive outcomes for patient (Joint Commission Resources, Inc., 2009).\nThe JCAHO Standards of Pain Management are listed below.\nJCAHO STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT\nTo meet the Joint Commission standards, accredited facilities must have policies in place to meet the following requirements:\nRecognize patients\u2019 rights to assessment and management of pain.\nAssess the nature and intensity of pain in all patients.\nEstablish safe medication, prescription, and ordering procedures.\nEnsure competency and orient new staff in pain assessment and management.\nMonitor patients post-procedure and reassess patient problems appropriately.\nEducate patients on the role of pain management in treatment.\nAddress patients\u2019 needs for symptom management in the discharge planning process.\nCollect data to monitor performance.\nSource: Partners against Pain, 2007.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics is a professional organization dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. As such, its committees develop guidelines, positions, and programs to support the mission of the organization. The AAP guidelines for pain management conclude with the strategies listed below.\nAAP GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on the assessment and management of acute pain in infants, children, and adolescents concludes with the following recommended strategies:\nExpand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric pain management principles and techniques.\nProvide a calm environment for procedures in order to reduce distress-producing stimulation.\nUse appropriate pain assessment tools and techniques.\nAnticipate predictable painful experiences; intervene, and monitor accordingly.\nUse a multimodal (pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral, and physical) approach to pain management and use a multidisciplinary approach when possible.\nInvolve families and tailor interventions to the individual child.\nAdvocate for child-specific research in pain management and Food and Drug Administration evaluation of analgesics for children.\nAdvocate for the effective use of pain medication for children to ensure compassionate and competent management of pain.\nSource: American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001.\nPAIN AND THE NURSING PROCESS\nThe nursing process includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation. To manage pain responsibly, nurses use each step of the nursing process.\nBasic to every strategy for managing pain is showing respect for the validity of a client\u2019s experience of pain. To communicate respect, nurses:\nAcknowledge pain and take action to manage it.\nGive accurate information to reduce anxiety and facilitate relief of pain.\nReduce environmental stressors that add to the experience of pain.\nEncourage disclosure of feelings and fears.\nProvide privacy and maintain confidentiality.\nAssessing Pain\nPain is a red flag. It tells us there is a problem somewhere in the body that is crying out for attention. In fact, pain is such an important indicator of health, its assessment has been called the \u201cfifth vital sign,\u201d joining temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. Even so, until we know more about a specific pain, we cannot fix it. To do this, nurses and therapists must gather information from as many sources as possible, especially the primary source, the person in pain. This investigation includes obtaining a comprehensive pain history, making observations of behaviors, performing an appropriate physical examination, and consulting with other healthcare professionals.\nPAIN HISTORY\nA pain history is obtained from written documents and from interviews with the person in pain, family members, and other caregivers. It asks specific questions about the location, intensity, quality, and history of the pain, as shown in the following box. In some facilities these questions are printed on an assessment form, with space for answers to be recorded beside each question. Later sections of this course discuss the assessment of pain in children and special populations.\nOBTAINING A PAIN HISTORY\nLocation: Where is your pain? Ask client to point to the area of pain.\nIntensity: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, how much pain would you say you are experiencing? If your pain were a temperature, how cold or hot would it be (warm, hot, blistering)? If your pain were a sound, how loud would it be (silent, quiet, strident, booming)?\nQuality: In your own words, tell me what your pain feels like. (worms under the skin, shooting, needle pricking, tingling, etc.).\nChronology/pattern: When did the pain start? Does your pain come and go? How often? How long does it last?\nPrecipitating factors: What triggers the pain, or what makes it worse?\nAlleviating factors: What measures have you found that lessen or relieve the pain? What pain medications do you use? How much and how often?\nAssociated symptoms: Do you have other symptoms before, during, or after your pain begins (dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and shortness of breath)?\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS\nMost people who suffer pain usually show it either by verbal complaint or nonverbal behaviors. The following table lists some typical behaviors nurses may observe when they assess people in pain.\nNONVERBAL BEHAVIORS INDICATING PAIN\nWidely opened eyes or mouth\nCrying\nFocus on pain relief measures\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nWhen clients complain of pain or show it by their behavior, health professionals need to take action to find the cause. Assessment is most effective if the pain history interview and behavioral observations are conducted at the same time as the physical examination. For example, if a client complains of acute pain on the sole of a foot, the nurse or therapist visually examines the foot for unusual signs, observes the person for behavioral cues of pain, and asks about the onset, intensity, quality, and pattern of the pain and what makes it worse or better. If the cause is not identified immediately, the client is referred for further assessment.\nDiagnosing Pain\nAn accurate diagnosis depends on an appropriate assessment that focuses on the exact nature of the pain. The more specific the diagnosis, the more effective interventions can be. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has identified two primary diagnoses for pain: acute and chronic. A complete nursing diagnosis, however, goes further. After identifying whether the pain is acute or chronic, it adds \u201crelated to\u201d the medical diagnosis. For example, \u201cchronic pain related to osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d Then, it adds \u201cmanifested by\u201d and lists the various symptoms experienced by the client or signs confirmed by objective data. Thus, a complete diagnosis might be \u201cchronic pain, related to osteoarthritis, manifested by stabbing pain in the left hip with weight-bearing.\u201d\nThe advantage of clear, specific information is that it leads to more effective interventions. In this case, an appropriate intervention might be an assistive devise such as a cane or walker and referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.\nPlanning and Goal Setting\nDuring the planning stage, nurses and therapists synthesize information from many sources and, together with the physician, plan appropriate interventions. The goal of these interventions is to relieve pain and facilitate the highest possible level of functioning. Practically speaking, this means identifying what activity the pain is preventing and the best way to achieve a return of function. For the client described above with chronic hip pain, the activity the pain is preventing is mobility.\nPlanning interventions means working in partnership with clients and physicians to provide specific measures to manage the pain. These interventions may be independent or collaborative. Independent nursing actions fall within the scope of nursing practice and include controlling the environment, giving emotional support, and providing comfort. Collaborative nursing actions involve cooperative interventions with other members of the healthcare team, such as physical therapists, pharmacists, and physicians.\nGoal setting involves the identification of attainable objectives and reasonable priorities. Because every person is different, the nurse or therapist discusses various alternatives with the client, and together they set priorities. For example, after consulting an orthopedic surgeon, the person with osteoarthritis may decide to delay hip replacement surgery and maintain mobility as long as possible with the aid of a cane and analgesics for pain.\nInterventions\nPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nThere are two primary groups of pain medications: nonopioids and opioids. A third group of drugs called adjuvants or co-analgesics address symptoms that often accompany pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasm, anorexia, and depression.\nNonopioid Analgesics\nNonopioid analgesics relieve pain by acting on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site to decrease the level of inflammatory mediators. This group of analgesics includes drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and ibuprofen (Motrin). The specific actions and dosages of these analgesics vary. Generally speaking, however, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects and are useful for mild to moderate pain.\nWith the exception of acetaminophen, most nonopioids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs are especially effective when the primary cause of pain is inflammation, as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and bone cancer. When tissue is damaged, a series of biochemical events leads to the release of prostaglandin, which causes edema, inflammation, and pain. Two isoenzymes\u2014cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)\u2014play an important part in this biochemical process. Drugs that inhibit their action, especially that of COX-2, reduce prostaglandin production and the inflammation it creates. However, these drugs must be used with caution because the safety of long-term use has not been verified. The following table lists some common nonopioid analgesics.\nCOMMON NONOPIOID ANALGESICS\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis; lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs\nAspirin\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis, general pain; antipyretic; inhibits platelet aggregation, causing bleeding\nIbuprofen (Motrin)\n400 mg q 4\u20136 hr\nUsed for osteoarthritis; antipyretic; multiple brand names; available as liquid\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nUsed for gout; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic\nNaproxen (Naprosyn)\n500 mg initial dose, then 250 mg q 6\u20138 hr\nUsed for gout, headaches; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic; available in liquid preparation\nOpioid Analgesics\nOpioid (narcotic, CNS-acting) analgesics are derivatives of opium and include such drugs as morphine, codeine, and methadone. These drugs modify the perception of pain and provide a sense of euphoria by binding to specific opiate receptors throughout the central nervous system. Opiate receptors have various names, typically denoted by Greek letters such as mu (\u03bc), kappa (\u03ba), and sigma (\u03c3). Many of the characteristics of particular opioids relate to the receptor to which they bind. For example, morphine binds to m receptors and follow m receptor control.\nOpioid analgesics are classified as full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed agonist-antagonists. Full agonists bind to \u03bc receptor sites, block pain impulses, and produce maximum pain control\u2014an \u201cagonist effect.\u201d Full agonists include such drugs as morphine (Kadian, Avinza, Rylomine intranasal), meperidine (Demerol), fentanyl (Duragesic patch, Fentanyl oralets), oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), and hydromorphine (Dilaudid).\nPartial agonists produce a lesser response than full agonists and include such drugs as buprenorphine (Buprenex) and nalbuphine (Nubain). Mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics include such drugs as pentazocine hydrochloride (Talwin) and butorphanol tartrate (Stadol). An antagonist is a drug that competes with opioid receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) is such a drug. It is used for opioid overdoses and physical dependency.\nThe primary action of opioids (narcotics) is to alleviate moderate to severe pain. Many of the unwanted effects of this class of drugs are related to their actions on systems of the body other than the central nervous system (CNS), causing such effects as constipation and respiratory depression. The following table lists some common opioid side effects and preventative measures.\nOPIOID ADVERSE EFFECTS AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nBody System\nMonitor blood pressure and heart rate\nCNS\nSedation, disorientation, euphoria, dysphoria, light-headedness, lower seizure threshold, tremors\nInform client that tolerance may develop over 3\u20135 days; administer stimulants as needed\nGastrointestinal\nOffer anti-emetic; change analgesic; increase fluid and fiber intake; increase exercise; administer laxatives\nGenitourinary\nCatheterize as needed; administer opioid antagonist\nIntegumentary\nApply cool packs or lotion; administer antihistamine\nRespiratory\nRespiratory depression; aggravation of asthma\nMonitor respirations closely; administer opioid antagonist such as naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan)\nSome medications combine nonopioid with opioid analgesics in one tablet to offer two different levels of pain relief\u2014acting both on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site and at the level of the central nervous system. Acetaminophen with codeine is such a medication.\nDrug Tolerance and Dependence\nDrug tolerance is a physiologic condition in which humans require larger and larger doses of drugs to provide the same effect as provided by the original dose. The first sign of tolerance is a decrease in the duration of the analgesic effect. This condition is followed by a decrease in total analgesic effect. Decreasing the time between doses or increasing the dosage may help overcome tolerance. Even so, drug tolerance is not the only reason drugs become less effective. They may be less effective because there is advancing tissue damage, thus greater pain.\nPseudotolerance is the need to increase opioid dosage for reasons other than the physical adaptation of continuous use. These other needs include drug-to-drug interaction, drug-to-food interaction, increased physical activity, psychological dependence (addiction), and changes in opioid formulation.\nPhysical dependence is a physiologic adaptation of tissues to the drug. If a person who is physically dependent on opioids abruptly stops using them, withdrawal symptoms occur. These symptoms result from an autonomic nervous system response and may include excessive yawning, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, delirium, and convulsions. When opioid analgesics are to be discontinued, physical withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or eliminated by a slow reduction of dose.\nPsychological dependence (addiction) is the compulsive use of a substance characterized by a continuous craving for a drug\u2019s nonanalgesic emotional effects. Opioids (narcotics) with an affinity for both m and s receptor sites produce euphoria and hallucinations. Thus, these drugs are the most frequently abused opioids. When people take opioids to relieve pain, tolerance and physical dependence may occur, but addiction will not necessarily follow. Psychological dependence is far more complex and involves emotional, social, and cultural issues. (Pain management in clients with addictive disease is discussed further later in this course.)\nPseudoaddiction is a term used to describe people who, because of severe, unrelieved pain, focus on finding relief. As a consequence, they seem preoccupied with obtaining opioids. This preoccupation is not truly \u201cdrug-seeking\u201d but \u201crelief-seeking.\u201d Their quest for opioids is directly related to inadequate pain relief caused by an inappropriate opioid or inadequate doses spaced too far apart.\nAdjuvant Analgesics\nAdjuvant analgesics (co-analgesics) are drugs that were developed for uses other than pain but have been found to enhance the effects of analgesics. Caregivers need to remember that these are \u201chelper drugs,\u201d not substitutes for analgesics. Clients in pain still need analgesics. The following table describes some common adjuvant analgesics.\nCOMMON ADJUVANT (CO-ANALGESIC) DRUGS\nAntidepressants: Tricyclics and serotonin, reuptake inhibitors\nBurning, neuropathic pain; improves sleep, enhances mood and analgesic effects\nAnti-epileptic drugs\nNeuralgic and neuropathic pain (sharp, prickling, shooting pain)\nAntispasmodic\nAnxiolytic drugs: Benzodiazepines, buspirone, venlafaxine\nAnxiety and sedation\nNeuralgic pain and diabetic neuropathic pain\nPsychostimulants\nOffsets sedating side effects and enhances analgesic effects of opioids\nSteroids\nInflammatory and chronic pain of cancer, malignant spinal cord compression, headaches, and arthritis\nPlacebos\nA placebo is a \u201csugar pill,\u201d an inactive substance prescribed as if it were an effective dose of a medication. Research has found that placebos produce hoped-for results in 30% to 50% of the people who take them (Thompson, 2000). This so-called \u201cplacebo effect\u201d has been exploited for centuries by hucksters and charlatans who sell tonics, treatments, and gadgets to people in pain. Because their purpose is to deceive and strip clients of the right to make informed decisions, legitimate medical practice does not use placebos. Such acts violate the ethical principles of honesty and autonomy. The only exception to this prohibition is when subjects give prior consent for the possible use of placebos in research studies.\nWorld Health Organization Pain Management Ladder\nBecause of widespread misconceptions about treatment of chronic pain and addiction, in 1990 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a three-step pain management ladder based on the intensity of pain.\nMild pain (intensity 1\u20133 on the 0\u201310 standard): Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nMild to moderate pain (intensity 4\u20136): Use combination medications such as oxycodone and acetaminophen and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nModerate to severe pain (intensity 7\u201310): Use potent opioids such as morphine, fentanylm methadone, and adjuvants.\nTo prevent undertreatment of malignant cancer pain, some authorities recommend a different approach. They begin the treatment of malignant cancer pain with strong opioids, providing immediate relief, then slowly reduce the type and dosage until pain relief is achieved at the lower level (Jackson & Stanford, 2003).\nRoutes of Administration\nAnalgesics can be administered by many routes. Each has advantages and disadvantages as well as indications and contraindications. The overriding considerations are effectiveness and safety. The table below lists some of the most common routes for the administration of analgesic drugs.\nANALGESIC DRUG ADMINISTRATION\nContraindications\nOral (per os = PO)\nPreferred route due to lower cost and convenience; may be prepared as powders, capsules, tablets, liquids, or lozenges\nGastrointestinal irritation; inability to swallow; need for more potent analgesic\nRectal (R)\nInability to take oral drugs; can be self-administered; longer duration than oral\nAnal or rectal lesions, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia\nIntramuscular (IM)\nNeed for prolonged pain relief; absorption may be poor; possible muscle or nerve damage; costly\nIntravenous (IV) bolus\nOffers most rapid pain relief (5\u201315 min) but lasts less than 60 min\nRequires IV access; gives only brief pain relief when prolonged relief is needed\nContinuous intravenous (IV) infusion\nGives constant opioid blood level when other methods are ineffective\nRequires infusion pumps with alarms and close monitoring\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA)\nAllows predetermined IV bolus of analgesic when client desires pain relief\nRequires IV access, client cooperation, close supervision; does not give continuous pain relief\nSubcutaneous (SC) opioid infusion\nContinuous, prolonged parenteral opioids when IV not possible; allows home use\nRequires site change every 7 days of 27-gauge butterfly needle; potential site irritation\nIntraspinal (neuraxial), intrathecal, epidural, subarachnoid, intraventricular\nLabor contractions; also intractable pain when client cannot tolerate systemic opioids by other routes\nRequires expert insertion of catheter into intended space; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nRegional nerve blocks\nContinuous or single dose analgesic for acute and chronic pain; used for trauma, burns, and labor\nRequires expert insertion of catheter to specific nerve root; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nTopical (cream-laden anesthetic)\nAnalgesic for needle sticks, venipuncture, dermatitis, and insect stings\nMust be applied 30\u201360 min in advance of need\nTransdermal skin patch\nContinuous dose of opioid; allows home use\nCostly; when body temperature is over 102\u00b0F, absorption is accelerated\nNasal sprays\nAlternative to IV, IM, and oral opioid administration; rapid onset of action\nNasal exudates or mucosal swelling may prevent consistent absorption\nPrinciples for the Use of Analgesics\nTo guide caregivers, the American Pain Society (2005) identifies thirteen principles regarding the use of analgesics to control pain:\nIndividualize the route, dosage, and schedule of analgesics medications.\nAdminister analgesics on a regular basis if pain is present most of the day.\nKnow the dose and time course of several opioid analgesic preparations:\nAsk client about prior experience with certain drugs.\nGive preference to long-acting, sustained-release opioids such as OxyContin, which provides up to 12 hours of analgesia; Kadian and Avinza, controlled-release morphine preparations which provide up to 24 hours of pain relief; and transdermal fentanyl, which provides up to 3 days of pain relief.\nAvoid the adverse effects of emesis by giving anti-emetics.\nRotate opioids to compensate for tolerance.\nUse rapid-onset opioids when necessary.\nUse concentrated dosage forms when injection volume must be minimized.\nGive infants and children adequate opioid doses.\nFollow clients closely, particularly when beginning or changing analgesics.\nWhen changing to a new opioid or a different route, first use equianalgesic doses to estimate the new dose. Then, modify the estimate, based on the clinical situation and the specific drug.\nRecognize and treat side effects, such as sedation, constipation, nausea, itching, respiratory depression, by doing the following:\nChange the dose or route of the same drug to maintain constant blood levels.\nTry different opioids analgesics.\nConsider multi-drug and multi-modal therapy.\nAdd another drug that counteracts the adverse effects, such as a stimulant for sedation.\nUse an administration route that minimizes drug concentrations at the site producing the side effect, such as intraspinal instead of oral when appropriate.\nDo not use meperidine (Demerol) because of neurotoxicity risk or mixed agonist-antagonists (Talwin) because of psychotomimetic effects.\nDo not use placebos to assess the nature of pain.\nMonitor for the development of tolerance and treat appropriately. Increased pain may be due to progressive disease, new pathology, skipped doses, or other causes.\nExpect physical dependence and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nDo not diagnose patients as \u201copioid addicted\u201d solely because of opioid dependence.\nBe alert to the psychological state of the client.\nNONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nAlthough there are myriad drugs to relieve pain, all have some risk and cost. Fortunately, there are many nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce pain, especially when used in conjunction with pharmacologic measures. Described as physical and cognitive-behavioral interventions, many of these approaches are noninvasive, low-risk, inexpensive, easily performed and taught, and within the scope of nursing practice. Physical interventions give comfort, increase mobility, and alter physiologic responses. Cognitive-behavioral interventions alter the perception of pain, reduce fear, give a greater sense of control, and are considered holistic nursing practice.\nPhysical Interventions\nComfort measures such as clean and smooth sheets, soft and supportive pillows, warm blankets, and a soothing environment have been used by nurses throughout history to relieve pain and suffering. These measures may be difficult to provide in the noisy, mechanized healthcare facilities of today. Nonetheless, they are important to the mental and physical well-being of patients.\nPosition change and movement are well-known pain-relieving interventions. Moving the body, even a small amount, relieves muscle spasm and provides a degree of pain relief. So important is movement of the body to health, an entire profession has developed specializing in physical therapy. However, nurses need not wait for a specialist to offer these important pain-relieving interventions.\nMassage relieves muscle spasm, improves circulation, and provides cutaneous stimulation. While there are many different massage techniques, they all involve rubbing the skin in various patterns and degrees of pressure. Once considered an expected part of basic nursing care, backrubs offer an important noninvasive way to relieve pain and provide comfort.\nApplications of hot and cold are effective pain-relieving measures when used appropriately. Heat decreases muscle spasm and increases blood flow to an area. Cold decreases blood flow, edema, and inflammation and may decrease muscle spasm and pain. Many devices are available to provide hot and cold, including electric heating pads, patches, and ice packs. Soaks and baths relieve muscle spasm and are an important means of providing comfort.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) provides a continuous, mild electric current via 2 to 4 electrodes placed on the skin near a painful site. The stimulator is a small, battery-operated devise worn by the client. Experienced as a tingling sensation, TENS works by stimulating large nerve fibers to close the \u201cgate\u201d in the spinal cord. It also may stimulate endorphin production. TENS may be used for acute postoperative pain or for chronic conditions such as low back pain, phantom limb pain, and neuralgia.\nSurgical interventions may be recommended when severe pain persists despite medical treatment. If pain is due to a known condition, such as osteoarthritis of a joint, joint replacement surgery may be offered. When specific interventions are not available and conservative measures do not relieve pain, surgical interruption of pain pathways may be undertaken. Rhizotomy and cordotomy are two such procedures. In a rhizotomy the surgeon destroys dorsal posterior nerve roots as they enter the spinal cord, either by delivering neurolytic chemicals, heat, or extreme cold by way of a catheter or by performing a laminectomy, isolating the nerve roots, and directly destroying the nerve. A chordotomy is more extensive than a rhizotomy, involving resection of the spinothalamic tract. Both procedures cause permanent loss of pain and thermal sensations, however they may also cause paralysis due to motor nerve damage.\nCognitive-Behavioral Interventions\nRelaxation exercises are useful ways to reduce anxiety, decrease muscle tension, and lower blood pressure and heart rate. They induce a state of altered consciousness and give individuals a sense of control and peace of mind. Meditation, yoga, and other such interventions may effectively relieve pain. One such exercise involves controlled breathing. A coach speaks in a calm, clear voice, suggesting the subject begin by breathing slowly and diaphragmatically, allowing the abdomen to rise slowly and the chest to expand fully. Then, the coach suggests the subject locate an area of muscle tension, contract the muscles in that area, and then relax them. As the subject relaxes, pain perception and anxiety diminish.\nGuided imagery is similar to relaxation exercises in that a coach leads subjects in a calm, clear voice, often beginning with a relaxation exercise. The coach then suggests subjects imagine themselves in some peaceful place where they experience various sensory pleasures such as the warmth of the sun, the sound of ocean waves, and the smell of salt water. The purpose of the exercise is to provide an experience of relaxation and relief from stress and pain.\nDistraction diverts the attention of individuals away from painful stimuli. When people focus on something that gives pleasure, they are less likely to feel acute pain. This phenomenon occurs because the reticular activating system briefly inhibits the awareness of pain. Distraction works best for short acute pain, such as a needle stick. Such things as listening to music, watching an intense scene on television, or describing something of special interest may temporarily distract a person from pain. Distraction, however, does not work for chronic, long-term pain.\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and other stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. It is displayed as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch these signals, they learn to control their responses.\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\nTo relieve their pain, an increasing number of people in the United States are also turning to theories and practices outside the realm of conventional Western medicine. In 1991, the federal government established the Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1998, the agency became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), making the center one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. NCCAM defines CAM as \u201ca group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not currently part of conventional medicine\u201d (NCCAM, 2009a).\nThe mission of NCCAM is to explore \u201ccomplementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science\u2026and [to] disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals\u201d (NCCAM, 2007). In this context, \u201ccomplementary\u201d describes practices used in conjunction with or to supplement conventional medical treatments, and \u201calternative\u201d means those that are used independently or in place of conventional medicine. Practitioners of such techniques and practices often use the term holistic because they view health and illness as affecting the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit.\nThe major categories of complementary and alternative medicine are:\nBiologic (herbal mixtures; macrobiotic diets; orthomolecular, such as megadoses of vitamins, magnesium, melatonin, etc.)\nEnergy fields (acupuncture, therapeutic touch, pulse fields, Reiki, etc.)\nManipulative and body-based (chiropractic, lymphatic drainage, reflexology, aromatherapy, deep-muscle massage, shiatsu, etc.)\nMind-body (biofeedback, hypnosis, art therapy, prayer, etc.) (Diluzio\u00c2\u00a0 & Spillane 2002)\nBiologic. Plants have been used to treat human ailments throughout history. Their therapeutic effects are due to the chemical compounds they contain. Such chemicals may be administered to patients by giving some part of a plant or by extracting or synthesizing the essential chemical. When prepared in a purified form, the dose is more precise than it can be from a plant. Some common active chemicals originally derived from plants are: digitaloid found in the foxglove plant (digitalis), saponins found in sarsaparilla (irritant laxatives), alkaloids found in nightshades (atropine), and alkaloids found in the opium poppy (morphine) (McGuigan & Krug, 1942).\nEnergy fields. Such healing measures are based on theories about unseen forces in the human body. Acupuncture, for instance, is based on an ancient Chinese theory that two opposing forces, yin and yang, move along meridians in the body. When these forces are out of balance, pain and illness result. There are at least 350 acupuncture points by which energy flows are accessible. The theory posits that by stimulating these points with very fine needles, the energy flow can be rebalanced and pain relieved (Mayo Clinic, 2009; NCCAM, 2009b).\nChiropractic is a healthcare approach that focuses on the relationship between the body\u2019s structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014and its functioning. Although practitioners may use a variety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems and supporting the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself. People seek chiropractic care primarily for pain conditions such as back pain, neck pain, and headache. Side effects and risks depend on the type of chiropractic treatment used. Ongoing research is looking at effects of chiropractic treatment approaches, how they might work, and diseases and conditions for which they may be most helpful. (NCCAM, 2009c.)\nOsteopathy is a medical specialty that combines traditional and nontraditional medicine. Practitioners, called doctor of osteopathy (DO), practice traditional, science-based medicine, and are licensed to perform surgery and prescribe drugs. They \u201ctake a holistic view of the body as an integrated system and approach prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by way of the musculoskeletal system\u201d (Asher, 2007).\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and some stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. The machine displays information as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch the signals, they learn to control their responses.\nEvaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions\nEvaluation is one of the most critical phases of the nursing process. It tells us the degree to which an intervention achieved an expected outcome. If the expected outcome is pain reduction, evaluation tells us if the intervention did, in fact, reduce pain and if so, how much and at what cost in time, treasure, and long-term effects.\nTo find out, we gather data from the best source of information, the client, or the second-best source, the client\u2019s caregivers. To be of value, the information must address the aspects of pain that were noted before the intervention, including the location, intensity, quality, and duration of the pain. In addition, data is gathered about adverse effects of an intervention, such as an allergic reaction, hypotension, or respiratory depression.\nSuch feedback is essential if we are to revise the plan of care effectively. A positive evaluation means that an intervention was successful and probably should be continued. A negative evaluation means that an intervention was not satisfactory and should be changed. Hence the adage \u201cnegative feedback makes for change.\u201d\nCommunicating, Documenting, and Teaching\nCommunication about pain and the response of clients to interventions is facilitated by accurate and thorough documentation. This communication needs to be conveyed from nurse to nurse, shift to shift, and nurse to other responsible healthcare providers. Various tools have been devised to facilitate this communication, including pain flow sheets, running diaries, and bedside computer charting, called \u201cpoint-of-care.\u201d When communicating information about pain, it is important to describe the time and exact nature of an intervention, including details such as an analgesic and dose administered, level of pain before and after the intervention, and any adverse effect that follows, such as respiratory depression. The more specific and timely a report, the more effective the evaluation.\nBecause pain is a potent motivator for change, people who suffer are vulnerable to all manner of fake gadgets and magical cures. It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to give patients accurate information about medications, devices, physical activities, and psychological strategies in clear, understandable ways. Such teaching empowers those who suffer and demonstrates genuine concern, accurate empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and respect.\nPAIN MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN\nUnbelievable as it may seem, only recently has the medical profession taken seriously the pain and suffering of infants and children. Not long ago, newborn infants were circumcised without anesthesia or analgesia, and seriously injured children were given pain medication \u201cas needed.\u201d Happily, such undertreatment of pain in children is changing as a result of research by caring nurses and other healthcare professionals. Better assessment tools, new pharmaceuticals, and innovative delivery systems are contributing to these advances.\nResearch has shown that neonates and infants do feel and remember pain. In fact, by 6 months of age, when children are taken to places where they had experienced pain, they demonstrate anticipatory fear (Pasero, 2004). One study measured the long-term effect of newborn circumcision without analgesia on behavioral response to immunizations. When pain was measured by observable indicators such as facial expression, length of crying, and body movement, 4- to 6-month-old infants circumcised without analgesia had higher pain scores than those circumcised with analgesia (Anand, 1997).\nOther research found some children so traumatized by past injections that were intended to relieve pain that they were afraid to admit having present pain (Stevens, 1999). These and other studies have corrected many misconceptions about pain in infants and children, as described in the table below.\nMISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT PAIN IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN\nMisconceptions\nCorrect Information\nPreterm infants are less sensitive to pain than term infants and older children due to an immature nervous system.\nPreterm infants have the anatomical and functional ability to process pain and an even greater sensitivity to pain than term infants.\nInfants and children have a diminished perception of pain and no memory of its occurrence.\nPerception of pain is present with the first insult, requires no prior experience, and is remembered.\nInfants are incapable of expressing pain.\nAlthough infants cannot verbalize pain, they give physical signs and behavioral cues.\nPain in infants cannot be assessed accurately.\nBehavioral cues and physiologic signs of pain can be reliably and validly assessed; facial expressions are the most valid indicators.\nAnesthetics and analgesics cannot be given to neonates and infants because of an immature ability to eliminate drugs.\nInfants older than 1 month metabolize drugs in the same way as older infants and children.\nOpioids are too dangerous to give to infants and children because of the risk of addiction and other adverse effects.\nAdverse effects of opioid and nonopioids can be minimized by careful monitoring, drug titration, and weaning.\nInfants and children tolerate pain well and become accustomed to pain.\nPain is pain, whether it occurs in an infant, child, or adult.\nPostoperatively, children should not receive the next analgesic dose until they show obvious signs of pain.\nOpioids are most effective if administered as a continuous infusion rather than \u201cas needed,\u201d thus avoiding the need of children to complain.\nInfants and children cry or complain at the slightest discomfort even when they are not in pain.\nOften children are afraid to complaint of pain because their fear of an injection is greater than their pain.\nCommunicating with Children and Adolescents\nTo manage pain effectively in children and adolescents, nurses and other healthcare professionals need to be able to communicate with them. Such communication must be appropriate to age and stage of development. The following table describes some approaches that can be used to refine a nurses\u2019s interactions with children and, at the same time, model effective communication skills for family members.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\nAge and Stage\n"}, {"score": 2171.5894, "uuid": "f5657c39-e2ca-5c71-971d-037a0710da4c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-04-13680", "target_hostname": "www.e-booksite.net", "target_uri": "http://www.e-booksite.net/health_and_fitness_ebooks/everything_wanted_to_know_about_back_pain_and_physical_therapy.php", "page_rank": 1.2455461e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> and <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "The good news <em>is</em> that no matter if you&#x27;re in a lot of <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> <em>or</em> you&#x27;re just concerned about protecting your <em>back</em>, \u201cEverything You Always Wanted to Know About <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> &amp; <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>\u201d <em>is</em> the perfect resource <em>for</em> caring <em>for</em> your <em>back</em> \u2013 injured <em>or</em> not.", "explanation": null, "document": "To Rest Or Not To Rest?\nConclusion\nHere is an excerpt of the book:\nPhysical Therapy\nSince much of back pain\u00a0is caused by a weakening of the muscles, getting those muscles back into shape is the best course of action for many patients.\nBut if exercise and activity on your own hasn't helped and the back pain keeps coming back, your doctor may prescribe physical therapy for you.\nPhysical therapists will help you learn how to move your body in a healthy manner, while also strengthening your core to support your back. They can work with you in both active and in passive ways to help your body regain its health and to lessen pain naturally.\nActive Physical Therapy: This is the physical therapy that most people readily recognize. When you are doing active physical therapy, the therapist is either moving your body for you or they are showing you movements that they want you to repeat during your session.\nThese are designed to work with your injuries and to help strengthen your body to prevent future troubles.\nDepending on the severity of your back pain, you may need to go to physical therapy several times a week or you might simply go one time a week over the course of many months \u2013 it depends on your diagnosis.\nDuring these sessions you may:\nStretch\nDo low impact aerobic work\nStrength training\nTo most people, this sounds like going to the gym, but under the care of a physical therapist, you will be able to have your injury monitored and regulated for you as an individual. They will be able to recommend specific movements and then create new goals for new movements as you progress.\nPhysical therapists will also encourage the patients to practice these exercises on their own to continue their progress as well as to continue strengthening their backs.\nIf you are given a certain set of exercises to do, it's best that you follow the regimen exactly and talk to your physical therapist about any additional pain that you might feel during the movements.\nThe best part of this eBook is that you don't have to wait another minute or head into a crowded store to pick up a copy.

Pain tells us something is wrong in the structure or function of our body and that we need to do something about it. Because pain is such a strong motivator for action, it is considered one of the body\u2019s most important protective mechanisms.\nDefinitions of Pain\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defined pain as \u201can unpleasant, subjective, sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\u201d (1979). Pain, however, is much more than a physical sensation caused by a single entity. It is subjective and highly individual, a complex mechanism with physical, emotional, and cognitive components.\nPain cannot be objectively measured in the same way as, for example, the chemical content of urine or the oxygen content level of blood. Only the person who is suffering knows how the experience feels. For these reasons, McCaffery defined pain as \u201cwhatever the experiencing person says it is and whenever he says it does\u201d (1979). The American Pain Society goes further by stating that it is \u201cnot the responsibility of clients to prove they are in pain; it is the nurse\u2019s responsibility to accept the client\u2019s report of pain\u201d (2005).\nPain alters the quality of life more than any other health-related problem. It interferes with sleep, mobility, nutrition, thought, sexual activity, emotional well-being, creativity, and self-actualization. Surprisingly, even though pain is such an important obstacle to comfort, it is one of the least understood, most undertreated, and oft-discounted problems of healthcare providers and their clients. For this reason, some nurses and therapists add comfort to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of basic human needs (1968). The American Pain Society goes further, declaring the relief of pain a \u201cbasic human right\u201d (2005).\nTraditionally, pain was considered merely a physical symptom of illness or injury, a simple stimulus-response mechanism. Though the historic role of nurses and therapists has been to relieve pain and suffering, there has been little understanding of the complexity of pain and only limited ways to manage it. Recent research shows pain to be a distinct disorder, with physical, emotional, and cognitive components. This view of pain has broadened our understanding of pain and given us new ways to understand its characteristics.\nPAIN-RELATED TERMINOLOGY\nAlgesia: Sensitivity to pain.\nBreakthrough pain: Transitory increase in pain to a level greater than the client\u2019s well-controlled baseline level (McCaffery & Pasero, 2003).\nHyperalgesia: Excessive sensitivity to pain.\nIdiopathic pain: Chronic pain for which there is no identifiable psychological or physical cause.\nIntractable pain: Pain that is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, and nursing measures (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nPain threshold: Amount of pain required before individuals feel the pain. The lower the threshold, the less pain they can endure; the higher the threshold, the more pain they can endure.\nPain tolerance: Maximum amount and duration of pain a person can endure. Tolerance varies widely among people and is influenced by emotions and cultural background.\nPain syndrome: A group of symptoms of which pain is the critical element, such as headaches and post-herpetic neuralgia.\nPhantom limb pain: Pain that occurs in a limb after it is removed or as a result of severe damage to the affected nerve plexus due to perceptual disruption in the brain.\nPsychogenic pain: Chronic pain with no identified organic explanation.\nRadiating pain: Pain that begins at one place and extends out into nearby tissues.\nReferred pain: Pain that is felt at a different location than where tissue was damaged. This phenomenon occurs because pain fibers in the damaged area synapse near fibers from other areas of the body; for example, a myocardial infarction may create referred pain in the left shoulder.\nTypes of Pain\nPain is classified as acute and chronic. Acute pain has an identifiable cause and occurs soon after an injury to tissues in the body, such as bone, skin, or muscle. Acute pain is protective in that it motivates a person to take action. Its onset may be sudden or slow, and its intensity may vary from mild to severe. Acute pain is temporary and subsides as healing takes place. Severe acute pain activates the sympathetic nervous system, causing diaphoresis, increased respiratory and pulse rates, and elevated blood pressure.\nChronic pain lasts beyond an expected healing phase, is non-protective in that it serves no function, and may not have an identifiable cause (Patterson, 2007). When pain goes on more than 6 months, it moves from being a \u201csymptom\u201d to a \u201ccondition.\u201d Chronic pain afflicts more than 1 in 5 Americans and is one of the most pervasive and thorny medical conditions in the United States. Such pain is described as nonmalignant (noncancerous), malignant (cancerous), and intractable.\nNonmalignant, noncancerous chronic pain typically accompanies such conditions as osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathy. The lack of purpose and uncertainty of duration of such pain may lead to depression, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, apathy, learned helplessness, and other psychosocial consequences. If it is severe, chronic pain\u2014like prolonged stress\u2014activates the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in muscle tension, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and failure of body defenses.\nMalignant, cancerous chronic pain may be due to tumor progression, invasive procedures, infection, toxicities of treatment, and physical limitations. Such pain may be felt at the tumor site or some distance from it. Since clients with cancer may experience both chronic and acute pain, caregivers need to investigate immediately any new pain in these clients.\nIntractable chronic pain is pain from any cause that is resistant to medical, surgical, and nursing measures. Persistent and ongoing, intractable chronic pain may be psychogenic in nature (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nSources of Pain\nThe sources of pain are divided into three main categories: nociceptor, non-nociceptor, and psychogenic.\nNociceptor pain results when tissue damage produces a pain-producing stimulus that sends an electrical impulse across a pain receptor (nociceptor) by way of a nerve fiber to the central nervous system. Nociceptor pain is further divided into visceral and somatic pain.\nVisceral pain results from stimulation of nociceptors in the abdominal cavity and thorax.\nSomatic pain is divided into deep somatic and cutaneous pain. Deep somatic pain arises from bones, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. Cutaneous pain originates in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Some body tissues, such as the brain and lung, have no nociceptors, and some tissues have many.\nNon-nociceptor (neuropathic) pain is caused by direct injury to structures of the nervous system.\nPsychogenic pain is pain for which there is little or no physical evidence of organic disease or identified injury to tissues in the body. Lack of evidence, however, does not mean clients are malingering or that they are not suffering.\nPHYSIOLOGIC SOURCES OF PAIN\nSource: Adapted with permission from Ignatavicius et al., 1999.\nNociceptor: Visceral\nOrgans and linings of body cavities\nMechanism\nPoorly localized, diffuse, deep, cramping or splitting\nSources of acute pain\nChest tubes, abdominal tube drains, bladder and intestinal distention\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nPancreatitis, liver metastases, colitis\nCutaneous: skin and sub-cutaneous tissues\nDeep somatic: blood, muscle, blood vessels, connective tissue\nMechanism\nIncisional pain, insertion sites of tubes and drains, wound complications, orthopedic procedures, skeletal muscle spasms\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nBony metastases, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, peripheral vascular disease\nNon-nociceptor: Neuropathic\nNerve fibers, spinal cord, and central nervous system\nMechanism\nNon-nociceptive injury to nervous system structures\nCharacteristics\nGeneralized along distribution of damaged nervous structures\nSources of acute pain\nPoorly localized: shooting, burning, fiery, shock-like, sharp, painful numbness\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNervous tissue injury due to diabetes, HIV, chemotherapy, neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, trauma, surgery\nPsychogenic\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNonorganic psychological factors\nPhysiology of Pain\nThough a person is not consciously aware of the process, the experience of pain involves a complex sequence of biochemical and electrical events or processes beginning with tissue damage and followed by transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation.\nTISSUE DAMAGE\nWhen tissue is damaged, there is an immediate release of inflammatory chemicals called excitatory neurotransmitters, such as histamine and bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator. Increased blood in the area causes the injured area to swell, redden, and become tender. The bradykinin stimulates the release of prostaglandins and substance P, a potent neurotransmitter that enhances the movement of impulses across nerve synapses.\nTRANSDUCTION AND TRANSMISSION\nTransduction occurs as the energy of the stimulus is converted to electrical energy. Transmission of the stimulus takes place when this energy crosses into a nociceptor at the end of an afferent nerve fiber. Two types of peripheral nerve fibers conduct painful stimuli: the fast, myelinated A-delta fibers and the very small, slow, unmyelinated C-fibers. A-fibers send sharp, distinct sensations that localize the source of the pain and detect its intensity. C-fibers relay impulses that are poorly localized, burning, and persistent. For example, after burning a finger, a person initially feels a sharp localized pain as a result of A-fiber transmission. Within a few seconds the pain becomes more diffuse and widespread as a result of C-fiber transmission.\nPain stimuli travel quickly to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where the \u201cgating\u201d mechanism (discussed below) occurs. Pain impulses then cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and ascend to the higher centers in the brain via the spinothalamic tracts and on to the thalamus and higher centers of the brain, including the reticular formation, limbic system, and somatosensory cortex.\nNeurologic transmission of pain stimuli. (Illustration by Jason McAlexander. \u00a9 2005, Wild Iris Medical Education.\nPERCEPTION\nWhen pain stimuli reach the cerebral cortex, the brain interprets the signal; processes information from experiences, knowledge, and cultural associations; and perceives pain. Thus, perception is the awareness of pain. The somatosensory cortex identifies the location and intensity of pain, and the associated cortex determines how an individual interprets its meaning.\nMODULATION\nOnce the brain perceives the pain, the body releases neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins), serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. These chemicals hinder the transmission of pain and help produce an analgesic, pain-relieving effect. This inhibition of the pain impulse is called modulation. The descending paths of the efferent fibers extend from the cortex down to the spinal cord and may influence pain impulses at the level of the spinal cord.\nGATE-CONTROL THEORY\nMelzack and Wall proposed the gate-control theory to explain the relationship between pain and the emotions (1982). According to the theory, a gating mechanism occurs when a pain impulse travels to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. There, trigger (T) cells influence the transmission of pain impulses. When their activity is inhibited, the gate closes and impulses are less likely to be transmitted to the brain. This mechanism is controlled by descending nerve fibers from the thalamus and cerebral cortex, areas of the brain that regulate thought and emotions. The gate-control theory helps explain how thoughts and emotions modify the perception of pain and why interventions, such as imagery and distraction, help relieve it.\nFactors That Influence Pain\nThe perception of pain is influenced by physiologic, psychological, and cultural factors, all of which caregivers need to consider.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS\nAge\nAge affects the way people respond to pain. It influences both the development and decline of the nervous system. Aging affects the whole body, causing many painful degenerative disorders (such as osteoarthritis), secondary injuries (such as skin abrasions and fractures), and a host of common surgical procedures (such as cataract and hip replacement). Age also affects the way families and caregivers respond to complaints of pain. The following table gives a brief overview of the perception of pain relative to age. (The management of pain in children and older adults will be discussed in greater depth later in this course.)\nAGE AND THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN\nAge\nPain Perception\nPre-term infants\nHave anatomical and functional ability to process pain by mid to late gestation; seem to have greater sensitivity to pain than term infants or children\nNewborn infants\nResponse to pain is inborn and does not require prior learning; respond to pain with behaviors such as crying, grimacing, moving body\nInfants, 1 month\nCan metabolize analgesics and anesthesia effectively; can recognize caregiver as comforter\nToddlers/Preschoolers\nCan describe pain, its location and intensity; respond to pain by crying, anger, sadness; may consider pain a punishment; may hold someone accountable for pain and remember experiences in a certain location, such as a clinic\nSchool-age children\nMay try to be brave when facing a painful procedure; may regress to an earlier stage of development; seek understanding of reasons for pain\nAdolescents\nMay be slow to acknowledge pain; may consider showing signs of pain a weakness; may regress to earlier stages of development with persistent pain\nAdults\u00c2\nFear of pain may prevent some from seeking care; may believe admission of pain is a weakness and inappropriate for age or sex; may consider pain a punishment for moral failure\nOlder adults\nMay have decreased sensations or perceptions of pain; may consider pain an inevitable part of aging; chronic pain may produce anorexia, lethargy, depression; may not report pain due to fear of expense, possible treatment, dependency; often describe pain in nonmedical terms such as \u201churt\u201d or \u201cache\u201d; may fear addiction to analgesics; may not want to bother nurses or be a \u201cbad patient\u201d\nFatigue\nFatigue decreases coping abilities and heightens the perception of pain. When people are exhausted from physical activity, stress, and lack of sleep, their perception of pain may be heightened and their coping skills diminished. Thus, sleep and rest from physical, emotional, and social demands are important measures to manage pain more effectively.\nGenetic Makeup\nRecent research suggests that sensitivity to and tolerance for pain may a genetically linked trait (Ruda et al., 2000). This finding does not negate the need to manage pain adequately, regardless of inherited traits.\nMemory\nMemory of painful experiences, especially experiences that occurred as a very young child, may increase sensitivity and decrease tolerance to pain. For example, even young children remember the pain of an immunization at the doctor\u2019s office and henceforth may be afraid to visit the doctor again.\nStress Response\nResearch has shown that \u201csevere, unrelieved pain can cause an overwhelming stress response in both pre-term and full-term infants which can lead to serious complications and even death\u201d (Pasero, 2004). In recent years, post-traumatic stress syndrome has been the subject of extensive research, both as to its cause and its treatment (Hamilton, 2008).\nHealing\nRecent research suggests that unrelieved acute pain slows postoperative wound healing (McGuire, 2006). This evidence is not surprising, given our increasing knowledge of the effect of stress on the human body.\nNeurologic Function\nAny factor that interrupts or interferes with normal pain transmission affects the awareness and response of clients to pain and places them at risk for injury. Analgesics, sedatives, and alcohol depress the functioning of the central nervous system. Some diseases, such as leprosy, damage peripheral nerves, decrease sensitivity to touch and pain, and render sufferers more vulnerable to injury.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS\nFear and Anxiety\nThe relationship between pain and fear is convoluted and complex. Fear tends to increase the perception of pain, and pain increases feelings of fear and anxiety. This connection occurs in the brain because painful stimuli activate portions of the limbic system believed to control emotional reactions. People who are seriously injured or critically ill often experience both pain and heightened levels of anxiety due to their feelings of helplessness and lack of control. Caregivers need to address both pain and anxiety and use all appropriate measures to relieve suffering.\nCoping\nPeople manage pain and other stressors of life in different ways. Some see themselves as self-sufficient, internally controlled, and independent. As a result, they may deny pain or be slow to admit they are suffering. Others see themselves as insufficient, externally controlled, and dependent on others to treat their pain. Self-sufficient, internally controlled people may do better with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), whereas dependent, externally controlled individuals may prefer nurse-administered analgesia. No matter what the coping style, it is the responsibility of caregivers to relieve pain.\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nCultural beliefs and values affect the way people respond to pain. As children they learn what is and what is not acceptable behavior when experiencing pain. In some cultures, any expression of pain is considered cowardly and shameful. In others, noisy demonstrations of pain are expected and acceptable. The meaning of pain itself may be markedly different in different cultures. Some ethnic groups see pain as a punishment for wrongdoing. Others see pain as a test of faith. And still others view pain as a challenge to be overcome. Recent immigrants to America are more likely to view pain from their cultural roots. Regardless of an individual\u2019s language, religion, or situation, nurses and therapists respect every person and strive to alleviate pain and suffering.\nSTANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nBecause pain management is so important to the provision of quality healthcare, many organizations have developed standards by which professional practice is measured. Two such organizations are the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\nJoint Commission\nThe Joint Commission is an independent organization that accredits and certifies more than 17,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the United States. It evaluates how well these healthcare providers meet published standards of care, including their management of pain. The federal government accepts Joint Commission\u2013accredited facilities as qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.\nRegarding pain management, the Joint Commission Resources states:\nEach and every patient has a right to the assessment and management of pain. Hospitals must develop policies and procedures which address the organization\u2019s expectations of pain management in support of their mission and philosophy of care. Patients and their families also need education regarding their role in pain management. Developing a comprehensive and coordinated pain management program can be made easier by accessing good practices. From policies and procedures for the different types of pain (acute, chronic, etc.) to training assistants (including pre- and post-tests) to assessment tools, good practices can assist your organization to provide a comprehensive approach to pain management that meets the intent of the standards and, at the same time, achieves positive outcomes for patient (Joint Commission Resources, Inc., 2009).\nThe JCAHO Standards of Pain Management are listed below.\nJCAHO STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT\nTo meet the Joint Commission standards, accredited facilities must have policies in place to meet the following requirements:\nRecognize patients\u2019 rights to assessment and management of pain.\nAssess the nature and intensity of pain in all patients.\nEstablish safe medication, prescription, and ordering procedures.\nEnsure competency and orient new staff in pain assessment and management.\nMonitor patients post-procedure and reassess patient problems appropriately.\nEducate patients on the role of pain management in treatment.\nAddress patients\u2019 needs for symptom management in the discharge planning process.\nCollect data to monitor performance.\nSource: Partners against Pain, 2007.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics is a professional organization dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. As such, its committees develop guidelines, positions, and programs to support the mission of the organization. The AAP guidelines for pain management conclude with the strategies listed below.\nAAP GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on the assessment and management of acute pain in infants, children, and adolescents concludes with the following recommended strategies:\nExpand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric pain management principles and techniques.\nProvide a calm environment for procedures in order to reduce distress-producing stimulation.\nUse appropriate pain assessment tools and techniques.\nAnticipate predictable painful experiences; intervene, and monitor accordingly.\nUse a multimodal (pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral, and physical) approach to pain management and use a multidisciplinary approach when possible.\nInvolve families and tailor interventions to the individual child.\nAdvocate for child-specific research in pain management and Food and Drug Administration evaluation of analgesics for children.\nAdvocate for the effective use of pain medication for children to ensure compassionate and competent management of pain.\nSource: American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001.\nPAIN AND THE NURSING PROCESS\nThe nursing process includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation. To manage pain responsibly, nurses use each step of the nursing process.\nBasic to every strategy for managing pain is showing respect for the validity of a client\u2019s experience of pain. To communicate respect, nurses:\nAcknowledge pain and take action to manage it.\nGive accurate information to reduce anxiety and facilitate relief of pain.\nReduce environmental stressors that add to the experience of pain.\nEncourage disclosure of feelings and fears.\nProvide privacy and maintain confidentiality.\nAssessing Pain\nPain is a red flag. It tells us there is a problem somewhere in the body that is crying out for attention. In fact, pain is such an important indicator of health, its assessment has been called the \u201cfifth vital sign,\u201d joining temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. Even so, until we know more about a specific pain, we cannot fix it. To do this, nurses and therapists must gather information from as many sources as possible, especially the primary source, the person in pain. This investigation includes obtaining a comprehensive pain history, making observations of behaviors, performing an appropriate physical examination, and consulting with other healthcare professionals.\nPAIN HISTORY\nA pain history is obtained from written documents and from interviews with the person in pain, family members, and other caregivers. It asks specific questions about the location, intensity, quality, and history of the pain, as shown in the following box. In some facilities these questions are printed on an assessment form, with space for answers to be recorded beside each question. Later sections of this course discuss the assessment of pain in children and special populations.\nOBTAINING A PAIN HISTORY\nLocation: Where is your pain? Ask client to point to the area of pain.\nIntensity: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, how much pain would you say you are experiencing? If your pain were a temperature, how cold or hot would it be (warm, hot, blistering)? If your pain were a sound, how loud would it be (silent, quiet, strident, booming)?\nQuality: In your own words, tell me what your pain feels like. (worms under the skin, shooting, needle pricking, tingling, etc.).\nChronology/pattern: When did the pain start? Does your pain come and go? How often? How long does it last?\nPrecipitating factors: What triggers the pain, or what makes it worse?\nAlleviating factors: What measures have you found that lessen or relieve the pain? What pain medications do you use? How much and how often?\nAssociated symptoms: Do you have other symptoms before, during, or after your pain begins (dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and shortness of breath)?\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS\nMost people who suffer pain usually show it either by verbal complaint or nonverbal behaviors. The following table lists some typical behaviors nurses may observe when they assess people in pain.\nNONVERBAL BEHAVIORS INDICATING PAIN\nWidely opened eyes or mouth\nCrying\nFocus on pain relief measures\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nWhen clients complain of pain or show it by their behavior, health professionals need to take action to find the cause. Assessment is most effective if the pain history interview and behavioral observations are conducted at the same time as the physical examination. For example, if a client complains of acute pain on the sole of a foot, the nurse or therapist visually examines the foot for unusual signs, observes the person for behavioral cues of pain, and asks about the onset, intensity, quality, and pattern of the pain and what makes it worse or better. If the cause is not identified immediately, the client is referred for further assessment.\nDiagnosing Pain\nAn accurate diagnosis depends on an appropriate assessment that focuses on the exact nature of the pain. The more specific the diagnosis, the more effective interventions can be. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has identified two primary diagnoses for pain: acute and chronic. A complete nursing diagnosis, however, goes further. After identifying whether the pain is acute or chronic, it adds \u201crelated to\u201d the medical diagnosis. For example, \u201cchronic pain related to osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d Then, it adds \u201cmanifested by\u201d and lists the various symptoms experienced by the client or signs confirmed by objective data. Thus, a complete diagnosis might be \u201cchronic pain, related to osteoarthritis, manifested by stabbing pain in the left hip with weight-bearing.\u201d\nThe advantage of clear, specific information is that it leads to more effective interventions. In this case, an appropriate intervention might be an assistive devise such as a cane or walker and referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.\nPlanning and Goal Setting\nDuring the planning stage, nurses and therapists synthesize information from many sources and, together with the physician, plan appropriate interventions. The goal of these interventions is to relieve pain and facilitate the highest possible level of functioning. Practically speaking, this means identifying what activity the pain is preventing and the best way to achieve a return of function. For the client described above with chronic hip pain, the activity the pain is preventing is mobility.\nPlanning interventions means working in partnership with clients and physicians to provide specific measures to manage the pain. These interventions may be independent or collaborative. Independent nursing actions fall within the scope of nursing practice and include controlling the environment, giving emotional support, and providing comfort. Collaborative nursing actions involve cooperative interventions with other members of the healthcare team, such as physical therapists, pharmacists, and physicians.\nGoal setting involves the identification of attainable objectives and reasonable priorities. Because every person is different, the nurse or therapist discusses various alternatives with the client, and together they set priorities. For example, after consulting an orthopedic surgeon, the person with osteoarthritis may decide to delay hip replacement surgery and maintain mobility as long as possible with the aid of a cane and analgesics for pain.\nInterventions\nPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nThere are two primary groups of pain medications: nonopioids and opioids. A third group of drugs called adjuvants or co-analgesics address symptoms that often accompany pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasm, anorexia, and depression.\nNonopioid Analgesics\nNonopioid analgesics relieve pain by acting on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site to decrease the level of inflammatory mediators. This group of analgesics includes drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and ibuprofen (Motrin). The specific actions and dosages of these analgesics vary. Generally speaking, however, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects and are useful for mild to moderate pain.\nWith the exception of acetaminophen, most nonopioids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs are especially effective when the primary cause of pain is inflammation, as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and bone cancer. When tissue is damaged, a series of biochemical events leads to the release of prostaglandin, which causes edema, inflammation, and pain. Two isoenzymes\u2014cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)\u2014play an important part in this biochemical process. Drugs that inhibit their action, especially that of COX-2, reduce prostaglandin production and the inflammation it creates. However, these drugs must be used with caution because the safety of long-term use has not been verified. The following table lists some common nonopioid analgesics.\nCOMMON NONOPIOID ANALGESICS\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis; lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs\nAspirin\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis, general pain; antipyretic; inhibits platelet aggregation, causing bleeding\nIbuprofen (Motrin)\n400 mg q 4\u20136 hr\nUsed for osteoarthritis; antipyretic; multiple brand names; available as liquid\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nUsed for gout; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic\nNaproxen (Naprosyn)\n500 mg initial dose, then 250 mg q 6\u20138 hr\nUsed for gout, headaches; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic; available in liquid preparation\nOpioid Analgesics\nOpioid (narcotic, CNS-acting) analgesics are derivatives of opium and include such drugs as morphine, codeine, and methadone. These drugs modify the perception of pain and provide a sense of euphoria by binding to specific opiate receptors throughout the central nervous system. Opiate receptors have various names, typically denoted by Greek letters such as mu (\u03bc), kappa (\u03ba), and sigma (\u03c3). Many of the characteristics of particular opioids relate to the receptor to which they bind. For example, morphine binds to m receptors and follow m receptor control.\nOpioid analgesics are classified as full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed agonist-antagonists. Full agonists bind to \u03bc receptor sites, block pain impulses, and produce maximum pain control\u2014an \u201cagonist effect.\u201d Full agonists include such drugs as morphine (Kadian, Avinza, Rylomine intranasal), meperidine (Demerol), fentanyl (Duragesic patch, Fentanyl oralets), oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), and hydromorphine (Dilaudid).\nPartial agonists produce a lesser response than full agonists and include such drugs as buprenorphine (Buprenex) and nalbuphine (Nubain). Mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics include such drugs as pentazocine hydrochloride (Talwin) and butorphanol tartrate (Stadol). An antagonist is a drug that competes with opioid receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) is such a drug. It is used for opioid overdoses and physical dependency.\nThe primary action of opioids (narcotics) is to alleviate moderate to severe pain. Many of the unwanted effects of this class of drugs are related to their actions on systems of the body other than the central nervous system (CNS), causing such effects as constipation and respiratory depression. The following table lists some common opioid side effects and preventative measures.\nOPIOID ADVERSE EFFECTS AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nBody System\nMonitor blood pressure and heart rate\nCNS\nSedation, disorientation, euphoria, dysphoria, light-headedness, lower seizure threshold, tremors\nInform client that tolerance may develop over 3\u20135 days; administer stimulants as needed\nGastrointestinal\nOffer anti-emetic; change analgesic; increase fluid and fiber intake; increase exercise; administer laxatives\nGenitourinary\nCatheterize as needed; administer opioid antagonist\nIntegumentary\nApply cool packs or lotion; administer antihistamine\nRespiratory\nRespiratory depression; aggravation of asthma\nMonitor respirations closely; administer opioid antagonist such as naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan)\nSome medications combine nonopioid with opioid analgesics in one tablet to offer two different levels of pain relief\u2014acting both on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site and at the level of the central nervous system. Acetaminophen with codeine is such a medication.\nDrug Tolerance and Dependence\nDrug tolerance is a physiologic condition in which humans require larger and larger doses of drugs to provide the same effect as provided by the original dose. The first sign of tolerance is a decrease in the duration of the analgesic effect. This condition is followed by a decrease in total analgesic effect. Decreasing the time between doses or increasing the dosage may help overcome tolerance. Even so, drug tolerance is not the only reason drugs become less effective. They may be less effective because there is advancing tissue damage, thus greater pain.\nPseudotolerance is the need to increase opioid dosage for reasons other than the physical adaptation of continuous use. These other needs include drug-to-drug interaction, drug-to-food interaction, increased physical activity, psychological dependence (addiction), and changes in opioid formulation.\nPhysical dependence is a physiologic adaptation of tissues to the drug. If a person who is physically dependent on opioids abruptly stops using them, withdrawal symptoms occur. These symptoms result from an autonomic nervous system response and may include excessive yawning, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, delirium, and convulsions. When opioid analgesics are to be discontinued, physical withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or eliminated by a slow reduction of dose.\nPsychological dependence (addiction) is the compulsive use of a substance characterized by a continuous craving for a drug\u2019s nonanalgesic emotional effects. Opioids (narcotics) with an affinity for both m and s receptor sites produce euphoria and hallucinations. Thus, these drugs are the most frequently abused opioids. When people take opioids to relieve pain, tolerance and physical dependence may occur, but addiction will not necessarily follow. Psychological dependence is far more complex and involves emotional, social, and cultural issues. (Pain management in clients with addictive disease is discussed further later in this course.)\nPseudoaddiction is a term used to describe people who, because of severe, unrelieved pain, focus on finding relief. As a consequence, they seem preoccupied with obtaining opioids. This preoccupation is not truly \u201cdrug-seeking\u201d but \u201crelief-seeking.\u201d Their quest for opioids is directly related to inadequate pain relief caused by an inappropriate opioid or inadequate doses spaced too far apart.\nAdjuvant Analgesics\nAdjuvant analgesics (co-analgesics) are drugs that were developed for uses other than pain but have been found to enhance the effects of analgesics. Caregivers need to remember that these are \u201chelper drugs,\u201d not substitutes for analgesics. Clients in pain still need analgesics. The following table describes some common adjuvant analgesics.\nCOMMON ADJUVANT (CO-ANALGESIC) DRUGS\nAntidepressants: Tricyclics and serotonin, reuptake inhibitors\nBurning, neuropathic pain; improves sleep, enhances mood and analgesic effects\nAnti-epileptic drugs\nNeuralgic and neuropathic pain (sharp, prickling, shooting pain)\nAntispasmodic\nAnxiolytic drugs: Benzodiazepines, buspirone, venlafaxine\nAnxiety and sedation\nNeuralgic pain and diabetic neuropathic pain\nPsychostimulants\nOffsets sedating side effects and enhances analgesic effects of opioids\nSteroids\nInflammatory and chronic pain of cancer, malignant spinal cord compression, headaches, and arthritis\nPlacebos\nA placebo is a \u201csugar pill,\u201d an inactive substance prescribed as if it were an effective dose of a medication. Research has found that placebos produce hoped-for results in 30% to 50% of the people who take them (Thompson, 2000). This so-called \u201cplacebo effect\u201d has been exploited for centuries by hucksters and charlatans who sell tonics, treatments, and gadgets to people in pain. Because their purpose is to deceive and strip clients of the right to make informed decisions, legitimate medical practice does not use placebos. Such acts violate the ethical principles of honesty and autonomy. The only exception to this prohibition is when subjects give prior consent for the possible use of placebos in research studies.\nWorld Health Organization Pain Management Ladder\nBecause of widespread misconceptions about treatment of chronic pain and addiction, in 1990 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a three-step pain management ladder based on the intensity of pain.\nMild pain (intensity 1\u20133 on the 0\u201310 standard): Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nMild to moderate pain (intensity 4\u20136): Use combination medications such as oxycodone and acetaminophen and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nModerate to severe pain (intensity 7\u201310): Use potent opioids such as morphine, fentanylm methadone, and adjuvants.\nTo prevent undertreatment of malignant cancer pain, some authorities recommend a different approach. They begin the treatment of malignant cancer pain with strong opioids, providing immediate relief, then slowly reduce the type and dosage until pain relief is achieved at the lower level (Jackson & Stanford, 2003).\nRoutes of Administration\nAnalgesics can be administered by many routes. Each has advantages and disadvantages as well as indications and contraindications. The overriding considerations are effectiveness and safety. The table below lists some of the most common routes for the administration of analgesic drugs.\nANALGESIC DRUG ADMINISTRATION\nContraindications\nOral (per os = PO)\nPreferred route due to lower cost and convenience; may be prepared as powders, capsules, tablets, liquids, or lozenges\nGastrointestinal irritation; inability to swallow; need for more potent analgesic\nRectal (R)\nInability to take oral drugs; can be self-administered; longer duration than oral\nAnal or rectal lesions, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia\nIntramuscular (IM)\nNeed for prolonged pain relief; absorption may be poor; possible muscle or nerve damage; costly\nIntravenous (IV) bolus\nOffers most rapid pain relief (5\u201315 min) but lasts less than 60 min\nRequires IV access; gives only brief pain relief when prolonged relief is needed\nContinuous intravenous (IV) infusion\nGives constant opioid blood level when other methods are ineffective\nRequires infusion pumps with alarms and close monitoring\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA)\nAllows predetermined IV bolus of analgesic when client desires pain relief\nRequires IV access, client cooperation, close supervision; does not give continuous pain relief\nSubcutaneous (SC) opioid infusion\nContinuous, prolonged parenteral opioids when IV not possible; allows home use\nRequires site change every 7 days of 27-gauge butterfly needle; potential site irritation\nIntraspinal (neuraxial), intrathecal, epidural, subarachnoid, intraventricular\nLabor contractions; also intractable pain when client cannot tolerate systemic opioids by other routes\nRequires expert insertion of catheter into intended space; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nRegional nerve blocks\nContinuous or single dose analgesic for acute and chronic pain; used for trauma, burns, and labor\nRequires expert insertion of catheter to specific nerve root; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nTopical (cream-laden anesthetic)\nAnalgesic for needle sticks, venipuncture, dermatitis, and insect stings\nMust be applied 30\u201360 min in advance of need\nTransdermal skin patch\nContinuous dose of opioid; allows home use\nCostly; when body temperature is over 102\u00b0F, absorption is accelerated\nNasal sprays\nAlternative to IV, IM, and oral opioid administration; rapid onset of action\nNasal exudates or mucosal swelling may prevent consistent absorption\nPrinciples for the Use of Analgesics\nTo guide caregivers, the American Pain Society (2005) identifies thirteen principles regarding the use of analgesics to control pain:\nIndividualize the route, dosage, and schedule of analgesics medications.\nAdminister analgesics on a regular basis if pain is present most of the day.\nKnow the dose and time course of several opioid analgesic preparations:\nAsk client about prior experience with certain drugs.\nGive preference to long-acting, sustained-release opioids such as OxyContin, which provides up to 12 hours of analgesia; Kadian and Avinza, controlled-release morphine preparations which provide up to 24 hours of pain relief; and transdermal fentanyl, which provides up to 3 days of pain relief.\nAvoid the adverse effects of emesis by giving anti-emetics.\nRotate opioids to compensate for tolerance.\nUse rapid-onset opioids when necessary.\nUse concentrated dosage forms when injection volume must be minimized.\nGive infants and children adequate opioid doses.\nFollow clients closely, particularly when beginning or changing analgesics.\nWhen changing to a new opioid or a different route, first use equianalgesic doses to estimate the new dose. Then, modify the estimate, based on the clinical situation and the specific drug.\nRecognize and treat side effects, such as sedation, constipation, nausea, itching, respiratory depression, by doing the following:\nChange the dose or route of the same drug to maintain constant blood levels.\nTry different opioids analgesics.\nConsider multi-drug and multi-modal therapy.\nAdd another drug that counteracts the adverse effects, such as a stimulant for sedation.\nUse an administration route that minimizes drug concentrations at the site producing the side effect, such as intraspinal instead of oral when appropriate.\nDo not use meperidine (Demerol) because of neurotoxicity risk or mixed agonist-antagonists (Talwin) because of psychotomimetic effects.\nDo not use placebos to assess the nature of pain.\nMonitor for the development of tolerance and treat appropriately. Increased pain may be due to progressive disease, new pathology, skipped doses, or other causes.\nExpect physical dependence and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nDo not diagnose patients as \u201copioid addicted\u201d solely because of opioid dependence.\nBe alert to the psychological state of the client.\nNONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nAlthough there are myriad drugs to relieve pain, all have some risk and cost. Fortunately, there are many nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce pain, especially when used in conjunction with pharmacologic measures. Described as physical and cognitive-behavioral interventions, many of these approaches are noninvasive, low-risk, inexpensive, easily performed and taught, and within the scope of nursing practice. Physical interventions give comfort, increase mobility, and alter physiologic responses. Cognitive-behavioral interventions alter the perception of pain, reduce fear, give a greater sense of control, and are considered holistic nursing practice.\nPhysical Interventions\nComfort measures such as clean and smooth sheets, soft and supportive pillows, warm blankets, and a soothing environment have been used by nurses throughout history to relieve pain and suffering. These measures may be difficult to provide in the noisy, mechanized healthcare facilities of today. Nonetheless, they are important to the mental and physical well-being of patients.\nPosition change and movement are well-known pain-relieving interventions. Moving the body, even a small amount, relieves muscle spasm and provides a degree of pain relief. So important is movement of the body to health, an entire profession has developed specializing in physical therapy. However, nurses need not wait for a specialist to offer these important pain-relieving interventions.\nMassage relieves muscle spasm, improves circulation, and provides cutaneous stimulation. While there are many different massage techniques, they all involve rubbing the skin in various patterns and degrees of pressure. Once considered an expected part of basic nursing care, backrubs offer an important noninvasive way to relieve pain and provide comfort.\nApplications of hot and cold are effective pain-relieving measures when used appropriately. Heat decreases muscle spasm and increases blood flow to an area. Cold decreases blood flow, edema, and inflammation and may decrease muscle spasm and pain. Many devices are available to provide hot and cold, including electric heating pads, patches, and ice packs. Soaks and baths relieve muscle spasm and are an important means of providing comfort.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) provides a continuous, mild electric current via 2 to 4 electrodes placed on the skin near a painful site. The stimulator is a small, battery-operated devise worn by the client. Experienced as a tingling sensation, TENS works by stimulating large nerve fibers to close the \u201cgate\u201d in the spinal cord. It also may stimulate endorphin production. TENS may be used for acute postoperative pain or for chronic conditions such as low back pain, phantom limb pain, and neuralgia.\nSurgical interventions may be recommended when severe pain persists despite medical treatment. If pain is due to a known condition, such as osteoarthritis of a joint, joint replacement surgery may be offered. When specific interventions are not available and conservative measures do not relieve pain, surgical interruption of pain pathways may be undertaken. Rhizotomy and cordotomy are two such procedures. In a rhizotomy the surgeon destroys dorsal posterior nerve roots as they enter the spinal cord, either by delivering neurolytic chemicals, heat, or extreme cold by way of a catheter or by performing a laminectomy, isolating the nerve roots, and directly destroying the nerve. A chordotomy is more extensive than a rhizotomy, involving resection of the spinothalamic tract. Both procedures cause permanent loss of pain and thermal sensations, however they may also cause paralysis due to motor nerve damage.\nCognitive-Behavioral Interventions\nRelaxation exercises are useful ways to reduce anxiety, decrease muscle tension, and lower blood pressure and heart rate. They induce a state of altered consciousness and give individuals a sense of control and peace of mind. Meditation, yoga, and other such interventions may effectively relieve pain. One such exercise involves controlled breathing. A coach speaks in a calm, clear voice, suggesting the subject begin by breathing slowly and diaphragmatically, allowing the abdomen to rise slowly and the chest to expand fully. Then, the coach suggests the subject locate an area of muscle tension, contract the muscles in that area, and then relax them. As the subject relaxes, pain perception and anxiety diminish.\nGuided imagery is similar to relaxation exercises in that a coach leads subjects in a calm, clear voice, often beginning with a relaxation exercise. The coach then suggests subjects imagine themselves in some peaceful place where they experience various sensory pleasures such as the warmth of the sun, the sound of ocean waves, and the smell of salt water. The purpose of the exercise is to provide an experience of relaxation and relief from stress and pain.\nDistraction diverts the attention of individuals away from painful stimuli. When people focus on something that gives pleasure, they are less likely to feel acute pain. This phenomenon occurs because the reticular activating system briefly inhibits the awareness of pain. Distraction works best for short acute pain, such as a needle stick. Such things as listening to music, watching an intense scene on television, or describing something of special interest may temporarily distract a person from pain. Distraction, however, does not work for chronic, long-term pain.\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and other stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. It is displayed as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch these signals, they learn to control their responses.\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\nTo relieve their pain, an increasing number of people in the United States are also turning to theories and practices outside the realm of conventional Western medicine. In 1991, the federal government established the Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1998, the agency became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), making the center one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. NCCAM defines CAM as \u201ca group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not currently part of conventional medicine\u201d (NCCAM, 2009a).\nThe mission of NCCAM is to explore \u201ccomplementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science\u2026and [to] disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals\u201d (NCCAM, 2007). In this context, \u201ccomplementary\u201d describes practices used in conjunction with or to supplement conventional medical treatments, and \u201calternative\u201d means those that are used independently or in place of conventional medicine. Practitioners of such techniques and practices often use the term holistic because they view health and illness as affecting the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit.\nThe major categories of complementary and alternative medicine are:\nBiologic (herbal mixtures; macrobiotic diets; orthomolecular, such as megadoses of vitamins, magnesium, melatonin, etc.)\nEnergy fields (acupuncture, therapeutic touch, pulse fields, Reiki, etc.)\nManipulative and body-based (chiropractic, lymphatic drainage, reflexology, aromatherapy, deep-muscle massage, shiatsu, etc.)\nMind-body (biofeedback, hypnosis, art therapy, prayer, etc.) (Diluzio\u00c2\u00a0 & Spillane 2002)\nBiologic. Plants have been used to treat human ailments throughout history. Their therapeutic effects are due to the chemical compounds they contain. Such chemicals may be administered to patients by giving some part of a plant or by extracting or synthesizing the essential chemical. When prepared in a purified form, the dose is more precise than it can be from a plant. Some common active chemicals originally derived from plants are: digitaloid found in the foxglove plant (digitalis), saponins found in sarsaparilla (irritant laxatives), alkaloids found in nightshades (atropine), and alkaloids found in the opium poppy (morphine) (McGuigan & Krug, 1942).\nEnergy fields. Such healing measures are based on theories about unseen forces in the human body. Acupuncture, for instance, is based on an ancient Chinese theory that two opposing forces, yin and yang, move along meridians in the body. When these forces are out of balance, pain and illness result. There are at least 350 acupuncture points by which energy flows are accessible. The theory posits that by stimulating these points with very fine needles, the energy flow can be rebalanced and pain relieved (Mayo Clinic, 2009; NCCAM, 2009b).\nChiropractic is a healthcare approach that focuses on the relationship between the body\u2019s structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014and its functioning. Although practitioners may use a variety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems and supporting the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself. People seek chiropractic care primarily for pain conditions such as back pain, neck pain, and headache. Side effects and risks depend on the type of chiropractic treatment used. Ongoing research is looking at effects of chiropractic treatment approaches, how they might work, and diseases and conditions for which they may be most helpful. (NCCAM, 2009c.)\nOsteopathy is a medical specialty that combines traditional and nontraditional medicine. Practitioners, called doctor of osteopathy (DO), practice traditional, science-based medicine, and are licensed to perform surgery and prescribe drugs. They \u201ctake a holistic view of the body as an integrated system and approach prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by way of the musculoskeletal system\u201d (Asher, 2007).\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and some stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. The machine displays information as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch the signals, they learn to control their responses.\nEvaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions\nEvaluation is one of the most critical phases of the nursing process. It tells us the degree to which an intervention achieved an expected outcome. If the expected outcome is pain reduction, evaluation tells us if the intervention did, in fact, reduce pain and if so, how much and at what cost in time, treasure, and long-term effects.\nTo find out, we gather data from the best source of information, the client, or the second-best source, the client\u2019s caregivers. To be of value, the information must address the aspects of pain that were noted before the intervention, including the location, intensity, quality, and duration of the pain. In addition, data is gathered about adverse effects of an intervention, such as an allergic reaction, hypotension, or respiratory depression.\nSuch feedback is essential if we are to revise the plan of care effectively. A positive evaluation means that an intervention was successful and probably should be continued. A negative evaluation means that an intervention was not satisfactory and should be changed. Hence the adage \u201cnegative feedback makes for change.\u201d\nCommunicating, Documenting, and Teaching\nCommunication about pain and the response of clients to interventions is facilitated by accurate and thorough documentation. This communication needs to be conveyed from nurse to nurse, shift to shift, and nurse to other responsible healthcare providers. Various tools have been devised to facilitate this communication, including pain flow sheets, running diaries, and bedside computer charting, called \u201cpoint-of-care.\u201d When communicating information about pain, it is important to describe the time and exact nature of an intervention, including details such as an analgesic and dose administered, level of pain before and after the intervention, and any adverse effect that follows, such as respiratory depression. The more specific and timely a report, the more effective the evaluation.\nBecause pain is a potent motivator for change, people who suffer are vulnerable to all manner of fake gadgets and magical cures. It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to give patients accurate information about medications, devices, physical activities, and psychological strategies in clear, understandable ways. Such teaching empowers those who suffer and demonstrates genuine concern, accurate empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and respect.\nPAIN MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN\nUnbelievable as it may seem, only recently has the medical profession taken seriously the pain and suffering of infants and children. Not long ago, newborn infants were circumcised without anesthesia or analgesia, and seriously injured children were given pain medication \u201cas needed.\u201d Happily, such undertreatment of pain in children is changing as a result of research by caring nurses and other healthcare professionals. Better assessment tools, new pharmaceuticals, and innovative delivery systems are contributing to these advances.\nResearch has shown that neonates and infants do feel and remember pain. In fact, by 6 months of age, when children are taken to places where they had experienced pain, they demonstrate anticipatory fear (Pasero, 2004). One study measured the long-term effect of newborn circumcision without analgesia on behavioral response to immunizations. When pain was measured by observable indicators such as facial expression, length of crying, and body movement, 4- to 6-month-old infants circumcised without analgesia had higher pain scores than those circumcised with analgesia (Anand, 1997).\nOther research found some children so traumatized by past injections that were intended to relieve pain that they were afraid to admit having present pain (Stevens, 1999). These and other studies have corrected many misconceptions about pain in infants and children, as described in the table below.\nMISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT PAIN IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN\nMisconceptions\nCorrect Information\nPreterm infants are less sensitive to pain than term infants and older children due to an immature nervous system.\nPreterm infants have the anatomical and functional ability to process pain and an even greater sensitivity to pain than term infants.\nInfants and children have a diminished perception of pain and no memory of its occurrence.\nPerception of pain is present with the first insult, requires no prior experience, and is remembered.\nInfants are incapable of expressing pain.\nAlthough infants cannot verbalize pain, they give physical signs and behavioral cues.\nPain in infants cannot be assessed accurately.\nBehavioral cues and physiologic signs of pain can be reliably and validly assessed; facial expressions are the most valid indicators.\nAnesthetics and analgesics cannot be given to neonates and infants because of an immature ability to eliminate drugs.\nInfants older than 1 month metabolize drugs in the same way as older infants and children.\nOpioids are too dangerous to give to infants and children because of the risk of addiction and other adverse effects.\nAdverse effects of opioid and nonopioids can be minimized by careful monitoring, drug titration, and weaning.\nInfants and children tolerate pain well and become accustomed to pain.\nPain is pain, whether it occurs in an infant, child, or adult.\nPostoperatively, children should not receive the next analgesic dose until they show obvious signs of pain.\nOpioids are most effective if administered as a continuous infusion rather than \u201cas needed,\u201d thus avoiding the need of children to complain.\nInfants and children cry or complain at the slightest discomfort even when they are not in pain.\nOften children are afraid to complaint of pain because their fear of an injection is greater than their pain.\nCommunicating with Children and Adolescents\nTo manage pain effectively in children and adolescents, nurses and other healthcare professionals need to be able to communicate with them. Such communication must be appropriate to age and stage of development. The following table describes some approaches that can be used to refine a nurses\u2019s interactions with children and, at the same time, model effective communication skills for family members.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\nAge and Stage\n"}, {"score": 2169.4155, "uuid": "a7c0e881-9a62-588e-a4eb-be582aab0fa9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-97-24540", "target_hostname": "www.ems-ceu.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ems-ceu.com/courses/282/index_pt.html", "page_rank": 1.2055575e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Pain</em> Management <em>for</em> Oregon Health Professionals | <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> Continuing", "snippet": "People seek <em>chiropractic</em> care primarily <em>for</em> <em>pain</em> conditions such as <em>back</em> <em>pain</em>, neck <em>pain</em>, and headache.

Pain tells us something is wrong in the structure or function of our body and that we need to do something about it. Because pain is such a strong motivator for action, it is considered one of the body\u2019s most important protective mechanisms.\nDefinitions of Pain\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defined pain as \u201can unpleasant, subjective, sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\u201d (1979). Pain, however, is much more than a physical sensation caused by a single entity. It is subjective and highly individual, a complex mechanism with physical, emotional, and cognitive components.\nPain cannot be objectively measured in the same way as, for example, the chemical content of urine or the oxygen content level of blood. Only the person who is suffering knows how the experience feels. For these reasons, McCaffery defined pain as \u201cwhatever the experiencing person says it is and whenever he says it does\u201d (1979). The American Pain Society goes further by stating that it is \u201cnot the responsibility of clients to prove they are in pain; it is the nurse\u2019s responsibility to accept the client\u2019s report of pain\u201d (2005).\nPain alters the quality of life more than any other health-related problem. It interferes with sleep, mobility, nutrition, thought, sexual activity, emotional well-being, creativity, and self-actualization. Surprisingly, even though pain is such an important obstacle to comfort, it is one of the least understood, most undertreated, and oft-discounted problems of healthcare providers and their clients. For this reason, some nurses and therapists add comfort to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of basic human needs (1968). The American Pain Society goes further, declaring the relief of pain a \u201cbasic human right\u201d (2005).\nTraditionally, pain was considered merely a physical symptom of illness or injury, a simple stimulus-response mechanism. Though the historic role of nurses and therapists has been to relieve pain and suffering, there has been little understanding of the complexity of pain and only limited ways to manage it. Recent research shows pain to be a distinct disorder, with physical, emotional, and cognitive components. This view of pain has broadened our understanding of pain and given us new ways to understand its characteristics.\nPAIN-RELATED TERMINOLOGY\nAlgesia: Sensitivity to pain.\nBreakthrough pain: Transitory increase in pain to a level greater than the client\u2019s well-controlled baseline level (McCaffery & Pasero, 2003).\nHyperalgesia: Excessive sensitivity to pain.\nIdiopathic pain: Chronic pain for which there is no identifiable psychological or physical cause.\nIntractable pain: Pain that is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, and nursing measures (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nPain threshold: Amount of pain required before individuals feel the pain. The lower the threshold, the less pain they can endure; the higher the threshold, the more pain they can endure.\nPain tolerance: Maximum amount and duration of pain a person can endure. Tolerance varies widely among people and is influenced by emotions and cultural background.\nPain syndrome: A group of symptoms of which pain is the critical element, such as headaches and post-herpetic neuralgia.\nPhantom limb pain: Pain that occurs in a limb after it is removed or as a result of severe damage to the affected nerve plexus due to perceptual disruption in the brain.\nPsychogenic pain: Chronic pain with no identified organic explanation.\nRadiating pain: Pain that begins at one place and extends out into nearby tissues.\nReferred pain: Pain that is felt at a different location than where tissue was damaged. This phenomenon occurs because pain fibers in the damaged area synapse near fibers from other areas of the body; for example, a myocardial infarction may create referred pain in the left shoulder.\nTypes of Pain\nPain is classified as acute and chronic. Acute pain has an identifiable cause and occurs soon after an injury to tissues in the body, such as bone, skin, or muscle. Acute pain is protective in that it motivates a person to take action. Its onset may be sudden or slow, and its intensity may vary from mild to severe. Acute pain is temporary and subsides as healing takes place. Severe acute pain activates the sympathetic nervous system, causing diaphoresis, increased respiratory and pulse rates, and elevated blood pressure.\nChronic pain lasts beyond an expected healing phase, is non-protective in that it serves no function, and may not have an identifiable cause (Patterson, 2007). When pain goes on more than 6 months, it moves from being a \u201csymptom\u201d to a \u201ccondition.\u201d Chronic pain afflicts more than 1 in 5 Americans and is one of the most pervasive and thorny medical conditions in the United States. Such pain is described as nonmalignant (noncancerous), malignant (cancerous), and intractable.\nNonmalignant, noncancerous chronic pain typically accompanies such conditions as osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathy. The lack of purpose and uncertainty of duration of such pain may lead to depression, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, apathy, learned helplessness, and other psychosocial consequences. If it is severe, chronic pain\u2014like prolonged stress\u2014activates the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in muscle tension, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and failure of body defenses.\nMalignant, cancerous chronic pain may be due to tumor progression, invasive procedures, infection, toxicities of treatment, and physical limitations. Such pain may be felt at the tumor site or some distance from it. Since clients with cancer may experience both chronic and acute pain, caregivers need to investigate immediately any new pain in these clients.\nIntractable chronic pain is pain from any cause that is resistant to medical, surgical, and nursing measures. Persistent and ongoing, intractable chronic pain may be psychogenic in nature (Mosby\u2019s Dictionary, 2009).\nSources of Pain\nThe sources of pain are divided into three main categories: nociceptor, non-nociceptor, and psychogenic.\nNociceptor pain results when tissue damage produces a pain-producing stimulus that sends an electrical impulse across a pain receptor (nociceptor) by way of a nerve fiber to the central nervous system. Nociceptor pain is further divided into visceral and somatic pain.\nVisceral pain results from stimulation of nociceptors in the abdominal cavity and thorax.\nSomatic pain is divided into deep somatic and cutaneous pain. Deep somatic pain arises from bones, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. Cutaneous pain originates in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Some body tissues, such as the brain and lung, have no nociceptors, and some tissues have many.\nNon-nociceptor (neuropathic) pain is caused by direct injury to structures of the nervous system.\nPsychogenic pain is pain for which there is little or no physical evidence of organic disease or identified injury to tissues in the body. Lack of evidence, however, does not mean clients are malingering or that they are not suffering.\nPHYSIOLOGIC SOURCES OF PAIN\nSource: Adapted with permission from Ignatavicius et al., 1999.\nNociceptor: Visceral\nOrgans and linings of body cavities\nMechanism\nPoorly localized, diffuse, deep, cramping or splitting\nSources of acute pain\nChest tubes, abdominal tube drains, bladder and intestinal distention\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nPancreatitis, liver metastases, colitis\nCutaneous: skin and sub-cutaneous tissues\nDeep somatic: blood, muscle, blood vessels, connective tissue\nMechanism\nIncisional pain, insertion sites of tubes and drains, wound complications, orthopedic procedures, skeletal muscle spasms\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nBony metastases, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low-back pain, peripheral vascular disease\nNon-nociceptor: Neuropathic\nNerve fibers, spinal cord, and central nervous system\nMechanism\nNon-nociceptive injury to nervous system structures\nCharacteristics\nGeneralized along distribution of damaged nervous structures\nSources of acute pain\nPoorly localized: shooting, burning, fiery, shock-like, sharp, painful numbness\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNervous tissue injury due to diabetes, HIV, chemotherapy, neuropathies, postherpetic neuralgia, trauma, surgery\nPsychogenic\nSources of chronic pain syndromes\nNonorganic psychological factors\nPhysiology of Pain\nThough a person is not consciously aware of the process, the experience of pain involves a complex sequence of biochemical and electrical events or processes beginning with tissue damage and followed by transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation.\nTISSUE DAMAGE\nWhen tissue is damaged, there is an immediate release of inflammatory chemicals called excitatory neurotransmitters, such as histamine and bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator. Increased blood in the area causes the injured area to swell, redden, and become tender. The bradykinin stimulates the release of prostaglandins and substance P, a potent neurotransmitter that enhances the movement of impulses across nerve synapses.\nTRANSDUCTION AND TRANSMISSION\nTransduction occurs as the energy of the stimulus is converted to electrical energy. Transmission of the stimulus takes place when this energy crosses into a nociceptor at the end of an afferent nerve fiber. Two types of peripheral nerve fibers conduct painful stimuli: the fast, myelinated A-delta fibers and the very small, slow, unmyelinated C-fibers. A-fibers send sharp, distinct sensations that localize the source of the pain and detect its intensity. C-fibers relay impulses that are poorly localized, burning, and persistent. For example, after burning a finger, a person initially feels a sharp localized pain as a result of A-fiber transmission. Within a few seconds the pain becomes more diffuse and widespread as a result of C-fiber transmission.\nPain stimuli travel quickly to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where the \u201cgating\u201d mechanism (discussed below) occurs. Pain impulses then cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and ascend to the higher centers in the brain via the spinothalamic tracts and on to the thalamus and higher centers of the brain, including the reticular formation, limbic system, and somatosensory cortex.\nNeurologic transmission of pain stimuli. (Illustration by Jason McAlexander. \u00a9 2005, Wild Iris Medical Education.\nPERCEPTION\nWhen pain stimuli reach the cerebral cortex, the brain interprets the signal; processes information from experiences, knowledge, and cultural associations; and perceives pain. Thus, perception is the awareness of pain. The somatosensory cortex identifies the location and intensity of pain, and the associated cortex determines how an individual interprets its meaning.\nMODULATION\nOnce the brain perceives the pain, the body releases neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalins), serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma aminobutyric acid. These chemicals hinder the transmission of pain and help produce an analgesic, pain-relieving effect. This inhibition of the pain impulse is called modulation. The descending paths of the efferent fibers extend from the cortex down to the spinal cord and may influence pain impulses at the level of the spinal cord.\nGATE-CONTROL THEORY\nMelzack and Wall proposed the gate-control theory to explain the relationship between pain and the emotions (1982). According to the theory, a gating mechanism occurs when a pain impulse travels to the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. There, trigger (T) cells influence the transmission of pain impulses. When their activity is inhibited, the gate closes and impulses are less likely to be transmitted to the brain. This mechanism is controlled by descending nerve fibers from the thalamus and cerebral cortex, areas of the brain that regulate thought and emotions. The gate-control theory helps explain how thoughts and emotions modify the perception of pain and why interventions, such as imagery and distraction, help relieve it.\nFactors That Influence Pain\nThe perception of pain is influenced by physiologic, psychological, and cultural factors, all of which caregivers need to consider.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS\nAge\nAge affects the way people respond to pain. It influences both the development and decline of the nervous system. Aging affects the whole body, causing many painful degenerative disorders (such as osteoarthritis), secondary injuries (such as skin abrasions and fractures), and a host of common surgical procedures (such as cataract and hip replacement). Age also affects the way families and caregivers respond to complaints of pain. The following table gives a brief overview of the perception of pain relative to age. (The management of pain in children and older adults will be discussed in greater depth later in this course.)\nAGE AND THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN\nAge\nPain Perception\nPre-term infants\nHave anatomical and functional ability to process pain by mid to late gestation; seem to have greater sensitivity to pain than term infants or children\nNewborn infants\nResponse to pain is inborn and does not require prior learning; respond to pain with behaviors such as crying, grimacing, moving body\nInfants, 1 month\nCan metabolize analgesics and anesthesia effectively; can recognize caregiver as comforter\nToddlers/Preschoolers\nCan describe pain, its location and intensity; respond to pain by crying, anger, sadness; may consider pain a punishment; may hold someone accountable for pain and remember experiences in a certain location, such as a clinic\nSchool-age children\nMay try to be brave when facing a painful procedure; may regress to an earlier stage of development; seek understanding of reasons for pain\nAdolescents\nMay be slow to acknowledge pain; may consider showing signs of pain a weakness; may regress to earlier stages of development with persistent pain\nAdults\u00c2\nFear of pain may prevent some from seeking care; may believe admission of pain is a weakness and inappropriate for age or sex; may consider pain a punishment for moral failure\nOlder adults\nMay have decreased sensations or perceptions of pain; may consider pain an inevitable part of aging; chronic pain may produce anorexia, lethargy, depression; may not report pain due to fear of expense, possible treatment, dependency; often describe pain in nonmedical terms such as \u201churt\u201d or \u201cache\u201d; may fear addiction to analgesics; may not want to bother nurses or be a \u201cbad patient\u201d\nFatigue\nFatigue decreases coping abilities and heightens the perception of pain. When people are exhausted from physical activity, stress, and lack of sleep, their perception of pain may be heightened and their coping skills diminished. Thus, sleep and rest from physical, emotional, and social demands are important measures to manage pain more effectively.\nGenetic Makeup\nRecent research suggests that sensitivity to and tolerance for pain may a genetically linked trait (Ruda et al., 2000). This finding does not negate the need to manage pain adequately, regardless of inherited traits.\nMemory\nMemory of painful experiences, especially experiences that occurred as a very young child, may increase sensitivity and decrease tolerance to pain. For example, even young children remember the pain of an immunization at the doctor\u2019s office and henceforth may be afraid to visit the doctor again.\nStress Response\nResearch has shown that \u201csevere, unrelieved pain can cause an overwhelming stress response in both pre-term and full-term infants which can lead to serious complications and even death\u201d (Pasero, 2004). In recent years, post-traumatic stress syndrome has been the subject of extensive research, both as to its cause and its treatment (Hamilton, 2008).\nHealing\nRecent research suggests that unrelieved acute pain slows postoperative wound healing (McGuire, 2006). This evidence is not surprising, given our increasing knowledge of the effect of stress on the human body.\nNeurologic Function\nAny factor that interrupts or interferes with normal pain transmission affects the awareness and response of clients to pain and places them at risk for injury. Analgesics, sedatives, and alcohol depress the functioning of the central nervous system. Some diseases, such as leprosy, damage peripheral nerves, decrease sensitivity to touch and pain, and render sufferers more vulnerable to injury.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS\nFear and Anxiety\nThe relationship between pain and fear is convoluted and complex. Fear tends to increase the perception of pain, and pain increases feelings of fear and anxiety. This connection occurs in the brain because painful stimuli activate portions of the limbic system believed to control emotional reactions. People who are seriously injured or critically ill often experience both pain and heightened levels of anxiety due to their feelings of helplessness and lack of control. Caregivers need to address both pain and anxiety and use all appropriate measures to relieve suffering.\nCoping\nPeople manage pain and other stressors of life in different ways. Some see themselves as self-sufficient, internally controlled, and independent. As a result, they may deny pain or be slow to admit they are suffering. Others see themselves as insufficient, externally controlled, and dependent on others to treat their pain. Self-sufficient, internally controlled people may do better with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), whereas dependent, externally controlled individuals may prefer nurse-administered analgesia. No matter what the coping style, it is the responsibility of caregivers to relieve pain.\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nCultural beliefs and values affect the way people respond to pain. As children they learn what is and what is not acceptable behavior when experiencing pain. In some cultures, any expression of pain is considered cowardly and shameful. In others, noisy demonstrations of pain are expected and acceptable. The meaning of pain itself may be markedly different in different cultures. Some ethnic groups see pain as a punishment for wrongdoing. Others see pain as a test of faith. And still others view pain as a challenge to be overcome. Recent immigrants to America are more likely to view pain from their cultural roots. Regardless of an individual\u2019s language, religion, or situation, nurses and therapists respect every person and strive to alleviate pain and suffering.\nSTANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nBecause pain management is so important to the provision of quality healthcare, many organizations have developed standards by which professional practice is measured. Two such organizations are the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\nJoint Commission\nThe Joint Commission is an independent organization that accredits and certifies more than 17,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the United States. It evaluates how well these healthcare providers meet published standards of care, including their management of pain. The federal government accepts Joint Commission\u2013accredited facilities as qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.\nRegarding pain management, the Joint Commission Resources states:\nEach and every patient has a right to the assessment and management of pain. Hospitals must develop policies and procedures which address the organization\u2019s expectations of pain management in support of their mission and philosophy of care. Patients and their families also need education regarding their role in pain management. Developing a comprehensive and coordinated pain management program can be made easier by accessing good practices. From policies and procedures for the different types of pain (acute, chronic, etc.) to training assistants (including pre- and post-tests) to assessment tools, good practices can assist your organization to provide a comprehensive approach to pain management that meets the intent of the standards and, at the same time, achieves positive outcomes for patient (Joint Commission Resources, Inc., 2009).\nThe JCAHO Standards of Pain Management are listed below.\nJCAHO STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT\nTo meet the Joint Commission standards, accredited facilities must have policies in place to meet the following requirements:\nRecognize patients\u2019 rights to assessment and management of pain.\nAssess the nature and intensity of pain in all patients.\nEstablish safe medication, prescription, and ordering procedures.\nEnsure competency and orient new staff in pain assessment and management.\nMonitor patients post-procedure and reassess patient problems appropriately.\nEducate patients on the role of pain management in treatment.\nAddress patients\u2019 needs for symptom management in the discharge planning process.\nCollect data to monitor performance.\nSource: Partners against Pain, 2007.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics is a professional organization dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. As such, its committees develop guidelines, positions, and programs to support the mission of the organization. The AAP guidelines for pain management conclude with the strategies listed below.\nAAP GUIDELINES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on the assessment and management of acute pain in infants, children, and adolescents concludes with the following recommended strategies:\nExpand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric pain management principles and techniques.\nProvide a calm environment for procedures in order to reduce distress-producing stimulation.\nUse appropriate pain assessment tools and techniques.\nAnticipate predictable painful experiences; intervene, and monitor accordingly.\nUse a multimodal (pharmacologic, cognitive behavioral, and physical) approach to pain management and use a multidisciplinary approach when possible.\nInvolve families and tailor interventions to the individual child.\nAdvocate for child-specific research in pain management and Food and Drug Administration evaluation of analgesics for children.\nAdvocate for the effective use of pain medication for children to ensure compassionate and competent management of pain.\nSource: American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001.\nPAIN AND THE NURSING PROCESS\nThe nursing process includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation. To manage pain responsibly, nurses use each step of the nursing process.\nBasic to every strategy for managing pain is showing respect for the validity of a client\u2019s experience of pain. To communicate respect, nurses:\nAcknowledge pain and take action to manage it.\nGive accurate information to reduce anxiety and facilitate relief of pain.\nReduce environmental stressors that add to the experience of pain.\nEncourage disclosure of feelings and fears.\nProvide privacy and maintain confidentiality.\nAssessing Pain\nPain is a red flag. It tells us there is a problem somewhere in the body that is crying out for attention. In fact, pain is such an important indicator of health, its assessment has been called the \u201cfifth vital sign,\u201d joining temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. Even so, until we know more about a specific pain, we cannot fix it. To do this, nurses and therapists must gather information from as many sources as possible, especially the primary source, the person in pain. This investigation includes obtaining a comprehensive pain history, making observations of behaviors, performing an appropriate physical examination, and consulting with other healthcare professionals.\nPAIN HISTORY\nA pain history is obtained from written documents and from interviews with the person in pain, family members, and other caregivers. It asks specific questions about the location, intensity, quality, and history of the pain, as shown in the following box. In some facilities these questions are printed on an assessment form, with space for answers to be recorded beside each question. Later sections of this course discuss the assessment of pain in children and special populations.\nOBTAINING A PAIN HISTORY\nLocation: Where is your pain? Ask client to point to the area of pain.\nIntensity: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, how much pain would you say you are experiencing? If your pain were a temperature, how cold or hot would it be (warm, hot, blistering)? If your pain were a sound, how loud would it be (silent, quiet, strident, booming)?\nQuality: In your own words, tell me what your pain feels like. (worms under the skin, shooting, needle pricking, tingling, etc.).\nChronology/pattern: When did the pain start? Does your pain come and go? How often? How long does it last?\nPrecipitating factors: What triggers the pain, or what makes it worse?\nAlleviating factors: What measures have you found that lessen or relieve the pain? What pain medications do you use? How much and how often?\nAssociated symptoms: Do you have other symptoms before, during, or after your pain begins (dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and shortness of breath)?\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS\nMost people who suffer pain usually show it either by verbal complaint or nonverbal behaviors. The following table lists some typical behaviors nurses may observe when they assess people in pain.\nNONVERBAL BEHAVIORS INDICATING PAIN\nWidely opened eyes or mouth\nCrying\nFocus on pain relief measures\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nWhen clients complain of pain or show it by their behavior, health professionals need to take action to find the cause. Assessment is most effective if the pain history interview and behavioral observations are conducted at the same time as the physical examination. For example, if a client complains of acute pain on the sole of a foot, the nurse or therapist visually examines the foot for unusual signs, observes the person for behavioral cues of pain, and asks about the onset, intensity, quality, and pattern of the pain and what makes it worse or better. If the cause is not identified immediately, the client is referred for further assessment.\nDiagnosing Pain\nAn accurate diagnosis depends on an appropriate assessment that focuses on the exact nature of the pain. The more specific the diagnosis, the more effective interventions can be. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has identified two primary diagnoses for pain: acute and chronic. A complete nursing diagnosis, however, goes further. After identifying whether the pain is acute or chronic, it adds \u201crelated to\u201d the medical diagnosis. For example, \u201cchronic pain related to osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d Then, it adds \u201cmanifested by\u201d and lists the various symptoms experienced by the client or signs confirmed by objective data. Thus, a complete diagnosis might be \u201cchronic pain, related to osteoarthritis, manifested by stabbing pain in the left hip with weight-bearing.\u201d\nThe advantage of clear, specific information is that it leads to more effective interventions. In this case, an appropriate intervention might be an assistive devise such as a cane or walker and referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.\nPlanning and Goal Setting\nDuring the planning stage, nurses and therapists synthesize information from many sources and, together with the physician, plan appropriate interventions. The goal of these interventions is to relieve pain and facilitate the highest possible level of functioning. Practically speaking, this means identifying what activity the pain is preventing and the best way to achieve a return of function. For the client described above with chronic hip pain, the activity the pain is preventing is mobility.\nPlanning interventions means working in partnership with clients and physicians to provide specific measures to manage the pain. These interventions may be independent or collaborative. Independent nursing actions fall within the scope of nursing practice and include controlling the environment, giving emotional support, and providing comfort. Collaborative nursing actions involve cooperative interventions with other members of the healthcare team, such as physical therapists, pharmacists, and physicians.\nGoal setting involves the identification of attainable objectives and reasonable priorities. Because every person is different, the nurse or therapist discusses various alternatives with the client, and together they set priorities. For example, after consulting an orthopedic surgeon, the person with osteoarthritis may decide to delay hip replacement surgery and maintain mobility as long as possible with the aid of a cane and analgesics for pain.\nInterventions\nPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nThere are two primary groups of pain medications: nonopioids and opioids. A third group of drugs called adjuvants or co-analgesics address symptoms that often accompany pain, such as insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasm, anorexia, and depression.\nNonopioid Analgesics\nNonopioid analgesics relieve pain by acting on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site to decrease the level of inflammatory mediators. This group of analgesics includes drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and ibuprofen (Motrin). The specific actions and dosages of these analgesics vary. Generally speaking, however, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects and are useful for mild to moderate pain.\nWith the exception of acetaminophen, most nonopioids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs are especially effective when the primary cause of pain is inflammation, as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and bone cancer. When tissue is damaged, a series of biochemical events leads to the release of prostaglandin, which causes edema, inflammation, and pain. Two isoenzymes\u2014cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)\u2014play an important part in this biochemical process. Drugs that inhibit their action, especially that of COX-2, reduce prostaglandin production and the inflammation it creates. However, these drugs must be used with caution because the safety of long-term use has not been verified. The following table lists some common nonopioid analgesics.\nCOMMON NONOPIOID ANALGESICS\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis; lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs\nAspirin\n650\u2013975 mg q 4 hr\nUsed for headaches, osteoarthritis, general pain; antipyretic; inhibits platelet aggregation, causing bleeding\nIbuprofen (Motrin)\n400 mg q 4\u20136 hr\nUsed for osteoarthritis; antipyretic; multiple brand names; available as liquid\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nUsed for gout; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic\nNaproxen (Naprosyn)\n500 mg initial dose, then 250 mg q 6\u20138 hr\nUsed for gout, headaches; anti-inflammatory; anti-rheumatic; available in liquid preparation\nOpioid Analgesics\nOpioid (narcotic, CNS-acting) analgesics are derivatives of opium and include such drugs as morphine, codeine, and methadone. These drugs modify the perception of pain and provide a sense of euphoria by binding to specific opiate receptors throughout the central nervous system. Opiate receptors have various names, typically denoted by Greek letters such as mu (\u03bc), kappa (\u03ba), and sigma (\u03c3). Many of the characteristics of particular opioids relate to the receptor to which they bind. For example, morphine binds to m receptors and follow m receptor control.\nOpioid analgesics are classified as full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed agonist-antagonists. Full agonists bind to \u03bc receptor sites, block pain impulses, and produce maximum pain control\u2014an \u201cagonist effect.\u201d Full agonists include such drugs as morphine (Kadian, Avinza, Rylomine intranasal), meperidine (Demerol), fentanyl (Duragesic patch, Fentanyl oralets), oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), and hydromorphine (Dilaudid).\nPartial agonists produce a lesser response than full agonists and include such drugs as buprenorphine (Buprenex) and nalbuphine (Nubain). Mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics include such drugs as pentazocine hydrochloride (Talwin) and butorphanol tartrate (Stadol). An antagonist is a drug that competes with opioid receptor sites. Naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) is such a drug. It is used for opioid overdoses and physical dependency.\nThe primary action of opioids (narcotics) is to alleviate moderate to severe pain. Many of the unwanted effects of this class of drugs are related to their actions on systems of the body other than the central nervous system (CNS), causing such effects as constipation and respiratory depression. The following table lists some common opioid side effects and preventative measures.\nOPIOID ADVERSE EFFECTS AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nBody System\nMonitor blood pressure and heart rate\nCNS\nSedation, disorientation, euphoria, dysphoria, light-headedness, lower seizure threshold, tremors\nInform client that tolerance may develop over 3\u20135 days; administer stimulants as needed\nGastrointestinal\nOffer anti-emetic; change analgesic; increase fluid and fiber intake; increase exercise; administer laxatives\nGenitourinary\nCatheterize as needed; administer opioid antagonist\nIntegumentary\nApply cool packs or lotion; administer antihistamine\nRespiratory\nRespiratory depression; aggravation of asthma\nMonitor respirations closely; administer opioid antagonist such as naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan)\nSome medications combine nonopioid with opioid analgesics in one tablet to offer two different levels of pain relief\u2014acting both on peripheral nerve endings at the injury site and at the level of the central nervous system. Acetaminophen with codeine is such a medication.\nDrug Tolerance and Dependence\nDrug tolerance is a physiologic condition in which humans require larger and larger doses of drugs to provide the same effect as provided by the original dose. The first sign of tolerance is a decrease in the duration of the analgesic effect. This condition is followed by a decrease in total analgesic effect. Decreasing the time between doses or increasing the dosage may help overcome tolerance. Even so, drug tolerance is not the only reason drugs become less effective. They may be less effective because there is advancing tissue damage, thus greater pain.\nPseudotolerance is the need to increase opioid dosage for reasons other than the physical adaptation of continuous use. These other needs include drug-to-drug interaction, drug-to-food interaction, increased physical activity, psychological dependence (addiction), and changes in opioid formulation.\nPhysical dependence is a physiologic adaptation of tissues to the drug. If a person who is physically dependent on opioids abruptly stops using them, withdrawal symptoms occur. These symptoms result from an autonomic nervous system response and may include excessive yawning, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, tachycardia, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, delirium, and convulsions. When opioid analgesics are to be discontinued, physical withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or eliminated by a slow reduction of dose.\nPsychological dependence (addiction) is the compulsive use of a substance characterized by a continuous craving for a drug\u2019s nonanalgesic emotional effects. Opioids (narcotics) with an affinity for both m and s receptor sites produce euphoria and hallucinations. Thus, these drugs are the most frequently abused opioids. When people take opioids to relieve pain, tolerance and physical dependence may occur, but addiction will not necessarily follow. Psychological dependence is far more complex and involves emotional, social, and cultural issues. (Pain management in clients with addictive disease is discussed further later in this course.)\nPseudoaddiction is a term used to describe people who, because of severe, unrelieved pain, focus on finding relief. As a consequence, they seem preoccupied with obtaining opioids. This preoccupation is not truly \u201cdrug-seeking\u201d but \u201crelief-seeking.\u201d Their quest for opioids is directly related to inadequate pain relief caused by an inappropriate opioid or inadequate doses spaced too far apart.\nAdjuvant Analgesics\nAdjuvant analgesics (co-analgesics) are drugs that were developed for uses other than pain but have been found to enhance the effects of analgesics. Caregivers need to remember that these are \u201chelper drugs,\u201d not substitutes for analgesics. Clients in pain still need analgesics. The following table describes some common adjuvant analgesics.\nCOMMON ADJUVANT (CO-ANALGESIC) DRUGS\nAntidepressants: Tricyclics and serotonin, reuptake inhibitors\nBurning, neuropathic pain; improves sleep, enhances mood and analgesic effects\nAnti-epileptic drugs\nNeuralgic and neuropathic pain (sharp, prickling, shooting pain)\nAntispasmodic\nAnxiolytic drugs: Benzodiazepines, buspirone, venlafaxine\nAnxiety and sedation\nNeuralgic pain and diabetic neuropathic pain\nPsychostimulants\nOffsets sedating side effects and enhances analgesic effects of opioids\nSteroids\nInflammatory and chronic pain of cancer, malignant spinal cord compression, headaches, and arthritis\nPlacebos\nA placebo is a \u201csugar pill,\u201d an inactive substance prescribed as if it were an effective dose of a medication. Research has found that placebos produce hoped-for results in 30% to 50% of the people who take them (Thompson, 2000). This so-called \u201cplacebo effect\u201d has been exploited for centuries by hucksters and charlatans who sell tonics, treatments, and gadgets to people in pain. Because their purpose is to deceive and strip clients of the right to make informed decisions, legitimate medical practice does not use placebos. Such acts violate the ethical principles of honesty and autonomy. The only exception to this prohibition is when subjects give prior consent for the possible use of placebos in research studies.\nWorld Health Organization Pain Management Ladder\nBecause of widespread misconceptions about treatment of chronic pain and addiction, in 1990 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a three-step pain management ladder based on the intensity of pain.\nMild pain (intensity 1\u20133 on the 0\u201310 standard): Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nMild to moderate pain (intensity 4\u20136): Use combination medications such as oxycodone and acetaminophen and adjuvants. If pain persists, then\nModerate to severe pain (intensity 7\u201310): Use potent opioids such as morphine, fentanylm methadone, and adjuvants.\nTo prevent undertreatment of malignant cancer pain, some authorities recommend a different approach. They begin the treatment of malignant cancer pain with strong opioids, providing immediate relief, then slowly reduce the type and dosage until pain relief is achieved at the lower level (Jackson & Stanford, 2003).\nRoutes of Administration\nAnalgesics can be administered by many routes. Each has advantages and disadvantages as well as indications and contraindications. The overriding considerations are effectiveness and safety. The table below lists some of the most common routes for the administration of analgesic drugs.\nANALGESIC DRUG ADMINISTRATION\nContraindications\nOral (per os = PO)\nPreferred route due to lower cost and convenience; may be prepared as powders, capsules, tablets, liquids, or lozenges\nGastrointestinal irritation; inability to swallow; need for more potent analgesic\nRectal (R)\nInability to take oral drugs; can be self-administered; longer duration than oral\nAnal or rectal lesions, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia\nIntramuscular (IM)\nNeed for prolonged pain relief; absorption may be poor; possible muscle or nerve damage; costly\nIntravenous (IV) bolus\nOffers most rapid pain relief (5\u201315 min) but lasts less than 60 min\nRequires IV access; gives only brief pain relief when prolonged relief is needed\nContinuous intravenous (IV) infusion\nGives constant opioid blood level when other methods are ineffective\nRequires infusion pumps with alarms and close monitoring\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA)\nAllows predetermined IV bolus of analgesic when client desires pain relief\nRequires IV access, client cooperation, close supervision; does not give continuous pain relief\nSubcutaneous (SC) opioid infusion\nContinuous, prolonged parenteral opioids when IV not possible; allows home use\nRequires site change every 7 days of 27-gauge butterfly needle; potential site irritation\nIntraspinal (neuraxial), intrathecal, epidural, subarachnoid, intraventricular\nLabor contractions; also intractable pain when client cannot tolerate systemic opioids by other routes\nRequires expert insertion of catheter into intended space; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nRegional nerve blocks\nContinuous or single dose analgesic for acute and chronic pain; used for trauma, burns, and labor\nRequires expert insertion of catheter to specific nerve root; attached to infusion pump or implanted reservoir; high risk for infection or dislodgment\nTopical (cream-laden anesthetic)\nAnalgesic for needle sticks, venipuncture, dermatitis, and insect stings\nMust be applied 30\u201360 min in advance of need\nTransdermal skin patch\nContinuous dose of opioid; allows home use\nCostly; when body temperature is over 102\u00b0F, absorption is accelerated\nNasal sprays\nAlternative to IV, IM, and oral opioid administration; rapid onset of action\nNasal exudates or mucosal swelling may prevent consistent absorption\nPrinciples for the Use of Analgesics\nTo guide caregivers, the American Pain Society (2005) identifies thirteen principles regarding the use of analgesics to control pain:\nIndividualize the route, dosage, and schedule of analgesics medications.\nAdminister analgesics on a regular basis if pain is present most of the day.\nKnow the dose and time course of several opioid analgesic preparations:\nAsk client about prior experience with certain drugs.\nGive preference to long-acting, sustained-release opioids such as OxyContin, which provides up to 12 hours of analgesia; Kadian and Avinza, controlled-release morphine preparations which provide up to 24 hours of pain relief; and transdermal fentanyl, which provides up to 3 days of pain relief.\nAvoid the adverse effects of emesis by giving anti-emetics.\nRotate opioids to compensate for tolerance.\nUse rapid-onset opioids when necessary.\nUse concentrated dosage forms when injection volume must be minimized.\nGive infants and children adequate opioid doses.\nFollow clients closely, particularly when beginning or changing analgesics.\nWhen changing to a new opioid or a different route, first use equianalgesic doses to estimate the new dose. Then, modify the estimate, based on the clinical situation and the specific drug.\nRecognize and treat side effects, such as sedation, constipation, nausea, itching, respiratory depression, by doing the following:\nChange the dose or route of the same drug to maintain constant blood levels.\nTry different opioids analgesics.\nConsider multi-drug and multi-modal therapy.\nAdd another drug that counteracts the adverse effects, such as a stimulant for sedation.\nUse an administration route that minimizes drug concentrations at the site producing the side effect, such as intraspinal instead of oral when appropriate.\nDo not use meperidine (Demerol) because of neurotoxicity risk or mixed agonist-antagonists (Talwin) because of psychotomimetic effects.\nDo not use placebos to assess the nature of pain.\nMonitor for the development of tolerance and treat appropriately. Increased pain may be due to progressive disease, new pathology, skipped doses, or other causes.\nExpect physical dependence and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nDo not diagnose patients as \u201copioid addicted\u201d solely because of opioid dependence.\nBe alert to the psychological state of the client.\nNONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nAlthough there are myriad drugs to relieve pain, all have some risk and cost. Fortunately, there are many nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce pain, especially when used in conjunction with pharmacologic measures. Described as physical and cognitive-behavioral interventions, many of these approaches are noninvasive, low-risk, inexpensive, easily performed and taught, and within the scope of nursing practice. Physical interventions give comfort, increase mobility, and alter physiologic responses. Cognitive-behavioral interventions alter the perception of pain, reduce fear, give a greater sense of control, and are considered holistic nursing practice.\nPhysical Interventions\nComfort measures such as clean and smooth sheets, soft and supportive pillows, warm blankets, and a soothing environment have been used by nurses throughout history to relieve pain and suffering. These measures may be difficult to provide in the noisy, mechanized healthcare facilities of today. Nonetheless, they are important to the mental and physical well-being of patients.\nPosition change and movement are well-known pain-relieving interventions. Moving the body, even a small amount, relieves muscle spasm and provides a degree of pain relief. So important is movement of the body to health, an entire profession has developed specializing in physical therapy. However, nurses need not wait for a specialist to offer these important pain-relieving interventions.\nMassage relieves muscle spasm, improves circulation, and provides cutaneous stimulation. While there are many different massage techniques, they all involve rubbing the skin in various patterns and degrees of pressure. Once considered an expected part of basic nursing care, backrubs offer an important noninvasive way to relieve pain and provide comfort.\nApplications of hot and cold are effective pain-relieving measures when used appropriately. Heat decreases muscle spasm and increases blood flow to an area. Cold decreases blood flow, edema, and inflammation and may decrease muscle spasm and pain. Many devices are available to provide hot and cold, including electric heating pads, patches, and ice packs. Soaks and baths relieve muscle spasm and are an important means of providing comfort.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) provides a continuous, mild electric current via 2 to 4 electrodes placed on the skin near a painful site. The stimulator is a small, battery-operated devise worn by the client. Experienced as a tingling sensation, TENS works by stimulating large nerve fibers to close the \u201cgate\u201d in the spinal cord. It also may stimulate endorphin production. TENS may be used for acute postoperative pain or for chronic conditions such as low back pain, phantom limb pain, and neuralgia.\nSurgical interventions may be recommended when severe pain persists despite medical treatment. If pain is due to a known condition, such as osteoarthritis of a joint, joint replacement surgery may be offered. When specific interventions are not available and conservative measures do not relieve pain, surgical interruption of pain pathways may be undertaken. Rhizotomy and cordotomy are two such procedures. In a rhizotomy the surgeon destroys dorsal posterior nerve roots as they enter the spinal cord, either by delivering neurolytic chemicals, heat, or extreme cold by way of a catheter or by performing a laminectomy, isolating the nerve roots, and directly destroying the nerve. A chordotomy is more extensive than a rhizotomy, involving resection of the spinothalamic tract. Both procedures cause permanent loss of pain and thermal sensations, however they may also cause paralysis due to motor nerve damage.\nCognitive-Behavioral Interventions\nRelaxation exercises are useful ways to reduce anxiety, decrease muscle tension, and lower blood pressure and heart rate. They induce a state of altered consciousness and give individuals a sense of control and peace of mind. Meditation, yoga, and other such interventions may effectively relieve pain. One such exercise involves controlled breathing. A coach speaks in a calm, clear voice, suggesting the subject begin by breathing slowly and diaphragmatically, allowing the abdomen to rise slowly and the chest to expand fully. Then, the coach suggests the subject locate an area of muscle tension, contract the muscles in that area, and then relax them. As the subject relaxes, pain perception and anxiety diminish.\nGuided imagery is similar to relaxation exercises in that a coach leads subjects in a calm, clear voice, often beginning with a relaxation exercise. The coach then suggests subjects imagine themselves in some peaceful place where they experience various sensory pleasures such as the warmth of the sun, the sound of ocean waves, and the smell of salt water. The purpose of the exercise is to provide an experience of relaxation and relief from stress and pain.\nDistraction diverts the attention of individuals away from painful stimuli. When people focus on something that gives pleasure, they are less likely to feel acute pain. This phenomenon occurs because the reticular activating system briefly inhibits the awareness of pain. Distraction works best for short acute pain, such as a needle stick. Such things as listening to music, watching an intense scene on television, or describing something of special interest may temporarily distract a person from pain. Distraction, however, does not work for chronic, long-term pain.\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and other stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. It is displayed as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch these signals, they learn to control their responses.\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\nTo relieve their pain, an increasing number of people in the United States are also turning to theories and practices outside the realm of conventional Western medicine. In 1991, the federal government established the Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1998, the agency became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), making the center one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. NCCAM defines CAM as \u201ca group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not currently part of conventional medicine\u201d (NCCAM, 2009a).\nThe mission of NCCAM is to explore \u201ccomplementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science\u2026and [to] disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals\u201d (NCCAM, 2007). In this context, \u201ccomplementary\u201d describes practices used in conjunction with or to supplement conventional medical treatments, and \u201calternative\u201d means those that are used independently or in place of conventional medicine. Practitioners of such techniques and practices often use the term holistic because they view health and illness as affecting the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit.\nThe major categories of complementary and alternative medicine are:\nBiologic (herbal mixtures; macrobiotic diets; orthomolecular, such as megadoses of vitamins, magnesium, melatonin, etc.)\nEnergy fields (acupuncture, therapeutic touch, pulse fields, Reiki, etc.)\nManipulative and body-based (chiropractic, lymphatic drainage, reflexology, aromatherapy, deep-muscle massage, shiatsu, etc.)\nMind-body (biofeedback, hypnosis, art therapy, prayer, etc.) (Diluzio\u00c2\u00a0 & Spillane 2002)\nBiologic. Plants have been used to treat human ailments throughout history. Their therapeutic effects are due to the chemical compounds they contain. Such chemicals may be administered to patients by giving some part of a plant or by extracting or synthesizing the essential chemical. When prepared in a purified form, the dose is more precise than it can be from a plant. Some common active chemicals originally derived from plants are: digitaloid found in the foxglove plant (digitalis), saponins found in sarsaparilla (irritant laxatives), alkaloids found in nightshades (atropine), and alkaloids found in the opium poppy (morphine) (McGuigan & Krug, 1942).\nEnergy fields. Such healing measures are based on theories about unseen forces in the human body. Acupuncture, for instance, is based on an ancient Chinese theory that two opposing forces, yin and yang, move along meridians in the body. When these forces are out of balance, pain and illness result. There are at least 350 acupuncture points by which energy flows are accessible. The theory posits that by stimulating these points with very fine needles, the energy flow can be rebalanced and pain relieved (Mayo Clinic, 2009; NCCAM, 2009b).\nChiropractic is a healthcare approach that focuses on the relationship between the body\u2019s structure\u2014mainly the spine\u2014and its functioning. Although practitioners may use a variety of treatment approaches, they primarily perform adjustments to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems and supporting the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself. People seek chiropractic care primarily for pain conditions such as back pain, neck pain, and headache. Side effects and risks depend on the type of chiropractic treatment used. Ongoing research is looking at effects of chiropractic treatment approaches, how they might work, and diseases and conditions for which they may be most helpful. (NCCAM, 2009c.)\nOsteopathy is a medical specialty that combines traditional and nontraditional medicine. Practitioners, called doctor of osteopathy (DO), practice traditional, science-based medicine, and are licensed to perform surgery and prescribe drugs. They \u201ctake a holistic view of the body as an integrated system and approach prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by way of the musculoskeletal system\u201d (Asher, 2007).\nBiofeedback is a method of treating chronic pain and some stress-related conditions. It uses an electric device to gather information about physical responses and report them back to clients. The information goes to the biofeedback machine by way of electrode sensors placed on the person\u2019s skin. The machine displays information as visual signals on a monitor. As clients watch the signals, they learn to control their responses.\nEvaluating the Effectiveness of Interventions\nEvaluation is one of the most critical phases of the nursing process. It tells us the degree to which an intervention achieved an expected outcome. If the expected outcome is pain reduction, evaluation tells us if the intervention did, in fact, reduce pain and if so, how much and at what cost in time, treasure, and long-term effects.\nTo find out, we gather data from the best source of information, the client, or the second-best source, the client\u2019s caregivers. To be of value, the information must address the aspects of pain that were noted before the intervention, including the location, intensity, quality, and duration of the pain. In addition, data is gathered about adverse effects of an intervention, such as an allergic reaction, hypotension, or respiratory depression.\nSuch feedback is essential if we are to revise the plan of care effectively. A positive evaluation means that an intervention was successful and probably should be continued. A negative evaluation means that an intervention was not satisfactory and should be changed. Hence the adage \u201cnegative feedback makes for change.\u201d\nCommunicating, Documenting, and Teaching\nCommunication about pain and the response of clients to interventions is facilitated by accurate and thorough documentation. This communication needs to be conveyed from nurse to nurse, shift to shift, and nurse to other responsible healthcare providers. Various tools have been devised to facilitate this communication, including pain flow sheets, running diaries, and bedside computer charting, called \u201cpoint-of-care.\u201d When communicating information about pain, it is important to describe the time and exact nature of an intervention, including details such as an analgesic and dose administered, level of pain before and after the intervention, and any adverse effect that follows, such as respiratory depression. The more specific and timely a report, the more effective the evaluation.\nBecause pain is a potent motivator for change, people who suffer are vulnerable to all manner of fake gadgets and magical cures. It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to give patients accurate information about medications, devices, physical activities, and psychological strategies in clear, understandable ways. Such teaching empowers those who suffer and demonstrates genuine concern, accurate empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and respect.\nPAIN MANAGEMENT IN CHILDREN\nUnbelievable as it may seem, only recently has the medical profession taken seriously the pain and suffering of infants and children. Not long ago, newborn infants were circumcised without anesthesia or analgesia, and seriously injured children were given pain medication \u201cas needed.\u201d Happily, such undertreatment of pain in children is changing as a result of research by caring nurses and other healthcare professionals. Better assessment tools, new pharmaceuticals, and innovative delivery systems are contributing to these advances.\nResearch has shown that neonates and infants do feel and remember pain. In fact, by 6 months of age, when children are taken to places where they had experienced pain, they demonstrate anticipatory fear (Pasero, 2004). One study measured the long-term effect of newborn circumcision without analgesia on behavioral response to immunizations. When pain was measured by observable indicators such as facial expression, length of crying, and body movement, 4- to 6-month-old infants circumcised without analgesia had higher pain scores than those circumcised with analgesia (Anand, 1997).\nOther research found some children so traumatized by past injections that were intended to relieve pain that they were afraid to admit having present pain (Stevens, 1999). These and other studies have corrected many misconceptions about pain in infants and children, as described in the table below.\nMISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT PAIN IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN\nMisconceptions\nCorrect Information\nPreterm infants are less sensitive to pain than term infants and older children due to an immature nervous system.\nPreterm infants have the anatomical and functional ability to process pain and an even greater sensitivity to pain than term infants.\nInfants and children have a diminished perception of pain and no memory of its occurrence.\nPerception of pain is present with the first insult, requires no prior experience, and is remembered.\nInfants are incapable of expressing pain.\nAlthough infants cannot verbalize pain, they give physical signs and behavioral cues.\nPain in infants cannot be assessed accurately.\nBehavioral cues and physiologic signs of pain can be reliably and validly assessed; facial expressions are the most valid indicators.\nAnesthetics and analgesics cannot be given to neonates and infants because of an immature ability to eliminate drugs.\nInfants older than 1 month metabolize drugs in the same way as older infants and children.\nOpioids are too dangerous to give to infants and children because of the risk of addiction and other adverse effects.\nAdverse effects of opioid and nonopioids can be minimized by careful monitoring, drug titration, and weaning.\nInfants and children tolerate pain well and become accustomed to pain.\nPain is pain, whether it occurs in an infant, child, or adult.\nPostoperatively, children should not receive the next analgesic dose until they show obvious signs of pain.\nOpioids are most effective if administered as a continuous infusion rather than \u201cas needed,\u201d thus avoiding the need of children to complain.\nInfants and children cry or complain at the slightest discomfort even when they are not in pain.\nOften children are afraid to complaint of pain because their fear of an injection is greater than their pain.\nCommunicating with Children and Adolescents\nTo manage pain effectively in children and adolescents, nurses and other healthcare professionals need to be able to communicate with them. Such communication must be appropriate to age and stage of development. The following table describes some approaches that can be used to refine a nurses\u2019s interactions with children and, at the same time, model effective communication skills for family members.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\nAge and Stage\n"}, {"score": 2155.5854, "uuid": "e782b472-a06c-52b0-be90-408fb512d4d1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-31-03227", "target_hostname": "www.deeptissue.com", "target_uri": "http://www.deeptissue.com/Yoga-back-dvd/yoga-back-pain.htm", "page_rank": 1.1863803e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Yoga <em>Therapy</em> <em>for</em> <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> with Emily Kligerman", "snippet": "Whatever the level of your <em>pain</em>, <em>or</em> if you just want to strengthen your <em>back</em>, this DVD has the safe and appropriate <em>therapy</em> <em>for</em> you!

The Pilates principle of core stabilization addresses posture, muscle performance, and motor control\u2014the same concepts that form the basis of most orthopedic rehabilitation and therapy. PTs are using Pilates successfully to treat many common conditions and diseases. Pilates-based therapy is especially fast-growing for treating and preventing injuries to the back.\nTo better understand how Pilates can help with back injuries, it is important to look at the overall effectiveness and therapeutic value of Pilates.\nPILATES AS AN EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION TOOL\nOne reason that Pilates works so well in physical therapy is due to a one-on-one emphasis with the therapist. In traditional physical therapy, clinicians are often forced by a variety of circumstances to see multiple patients at one time. That can be hard to juggle. While many patients do well in this environment, many require more individualized care, particularly when dealing with chronic pain syndromes.\nPatients are frequently started on a modality or given exercises, and are told to continue while the therapist moves on to other patients. Clients start doing the exercise on their own and may not be sure they are doing it correctly. In a Pilates-based program, the therapist educates the patient on the principles of Pilates, one of which is precision. Through attention to these principles and manipulation of the Pilates environment, the therapist works to create a positive movement experience in which the patient learns to move without pain.\nPASSIVE VERSUS ACTIVE\u2014BRIDGING THE GAP\nThe \"Pilates environment\" refers to the full complement of repertoire and apparatus. This environment lends itself to a wide array of movement possibilities. Traditional therapies often have a difficult time bridging the gap between active and passive movements. Patients may not be able to exercise actively due to pain or weakness, so creating a more assistive environment is valuable. Use of the Pilates apparatus allows us to create this assistance.\nThe exercises can also be modified to meet the needs of each individual patient. You can start a patient in a movement sequence that does not tax the injured area or cause pain, and then build on that as the patient progresses.\nPILATES AND THE BACK: A PERFECT FIT\nPilates stresses correct posture and spinal alignment, making it a perfect fit for back injuries. Many things cause back problems, from trauma to poor movement strategies and sustained faulty postures. It's theorized that Pilates works well for these patients by improving strength and recruitment of core musculature, increasing patients' awareness of their own bodies, and normalizing the forces that distribute through the spine. In particular, the lower lumbar area is where we see the most injuries. This correlates to the fact that most of our mobility comes from the lower segments of the lumbar spine. Part of that is attributed to how we put together our movements in our body.\nPilates teaches clients how to access other spinal segments more easily and then redistribute the load that goes through the spine. This redistribution removes a patient's dependence on one or two segments of the spine, particularly crucial if that is the area of injury. This theory has been posed by Brent Anderson, PhD, PT, OCS, of Polestar Pilates Education. Anderson believes that if we engage more segments to organize movement, then less force will be applied to injured lower segments. This is especially true in a chronic back injury, where multiple compensatory changes take place due to pain, muscle imbalance, and weakness.\nPilates focuses on creating an even musculature, which can correct these muscle weaknesses and re-educate the body as to what muscles should be recruited for a specific movement. Normalizing these patterns will allow the body to heal, instead of repeatedly irritating the site of the injury.\nMAT VERSUS EQUIPMENT\nPilates exercises are done on a mat or using various apparatus. When first treating a patient, a therapist should use the apparatus because of the assistance the springs provide. By selecting the appropriate exercises and modifying them as needed, a therapist can make the initial therapy very supportive and assisted. Patients can learn to organize their bodies and put principles of Pilates into play.\nFor a lumbar injury, we can recruit the core muscles in that area, teach the patient to find and maintain a neutral spine position, and then have the patient work on basic movements that can both increase their strength and eliminate pain. Pilates includes a tremendous number of assistance-based exercises that can be difficult to achieve in the traditional rehabilitation clinic. And that's a big step toward the ultimate goal\u2014creating a positive movement experience where the patient successfully achieves pain-free movement and gains confidence in their movement abilities.\nIn our facility, we use the full complement of Pilates apparatus: the Trapeze Table (Cadillac), Reformer, Combo Chair, and Ladder Barrel. The Cadillac is great for initial patient evaluations. It is also a good piece of equipment for teaching patients how to attain neutral spine. And again, the springs provide assistance\u2014we can begin with movements like the 90/90 position, which takes the pressure off the hips and low back, and allows the patient to begin combining activation of deep abdominals with small movements in the support of the springs.\nIn addition to strengthening and stretching, the Reformer is a great diagnostic tool for seeing how a client puts his or her movements together, which we refer to as \"organization of movement.\" We have patients start on the back and do footwork exercises, which gives the clinician an indication of the patient's ability to maintain neutral spine, separate movements at the hip from the pelvis and lumbar spine, and align the lower extremities. We can see where weakness or muscle imbalances exist, and can also begin to promote stability without irritating the spine.\nThe following is a brief case study to give an example of how patients are managed in this environment.\nCASE STUDY\nPatient Background. Our patient is Kay, a 61-year-old female referred to us for low back pain and lumbar stenosis. She sustained her back injury from a fall that occurred during a tennis clinic 5 months prior. While returning balls from her partner, she fell backward and landed on numerous tennis balls that had accumulated in the backcourt. She had some immediate back pain, which worsened as the day went on. Kay stated that her \"muscles tightened and spasmed,\" and she had \"a large pelvic torsion and a lot of pain.\" She eventually sought help, trying chiropractic, acupuncture, and physical therapy. MRI revealed lumbar stenosis, arthritis changes, and disk pathology at L4-5, L5-S1.\nInitial patient history review. Improvement was made with physical therapy, but upon finishing her course of treatment she believed that she was not yet at her preinjury level of function and was still having a marked amount of back pain. As an active athlete, Kay was frustrated by her inability to participate in all of her activities and perform at her previous level of tennis. Her chief complaints at the time of evaluation were LBP and numbness of the feet and LE with prolonged activity. The pain was described as sharp, intermittent, and rated at 6/10 subjectively on a 10-point subjective pain scale. Pain started in the central lumbar spine and radiated down to the R buttock and down the R posterior LE. Symptoms were made worse by lying, sitting, and standing for more than 20 to 30 minutes. Heat and exercise provided some relief, and she stated that movement tended to help prevent symptoms. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable.\nPhysical evaluation. Postural evaluation was unremarkable. Assessment of the spine active range of motion (AROM) revealed a decrease in extension and lateral flexion ROM bilaterally (limited to 50% of normal), with pain into extension. Lumbar flexion was also noticeably deficient, with no reversal of lordosis. Flexion movement was achieved primarily by thoracic spine flexion and hip flexion, with very little segmental mobility of the lumbar spine. Strength was intact, with manual muscle-testing grades of 5/5 throughout the LE's bilaterally. Sensation and reflexes were also intact bilaterally, 2+ throughout. Straight-leg raise was negative and 85\u00ba bilaterally.\nAssessment/plan of care. Kay presented with the following impairments and functional limitations: decreased spine AROM, decreased core strength, decreased spine articulation, and decreased overall movement awareness and control. Functionally, these impairments presented as a decreased tolerance for sitting, standing, or lying for more than 20 to 30 minutes. Our plan of care was to see Kay two times per week for 6 weeks to address these impairments and functional limitations. Treatment was to consist of Pilates rehabilitation exercise and manual therapy. Sessions were one-on-one with a therapist certified in Pilates rehabilitation, using the full complement of Pilates exercises and apparatus. A comprehensive home-exercise program was also used to allow the patient to continue to progress on days she was not being seen for Pilates.\nTreatment. Sessions focused on improving her core stability, increasing her segmental mobility and control, improving her hip and thoracic spine mobility, and improving her overall strategies of movement. Our hypothesis is that increasing the ability to disassociate at the hips and improving thoracic spine mobility will allow the patient to access and distribute movement to areas other than the lumbar spine and the lesion site. The initial phase of treatment focused on the ability to find and maintain neutral spine and engage deep abdominals. These components were then coupled with disassociation movements above (shoulders) and below (hips) the lumbar spine to further facilitate deep abdominal recruitment. Exercises were progressed when the patient showed proficiency with previous lower-level movements. Mobility exercises were then introduced to improve spine ROM, segmental movement, and control. Care must be taken at this point, because movement is now occurring through the site of lesion. Dynamic stability and functional exercises are introduced next, and allow for carryover of newly acquired ROM and strategies of movement into daily activities.\nOutcome. This patient progressed extremely well and was able to return to all activities without pain or limitation. Kay is back to playing competitive tennis more than 3 days per week, and is very satisfied with the results she has achieved through Pilates rehabilitation.\nFor more Pilates-related articles, search for \"pilates\" in our online archives .\nIt is also important to note that at week 2 of her treatment plan, Kay sustained a significant ankle injury (grade 2 inversion sprain) and was able to successfully rehabilitate both her back and ankle injuries. We believe that success is achieved in these situations through the dynamic, whole-body approach that this Pilates environment provides. The variability of the equipment makes it possible to use an assistive or resistive environment, depending on the patient's stage. Exercises and movements are also variable, and can be modified or progressed as appropriate. With Kay, we were able to focus on exercises that challenged her core stability and allowed us to address her low back injury without perturbing the recent ankle injury. We also incorporated ankle ROM, strengthening, and proprioception exercises, beginning with minimal weight-bearing in an unfamiliar environment (for example, supine footwork on the Reformer) and then progressing to familiar, functional exercises in full weight-bearing (for example, spring-assisted squats, multidirectional lunges).\nOverall, Kay was seen for 12 sessions over an 8-week period of time before returning to tennis, and she has not had any problems thus far. She continues to exercise regularly to maintain the gains made in rehabilitation and to continue to improve her overall state of wellness.\nKristopher Bosch, DPT, ATC, is the director of rehabilitation and cofounder of Northstar Pilates Solutions LLC, Buffalo, NY.

Up until now, we\u2019ve only had anecdotal evidence to suggest that massage therapy helped to reduce pain. And as you know, anecdotal evidence leaves plenty of room for doubt.\nHowever, I recently ran across a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine that finally lends some credibility to this very popular treatment method.\nThe study involved 380 adults with advanced cancer who were experiencing moderate-to-severe pain. The participants were divided into two groups. One group received six 30-minute massage treatments over two weeks from certified massage therapists, while the control group received an equal number of treatments utilizing simple touch performed by untrained individuals.\nThe Results\nThe good news is that both groups experienced immediate pain relief according to the report:\n\u201cPrimary outcomes were immediate \u2026 and sustained \u2026 change in pain. Secondary outcomes were immediate change in mood \u2026\n[snip]\nBoth groups demonstrated immediate improvement in pain and mood \u2026\n[snip]\nMassage was superior for both immediate pain and mood \u2026 \u201d [1]\nNow, while this is good news, it should be noted that patients did not experience total pain relief from the treatments. Their pain was only reduced between 1 to 2 points on a 0 - 10 scale. This represents a significant improvement, but not total relief.\nAlso, this was not a blind study as noted here\u2026\n\u201cLimitations: The immediate outcome measures were obtained by unblinded study therapists, possibly leading to reporting bias and the overestimation of a beneficial effect. The generalizability to all patients with advanced cancer is uncertain. The differential beneficial effect of massage therapy over simple touch is not conclusive without a usual care control group.\u201d [1]\nThe report went on to conclude\u2026\n\u201cMassage may have immediately beneficial effects on pain and mood among patients with advanced cancer. Given the lack of sustained effects and the observed improvements in both study groups, the potential benefits of attention and simple touch should also be considered in this patient population.\u201d [1]\nHerein Lies the Rub\nNow perhaps you noticed that this study did not directly involve treatment for back pain. This is something that I happen to consider a plus rather than a negative.\nAfter all, what\u2019s significant about this study is that it was conducted on advanced cancer patients. These were people with real pain. There was little or no chance that their pain was psychosomatic in nature.\nThe same cannot be said about back pain or migraine headaches or any other form of pain where emotions or stress can influence the results. After all, the brain can play tricks on us.\nAnd while one study is not enough to establish proof, and it was not a double-blind situation, and the patients did not receive total pain relief, the fact remains that the results were immediate and sustained for the short term.\nOverall, I feel the positive outcomes from this study are encouraging.\nUntil next time,\nDean\nReferences:\n"}, {"score": 2140.1023, "uuid": "734ff3e3-2428-56f9-bca1-8e72bec9d29a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-04-11072", "target_hostname": "www.spineuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.spineuniverse.com/conditions/chronic-pain/therapy-helps-chronic-back-pain-patients-sleep", "page_rank": 1.1936608e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Therapy</em> Helps Chronic <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> Patients Sleep Easier", "snippet": "&quot;Training nurses in the delivery of this type of <em>therapy</em> will result in <em>better</em> access <em>for</em> patients.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nChronic pain can have a negative impact on just about every aspect of your life.

The study, which had more than 60 participants, tested the effectiveness of preventative low level heat wrap therapy for low back delayed-onset muscle soreness.1 Analysis by the U.S. Spine & Sport Foundation concluded that it is possible to minimize delayed-onset muscle soreness by using wearable low level heat wraps across the lumbar region before exercise (back extension exercises on machines) begins and immediately thereafter.2\nMost individuals suffering from low back pain know the importance of staying active, whether that means engaging in low-impact aerobic exercise like walking, or pursuing a more comprehensive program of aerobic, strength and conditioning activities. The back and spine structures all benefit from activity that increases blood flow and maintains flexibility. One major obstacle to ongoing exercise, however, is the attendant muscle pain that many people experience in the day or two after a rigorous workout. In fact, post-exercise pain and stiffness derails many fitness programs.\nArticle continues below\nPeople with low back pain face a conundrum: they need to engage in lower back exercise but to do so risks increasing their muscle pain, or having a sore back, at least in the short term. Thus, the research showing that heat wrap therapy can minimize the intensity of post-exercise pain potentially gives low back pain sufferers more hope of keeping their exercise program on track.\nLow Back Pain Intensity Decreases with Preventative Heat Therapy\nThe study compared the effect of using preventative lumbar heat wrap therapy to performing a set of routine stretches. The heat wraps were lightweight, disposable, air-activated, commercially available wraps designed to deliver low level heat (i.e. a few degrees above body temperature) for eight hours of continuous use. Outcomes were assessed across several dimensions:\nPain intensity, using a 6-point scale ranging from no pain to extreme pain\nSelf-reported physical functioning, assessed with the Multidimensional Task Ability Profile (MTAP)\nSelf-reported disability, (as gauged by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)\nOn all dimensions, study participants who used the lumbar heat wrap showed statistically significant better scores than those in the control group who did not use the heat wrap, but instead engaged in minimal stretching of various muscle groups.3\nMean pain intensity scores 24 hours after exercising showed a wide disparity between the groups. Figure 1 shows low back pain intensity scores for both groups plotted across 72 hours. At the 24-hour mark when post-exercise muscle generally nears its peak, low back pain intensity scores for those who used the heat wrap were almost 47% less than for the control group.\nSimilarly, the scores of physical functioning and disability between groups varied widely. The adjusted mean change in physical functioning was more than 44% for the heat wrap group (indicating preservation of physical functioning) and the disability scores varied more than 50%, with 50% more of the control group (the non-heat wrap group) reporting bothersome pain.\nConsequently, participants who used the low back heat wrap (specifically, the product marketed as ThermaCare, which covered the whole lumbar region) before they exercised were far more satisfied with the outcome of the study than those in the control group.\nPreventative Heat Therapy May be Superior to Traditional Protocols\nThe study calls into question traditional approaches to pain control or pain management for exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness. Many people who undertake a low back muscle exercise program are advised to stretch or loosen their muscles before vigorous exercise to prevent injury, and to use ice or a heating pad after exercise to calm inflammation and relieve muscle soreness. While those approaches may work to some extent, several studies with other muscle groups have reported that warming-up or stretching of muscle tissue prior to exercise is ineffective in preventing delayed-onset muscle soreness symptoms and related functional loss. For example, neither passive nor active warm-up of the bicep muscles prior to lifting weights prevented muscle damage. Similarly, another researcher found that active warm-up of the quadriceps muscles in the thigh using low intensity exercise did not prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness. 4\nFurthermore, there are no studies that indicate whether or how stretching before exercise prevents onset of low back pain after exercising. The lower back is a complex area and can be somewhat difficult to condition. In contrast, the results of the delayed-onset muscle soreness study described above indicate that applying the heat wrap for four hours prior to and after exercise results in a substantial decrease in low back pain intensity.\nThe researchers hypothesized that the results could be explained by two main factors.\nFirst, the heat wrap was worn for several hours (unlike a heating pad that people usually use for less than an hour), thereby increasing the heat wrap\u2019s thermal effect on muscle. Since the heat wrap used in the study administered low-level heat (i.e. a few degrees above body temperature), continuous wear for eight hours was possible.\nSecond, the heat wrap also allowed the individual to continue moving and remain active, unlike an ice pack or heating pad that uses when stationary, so the wrap wearer maintained a higher level of flexibility and blood flow.\nDespite the study\u2019s promising findings, one must take its findings with caution. The study enrolled a relatively small number of participants who were free of low back pain at the onset of the study; and the study used a very specific type of heat wrap. Thus, it is unknown at the present time if these findings can be generalized to other populations (e.g. those with chronic low back pain) and other types of heat wraps. Further research is needed in this area.\nFor some people, the low back muscle soreness that settles in after exercise is intense enough to cause them to skip an exercise session. Worse, it could lead some people to avoid exercise altogether. None of these is conducive to maintaining or improving low back health. Finding a way to control\u2014or better yet prevent\u2014muscle soreness and related pain can significantly enhance both back and overall health. Low level heat wraps are readily available over the counter in drug stores or from medical supply outlets. People seeking to minimize exercise-related low back muscle soreness can ask their health provider if the results of this study apply to them.\nReferences:\nMayer, John M., et al.

I have tried a number of different treatments but nothing has worked and the pain is getting worse. What is the Chiropractic approach?\nAnswer:\nSciatica is a very common problem which usually results in some type of symptom down the leg. This condition is usually a result of an inflammation of the sciatic nerve, the longest and largest nerve in the body. It is composed of five smaller nerves that leave the spinal cord from lower (lumbar) spinal column, join together and then travel down the leg. It then divides into many smaller nerves that travel to the thigh, knee, calf, ankle, foot and toes.\nPeople with \"sciatica\" suffer from a wide range of symptoms. Some people may have only mild pain, which travels down the back into the upper leg. It may feel like a dull ache or numbness. For others, the pain may be very severe and travel down the leg into the foot and toes. Many factors affect the pain of sciatica. Sitting for long periods of time or driving can increase the pain, as well as working out or running. Also twisting activities, especially golf and tennis, have a tendency to cause a flare-up in sciatica pain. For some, the pain may be in both legs or change from side to side. For a number of others, back pain may occur before the sciatica itself.\nSciatica can result in a number of different areas. The first place to look is the lower back (lumbar spine). A misaligned spine of one or more of the lumbar vertebra resulting in pressure on the nerve is common. This condition is known as a subluxation. There may be disc involvement. The disc is the pad between the vertebra. The disc may bulge to one side resulting in what many people call a \"slipped disc,\" although disc herniation is a better way of describing this condition. Degeneration or arthritis of the spine can also irritate the sciatic nerve. Trauma such as car accidents or falls may also result in sciatica.\nThe medical approach to treatment varies. It may include using painkillers, muscle relaxers or anti-inflammatories. Traction, physical therapy or injections may also be used. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.\nThe chiropractic approach to this condition varies. In our clinic, a complete history is taken to determine how the problem may have first started. Next, x-rays are taken and a complete exam is performed. These tests are reviewed and presented to the patient. Recommendations will vary according to the severity of the condition. With most, a series of adjustments to move the related vertebra back to a more normal position is helpful to reduce the pressure on the nerve. In some cases, the use of ultrasound and ice is all that is needed. In our clinic, we employ two full-time massage therapists who are trained in reducing the pain related to muscle spasms. The combination of adjustments and physical therapy has proven very successful in treating sciatica. In the most severe cases, where we find a spinal fracture or some type of pathology such as a tumor, we will be sure to refer you to the appropriate specialist.\nWhatever the cause of your sciatica, it is important to seek the advice of your Chiropractor or Physician for treatment. Too many people wait, hoping the symptoms will just go away or get better by themselves. Usually, it is much easier to treat a problem when it first becomes noticeable. Too many people wait until they can't stand the pain anymore, then come in and want immediate relief.\nIn conclusion, it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible for symptoms associated with sciatica. Be sure the doctor of your choice performs a complete exam with x-rays, and explains their approach to treatment in detail. If you do not receive positive results, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion. If I may be of further help, please contact me at my clinic.\n\u00a92009 Dr. Harvey\n"}, {"score": 2132.214, "uuid": "93bf33ca-e6bd-5c54-9af2-b9199ca0f95b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0918wb-29-17325", "target_hostname": "ptthinktank.com", "target_uri": "http://ptthinktank.com/category/physical-therapy/", "page_rank": 4.4425597e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> | PT Think Tank", "snippet": "Individuals are routinely given cervical soft collars <em>for</em> neck <em>pain</em>, immobilization including CASTS and <em>or</em> instructions <em>for</em> non-weight bearing <em>for</em> ankle sprains, and MULTIPLE days of bed rest <em>for</em> low <em>back</em> <em>pain</em>. <em>What</em> do the PATIENTS want?

Female athletes exhibit increased incidence of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries, so we need to work to reduce their risk of injury through specific training, performance, and post-surgical rehabilitation programs. ACL injury, reconstructive surgery, co-morbidities, rehabilitation, return to sport, and prevention all are hot topics currently. Studies have investigated risk factors for ACL injury, sport specific rehabilitation and return to play, accelerated\u00a0vs. standard rehabilitation timeframes, as well as predictors of osteoarthritis following reconstruction. Some investigations attempt to identify individuals who can cope without an ACL vs. those who require surgical intervention. And unfortunately, as ACL injuries occur in younger and younger athletes physical therapists must consider the proper management of ACL injuries in skeletally immature individuals . I posted about fear of re-injury and return to sport following ACL reconstruction .\nThe link in the tweet is a Santa Monica Sports Medicine Foundation website page that explains the Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance (PEP) Program .\u00a0But, I had 2 discussion points:\nThe PEP may not be the best program\nPrevention may not be the best wording\nBased upon my understanding of the literature on the topic, Sportsmetrics seems a superior choice for both injury risk reduction and performance. Second, I do not think we can truly and absolutely prevent injuries. Injury is an inherent risk of sport. Even non-contact ACL injuries are not totally preventable. Now, injury risk reduction is possible and feasible. I believe that the using the term prevention is the wrong nomenclature. It conveys an inaccurate message. Every attempt is made to reduce the relative risk of injury. But, make no mistake, there is no way to totally abolish injury risk. Maybe I am being too fussy\u2026\nIn a strike of happy coincidence I read the abstract of a systematic review from the journal Sports Health: A Multi-disciplinary Approach the day before through Google Reader. The title of the article is Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Prevention Training In Female Athletes: A Systematic Review of Injury Reduction and Results of Athletic Performance Tests . The review analyzed the results of other studies in an attempt to ascertain which training programs decreased ACL injury risk and in conjunction what measures of performance were improved. The conclusion:\nSportsmetrics produced significant increases in lower extremity and abdominal strength, vertical jump height, estimated maximal aerobic power, speed, and agility. Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance (PEP) significantly improved isokinetic knee flexion strength but did not improve vertical jump height, speed, or agility. The other 3 programs (Myklebust, the \u201c11,\u201d and Knee Ligament Injury Prevention) did not improve both ACL injury rates and athletic performance tests.\nMy initial response\nA little bit of info from the review\nResponses\nOther tweets\n@PacificTigerDPT brought up some excellent points in our exchange. The importance of marketing to patients and clients to maximize accessing the most effective care was something I did not think about. I really enjoyed conversing, discussing, and learning via Twitter.\nNow, I am bias, because my practice location utilizes the Sportsmetrics program. I am most comfortable and familiar with\u00a0administering Sportsmetrics. But, given the data in the above systematic review, I think Sportsmetrics is overall a superior program. Obviously, you want your injury risk reduction program to reduce the risk of injury! That is priority number one. But, improving performance measures such as power, aerobic capacity, strength, and agility is always at the forefront of any training, recovering, or rehabilitating athlete\u2019s mind. In this regard, the data seems to suggest that Sportsmetrics outperforms Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance (PEP) Program. I would argue the Enhance Performance part of the name should be taken out, given the data shows that it only improves isokinetic knee flexion strength, but no measures of athletic performance.\nThe interactions on this topic I had through twitter as well as this resulting blog post are a real illustration of how to leverage Twitter, tweet replies, RSS feeds, and blog posts to engage in the analysis of literature, discussion of clinical practice, and comparison of research. I think this is the future of professional discussion, and potentially continuing education.\nI was able to engage information from a tweet with replies. I read a website post on the PEP and compared it to the abstract I had read through RSS and Google Reader. Then, replied to the tweet with some of my analyses and a link to the systematic review. Lastly, I expanded upon my thoughts and analysis through this blog post. As illustrated, current technological and social media tool are not mutually exclusively. They can be leveraged together to facilitate networking, discussion, and professional growth.\nFor more detailed information on leveraging technology check out the entire Leveraging Technology Series:\n"}, {"score": 2130.3938, "uuid": "459def01-a1a3-549f-bc71-e457362e0550", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-25-01829", "target_hostname": "www.loptonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.loptonline.com/testimonials", "page_rank": 1.7256826e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Lincoln Orthopedic <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em> | Testimonials", "snippet": "Through treatment and education I&#x27;ve gone from severe <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> to no <em>back</em> <em>pain</em>. &quot;I went to see my family physician <em>for</em> a painful left shoulder and was referred to Lincoln Orthopedic <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Testimonials\nIf you would like to share a story about the care you received at Lincoln Orthopedic Physical Therapy, you may email it to: south@ loptonline.com\n\"I was referred to Jake DeNell by a friend and my doctor when I was in as much pain that I could barely walk.

Although this condition is more often reported by women, men also experience chronic pelvic pain. CPP is any pelvic pain that lasts for more than six months.\nA precise definition of Chronic Pelvic Pain is not a simple one since the understanding of chronic pelvic pain is currently in transition. Those with CPP have found this frustrating and challenging often visiting several healthcare providers before being properly diagnosed and treated. \u00a0\u00a0In the past, the belief that this condition was \u201call in the head\u201d prevailed among health care providers and patients but heightened awareness and understanding of the condition have changed this.\nAt present, CPP can best be explained by describing its symptoms, the impact of these symptoms on quality of life and describing treatments that have been effective.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of chronic pelvic pain may or may not include sharp or severe pain but instead may present with some variation of discomfort, aching, burning, fullness, squeezing, tightness, sharp or dull sensation.\u00a0 These may appear in the genital, anal, bladder, tail bone, groin and low back as well as other areas.\u00a0 Reports of discomfort or relief when sitting and following bowel movements are common.\u00a0 Urinary symptoms include frequency, urgency, incontinence, hesitancy, burning and frequent night time urination.\u00a0 Sexual dysfunction may manifest as painful or impossible intercourse and absent or painful orgasm.\u00a0 Anxiety, depression and a feeling of helplessness prevail.\u00a0 Partner relational issues result from the condition and the condition magnifies existing issues.\nSources and Causes of CPP\nSources of pelvic pain include the organs that reside in the abdominal cavity as well as the bones and connective tissue on the front and back of the trunk, lower extremities and all areas in and around the pelvis.\u00a0 Instances of trauma to the pelvic floor resulting from childbirth, accident, sexual intercourse, sexual abuse, surgery, irradiation as well as acute disease can contribute to CPP.\nDiagnosis\nThe first step is a detailed medical screening and diagnosis often by a nurse practitioner or physician with a specialty in women\u2019s health. Two major categories of pelvic pain exist:\u00a0 gynecological and non-gynecological. It is necessary to have a thorough examination in order to identity the problem and rule out infectious and neurological diseases.\u00a0 Screening for depression and anxiety disorders is also necessary.\nTreatment\nTreatment of chronic pelvic pain must be multidisciplinary to be effective. A team approach is critical, whether the team is present in the same facility or exists as a referral network. It is important that the members of the team consult regularly.\u00a0 The team may include the physician, nurse practitioner, physician\u2019s assistant, physical therapist, counselor and other providers involved in care.\nBe patient with your treatment as it may take 3-6 months to resolve.\nMedication including homeopathic preparations applied topically and by injection, bio-identical compounded hormones, sleep aides, antidepressants and others may be prescribed by the physician, nurse practitioner or physician\u2019s assistant.\nA physical therapist specially trained in pelvic floor dysfunction can provide a detailed evaluation necessary to identify the soft tissue structures that are responsible for the pain and dysfunction. Treatment may consist of myofascial release, electrical stimulation, biofeedback, and other procedures to release the shortened structures and strengthen the weakened ones. Postural correction and therapeutic exercises are also used.\nSome patients find relief of pain with acupuncture and other alternative measures.

Whether you suffer from an acute injury or chronic pain, a rehabilitation program will be customized to meet your individual needs.\nWe do not simply rely on \u0093one size fits all\u0094 exercise handouts. Rather, through a series of specialized tests including orthopedic and neurologic examination, posture analysis, gait analysis, muscle testing, muscle length assessment, muscle firing pattern analysis, and a functional performance assessment, the doctor will identify your key link(s) of biomechanical dysfunction. Based upon this information, a specific rehab program will be developed by your chiropractic physician to correct the underlying cause(s) of your problem. We will then work with you \u0093one-on-one\u0094, paying close attention to every detail of your performance, so that your program is safe and effective. You will be guided through a series of highly therapeutic exercises, ensuring that you have mastered one exercise before moving on to the next. Most of the exercises taught are \u0093low-tech\u0094, require little to no special devices, and are simple enough for you to perform on your own at home, at work, or at the gym. These exercises often involve spinal stabilization, core-strengthening, stretching & relaxation procedures for overactive/tight muscles, as well as strengthening & facilitation procedures for weaker/inhibited muscles. As a result, you will achieve increased functional capacity and reduced pain by improving your mobility, flexibility, stability, strength, overall muscle balance, and performance.\nThroughout the process, we adopt a teamwork approach with you as an equal participant in your health care.

Sitemap | Resources | Customer Review Form | RSS 2.0 Valid\nPROGRESSIVE HEALTH & WELLNESS BLOG:\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF ERGONOMICS & MICRO-BREAKS : Over time, the human body has adapted very well to the task of hunting for and gathering food. It performs and feels its best when it is in motion during the day, and resting at night. Sitting all day, on the other hand, puts an enormous strain on the sspine and its supporting tendons, ligaments, muscles, and fascia. If you are sitting at a desk and/or computer for more than 1 hour on a regular basis, then you are what we call an \u0093industrial athlete\u0094. For you, proper ergonomics and micro-breaks (discussed in a separate blog) are essential to prevent neck pain, back pain, and headaches, as well as to allow your body to get the best results from your chiropractic care.\nProper ergonomics involves having your computer monitor positioned directly in front of you (not off to one side), at eye-level. Your feet should be in full contact with the floor, with your hips and knees bent at approximately a 90 degree angle. It is crucial that your elbows are in at your sides at all times (even when using your keyboard and mouse), no more than 2-3 inches away from your sides or reaching in front of your shoulders. Ideally, your elbows and wrists are resting on an arm rest/wrist rest, either attached to your chair, or your desk. In order for the above requirements to be met, a drop-down keyboard tray and fully adjustable ergonomic chair are usually necessary. Drs. Ezgur and DiDomenico are highly skilled in advising you how to modify your worksite to be ergonomically correct for you. They may also recommend that you request an ergonomic consultation to be performed for you by your employer. Many people don\u0092t realize that most companies are required by law to comply with your request.\n"}, {"score": 2116.1572, "uuid": "3dd52828-1d10-59a8-a50c-bf83d8df2ca3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-57-32744", "target_hostname": "www.sttereizapt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sttereizapt.com/massage-therapy", "page_rank": 1.5599665e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Saint Tereiza <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>", "snippet": "Why <em>Physical</em> <em>Therapy</em>?

For those who work in an office and sit at a desk on a regular basis, neck pain occurs even more regularly, with roughly 43-69% of all office workers experiencing pain in the past year. To attempt to curb this trend, measures have been made to reduce neck pain for office workers, and exercise therapy is one intervention growing in popularity. Investigating all available literature on the topic, it was found that muscle strengthening and muscle endurance exercises can help reduce the intensity, duration and discomfort of neck pain. Therefore, instilling a program such as this for office workers suffering from neck pain can relieve employees and improve productivity in the workplace.\nTemporarily stopping participation and starting a rehab program effective for young soccer players experiencing back pain\nThough soccer doesn't experience the same popularity levels in the U.S. that it does internationally, it's still the most widely played sport in the world, with participation numbers that only continue to grow. Consequently, the rate of injuries sustained by soccer players also continues to increase, especially in the spine. Spondylolysis, which results from a stress fracture to a vertebra, is the most common condition that leads to low back pain (LBP) for soccer players under 18, making it an important disorder for young players. In an effort to determine an effective strategy for dealing with this condition, a study found that temporarily halting participation in sports and beginning a conservative rehab program (free of surgery) was extremely beneficial for young soccer players and greatly facilitated their return to sports.\nRegular smokers shown to improve less following back surgery than nonsmokers\nThe negative impact of being a habitual smoker has never been underplayed, particularly when it comes to lung health and cancer. In addition to those risks, however, smoking can also lead to more complications and slower recovery following certain types of surgery. To determine how great these risks are, a study evaluated the recovery of a number of patients following lumbar spinal surgery, and found smokers to improve less, with more pain and a lower quality of life than nonsmokers, adding more reasons to the laundry list of potential pitfalls of smoking regularly.\nPhysical therapists need to treat psychosocial factors in addition to physical ones\nMost patients enter a physical therapist's office with a physical ailment of some sort, and intend to be treated primarily for that particular ailment. While this is the major concern for physical therapists (PTs) and should remain as such, a recent issue of Physical Therapy magazine stresses the importance of treating the \"whole\" patient, and the necessity of addressing their psychosocial issues associated with their condition to ensure the best possible outcome. Treating an injury or condition is a process that triggers a number of emotional responses, and, according to the issue, PTs need to keep them in mind and tend to them while treating patients. This sort of shift can mean better overall results and more patient satisfaction, both of which are sought after by all PTs.\nThinking about seeing a chiropractor for your low back pain? Read this report and think again.\nThe high occurrence rates of low back pain (LBP) and the hindrances it causes on peoples' lives continue to be well documented, and those who suffer from it continue to seek any form of treatment that may be effective in alleviating their pain. One of the most popular interventions Americans use is to see a chiropractor, who will use manipulation and a number of other methods to treat LBP. Yet despite their common usage in the U.S., the evidence of a chiropractor's effectiveness is limited. Looking into this matter further with the intent of drawing more definitive conclusions, a review of available information on the subject actually found no meaningful effects of chiropractic interventions on LBP in the long-term, leading to more questions than answers on the usefulness of chiropractics.\nDoing away with the concept of 'diagnosis' could be the key in optimizing treatment for axial neck pain\nAxial neck pain, one of the three major types of neck pain, is a musculoskeletal disorder (affecting both the muscles and bones) that's limited to pain in the neck only. Unfortunately, when it comes to diagnosing axial neck pain and determining how to treat it, many spine specialists differ in their approach, using only the types of tests they know will confirm the treatment they wish to recommend. As a result, patients are put through a number of expensive and sometimes unnecessary tests that may or may not even help in better defining their condition. The problems with this system lie primarily in the lack of uniformity of spine clinicians, who continue to do things their own way even if they're not proven to be effective. Many researches believe the flawed system needs to be overhauled entirely, and one possible change that's been gaining some popularity is to nix the term \u201cdiagnosis\u201d altogether, and instead use a series of clinical prediction rules that will highlight specific characteristics in patients that will determine which treatments will lead to the best possible outcome for each subject.\nInsider's perspective from those with low back pain claim it never fully goes away\nLow back pain (LBP) continues to affect the lives of millions of Americans on a regular basis, preventing many from engaging in everyday activities and leading a normal lifestyle. Efforts have been made to be better understand LBP and the reason it reoccurs so often, but there is still not a universal system for measuring its recurrence rates. Some measurements take into account time off work and health-care utilization, but questions exist as to if those figures accurately depict the bigger picture of LBP. A group of researchers noted this and thought it would be beneficial to hear from LBP sufferers in an open-forum discussion to get a sense of how it impacts their lives. The overall consensus showed that most with LBP felt it was an ongoing condition that comes and goes in varying degrees, but never fully goes away. Health care use was minimal since participants felt it never actually helped their pain, and work was only missed in extreme situations. These findings suggest that time off work and health-care use aren't effective measurement statistics, and that treatment strategies need to be improved significantly.\nEarly physical therapy treatment for low back pain can prevent future complications\nLow back pain (LBP) is one of the most common disorders found throughout the world, with about 65-80% of adults experiencing the condition at some point in their lifetime, making it an urgent and pressing matter to address with the best possible treatment. Physical therapy administered early on is regarded by most as the leading treatment method available, but there are some medical professionals who question its effectiveness and choose to treat it by other means. Seeking definitive answers, a study was conducted that compared early PT to a number of other interventions and found it to be effective in reducing the likelihood of receiving costly procedures like injections and surgery later on in the course of LPB.\nHow healthcare professionals' word choice affects patients' perceptions on low back pain\nLow back pain (LBP) continues to affect countless individuals throughout the globe with distress and discomfort, and remains a major concern of health-care professionals. In addition to the physical aspects that are largely responsible for LBP, there are also some psychosocial factors that can contribute to it and create negative beliefs about the condition. For this reason, the word choice used by physicians to deliver news to patients is of utmost importance, as it can shape patients' views and potentially lead to the condition worsening. A study investigated the role of word choice in a clinical setting and found direct correlations between certain words and inappropriately negative outlooks, which means physicians should be much more cognizant about the manner in which they deliver messages to patients.\nHow characteristics of swinging mechanics can lead to low back pain for golfers\nGolf is a sport that enjoys wide-ranging popularity on an international scale due to its casual nature and mild intensity level. Despite the fact that golf doesn't require much energy exertion and is fairly safe compared to most other sports, injuries still do occur, with lower back pain (LBP) being the most common complaint for both professional and amateur golfers. Consequently, physical therapists have been investigating which characteristics, if any, in a golf swing could contribute to a more likely chance of a golfer experiencing low back pain and why. One study compared golfers with LBP to those without it, and found a number of indicators that may lead to LBP that can be avoided if addressed properly.\nMany patients with low back pain fail to follow recommendations for improvement\nLow back pain (LBP) is an extremely common condition and major source of discomfort that affects a large percentage of people throughout the world at some point in their lives. When not treated correctly, cases of LBP can go on to turn more extreme and pose future problems that could've been avoided if guidelines were followed properly by patients. Noting this, an Australian study surveyed patients with LBP and found that many of those suffering from the condition didn't seek advice, and of those that did, a significant amount didn't actually follow the recommendations given to them. This figure points out much of what's wrong with the overall face of LBP rehab and should be considered in moving forward.\nA close look at hyperkyphosis: how it develops, how to manage it\nAge-related hyperkyphosis, which is defined by an exaggerated curvature of the thoracic spine, is a common condition in the elderly population that impairs the ability to function properly and increases the risk of falls and fractures. Though it effects somewhere between 20-40% of senior citizens, the natural history of hyperkyphosis is not completely understood, and it\u2019s thought to come about from a variety of processes. Fortunately, if hyperkyphosis is identified and treated early in its onset, the chances of recovering from it are much more likely. Take a look at what can cause it and the best ways to treat hyperkyphosis if it occurs.\nFull-scale evaluation of lumbar spinal stenosis surgery for older adults\nSpinal stenosis, a condition in which the narrowing of the spinal cord causes nerve pinching and subsequent pain in the buttocks, is the most common indicator for spine surgery in older adults, which itself is extremely prevalent. Despite the popularity of the surgery, however, a general consensus on the best surgical method has yet to be reached, as many surgeons still take their own individualized approach. To investigate these various methods and to clarify which is the best option, a study was conducted that evaluated Medicare trends to determine the optimal surgical style.\nHip impingement: recognizing, understanding and treating a common cause of hip pain\nBased off the recent progress in diagnosing and treating nonarthritic hip injuries, hip impingement has become increasingly recognized as one of the more common causes of hip pain for athletes, adolescents and adults. Caused by a bone in the hip and the thighbone rubbing against each other, hip impingement can lead to the wearing away of cartilage and eventually osteoarthritis if not treated properly. The debilitating disease can have serious implications for both physical and daily life activities, but physical therapy has been strongly recommended as a method to treat it.\nHip arthroscopy for athletes in the long term: a 10-year follow up\nArthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure preferred by some for its shorter recovery time and smaller scar, and it has been a popular method to treat sports-related hip problems for years. Despite the popularity of hip arthroscopy, there is a lack of data on the long-term effects of the surgery, spurring a study in which athletes who underwent the procedure were monitored over the course of 10 years to determine its effectiveness or lack thereof.\nBeyond heavy backpacks and computer overuse: Lower back pain in adolescents\nNow that lower back pain has become a malady not only experienced by the adult population, but by adolescents as well, concerned parents are interested in the exact causes of so many back-related issues. Though wearing a heavy backpack and spending too much time slouched over in front of the computer screen have taking most of the rap, and with fairly good reason, back problems for most adolescents are rooted much deeper.\nWheeling back to health: Wheeled walkers may relieve pain for Spinal Stenosis patients\nMany elders who suffer from Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS), a condition characterized by the narrowing of the spinal canal, have a tendency to lean forward on shopping carts and other similar devices to alleviate pain. A study conducted on elders with LSS determined that the forward leaning motion is actually helpful for the spine, and came to recommend wheeled walkers for the condition as it encourages the walker towards this motion, opening up the spine and relieving pain.\n"}, {"score": 2103.6501, "uuid": "5153565a-5332-56e6-a473-51f33eb01e34", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1011wb-57-28719", "target_hostname": "www.drharvey.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drharvey.com/Pages/Articles/CarpalTunnel.html", "page_rank": 2.3010371e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "San Diego chiropractor, <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>, spine adjustment, <em>pain</em> relief", "snippet": "I don&#x27;t want to have surgery - <em>is</em> there anything a chiropractor can do <em>for</em> me?

CTS <em>is</em> usually associated with a tingling, numbness and&#x2F;<em>or</em> <em>pain</em> in the fingers, hand <em>or</em> wrist.", "explanation": null, "document": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\nQuestion: Dear Dr. Harvey,\nI have recently been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. My regular doctor has recommended that I have surgery. I don't want to have surgery - is there anything a chiropractor can do for me?\nAnswer: First of all, I think it is important for you to gain a better understanding of carpal tunnel syndrome. CTS is usually associated with a tingling, numbness and/or pain in the fingers, hand or wrist. The symptoms range from mild to severe, constant or sporadic. Similar conditions may also occur in the arm, shoulder or neck regions.\nThe carpal tunnel itself is formed by the carpal bones in your wrist. Through the tunnel run a group of tendons and the median nerve. CTS is commonly associated with pressure on this nerve.\nCTS affects as many as one in ten people who work with their hands and is even more common with people who perform repetitive tasks, such as secretaries, carpenters computer operators, etc. In these cases, it may also be called Overuse Syndrome.\nCTS is also found in people who have suffered trauma to the hands, arm, or neck. It can also occur in pregnant women or people who experience a sudden weight change.\nNow that you have a better understanding of CTS, you can take a look at the different approaches in treating this common ailment. The medical approach may include a splint to immobilize the wrist or a prescription of diuretics (or anti -inflammatory drugs. Sometimes an injection of corticosteroids is prescribed to provide temporary relief. As a last resort, surgery may be performed. Recovery can take months or even years and there is no guarantee that your symptoms will not return.\nThe chiropractic approach is very different. As a chiropractor, I am more interested in finding out what is causing the symptom than in simply treating the symptom. The first area I examine in a CTS case is not the wrist, but the neck. It is here that a group of nerves known as the brachial plexus comes out of the mid to lower neck region, then\nbranches out to the arms, hands and fingers.\nIf there is pressure on any of these nerves, especially the median nerve, the result may be CTS. It is not uncommon to have neck involvement when the symptoms occur in both hands. Likewise, if there is pressure on the nerves in the shoulder area, elbows, or wrist, the symptoms may also appear. As a chiropractor, I adjust the bones of the neck, known as the vertebrae, to relieve the pressure on nerves involved. It has been shown to be very effective in treating CTS by manipulating the various carpal bones in the wrist to reduce the pressure on the tunnel itself. These small bones can easily become displaced, resulting in CTS. Taping, splinting and various forms of physical therapy can also be used.\nIt is also an important part of treatment to determine how CTS was first developed. For instance, if a patient develops CTS because they sit in front of a computer all day, it is important to determine if the chair, desk, keyboard, screen, etc. are set up properly.\nIn conclusion, I feel that the chiropractic approach is an excellent choice for the treatment of CTS. It should definitely be considered before more aggressive treatment such as drugs or surgeries are attempted. Please contact me if you are suffering from any symptoms of CTS.\n\u00a92009 Dr. Harvey\n"}, {"score": 2102.2935, "uuid": "2eba05f3-b6e0-5b46-a517-0a99af28d85d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1011wb-64-34984", "target_hostname": "www.drharvey.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drharvey.com/Pages/Articles/ChiropraticTechniques.html", "page_rank": 1.7353091e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "San Diego chiropractor, <em>physical</em> <em>therapy</em>, spine adjustment, <em>pain</em> relief", "snippet": "| High Blood Pressure How Your Body Heals | Kids <em>Chiropractic</em> | Latrogenic Disease | Low <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em> | Spinal Arthitis | Sciatica | Scoliosis | Shoulder <em>Pain</em>", "explanation": null, "document": "Chiropractic Techniques\nQuestion: Dear Dr. Harvey,\nI have been to a number of different chiropractors over the years. I have noticed that they all have very different approaches in regard to their diagnosis and treatments. Could you tell me what approach you use and what some of the differences are?\nAnswer:\nThere are a number of different approaches to chiropractic. We refer to them as chiropractic techniques. A technique is a combination of different adjustments, x-ray analysis, case management and philosophies. Some chiropractors adjust by hand only, while some use instruments. Most take x-rays and analyze them, some do not. Commonly, chiropractors use a combination of adjusting with some form of therapy such as heat or cold, massage, ultrasound, etc. Some only adjust. Many chiropractors are heavily involved in nutrition, exercise, and education.\nWhatever the technique may be, it may not work for all people. A very important point here is that if you have tried chiropractic and did not get the results you were looking for, TRY ANOTHER CHIROPRACTOR!\nChiropractic works - it is not a belief. Some people have tried one chiropractor and did not get the results they wanted and gave up on chiropractic. However, if you go to a dentist and don't get good results, you simply find another dentist - you don't give up on dentistry.\nIn our clinic, all the chiropractors use the Gonstead technique. Gonstead is a very specific technique of finding and correcting the subluxation. We do a complete exam and x-rays on all our patients (except infants and pregnant women). We then do a complete analysis of the x-rays and present all this to the patient in a report of findings. We also do a great deal of patient education.\nWe adjust the full spine and extremities specifically by hand only. One of the main differences between Gonstead and other techniques is that we always adjust the neck while the patient is seated, not lying down. We find this to be a better approach.\nGonstead is also a very complex system of addressing the case management of the patient. Gonstead doctors from all over the world get together on a regular basis to discuss difficult case and treatment approaches.\nIn our office we also have acupuncture, massage therapy, oriental medicine and herbology. If you would like to experience the Gonstead technique, please contact our clinic. You will be glad you did.\n\u00a92009 Dr. Harvey\n"}, {"score": 2103.3535, "uuid": "efb3f954-6ac0-5459-b234-0e87c9d9a627", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1213wb-08-12240", "target_hostname": "www.unitedtherapyassociates.net", "target_uri": "http://www.unitedtherapyassociates.net/chiropractictreatment.html", "page_rank": 1.3809959e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Chiropractic</em> Treatment - United <em>Therapy</em> Associates, P.A.", "snippet": "Saez can help you feel <em>better</em>.

We welcome patients of all ages, from children to the elderly, and if you are new to chiropractic, we\u2019d love to explain how it works.\nChiropractic care is a natural form of health care that focuses on restoring proper motion of the body\u2019s joints \u2014primarily the spine\u2014to allow for natural movement and function. When the joints of the body do not move or function properly, pain can often result. The Chiropractic philosophy is that when joints function properly, normal pain-free movement occurs. A chiropractor identifies the source of joint related difficulty and restores joint movement by gently moving the joint manually, with soft-tissue techniques or physical therapy modalities.\nWhat is the treatment?\nUsing a number of gentle hands-on techniques such as, manipulation, joint mobilization and soft tissue techniques, flexibility and strengthening activities, electrical muscle stimulation and ultrasound- Dr. Saez can help you feel better. Dr. Saez is a chiropractor with physical therapy privileges, which allows him to use a comprehensive approach to diagnose and treat many conditions.\nWhy Chiropractic?\nOur bodies are made for motion. When your joints do not move adequately, or move improperly, our muscular and joint systems are compromised, which can lead to various physical problems, including pain (either local or radiating), stiffness, parasthesias (tingling and numbness), headaches, weakness and a variety of other symptoms.\nIs it safe?\nChiropractic treatments are remarkably safe\u2014actually, they\u2019re one of the safest kinds of health care available.\nHow is the Chiropractor educated?\nChiropractors earn a doctorate degree with extensive training that consists of 4700 hours of classroom and clinical study to fully understand the human body and how it functions. According to the American Chiropractic Association, more than 30 million people visited doctors of chiropractic last year for a variety of conditions, and more and more medical doctors are referring their patients to doctors of chiropractic.\nWhat conditions can be treated?\nChiropractic treatment is successfully used to treat headaches, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, shoulder and hip pain, tingling or numbness, arm and leg pain, scoliosis, and a variety of other health issues.\nDr. Saez has been practicing in the Baltimore area for 15 years. He has accumulated experience and numerous skills to diagnose and successfully treat a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions.

In order to prove to you that chiropractic works, I gathered evidence from peer-reviewed medical journals that use evidence-based guidelines to convince and open the minds of even the most guarded chiropractic skeptics.\nIn a joint effort, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service and Agency for Health Care Policy and Research put out clinical practice guidelines for acute low back pain, which stated that chiropractic adjustment (spinal manipulation) is the only doctor-delivered method of treatment shown to both relieve pain and improve function.\nIn 2007, a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society recognized spinal manipulation as a treatment method \u201cof proven benefit\u201d in low back pain. Although several other conservative treatment methods (acupuncture, cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise therapy, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, massage therapy, progressive relaxation and yoga) were investigated, only spinal manipulation was recognized as an effective treatment for acute, sub-acute and chronic cases of low back pain.\nNot enough evidence?\nIn 2010, the award winning research by Bishop and colleagues on acute mechanical low back pain concluded that \u201ctreatment including CSMT [chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy] is associated with significantly greater improvement in condition-specific functioning.\u201d\u00a0 This study was published in The Spine Journal, one of the most prestigious and frequently cited medical spine journals in the world.\nStill not enough proof?\nI leave you with one final report: the people\u2019s word! In 2009, The Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center surveyed more than 14,000 subscribers who experienced low back pain within the past year. Participants tried an average of 5-6 different treatments over the course of a year and were asked to rate the treatments (23 treatments in total including physical therapist, massage therapist, acupuncturist, primary care physician, specialist physician, etc.). Chiropractors were ranked #1 with the highest percentage of participants reporting that they were very or completely satisfied with their chiropractic low back pain treatment.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg in research supporting the necessity and benefits of chiropractic in helping with low back pain. An abundance of studies continues to prove that chiropractic works. Spinal adjustment releases endorphins, restores crucial biochemical functions and reduces pressure on your nerves. So if you live or work in NYC the next time you experience back pain, visit Dr. John Vilkelis or Dr. Peter Kim, and see for yourself!\n"}, {"score": 2102.9683, "uuid": "6fe04140-be44-5355-873a-bc55f6b3e9c4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400wb-12-17981", "target_hostname": "connection.ebscohost.com", "target_uri": "http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9710166134/stretch-away-back-pain", "page_rank": 1.1736285e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Stretch away <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> - Tags: EXERCISE <em>therapy</em> BACKACHE -- Treatment", "snippet": "According to the survey, 58% people surveyed rated <em>chiropractic</em> <em>or</em> spinal manipulation as helping a lot, while 48% showed their... * Don&#x27;t Be Puzzled by <em>Back</em> <em>Pain</em>: A <em>physical</em> therapist can determine the source of your <em>back</em> <em>pain</em> and help you alleviate it.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ease lower back pain.
