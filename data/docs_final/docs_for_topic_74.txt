Following in the wake of London garnering the prestigious \"World's Best Destination\" award at the 17th annual World Travel Awards gala held November 7, 2010, comes that official finding from a survey commissioned by the French themselves.\nAs chronicled by BreakingTravelNews.com on November 19, French officials have conceded that London offers a better tourism experience than Paris. The report, titled \u201cTwenty Four Hours in a Tourist Capital,\" was authorized by the Paris-Ile de France Regional Tourism Committee (CRT). It placed London first ahead of the five other European cities of Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, and Berlin.\nIn the French report, London is accepted as the more impressive city in every aspect, from its restaurants and taxis to its landmarks such as Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, and the famous Tower of London. The findings come despite Parisians boasting that nowhere beats their restaurants and tourist attractions, such as the Eiffel Tower.\nIn the survey London scored 82% for its welcome to visitors from abroad. This was followed by Paris and Amsterdam in joint second place on 79%. Madrid and Rome were tied at third, both with 76%, while Berlin was last with 74%.\nUndercover French investigators concluded that public transport in Paris was poor, with tickets difficult to buy and the Metro old and dirty. Hotels scored 74% compared with 89% for those in London.\nCommittee head Jean-Pierre Blat said: \u201cThe survey reflects reality. Paris knows how to welcome visitors but there are definite improvements to make.\u201d He also suggested the French were often the most critical of their own capital, which may explain the result.\nThe main fault found in London was the lack of foreign languages. Mr Blat said: \u201cIn Paris, besides French we speak English, Italian, and Spanish, while in London they only speak English.\u201d\nThe BTN article also announced a new way to have access to travel information about London, with the launch of a new mobile site: London.mobi. The site is the latest in the line up of city guides from World Mobi, with over 800 cities in 200 countries listed, including Brussels.Mobi, Sanfrancisco.Mobi and Sydney.Mobi.\nWorld Mobi guides include user reviews and traveler utilities such as a translation guide, currency converter, news and local weather guide. Other key features include information on accommodation, restaurants, attractions, entertainment, nightlife, shopping, and transport.\n(Photo credit \u2013 sdkbphotography.com on Flickr)\n"}, {"score": 1529.4083, "uuid": "2d066105-190e-548b-8941-0d48a6a004f5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800wb-05-10928", "target_hostname": "jeremiekubicek.com", "target_uri": "http://jeremiekubicek.com/city-perspective-london-versus-paris/", "page_rank": 1.1804294e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>City</em> Perspective: <em>London</em> versus <em>Paris</em> | Jeremie Kubicek", "snippet": "When you consider food, people, sights and ambience, <em>Paris</em> wins hands down.

In our case, each of these elements were amazing. And thus, it was easy to fairly judge London and Paris, respectively.\nHistorical Influence: London or Paris\nWhen you think of the histories of both cities it is easy to argue that each of them have equal significance over the course of time. Each city has played a vital role in our world. However, London has been central command of one of the largest empires in the history of our world. Therefore, I would claim that London is much stronger in historical significance than Paris.\nCurrent Influence: London or Paris\nWhen you think of current influence you must also think of the governments of each country, England and France, as well as the leaders of each country. While England continues to have a global influence, the current president of France, Sarkozy, is embarking on a new strategy of influence for the French. Thus, I would claim that it might be a wash between the two, with London being slightly ahead.\nBest City to Visit: London or Paris\nWhen you consider food, people, sights and ambience, Paris wins hands down. While London boasts great theater and charming buildings amongst its history, Paris is much easier to visit and much more laid back.\nBest Business City: London or Paris\nLondon is by far the better city for business. Not speaking English, nor tolerating it, truly hurts Paris\u2019 impact on the business world. London is a prime city for global business.\nWhich one would I go back to next weekend?\nHands down \u2013 Paris. While London wins most of the above topics, I would go back to Paris for its charm, food (crepes and pastries), and sights. It is an amazing city for rest and relaxation.\nBoth cities are amazing. I recommend them both. It will be interesting to see the role each plays over the next 25 years.\nShare this post with others...\nRelated posts:\nGod\u2019s Economy\nAbout Jeremie Kubicek\nJeremie Kubicek is the President & CEO of GiANT Impact, co-founder of GiANT Partners, and author of \" Leadership is Dead: How Influence is Reviving It. \" Follow Jeremie on Twitter , Facebook , LinkedIn , and/or Subscribe to this Blogs RSS Feeds .\nPopular\n"}, {"score": 1487.3552, "uuid": "a229cbb4-6fb9-569b-a1ea-e20335fad918", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1713wb-94-21611", "target_hostname": "www.sophiastravel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sophiastravel.com/html/Europe/TauckPDLondonParis.htm", "page_rank": 1.1957499e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Tauck <em>London</em>, <em>London</em> and <em>Paris</em>", "snippet": "Spend your free afternoon in <em>London</em> visiting famed gardens, museums, <em>or</em> historic sites.

These include American Airlines, Air France, Aerolineas Argentinas, Alitalia, Finnair, British Airways, British Midland Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Aer Lingus, Icelandair, Iberia, Spanair, Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines Ltd., Northwest, Air New Zealand, Olympic Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Taca International Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, US Airways, Air Europa, and Virgin Atlantic. You'll receive flight information as your departure date approaches.\nHow many people travel in a group?\nACIS groups average anywhere from 35 to 45 participants traveling together on a bus, led by an ACIS Tour Manager. Small groups are often combined to create one bus group. This is the group with whom you share your travel experience. You eat your meals together, stay in the same accommodations, and travel together on the bus. It's an opportunity to make lifelong friendships!\nTell us more about the tour manager.\n\"Tour manager\" is an important term in educational travel. It refers to your bus group leader, who is rigorously trained and specially selected to assist your group while overseas. ACIS Tour Managers are famous for their multifaceted roles, both educational and logistical. An ACIS Tour Manager is part commentator, counselor, troubleshooter, advocate, and stopwatch! He or she supervises hotel check-ins, directs the bus driver and leads educational activities.\nMost importantly, ACIS Tour Managers are travel gurus. They thrive on sharing their passion and love for the cultures of the world, giving you the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of those who live and work there. Over the years, we've employed university professors, film directors, journalists, musicians, business professionals, and other creative achievers. Our tour managers are consistently recognized as top in the industry. You'll receive more information about your tour manager as your departure date approaches.\nYour ACIS Tour Manager maintains a professional relationship with the group but is not directly responsible for enforcing discipline or the ACIS behavior guidelines. That is the responsibility of the your group leader. It is your tour manager's responsibility, however, to report to your group leader any infractions and to be sure that ACIS behavior guidelines are adhered to.\nWhere do we stay?\nACIS groups stay in three- and four-star conveniently located hotels. We place a priority on booking hotels in good locations and safe areas, with convenient access to both local attractions and public transportation.\nStudents generally stay in rooms with two or three beds. During peak travel periods, hotels sometimes add an extra bed to accommodate heavy bookings. ACIS attempts to prevent this but cannot guarantee that it will never happen. Some hotel rooms in France have a Grand Lit (an oversize double bed for two) instead of twin beds. Those who have paid the adult surcharge stay in double rooms in hotels but not on overnight ferries or trains.\nAn ACIS bus group is typically made up of two, three, or four groups from around the U.S. who quickly get to know each other and feel part of one overall group. Depending on the mix of male and female students in the bus group, students may be rooming with participants from other groups. Don't worry, this is a great way to meet new people and make some new friends!\nThe group leader will create a variety of rooming combinations before you leave, in order to make it easier for your tour manager to work out the rooming when you check in to your hotel.\nCheck-in time at most hotels is early to mid-afternoon. If you arrive overseas early in the morning, you likely have time to change money and do some exploring before you check in.\nWhat will we have to eat?\nYou will enjoy a variety of meals en route, mixing both native and familiar cuisines depending on your area of travel. Keep an open mind and be willing to sample everything\u2014that's what travel is all about!\nMost days you will be served a continental breakfast that includes a variety of fresh rolls, cereal, pastry, butter and jam, coffee, tea or hot chocolate. In Australia and China, you will be served an American-style hot buffet breakfast. On trips to the Americas you may be served the traditional rice and beans. In some hotels in Britain, eggs or other items may be included. In Europe, the larger hotels sometimes serve eggs and other American-style breakfast items for an extra charge.\nOn most ACIS trips, you will enjoy lunch on your own. Be adventurous and experiment. Many travelers do what the locals do; instead of having an expensive restaurant meal, they buy fresh ingredients at a local market, then put together a sandwich and have a picnic lunch in a city park.\nOn most tours, beverages at dinner are not included. The are included on tours to China, Costa Rica, Peru, and occasionally other destinations. Sometimes your waiter may put soda or mineral water down on the table without being asked. Be aware that you will be charged for any beverages you consume.\nAlthough ACIS will try to accommodate special-needs meals including kosher, vegetarian and low salt, we cannot guarantee all requests.\nHow much spending money will I need?\nSpending needs vary depending on personal habits, but a typical allowance is $50 per day. This allows for lunch, snacks, soft drinks, postage, souvenirs, local transportation during free time, free-time activities, and optional excursions not already included in your itinerary. Most ACIS participants carry ATM cards, travelers checks and credit cards. ACIS has compiled all the information you need to know in Money Matters .\nWhat should I pack?\nOur advice is to pack light\u2014you won't regret it!

This time we visited London, Paris, and Barcelona. Luckily we had great weather for late November. The hotels in Paris (Manufacture) and Barcelona (Silken) definitely exceeded expectations. Both had terrific staff, rooms and service. The hotel in London (Garden View) was fine. The hotel provided breakfast but I would recommend skipping it. Still it was pretty and it a nice location. - The flights to and from New York were comfortable. We loved (and definitely recommend) the night train from Paris to Barcelona. We upgraded to a private room which came with a wonderful breakfast at sunrise. It was a perfect way to reach Barcelona and the upgrade didn`t add a lot to the cost of the trip. We`re already researching our next trip with you!\nMARY JANE MORRILL\n"}, {"score": 1257.6755, "uuid": "ae622556-5db1-5e1c-9f77-3e18d0c9e393", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1610wb-36-14376", "target_hostname": "www.europeandestinations.com", "target_uri": "http://www.europeandestinations.com/Scotland/Itinerary_pk26586_Edinburgh_-_London_-_Paris.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1786647e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Edinburgh - <em>London</em> - <em>Paris</em>- Customizable Itinerary", "snippet": "<em>Paris</em> <em>is</em> a <em>city</em> of vast perspectives and intimate streets, of formal espaces verts (green open spaces) and of quiet squares. <em>Paris</em> <em>is</em> relatively small as capitals go, with distances between many of its major sights and museums invariably walkable.", "explanation": null, "document": "close X\nTournet is the engine that runs our applications.

I have never been\u2026 to the city, of course. But spurred on by a week\u2019s holiday I have to take before the end of the financial year and the fact I have always wanted to go \u2013 I am off to visit.\nSo, with the world literally at my finger tips, I thought it would be best to do some research into the land of crepes, garlic and interesting culinary tastes before I go, and sharing what I found might give you some food for thought.\nChoosing a hotel\nNow the first thing I found out is that PARIS IS EXPENSIVE! Fair enough, I want to stay somewhere central and close to the action, but averaging around \u00a375 a night for a 3 star hotel is a little steep. I did find some better deals, but without actually checking them out first hand I can only go on the reviews, therefore do not want to comment on specific hotels in this post.\nBeing that I am only going for a long weekend (in March) I found a great deal for 3 nights at one of the better looking 4 star central Paris Hotels I came across, cheaper than a few of the 3 star ones ;). No real groundbreaking advice on choosing a hotel, apart from, as I did, get a personal referral. My friend recommended my accommodation, and unless my friend has a wicked sense of humour, I trust all will be well.\nFinding things to do\nI am going to Paris by myself. Slightly ironic for one of the most romantic cites in the world. However, I am reliably informed Paris is one of the better cities to visit alone, because you can lose yourself and blend into the general City buzz. I won\u2019t sit here and bore you with a list of Paris landmarks, if you are reading this, you probably know them all. But what I will say is, don\u2019t be afraid to go somewhere alone, take your camera and have some \u2018you time\u2019. Another idea, which may seem obvious, is to put out on your social networks that you are visiting somewhere. Sometimes you don\u2019t know or even forget that people you know are actually living in the place you are visiting. When I was travelling in South-East-Asia I found out through Facebook that my friend was actually on the next beach along from us in Thailand, so went to meet him for a beer. Luckily I have a couple of friends in Paris, so I hope to meet up with them. Here is my main \u2018to do\u2019 list whilst I am there:\nMeet up with old friends;\nEat a Snail;\nSpeak to a stranger in French;\nWalk around the Eiffel Tower at night;\nSee the Mona Lisa (probably overrated, but hey);\nEat lots of Crepes, just because.\nWhere to eat cheap?\nIt may be tough to do this in Paris , but I am definitely going on a shoestring budget. My suggestion is to take your own food, a box of cereal will save you on eating out for breakfast, unless it is included in your Hotel of course. If you do have a small budget, and are more about the experience, than the luxuries of a \u2018holiday\u2019 I would consider taking a box of pasta or rice and some tinned tomatoes to really save on some lunch and dinners, remember we eat to live, and spending loads of money on food instead of experiences you will never forget would be wrong.\nI will certainly let you know how I get on when I return from my trip in March!\nImage credit: TaylorMiles via Flickr\n"}, {"score": 1268.9739, "uuid": "60f41f92-654b-5fb3-846e-6d074813abab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-86-23805", "target_hostname": "www.acis.com", "target_uri": "http://www.acis.com/trips/itinerary/program/EX3", "page_rank": 1.1725813e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "ACIS - <em>London</em>, <em>Paris</em> and Madrid", "snippet": "The Eiffel Tower <em>is</em> an iconic symbol of <em>Paris</em>, but lines to go to the top can be long and tiresome.

Kearney Global Cities Index\nBeijing and Shanghai may rival top global cities in 10 \u2014 20 years\nNew York and London remain the world\u2019s most global cities, while major emerging-market cities strengthened their ability to challenge global leaders in the next 10 to 20 years, according to the 2012 A.T. Kearney Global Cities Index which was released today in collaboration with Bloomberg.\nThe Global Cities Index, conducted every two years since 2008, provides a unique measure of global engagement for 66 cities across five dimensions\u2014Business Activity, Human Capital, Information Exchange, Cultural Experience, and Political Engagement. The 2012 Global Cities Index was developed by A.T. Kearney and The Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\nRachel Bronson, Chicago Council on Global Affairs Vice President of Studies noted, \u201c While most other city rankings limit their focus to business or quality of life measures, the Global Cities Index provides a holistic look at what differentiates cities in generating, attracting and retaining global capital, people, and ideas.\u201d\nThe 2012 edition of the Global Cities Index includes the Emerging Cities Outlook 2012, a forward looking measurement of emerging cities that have the potential to improve their global standing in future years. Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei top this newly introduced perspective.\nMike Hales, A.T. Kearney partner and study co-leader commented, \u201cThe Global Cities Index is a tool that business executives can use to identify locations for regional headquarters that have the potential to attract and retain top talent. Many cities are also using the Global Cities Index to benchmark their development initiatives.\u201d\nFindings from the 2012 Global Cities Index\nDespite the financial turmoil of the past few years, New York and London have consistently led the rankings in all three editions of the Global Cities Index. Paris and Tokyo, although they alternate positions this year, are always far above the rest of the top ten. The top four cities demonstrate that having a balanced portfolio of strengths across several dimensions of globalization allows these cities to hold their positions at the top of the Index despite the recent global financial turmoil.\nThe table below provides the complete rankings for the world\u2019s top 35 cities.\nAsian cities continued to perform well in the Global Cities Index, with at least three Asian cities featured in the top ten in all three editions of the Index. These results demonstrate the stability of Asia\u2019s significance on the world stage.\nGermany is the only European country with three cities ranking in the top half of the 2012 Index, although no German city has ever been ranked among the top 10 Global Cities. One of the linchpins of the Global Cities Ranking is the notion that globalization represents a transfer of power from national states to a network of global cities. Germany demonstrates this concept with Berlin (#20), Frankfurt (#23), and Munich (#31) representing a network of cities that should drive continued national success.\nCities in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) continue to work their way to the top of the Index at varying paces. Similar to their performance in prior Index rankings, the BRIC cities\u2019 rise is driven by their strength in business activity, rather than the other dimensions that make for a more well-rounded global city. Strong business activity should drive future development of the other dimensions, leading to the development of cultural institutions and international policy institutes.\nFindings from the Emerging Cities Outlook 2012\nThe Emerging Cities Outlook gauges each city\u2019s rate of change by measuring factors that will affect the future of two Index dimensions: Business Activity and Human Capital.

The result of this preservation of the past has created the beautiful and historic city as we now know it, with its unique perspectives, geometric squares, sculptures and monuments. This tour concentrates on showing Paris from two different angles: from above and below. From the Eiffel Tower, enjoy a 360-degree panoramic aerial view of the capital. From the Seine river cruise, visitors will be captivated by an up-close-and-personal view of the monuments and bridges.\nAdditional Information\n"}, {"score": 1182.1492, "uuid": "8eb7a126-1e6b-5cbe-b4ba-024c78c72cc3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700wb-95-04565", "target_hostname": "www.speedace.info", "target_uri": "http://www.speedace.info/london.htm", "page_rank": 1.1931357e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>LONDON</em> <em>CITY</em> ENGLAND", "snippet": "On census day, 2001, the <em>City</em> and the 32 boroughs (some 1579 km2 <em>or</em> 610 sq miles) had 7,172,036 inhabitants, making <em>London</em> one of the most populous <em>cities</em> in Europe alongside Moscow, Istanbul and <em>Paris</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "HOME | INDEX | AUTOMOTIVE | BLUEBIRD | ELECTRIC CARS | E. CYCLES | SOLAR CARS\nLondon \u0097 containing the City of London \u0097 is the capital of the United Kingdom and of England and is recognised as one of the key \"world cities\". With over seven million inhabitants (Londoners) in Greater London, it is the second-most populous conurbation in Europe, after Moscow. Founded as Londinium, the capital of the Roman province of Britannia, it later rose to become the centre of the British Empire. Today it generates over 17% of the GDP of the UK's economy, the world's fourth largest, and is a major financial centre along with New York and Tokyo. For several centuries, London has been one of the most influential powers in politics, finance, arts and fashion and remains so today.\nSatellite image of west London taken on NASA 's Landsat 7 satellite\nLOCATION\nThe term \"London\" was used for hundreds of years to refer to the conurbation centred on the small City of London in the historic county of Middlesex. Today, it usually refers to the administrative area known as Greater London, but is sometimes used to mean the area within the London postal district, the area covered by the 020 area code (formerly 0171 and 0181; before that 071 and 081; even earlier 01), the area covered by an all-zone Transport for London Travelcard, the area within the M25 motorway, or the larger London commuter belt.\nThe coordinates of the centre of London (traditionally considered to be Charing Cross, near Trafalgar Square) are approximately 51\u00b030' N, 0\u00b08' W although the Romans marked the centre with the London Stone in the City.\nHISTORY\nMain article: History of London\nThe city of Londinium was founded by the Romans on the north bank of the River Thames in around AD 50. Although there is no evidence of a large pre-Roman settlement, the name is thought to be pre-Roman. It is believed to have become the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in the early second century. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Roman city was virtually abandoned and a Saxon town named Lundenwic was established a mile or two west in the Aldwych area in the 7th century AD. The fortified Roman City of London was reoccupied around the late 9th or early 10th century, whereafter it resumed its role as England's biggest city (although not its capital - Winchester served as capital until the 12th century). In 1666, a devastating fire swept through the city, destroying a large part of it. Re-building the city took over 10 years but by the 18th century London was the largest city in the world.\nOver the years, London has increased dramatically in size, absorbing meadows, woodlands, villages and towns and spreading outwards in every direction. Outward growth has been physically interrupted (though by no means halted) through the definition of a Green Belt. In recent years development has been concentrated in the London Docklands and Thames Gateway areas of East London.\nLondon Millennium Bridge spanning the River Thames between\nTate Modern gallery and St. Pauls Cathedral\nMODERN LONDON\nToday the Greater London administrative area comprises the City of London and 32 London boroughs including the City of Westminster. The City of London, also known as the \"square mile\", is predominantly the financial centre, and geographically a very small area. Although bustling during the working week, the City of London is usually much calmer on the weekends.\nThe London that most tourists see is Central London, which comprises the historic City of London, the West End with all its theatres, shops and restaurants, the City of Westminster and its Royal palaces, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea with its museum quarter and Hyde Park and the newly emerging Bankside area of Southwark with the Globe Theatre, Tate Modern and other attractions.\nIn contrast, the East End has played host to successive waves of immigrants for centuries and contains some of the UK's most deprived areas. The Isle of Dogs is, however, witnessing unprecedented commercial change and many restaurants, music and comedy clubs are injecting a more varied atmosphere. See also gentrification. The East End is centred on the Borough of Tower Hamlets and Hackney.\nPOPULATION\nLondon was the most populous city in the world from 1825 until 1925, when it was overtaken by New York City.\nResidents of London are known as 'Londoners'. On census day, 2001, the City and the 32 boroughs (some 1579 km2 or 610 sq miles) had 7,172,036 inhabitants, making London one of the most populous cities in Europe alongside Moscow, Istanbul and Paris.\nIn the 2001 census 71% of these seven million people classed their ethnic group as white, 10% as Indian, Bangladeshi or Pakistani, 5% as black African, 5% as black Caribbean, 3% as mixed race and 1% as Chinese. The largest religious groupings are Christian (58.2%) and No Religion (15.8%). 21.8% of inhabitants were born outside the European Union.\nThe London metropolitan area (6,267 sq miles, 16,043 sq kilometers) had a population of 13,945,000 - larger than the combined populations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is the largest metropolitan area in Europe, and one of the World's largest 20. (external references:\n(http://www.demographia.com/dm-lonarea.htm), (http://www.lbwf.gov.uk/demography/census/london/london_boroughs_census2001.pdf))\nGOVERNMENT\nGreater London is divided into 32 London boroughs and the City of London, which are responsible for running most services in their respective areas.\nThe Greater London Authority (GLA) is the London-wide body responsible for co-ordinating the boroughs, and is responsible for running London-wide services such as emergency services, transport, and strategic planning.\nThe GLA consists of the elected Mayor of London and the elected London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor. The mayor is elected by the Supplementary Vote system while the assembly is elected by the Additional Member System.\nThe current mayor of London Ken Livingstone was elected as an independent candidate in 2000. Despite opposition from all the main political parties and the press, his enormous popularity with Londoners made the election a foregone conclusion. Expelled from the Labour Party after standing against the official Labour candidate in the 2000 election, he was re-admitted in 2004, and was re-elected as Mayor under the Labour banner in the election later that year.\nThe GLA was established in 2000 as a replacement for the former Greater London Council (GLC) which was established in 1965 and abolished in 1986 after several high-profile clashes between the GLC (also then lead by Livingstone) and the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher.\nBetween 1986-2000 there was no central administrative body for London, and it was governed in piecemeal fashion by the individual boroughs and unelected agencies.\nThe Mayor and the Assembly will likely be in conflict with one or more Boroughs from time to time: they had each enjoyed \"unitary status\" and a fair degree of autonomy since the GLC was abolished.\nHistorically London was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works (1855-1889) and then the London County Council (1889-1965).\nFrom the Boundary Commission of England and Wales: Population of London, 1881 (http://www.londonancestor.com/misc/bc-pop.htm)\nTRANSPORT\nAIRPORTS\nLondon City Airport, Heathrow, Biggin Hill, and Northolt lie within the London boundary. Of these, Heathrow is the city's principal airport and is also a major international hub. It is currently the busiest international terminal in the world, and a fifth terminal (with a sixth being proposed) is currently being built on the site.\nOther airports, such as London Gatwick Airport, London Luton Airport, and London Stansted Airport, as well as those at Manston and Southend, incorporate \"London\" into their name, but the towns where they are situated (Crawley, Luton and Stansted respectively) lie some distance from London.\nSpecial train stations built at Gatwick, Luton and Stansted help to offset their distance from the capital and thus spread scheduled airline services in a safe and manageable way across the region.\nRAIL\nLondon Underground at Green Park station\nThe London public transport system is one of the few systems in the world to be a tourist attraction in its own right; its infrastructure, however, is, and historically has been, financially stretched and under-resourced, leading to frequent difficulties and delays in making journeys. However, in recent years the London Rail/Tram network has seen substantial spending.\nLondon has a vast rail network, primarily split into four sections:\nMainline\nUnderground (known as the 'Tube')\nTramlink\nDocklands Light Rail\nTransport for London runs the London Underground (the world's first metro or underground rail network), also known as the Tube. Government proposals to place the Underground network under a \"public-private partnership\" arrangement have encountered widespread opposition.\nAll four parts of the rail network are undergoing major upgrades and expansions to counter London's congestion problems. Important examples include the Crossrail and Channel Tunnel Rail Link projects.\nROAD\nThe famous red double decker buses are now run by private companies, although it is a requirement that the buses still be painted (mostly) red. However the famous \"Routemasters\" have now mostly been taken out of service. London is also famous for its black cabs.\u00a0 Transport for London introduced a road pricing scheme called the Congestion Charge in February 2003, which is levied on traffic entering Central London during peak hours. The intention was to help alleviate chronic traffic congestion and initial indications are that traffic levels have dropped by over 10%.\nWATERWAYS\nThe River Thames flows through London on its way to the North Sea. The river is easily navigable and so London has historically been a major port.\u00a0 London has several smaller rivers which feed into the River Thames. However, many of these rivers have been built over, and so now only exist in underground pipes (see Subterranean rivers of London).\nLondon also has an extensive canal network, with important routes such as the Regent's Canal linking the Thames with other major rivers.\nSPORT\nLondon is home to 11 professional football clubs, which are named after the district in which they play (except for Arsenal, who play in Highbury, Chelsea who play in fulham, and Crystal Palace who play in Norwood). Those currently in the top division (the Premier League) are Arsenal, Charlton Athletic, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, and Tottenham Hotspur. The clubs outside the Premier League are Brentford, Millwall, Queens Park Rangers, Leyton Orient and West Ham United - all of whom have at one time played in the top division. Wimbledon F.C., in an extremely controversial move, left London in 2003 to play in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, changing their name to Milton Keynes Dons F.C., and the newly formed AFC Wimbledon inherited most of their support, despite playing at a much lower level in the football pyramid. London hosted the World Cup Final in 1966, the European Football Championship in 1996 and the European Cup final in 1968 & 1978 and 1992.\nLondon is also home to many major sporting venues including Lord's, home of Middlesex and the Marylebone Cricket Club, and The Oval, home of Surrey. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which hosts the Wimbledon Championships, is based in Wimbledon. Twickenham is the home of English Rugby Union and Wembley Stadium, currently being rebuilt, is the home for international football and Rugby League. London hosts one of the world's largest mass-participation road races, the London Marathon.\nLondon has twice hosted the Summer Olympics, in 1908 and 1948. It is one of the cities bidding to host the 2012 Games.\nCulture\nMusic\nLondon has five professional symphony orchestras; the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. There are also several chamber orchestras, some of which specialise in period instrument performances, including the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields.\nThe principal orchestral music venues are the Royal Festival Hall, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, which are both in the the South Bank Centre; the Barbican Centre; and the Royal Albert Hall, which hosts the Proms each Summer. Chamber music venues include the Purcell Room at the South Bank Centre; the Wigmore Hall and St. John's, Smith Square.\nThe Royal Opera House at Covent Garden is home to the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet. The other main opera company is the English National Opera. In the summer opera is performed in a temporary pavillion by Holland Park Opera, and there are irregular performances by visting opera companies and small freelance prefessional opera companies.\u00a0 The major venues for modern dance productions include the Sadler's Wells Theatre and the Barbican Centre.\nTheatre\nThere are over three dozen major theatres, most concentrated in the West End (see the articles West End Theatre and List of London venues). West End theatres are commercial ventures and show a mixture of musicals, comedy and serious drama. The subsidised or non-commerical theatre includes the National Theatre, which is based at the South Bank; the Royal Shakespeare Company which is based in Stratford, but presents seasons in London; The Globe, a modern reconstruction of the home of Shakespeare's troupe; The Royal Court Theatre which specialises in new drama; the Old Vic; and the Young Vic. London also boasts a vibrant fringe theatre culture including places such as the Battersea Arts Centre, The UCL Bloomsbury, The Place, and Tricycle Theatre.\nArt\nThe British National collection of Western Art to 1900 is held at the The National Gallery. Other major collections of pre-1900 art are The Wallace Collection; the Courtauld Gallery at the Courtauld Institute of Art; and Dulwich Picture Gallery. The national collection of post-1900 art is at Tate Modern and the national collection of British Art is at Tate Britain. The National Portrait Gallery has a collection of portraits of all periods.\u00a0 In addition to Tate Modern major contemporary art venues include White Cube, the Saatchi Gallery, and The ICA.\nWestminster Abbey\nMUSEUMS\nThe main museums include the British Museum (antiquities), the Victoria and Albert Museum (applied arts), the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, and the Museum of London. There are over 260 museums in London altogether.\nNight-life\nApart from the ubiquitous pubs and generic clubs, there are a number of famous music venues including Shepherds Bush Empire, Brixton Academy, Hammersmith Apollo, Wembley Arena, The Marquee, The UCL Bloomsbury, Mean Fiddler, Albert Hall and the London Astoria.\nBusiness\nThe City of London or \"Square Mile\" is the financial centre of London, with many banks, brokers, insurers and legal and accounting firms. A second financial district is developing at Canary Wharf to the east of central London. This is much smaller than City of London, but has equally prestigious occupants, including the global headquarters of HSBC .\nNon financial business headquarters are located throughout central London. Some are in City of London, but more are located further West, in and around Mayfair, St James's, The Strand and elsewhere. More than half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE) are headquartered in central London, and more than 70% in London's metro region. London is a leading global centre for professional services, and media and creative industries.\nTourism is one of the UK's largest industries, and in 2003 employed the equivalent of 350,000 full time workers in London http://www.visitbritain.com/\nWhile the Port of London is now only the third largest in the United Kingdom, rather than largest in the world, it still handles 50 million tonnes of cargo each year. The main docks are now at Tilbury which is outside the boundary of Greater London.\nLondon's economy generates 116,444 million pounds annually, and accounts for 17% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product - see Economy of the United Kingdom.

West served as SFI President from July 2005 through July 2009. Prior to joining the Santa Fe Institute as a Distinguished Professor in 2003, he was the leader, and founder, of the high energy physics group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he is one of only approximately ten Senior Fellows.\nHis long-term fascination in general scaling phenomena evolved into a highly productive collaboration on the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade biology from the molecular genomic scale up through mitochondria and cells to whole organisms and ecosystems. This led to the development of realistic quantitative models for the structural and functional design of organisms based on underlying universal principles. This work, begun at the Institute, has received much attention in both the scientific and popular press, and provides a framework for quantitative understanding of problems ranging from fundamental issues in biology (such as cell size, growth, metabolic rate, DNA nucleotide substitution rates, and the structure and dynamics of ecosystems) to questions at the forefront of medical research (such as aging, sleep, and cancer). Among his current interests is the extension of these ideas to understand quantitatively the structure and dynamics of social organizations, such as cities and corporations, including the relationships between economies of scale, growth, innovation and wealth creation and their implications for long-term survivability and sustainability.\nHe is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and was one of their Centenary Speakers in 2003. He has been a lecturer in many popular and distinguished scientist series worldwide, as well as at the World Economic Forum. Among recent honors he was a co-receiver of the Mercer Award from the Ecological Society of America, the Weldon Memorial Prize (2005), Oxford University and the Glenn Award for research on Aging. In 2006 he was named one of Time magazine's\"100 Most Influential People in the World\" and his work selected as one of the breakthrough ideas of 2007 by the Harvard Business Review. He is the author of several books, a visiting Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College, London, and an Associate Fellow of the Said Business School at Oxford University.\nWest received his BA from Cambridge University in 1961 and his doctorate from Stanford University in 1966, where he returned in 1970 to become a member of the faculty. West is married to Jacqueline West, a psychologist in private practice; they have two children: Joshua, a geologist at Oxford University and an Olympic silver-medalist, and Devorah, a political scientist at the Brookings Institute.\nFahd\n"}, {"score": 1151.8717, "uuid": "e5b80488-ac10-5acb-a93e-8c9e4f8e7228", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-99-07210", "target_hostname": "www.cushwake.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c19400008p&Language=EN&Country=DE", "page_rank": 1.1703695e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "C&amp;W European <em>Cities</em> Monitor 2008: <em>London</em>, <em>Paris</em> and Frankfurt the best", "snippet": "\u201cThis <em>is</em> a further clear indication that German <em>is</em> <em>better</em> than its reputation suggests\u201d.", "explanation": null, "document": "C&W European Cities Monitor 2008: London, Paris and Frankfurt the best business locations in Europe\n7 Oct, 2008, Frankfurt\nFrankfurt the third most popular European location for the past 19 years\n\u2022 Brussels now in the Top Five\n\u2022 Clear endorsement of Germany as a location\n\u2022 Many companies\u2019 sights set on Moscow\n\u2022 D\u00fcsseldorf up four places\n\u2022 Barcelona the city with the best quality of living\nFor the 19th consecutive occasion, London, Paris and Frankfurt have been voted the best business locations in Europe, as concluded by this year\u2019s \u201cEuropean Cities Monitor 2008\u201d study conducted by Cushman & Wakefield (C&W). Also in the top five most popular locations were Brussels which rose from sixth to fourth place and Barcelona which climbed to fifth place. The highest climbers in the ranking of the most popular locations for companies in Europe were Zurich which rose from 13th to 10th place, D\u00fcsseldorf rising from 16th to 12th place and Manchester climbing from 18th to 14th place. Hamburg was another German high-flyer in 17th place (20th in 2007). Many companies see Moscow as an important location for expansion.\nProperty portfolio managers and location strategists from the top levels of the 500 largest European firms were interviewed for the European Cities Monitor. A variety of factors were taken into account for the ranking including transport links, telecommunications, access to markets, office space costs, qualified staff and quality of living. London, which was number one in the overall ranking, scored top marks for twelve of these location factors. Brussels scored highly for its geographic and political position at the heart of Europe. The EU and NATO have their headquarters here, contributing indirectly to the relative economic stability enjoyed by the Belgian capital.\nGermany, which is home to a quarter of all European top 20 locations, was by far the most popular country. \u201cThere can be no a clearer endorsement of Germany as a location\u201d, states Martin Br\u00fchl, Managing Partner at C&W Germany, giving his opinion of the study\u2019s results. \u201cFive German cities are among the top 20 most popular European locations for companies: Frankfurt in third place, Berlin in eighth place, Munich in ninth place, climber Dusseldorf in 12th place (up from 16th in 2007) and Hamburg in 17th place (up from 20th in 2007).\u201d\nMost popular business locations in Europe, 2008\nLocation\nThe most important factors when choosing a location\nFactor\nEasy access to markets, customers or clients\n59\nTransport links with other cities and internationally\n53\nThe climate governments create for business through tax policies or financial incentives\n27\nValue for money of office space\n26\nEase of travelling around within the city\n25\nThe quality of life for employees\n21\n18\n16\nIn 2008, qualified employees were once again the most important factor in choosing a location. This was followed in the ranking of the most significant factors by easy access to markets and customers, quality of telecommunications, good transport links and employee costs. With the exception of employee costs (here Warsaw was in first place, Bucharest in second place and Budapest in third place) London, Paris and Frankfurt took the first three places in these critical categories.\nHowever, one German city took first place in two categories this year: Berlin is the best European location for office space and is the best city for expatriates.\nThe city which had made the greatest improvement since last year was Barcelona. Last year, Madrid was still ahead of the field.\nThe most important place for expansion within Europe and for the next five years was Moscow. In terms of expansion outside Europe, Shanghai is high on strategists\u2019 lists of priorities.\nQualified staff Germany\u2019s trump card\n\u201cAmong the ten European locations with the highest numbers of qualified staff available to companies, the top five are in Germany\u201d, adds Mr Br\u00fchl. \u201cThis is a further clear indication that German is better than its reputation suggests\u201d.\n\u201cAs in other countries, it appears that little will change in Germany in terms of the positioning of the major cities in the popularity ranking in the next few years\u201d, states Inga Schwarz, researcher at C&W Germany. \u201cHowever, we should not forget that regional centres throughout Europe are gaining in importance and appeal for larger companies owing to their cost-conscious business climate and \u2018soft factors\u2019 such as quality of living.\u201d\nGreen Building\nThis year\u2019s European Cities Monitor also looked at the topic of sustainability for the first time. 15% of those questioned stated that their company owns or has leased a sustainable building, 45% do not use a sustainable building but are susceptible to the idea, and 32% do not use a sustainable building and are not interested in doing so.\nFor 35% of those questioned, the most important aspects of a green building were reductions in energy and water consumption whereas 13% stated that lower running costs were the priority.\n11% of all companies regarded the most important factor in opting for \u201cpro green building\u201d as being the improved travel planning offered by such business locations.\nThere are currently still many barriers to relocating to green buildings. 19% of all those questioned stated that the poor availability of sustainable properties is a major impediment, for 17%, it takes too long for their investments in sustainable buildings to pay off, 16% state that rents are too high in comparison with standard buildings and 15% are not entirely sure what the criteria for a sustainable building are.\nFree ECM download\nThe study can be downloaded free of charge from the C&W Knowledge Center at: http://www.cushmanwakefield.com/cwglobal/jsp/kcLanding.jsp?Country=DE&Language=DE&pageType=null&lhsImgAltKey=null&lhsImg=null\nStudy Details\nThe study has been conducted on an annual basis since 1990 and published by C&W.

Approximately 67 millions of travelers arrive and depart from it every year to either enjoy all the great things the the UK has to offer, or to venture to some foreign lands. And it is a well known fact that the airport is making an impact on anyone who has ever passed its gates. No tourist can leave it untouched, either by its size, splendor or just the wonderful organization and how well the place is run.\nCity breaks are closely connected with airports. It\u2019s almost impossible to get to any foreign city in any other way these days, especially those quite far away. In this article I want to tell you more about my personal experiences with Heathrow airport and what makes it so special in my view.\nThe History of Heathrow Airport\nStarting off with some historical data though, Heathrow airport started off as a small airfield and it was 15 years later that it was selected for further development, first as a long distance military airbase, then as the airport we know it today. As an interesting fact, it is the terminal 3 that stands the closest to the original location of the small airfield that started it all.\nHeathrow is divided into 4 terminals. The first one handles all domestic flights. Terminal 2 is used for non UK carriers. Terminal 3 is where you go if you are on a long haul journey to the US and the last one caters to most British Airways flights plus some selected European services.\nIn total there are 90 airlines using the Heathrow airport today flying to 170 destinations worldwide.\nAs someone who has used Heathrow airport on a number of occasions, there are certain things that make me feel amazed there. Their order, the non chaotic way of handling large number of travelers. Needless to say, even though some small things can irritate there, it is admirable how the airport staff is able to orderly manage all the people there.\nServices and facilities on the Heathrow airport are quite amazing. You can find the abundance of restaurants with diverse choice of foods, shops and various services that can take your mind off your forthcoming journey. There are also the lounges, that offer a bit of peace and quiet in the middle of this hectic place.\nHeathrow airport is a fascinating place and if you ever get a chance to be there, I am sure you will know what I mean.\nMore info on Heathrow Airport\nThe most in depth knowledge base about Heathrow Airport is probably the official website, however, Wikipedia has some extensive information about it as well.\n"}, {"score": 1148.5708, "uuid": "1b0fe99c-0b17-5089-ab2e-2420dcf59175", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-46-10064", "target_hostname": "london.cafebabel.com", "target_uri": "http://london.cafebabel.com/en/category/Guide-to-London", "page_rank": 1.6384274e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>London</em> <em>is</em>... - Cafe Babel <em>London</em>", "snippet": "Another offbeat thing to do in <em>London</em> <em>is</em> to check out the British Science Museum&#x27;s exhibits on the history of medicine.

When we sit down, and I ask her about the initiative, her eyes brighten up.\n\u201cWe are fairly young,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut the immediate attention the campaign has generated has been fantastic.\u201d \u201cThe other day, for example, I was attending a conference on climate change, and the speaker encouraged everyone to join Move Your Money. It was unexpected, but really inspiring.\u201d\nMove Your Money UK (MYM) is a British movement, led by a small group of young and talented people, whose main goal is to inform the UK public on alternative banking and transform the country's banking sector.\nDissatisfied with the way banks handle their customers\u2019 money, MYM originated as a protest against the current state of financial affairs, starting with the controversial system of bank bonuses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that banks such as RBS, which is largely owned by the government, do what they do with our money.\u201d\nThe campaign asks people to move their money from the big banks that commit unethical investments, such as financing companies with a poor human rights record, to more local, community-focussed and ethical alternatives: credit unions, mutually-owned banks, or banks that have explicit ethical commitments.\n\u201cThe aim is to reach out to UK citizens, and let them know that there are different ways for their hard-earned cash to be invested. Ways that can help their local community and where moving their money can have tangible effects that can be seen and touched.\u201d\nPrevious events organized by MYM have been a great success. \u201cA few weeks ago we organized initiatives outside of Barclays branches to raise public awareness, and the people\u2019s response was extraordinary.\u201d\nThe next event will take place this Thursday, on the 23rd of February, from 8:45 am to 9:15 am, outside of the Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s branch in High Holborn. \u201cWe hope to gather a large number of people, and spread the message further.\u201d\nStarting in March, MYM will organize \"Move your Money Month\", where it encourages people to choose a random day in March and pledge to move their money.\n\u201cThe fact that people from completely different backgrounds have participated to past gatherings highlights the fact that irresponsible and unethical banking is something which affects every single one of us, independent of our interests, politics, or age.\u201d\nBefore finishing our conversation, Julia reveals a secret to me: \u201cI personally want to inspire 100 people to move their money to more ethical institutions. I am just at the beginning, but if I convince enough people, I hope to make a big difference.\u201d\nJudging by the look of things, Julia will not have any problem achieving this.\n2012 - London's crucial year?\nThe upcoming mayoral elections and the 2012 London Olympics have put the City\u2019s public transport system at the heart of recent debate.\nSubject to scrutiny will be the transport system\u2019s efforts to cope under extreme duress during the Olympic events. Expecting an extra 20 million commuters, London Metro officials described the Olympics as \u201cthe biggest sustained logistical challenge since the Second World War.\u201d\nAs reporters commented: \u201dThe fact that the PowerPoint presentation by the transport secretary, Justine Greening, crashed as she underlined that point at the launch didn't necessarily inspire confidence.\u201d\nThe success of a series of initiatives, aimed at informing millions of fans in route to sporting competitions, will prove crucial for the positive outcome of the Event. Officials hope that the initiatives will cut at least 30% of traffic during the Olympic weeks.\nAdding fuel to the debate are the upcoming May elections for London Mayor. Ken Livingston, Boris Johnson\u2019s main political rival, frequently attacked his opponent on his stance on the City\u2019s public transport service.\nSince Johnson took office, fares have gone up by 7% angering most of the city\u2019s population. Observers have frequently stated that whoever will be more convincing on the area of public transport will bring home the victory.\nWith London being the most populous municipality of the European Union, the 2012 Olympics and the May Elections will prove decisive for all us Europeans living in the city.\n"}, {"score": 1138.3102, "uuid": "f8a95cbf-f959-5e53-8e48-60fdc64ee7c4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1415wb-07-06711", "target_hostname": "www.baseballadventures.com", "target_uri": "http://www.baseballadventures.com/france/france1.html", "page_rank": 1.490033e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Paris</em>, France, <em>London</em> Baseball Trip Summer 2010", "snippet": "In <em>Paris</em>, we&#x27;ll see all the major sites including the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, The Louvre, Champs-Elysees, Notre Dame Cathedral, Palace of Versailles, have a boat cruise on the Sine, and more. <em>Paris</em> <em>is</em> an easy <em>city</em> to get around in if you use the metro, <em>which</em> we will.", "explanation": null, "document": "Roster\nEiffel Tower\nThis is a custom designed trip for baseball players. It's the only one of it's kind so far to provide a baseball vacation in London and Paris.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, you'll have many opportunities to interact with local players. Baseball is a common medium between our cultures, even if you don't speak the language you'll be able to interact with the locals because they will speak baseball.\u00a0 We'll eat at some great restaurants, be entertained by a full time agenda, see some great sights and Play Baseball, Euro style.\nTrip is open to any adult person who plays baseball. The average age of our teams is usually in the mid 40's-50's.\u00a0 The trip is scheduled for July of 2010.\u00a0 Players, family members and tourists are all welcome.\u00a0 We'll be limiting ourselves to a maximum of 14-15 players. We will need 4-5 good pitchers, a couple of catchers and some good position players.\u00a0 Come as a team or come as a pool player and join the experience.\u00a0 You will need a valid passport.\nThe trip is more economical than any travel agent could or would do. No travel agency could put together a trip like this.\u00a0 Most have set tour plans and rarely deviate, custom tours are often unheard of.\u00a0 Second, they don't have the baseball contacts.\u00a0 Third, they would charge at least $2,000-$4,000 and lead you to places they want you to see and spend money.\nFrance and England are relatively expensive countries to visit and with the devaluation of the dollar to the Euro and GBP, it's not getting any better.\u00a0 Since we are traveling as a group, we'll be able to cut costs down somewhat.\u00a0 Considering the hotels, tours, restaurants and places we'll visit, we'll be going at a reasonable cost that includes first class treatment in every step of the way.\u00a0\u00a0 The trip will include all lodging, ground transportation to scheduled events, all baseball, all scheduled tours, lots of sightseeing, shopping sprees, translator when needed and several meals. Our trip is customized with us in mind at a reasonable price not including airfare.\nMost every day we'll tour a different area and see the local attractions.\u00a0 Some evenings may have group outings or dinners.\u00a0 Occasionally there may be joint meals or outings with the local\u00a0 teams that will allow the locals and USA players to get together, exchange ideas and make new friends.\u00a0 You'll find baseball enthusiasts of a variety of age groups and levels as many of their players are American players.\u00a0 They are eager to meet and play ball with you.\nDon't be just a tourist, be an International Baseball Ambassador, get to know the people not just the postcards.\nBaseball\nBaseball dates back beyond WWII in Europe.\u00a0 Over the decades, it has expanded to participating in the European national leagues and has developed local and national baseball leagues for youths and adults. Though there are no professional stadiums in France and England, there are however a number of quality fields, much like what we are used to playing in at our local leagues, parks and schools.\u00a0 The local Baseball Federations will be our hosts and provide the teams, fields, umpires etc.\nWe'll be starting our baseball experience by participating in an international 2 day tournament that will include 12-16 teams, mostly from Great Britain.\u00a0 In the past teams have also come from Ireland, Scotland, Portugal, France, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and all over England.\u00a0 We may be the first and only team from the USA in this tournament so they will probably expect a lot from us as it is an American sport.\u00a0 The tournament will include probably at least 4 games and 5 games when we play the championship game.\u00a0 It should all be very competitive baseball.\nAfter sweeping the tournament we'll take our awards and travel off to Paris for more sightseeing and baseball.\u00a0 Our French baseball experience will be to play 2 games in or near the city of Paris.\u00a0 These teams will be made up of amateur adult players from France who will be just about ending their season about the time we are there.\u00a0 We may also be playing some of the same teams we saw in London.\u00a0 They have a number of nice fields and ball parks that we will be sharing.\u00a0 We will probably have some sort of after game beverages or party with the local teams.\nOur team will be made up of US players from various leagues and organizations.\u00a0 The average age of our teams is usually in the mid-40's-50's.\u00a0 We generally have players in their 30's through the 60's.\u00a0 We'll be playing at least 6-7 games against local French and European teams. They are not sticklers about uniforms so we don't have matching uniforms so you are free to bring what ever uniforms you want.\u00a0 We will be using metal bats.\nTransportation\nYou'll need to make your own airline reservations to and from Europe and all transfers to and from the airport.\u00a0 We'll all meet up at the team hotel a couple of days before the first game in London.\u00a0 We'll be making arrangements for a team bus occasionally to some venus but mostly we will be using the local metro system when applicable around London and Paris.\u00a0 We'll be using the Chunnel to get from London to Paris.\u00a0 Once in Paris we will also be using local transportation for various outings.\u00a0 We will have a bus to take us to the games and maybe some tours.\u00a0 Upon departure you'll be making your own transportation arrangements to the airport.\nFood\nBreakfasts may be included with the rooms at the hotels in London.\u00a0 These are usually a glorified continental breakfast in Europe, not like American breakfasts.\u00a0 In Paris, at this point, I am planning that we would do our own breakfasts.\u00a0 Reason being is that Paris is full of delightful bakeries everywhere.\u00a0 One of my favorite things last year was to go to the local bakery every morning to sample their many scrumpious creations.\nLunches and dinners will be at your own expense at this point.\u00a0 As the program develops more, some meals may be included at various events.\u00a0 There may also be some dinner get together with the local teams.\u00a0 Restaurants are generally in our hotels or within easy walking distance.\nThe British are not known for their great food.\u00a0 Their traditional meals consist of a lot of meat with a variety of vegetables and breads.\u00a0 What they do have in Britain though is a lot of foreign restaurants, French, Indian, Italian, Chinese, Japanese etc. so we'll have plenty of choices.\u00a0 We may also have an afternoon tea.\nFrench Cuisine is famous the world round for it's excellent foods.\u00a0 Each region has its own distinctive specialties.\u00a0 In Paris and surrounding areas they are famous for lots of sauces using butter and cream.\u00a0 Wine and cheese are an integral part of French cuisine.\u00a0 For French people, cooking is a part of culture and they consider it a way of life.\u00a0 That being said, when I was there last year there were more restaurants serving Italian food than French food.\u00a0 You can't beat the French pastries though.\nThere are four kinds of restaurants in Paris: gastronomic temples, brassieres, bistros and cafes de the.... Gastronomic temples are the starred restaurants, those rated by the Michelin Guides as being superior. These usually offer classic French cuisine, are very elegant and quite costly.\nBrassieres are much more casual, usually open until late at night for the after theater crowd, serve numerous kinds of seafood, especially fresh oysters, and beer.\nBistros are neighborhood places that serve hearty food. They are unpretentious and tend to be \"in\" right now. Some three star chefs are opening bistros and although they are not cheap, they are less expensive than these chefs more formal establishments.\nCafes de.. offer another popular form of dining. These casual spots are good for sandwiches and salads at lunchtime or dessert and afternoon tea.\nOther places that sell chocolates, teas, coffees, breads, wines, pastries and all forms of upscale food items are everywhere.\nSome great foods can also be found in various small street stands, especially crepes.\u00a0 These are good for breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinners.\nEntertainment\nWhile in London we'll spend some time after hours visiting some pubs and local night spots, probably around Picadilly Circus, with the teams and around the neighborhood.\nParis is a vibrant city full of neighborhoods and a whole variety of night life to satisfy any need.\u00a0 Before we depart, we'll plan some evening activities or cultural events to attend.\u00a0 There are plenty of restaurants, bars, discos, night clubs and other activities to keep you busy each day, Paris and London both rock!. Moulin Rouge?\nSightseeing\nWe'll start the trip the first day you arrive. After making your way to our hotel for check in, you'll have the afternoon to decompress or see some of the local sites on your own.\u00a0 That evening we'll have a \"get aquatinted\" dinner at a local restaurant where you'll have a chance to meet the other team players.\nWhile in London we'll have a full day of touring that will include most of the must see and do sites.\u00a0 These will include many, if not all of these: Trafalgar Square , Westminster Abbey , Buckingham Palace , Big Ben , the Houses of Parliament , Tower of London , Picadilly Circus and a stop outside St. James's Palace , where have opportunity to observe the ceremonial changing of the guard.\nIn Paris, we'll see all the major sites including the Eiffel Tower , Arc de Triomphe , The Louvre , Champs-Elysees , Notre Dame Cathedral , Palace of Versailles , have a boat cruise on the Sine, and more.\u00a0 Paris is an easy city to get around in if you use the metro , which we will.\u00a0 The days will be long as there is still light in the sky to late in the evening so we'll take advantage of it.\u00a0 We'll also be there for Bastille Day on July 14 which will be an exciting event with lots of celebrations, lights and activities.\nAfter the first couple of days of baseball, a typical day will consist of day time tours, lunches and evening dinners or day time tours with an evening game.\u00a0 Each day will consist of tours to different places so you'll have lot's of opportunities to see all the major sites and surrounding areas.\nAccommodations\nWhen you travel a long distance to a foreign land, you want a comfortable place to stay.\u00a0 Hotels are expensive in the downtown area of London or Paris so we may be staying just out of the downtown area.\u00a0 This will get us the best rooms for a reasonable rate.\u00a0 We'll be staying in areas close to the metro system so it will be easy to get around to various parts of the cities.\u00a0 We'll be staying in 3-4 star hotels. All rooms will have private bathrooms, TV, direct dial phone etc.\nRestaurants, bars, laundry facilities will be available at the hotels or very near by.\u00a0 Keep in mind that European hotel rooms are very small compared to our American standards though not as small as Japanese rooms.\u00a0 Generally small but adequate, clean with suitable amenities.\nRequirements\nThis trip is for amateur baseball players.\u00a0 Most our players are members of local amateur baseball leagues.\u00a0 Ages ranging in the 30's through the 60's.\u00a0 Wives, family members, kids or other tourists may also attend as this is a family friendly trip.\u00a0 You will need a valid passport and visa.\u00a0 We'll get into more detail on this as we get closer.\nAll in all, between the baseball and the tours, this will be a very busy schedule that will give you a great experience and a chance to see the major tourist attractions of London and Paris.\u00a0 We'll also have lots of opportunities for evenings out.\u00a0 Some nights we'll go out as a group or you are welcome to go on your own.\u00a0 We'll never have enough time to see and do all the things available around England and France but we will be at all the must see and do places.\u00a0 I encourage you to consider possibly coming early and/or staying later so that you can take advantage of being there and see more things.\u00a0 I personally may be spending a few days early traveling through Scotland down to London.\u00a0 After Paris I may also travel through other parts of Brussels or Germany before returning home.\u00a0 These are things to be considered as we get closer.\nPreliminary Outline of Schedule for 10-day tour, 9 nights\nDay 1\n"}, {"score": 1137.5785, "uuid": "69388d63-3187-56e7-9494-d3492640bc1f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-75-11945", "target_hostname": "thecity-litcafe.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://thecity-litcafe.typepad.com/the_citylit_cafe/2011/07/the-best-book-on-london-berlin-paris-amsterdam-and-dublin-check-out-city-pick-in-culture-critic.html?no_prefetch=1", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "the <em>city</em>-lit cafe: The best book on <em>London</em>, Berlin, <em>Paris</em>, Amsterdam and", "snippet": "New York, <em>Paris</em>, Berlin, <em>London</em>, Istanbul, Barcelona, Rome and Amsterdam A young English woman in <em>Paris</em>, full of nice things.

Taking in Woolf's Westminster, Christopher Isherwood's sordid Berlin underworld and Joyce's Dublin odyssey, they talk us through the impetus behind the series and their favourite books from their first five titles.\nWords: Malcolm Burgess & Heather Reyes\nWe were on the slopes of the Acropolis in the blazing heat three years ago and desperate to read a selection of contemporary writing about Athens. We had the heavy and slightly out-of-date guide books but there was nothing in them, or, we discovered later, in Athens' bookshops. There wasn't anything in London bookshops either. And so Oxygen Books and our city-pick series began, finding some of the best writing on cities we love, from fiction and non-fiction to journalism and blogs. Current titles include Berlin , Paris , London , Venice , Amsterdam and Dublin with New York out on 20 October and Istanbul and St Petersburg appearing next year.\nLONDON\nVirginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway (1925)\nNo matter how many times I read Mrs Dalloway, I enjoy it and find some new detail to wallow in. Finding oneself in London on a lovely summer's morning, the whole novel floods back and increases the pleasure of it all.\nWhen we step out into the London streets on a brilliant June morning with Clarissa Dalloway, we begin a rich day (like Ulysses, the novel observes the classical ' unity of time ' rule) that draws many aspects of the city and its people into the narrative. While it is a wonderful \u2013 and often very funny \u2013 celebration of the capital, Woolf doesn't ignore its darker side. Set in 1923, the aftermath of the First World War casts a shadow both in the character of the shell-shocked Septimus Warren Smith and in Mrs Dalloway's own state of health. The sound of Big Ben haunts the novel, suggesting human mortality but also a kind of joyous pride in London. The party at the novel's close feels like a celebration of city life and brings together the characters we have met or whose minds we have entered during the course of the day. Tragedy arrives in the midst of it all, but the overwhelming impression is of a deep appreciation of people in all their failings and complexities, and of the city itself, which is equally complex but elicits love too.\nBERLIN\nChristopher Isherwood, Goodbye to Berlin (1939)\nNo matter how well you know the film Cabaret, going back to the book on which it was based is essential if you really want to get into those pre-Second World War years in Berlin. On the first page, Isherwood declares himself to be \"a camera\", and while this suggests a cool, objective take on events, one mustn't forget that a camera is selective and able to make us 'feel' through focusing on particular details. For me, it is this balance between the objective and subjective that makes the book work so well. Who can forget, once we have met her, the landlady of 'Herr Issyvoo', Fraulein Schroeder. While poking gentle fun, Isherwood treats her with an underlying generosity of spirit which he also applies to the \"hopeless\" Sally Bowles (not quite as striking and energetic as Liza Minelli in the film). Yes, there's plenty of good fiction set in Berlin, but I always go back to Isherwood when I want that satisfying blend of truth and pleasure.\nAMSTERDAM\nH. M. van den Brink, On the Water translated by Paul Vincent (1998)\nThis is a short but truly memorable novel and reflects Amsterdam's deceptively quiet, considered nature, which conceals turbulence beneath. It is the story of two adolescent boys from very different backgrounds who find a deep friendship partly through their shared passion for being \"on the water\" during an ideal summer before the war. With the rise of fascism and the occupation, their world is destroyed and the more fortunate of the two boys, David, disappears. The focus on water helps one appreciate the various manifestations of this essential element of Amsterdam, but the historical setting reminds one of just what was lost to Europe as a whole through the spread of the Nazi regime. It's a quiet but powerful read that deserves to be better known \u2013 as do many Dutch writers of whom we remain shamefully ignorant.\nDUBLIN\nJames Joyce, Ulysses (1922)\nNo, I'm really not being pretentious when I say this is my favourite book on Dublin. I had made several (unsuccessful) attempts to get through it, but then came across the most marvellous Naxos recording (22 CDs), read by Jim Norton with Marcella Riordan as Molly Bloom, which simply made it work. And it really is one of the funniest, most touching, tragic, wide-ranging, thoroughly enjoyable books ever. But you have to hear it in an Irish voice. It deserves its reputation as one the great books of all time not only for its close observation of early 20th-century Dublin, but of human relationships of many kinds, and the great joys and sorrows that shape our lives. Yes, there's a brilliant (and often referred to) description of Leopold Bloom on the loo, but details often not mentioned include the fact that he and Molly lost their only child, little Rudi, as a baby. The subtle anti-semitism of Dublin society is also something Bloom has to deal with continually. And Joyce isn't just good on people: the description of the Bloom's cat is just brilliant.\nPARIS\nEmile Zola, Ladies' Delight (1883)\nLadies' Delight (Au Bonheur des Dames), published in 1883, tells of the rise of Octave Mouret, and a new kind of Paris department store, based on the Left Bank's Le Bon Marche.

An Alternate Return Request Form must be completed and returned to ACIS no later than 90 days before departure. You will be responsible for any additional flight costs, and must arrange for a responsible adult (preferably an assistant) to take charge of your group on the flight home. You must obtain written permission from a parent/guardian of each participant, naming the adult in charge. There will be a $150 charge for any change made within 90 days of departure, and no changes are possible within 65 days.\nCan I stay in a single room?\nSingle accommodations are provided free of charge for group leaders who have eight or more paying participants counted to their credit AND who do not travel with a spouse or an assistant of the same sex. For those traveling in 2010/2011, see our Service Guarantee . In the unlikely event that a single room is not available, ACIS will reimburse you $20 per hotel night. Eligibility for the single room is based on the standard 1:6 prorate and is non-transferable. If the above does not apply, you may also elect to pay a surcharge of $40 per hotel night for a single room. Single rooms are not available aboard cruise ships, overnight ferries or trains, in China, Africa, Russia and most residence programs.\nFor Students and Parents:\nWhat airline do we fly?\nACIS groups travel on scheduled flights, using all the major carriers. These include American Airlines, Air France, Aerolineas Argentinas, Alitalia, Finnair, British Airways, British Midland Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Aer Lingus, Icelandair, Iberia, Spanair, Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines Ltd., Northwest, Air New Zealand, Olympic Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Taca International Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, US Airways, Air Europa, and Virgin Atlantic. You'll receive flight information as your departure date approaches.\nHow many people travel in a group?\nACIS groups average anywhere from 35 to 45 participants traveling together on a bus, led by an ACIS Tour Manager. Small groups are often combined to create one bus group. This is the group with whom you share your travel experience. You eat your meals together, stay in the same accommodations, and travel together on the bus. It's an opportunity to make lifelong friendships!\nTell us more about the tour manager.\n\"Tour manager\" is an important term in educational travel. It refers to your bus group leader, who is rigorously trained and specially selected to assist your group while overseas. ACIS Tour Managers are famous for their multifaceted roles, both educational and logistical. An ACIS Tour Manager is part commentator, counselor, troubleshooter, advocate, and stopwatch! He or she supervises hotel check-ins, directs the bus driver and leads educational activities.\nMost importantly, ACIS Tour Managers are travel gurus. They thrive on sharing their passion and love for the cultures of the world, giving you the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of those who live and work there. Over the years, we've employed university professors, film directors, journalists, musicians, business professionals, and other creative achievers. Our tour managers are consistently recognized as top in the industry. You'll receive more information about your tour manager as your departure date approaches.\nYour ACIS Tour Manager maintains a professional relationship with the group but is not directly responsible for enforcing discipline or the ACIS behavior guidelines. That is the responsibility of the your group leader. It is your tour manager's responsibility, however, to report to your group leader any infractions and to be sure that ACIS behavior guidelines are adhered to.\nWhere do we stay?\nACIS groups stay in three- and four-star conveniently located hotels. We place a priority on booking hotels in good locations and safe areas, with convenient access to both local attractions and public transportation.\nStudents generally stay in rooms with two or three beds. During peak travel periods, hotels sometimes add an extra bed to accommodate heavy bookings. ACIS attempts to prevent this but cannot guarantee that it will never happen. Some hotel rooms in France have a Grand Lit (an oversize double bed for two) instead of twin beds. Those who have paid the adult surcharge stay in double rooms in hotels but not on overnight ferries or trains.\nAn ACIS bus group is typically made up of two, three, or four groups from around the U.S. who quickly get to know each other and feel part of one overall group. Depending on the mix of male and female students in the bus group, students may be rooming with participants from other groups. Don't worry, this is a great way to meet new people and make some new friends!\nThe group leader will create a variety of rooming combinations before you leave, in order to make it easier for your tour manager to work out the rooming when you check in to your hotel.\nCheck-in time at most hotels is early to mid-afternoon. If you arrive overseas early in the morning, you likely have time to change money and do some exploring before you check in.\nWhat will we have to eat?\nYou will enjoy a variety of meals en route, mixing both native and familiar cuisines depending on your area of travel. Keep an open mind and be willing to sample everything\u2014that's what travel is all about!\nMost days you will be served a continental breakfast that includes a variety of fresh rolls, cereal, pastry, butter and jam, coffee, tea or hot chocolate. In Australia and China, you will be served an American-style hot buffet breakfast. On trips to the Americas you may be served the traditional rice and beans. In some hotels in Britain, eggs or other items may be included. In Europe, the larger hotels sometimes serve eggs and other American-style breakfast items for an extra charge.\nOn most ACIS trips, you will enjoy lunch on your own. Be adventurous and experiment. Many travelers do what the locals do; instead of having an expensive restaurant meal, they buy fresh ingredients at a local market, then put together a sandwich and have a picnic lunch in a city park.\nOn most tours, beverages at dinner are not included. The are included on tours to China, Costa Rica, Peru, and occasionally other destinations. Sometimes your waiter may put soda or mineral water down on the table without being asked. Be aware that you will be charged for any beverages you consume.\nAlthough ACIS will try to accommodate special-needs meals including kosher, vegetarian and low salt, we cannot guarantee all requests.\nHow much spending money will I need?\nSpending needs vary depending on personal habits, but a typical allowance is $50 per day. This allows for lunch, snacks, soft drinks, postage, souvenirs, local transportation during free time, free-time activities, and optional excursions not already included in your itinerary. Most ACIS participants carry ATM cards, travelers checks and credit cards. ACIS has compiled all the information you need to know in Money Matters .\nWhat should I pack?\nOur advice is to pack light\u2014you won't regret it! You will be responsible for carrying your own luggage on and off the bus, in and out of your hotel, and onto trains. Bring comfortable, practical clothes that you can wear more than once, with a few nice pieces thrown in.\nRemember to pack clothes that you can layer as the weather can be unpredictable. Lastly, try to avoid bringing new shoes. New shoes can be tough to break in and you\u2019ll want to make sure your shoes are comfortable and reliable. For more information specific to your trip, log into My Account for a detailed packing list.\nWhat about calling home?\nCalling home from overseas can be expensive and obtaining local phone cards can be complicated and time consuming. The best way to call is with an ACIS eKit Global Phonecard or Global Mobile Phone. Using the eKit card can save you up to 70% on international and U.S. long distance calls compared to pay phones and hotel phones. Simply charge up your eKit card with the credit card of your choice and it will be ready for use. In addition to cheap calls home, the ACIS eKit Global Phonecard offers you email, Voicemail, the ability to listen to email over the phone and much more!\nAnother option is the ACIS eKit Global Mobile phone. With a variety of pre-paid plans available, this mobile phone can save you up to 70% on global roaming rates.\nDo I have travel insurance?\nYes. Your ACIS Registration Fee includes coverage under our Basic Protection Plan. ACIS recommends you upgrade your insurance coverage by purchasing the Ultimate Protection Plan designed specifically for you travel needs. With the Ultimate Protection Plan, you may cancel for any reason up to the day of departure and receive a cash refund. You will also receive expanded travel protection while on tour.\nI am signed up for an ACIS tour. How do I access my account?\nYou can get your latest account information online\u2014any time, any day. To view your most up-to-date itinerary and account status, just, log in to My Account with your Account ID and password, which can be found in the upper-right hand corner of your invoice.

Overall it was deemed necessary to improve the conditions of the European integration whilst respecting global best practices and avoiding overregulation and bureaucratic processes: there are a number of important areas (insurance, asset management, post-market activities, enhancement of the Lamfalussy process\u2026) that require both new measures combined with the need of a convergent implementation of texts and practices born from the completion of the 2000-2005 program (FSAP).\nLord Mayor David Lewis, who is the global ambassador for the UK-based financial services industry, said \u201cDespite current world turmoil, financial markets are still the key to economic growth and there is no way to avoid the fact that in a globalised world our financial services must be competitive on a global basis\u201d.\nPolicy chairman Stuart Fraser, whose elected role to the City centres on issues such as working with Europe, said: \u201cthe key priority is: furthering Europe\u2019s integration, in order to take advantage as soon as possible of the domestic market of 500 millions citizens and in turn strengthening the global efficiency\u201d.\nFurthermore, Michel P\u00e9bereau adds that \u201cin order to increase European financial services\u2019 global competitiveness, targeted harmonisation initiatives should be launched on following topics: asset management, insurance, retail banking and post trade\u201d\nTwo important areas of concerns highlighted under the French Presidency:\nFirst, in order to ensure financial stability, the EU regulatory framework must secure closer supervisory coordination. The Lamfalussy process must be improved following the \"better regulation\" principle. Member States should urge their national regulators to integrate the EU dimension in their mandate and increase their convergence of practices and their level of information sharing, including the \"comply or explain\" principle. Even if the implementation of this process is globally a success, the three Level Three committees, should be gradually reinforced with regards to resources, decision making rules and visibility. Especially in the view of a more efficient prudential supervision of pan European groups, the priority shall be given to the functioning of the college of supervisors and to a lead home supervisor concept. CEBS should be given the task to monitor coherence between those colleges.\nAs far as the global dimension is concerned, mutual recognition is a good approach. It should be pragmatically applied, on selected topics and on condition that common principles maintain a level playing field between defined areas. This process should be driven according to a European framework and on the basis of compatible local regulatory practices. In any case, Paris EUROPLACE and the City of London support the multilateral dialog approach, which involves a step toward the mutual recognition.\nSecondly Paris EUROPLACE and the City of London have identified five business priorities for 2008:\nAsset management: UCITS IV Directive is a major priority in order to finalise the global competitiveness of the European fund industry. Three areas should be improved: enhancement of the \u201cproduct\u201d passport (faster and simplified procedures), including cross-border master-feeders and transnational UCITS mergers, a coherent and simplified prospectus, and most importantly the implementation of a full passport for fund management companies. It\u2019s essential to ensure that the UCITs framework fosters financial innovation.\nInsurance: The reform of the prudential framework with the Solvency II Directive is a major step forward and a top priority. It will modernize the measurement of insurance risks in order to ensure highly harmonized protection of consumers and the competitiveness of European financial actors. It should be based on economic prudential requirements, allowing better capital allocation, including at group level, and it should bring improvements of risk assessment and management by insurance companies. It should be based on economic prudential requirements, allowing better capital allocation, including at group level, and it should bring improvements of risk assessment and management by insurance companies.\nIn this respect, crucial choices will have to be done to ensure that the new reform will effectively really modernize the insurance supervision and take into account risks appropriately:\nThe minimum capital requirements (MCR) calculation must use a risk sensitive methodology in line with the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).\nThe economic assessment of the risks and requirements concerning groups must be carried out at the consolidated level. The respective powers of the supervisor of the parent company and the supervisors of local subsidiaries will have to be organized consequently in a rational manner.\nThe principle of risk assessment on a one-year view proposed by the European Commission must be implemented appropriately to companies over long term risks in order to avoid detrimental effects for the consumers\nAccounting standards: The convergence of global standards is a common objective. Nevertheless, the recent crisis showed the weaknesses of the full fair market value approach. The evolution of such global standard should respond to the users\u2019 needs. In particular the industry is opposed to the extension of fair valuation to the banking book. Consequently, the governance of the IASB board should be adjusted to take on board such needs and be articulated with national or regional processes integrating those standards. Furthermore, the IASB board should enter into a constructive dialogue with the industry.\nPensions: it is suitable to develop pan European pension products, with a harmonized and economic based prudential framework. This is a key issue for answering the needs of European citizens and for the European economic growth.\nRetail banking: harmonisation of consumer protection rules is key to provide more choice and to reduce prices for retail financial products. Therefore a targeted harmonization process should be a prerequisite to trigger more progress in the European retail banking market.\nPost-trade: In this area Europe is still too fragmented and not competitive enough. There is a view that the Code of Conduct will fail to deliver all initial expectations. Recent initiatives and evaluation process will come to a conclusion in a few months, but it appears that the interoperability and the segregation between general interest and commercial functions, which are the main issues addressed by the Code, may not be reached. On this basis major orientations should be decided before the end of 2008, such as the Legal Certainty Group\u2019s proposals on securities Law. This is expected to solve some Giovannini barriers and improve interoperability conditions for market infrastructures. Those proposals should be driven by effective cost reductions, precise governance principles to manage the relevant projects in the interest of all parties concerned and assuring its ability to evolve at the right speed to respond to users\u2019 needs.\nTo enlarge this level of consensus, Paris EUROPLACE and the City of London agreed to set up few task forces to identify and document specific issues on critical and important areas. Those task forces will address the following topics:\nalter UCITs\n"}], [{"score": 1103.0286, "uuid": "10178ee4-fd8a-580c-ba33-7b56e8341a92", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1010wb-78-15598", "target_hostname": "adloyada.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://adloyada.typepad.com/adloyada/2005/11/paris_is_burnin/comments/page/1/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Adloyada: <em>Paris</em> <em>is</em> burning", "snippet": "When I was in <em>Paris</em>, I was pretty much left to my own devices by my hostess and took to walking across the <em>city</em>, much as I had done when I acquired a taste for truanting afternoons in <em>London</em> in my previous year at school.

[Died in vain] Now what could be more un-Islamic than that? No claiming of martyrdom or dozens of virgins here.\nThere are not the flags, the typical chanting and sloganizing of Islamism on the marches. It's true that over the last months, many attacks have taken place on Jewish premises, including cemeteries.\nBut where today rioters are interviewed, they talk of the same types of grievance as articulated by race rioters of the sixties and seventies, of exclusion from jobs and harassment by the police.\nAnd I'll end, to my surprise, by referring you to a good analysis by John Lichfield in The Independent , of which this is a good example:\nTalk of an intifada is absurdly misleading. Firstly, the rioters are far from being all Muslim (although more than half are from Islamic backgrounds). Second, they have no sense of political or religious identity and no political demands. Their allegiance is to their quartier and their gang. Their main demand, so far as can be established, is to be left alone by police and the Interior Minister, Nicolas Sark-ozy, to continue with their life of low-level violence and drugs trading. The wider significance is therefore not politico-religious but a warning of what happens if problems of deprivation and violence are allowed to fester.\nPosted on November 07, 2005 | Permalink\nTrackBack\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d83451d36869e200d834251c7b53ef\n\u00bb France Is Hoist On Its Own Petard ~ UPDATED from GM's Corner\nOddly enough, this individual is praying for France!

The Metro (underground/subway) is the backbone of the network. Other useful options include, buses, taxis, riverboats and the suburban RER trains. Finally, don't forget your own two feet - Paris city centre is compact and walking is a great way to get your bearings. The Metro is often the quickest way of getting around, and with approximately 300 stations you're rarely more than five minutes' walk from a line. Trains vary from ultramodern to past-their-best, depending on the line. But services usually run with minimum delays (barring strike action). Once inside the station, be prepared for long walks to reach the platform - especially at Chatelet - although you wont need to go deep underground. Buses give you the chance to see the city as you travel and their routes are clearly marked at the stops and on the bus. But they are slower than the Metro and can become just as crowded in rush hour.\nTips\nGetting a taxi maybe useful if you have lots of baggage or if you dont want to use the Metro at night.\nTry to avoid using buses and the Metro during rush hour (roughly 7.30-9.30am and 4.30-7pm).\nRead more on this destination in the AA Spiral Guide to Paris.\nWays to get around in Paris\nMetro: The Metro and Buses use the same tickets and travel cards. These can also be used on the RER trains within central Paris. The city is divided into fare zones. Most of the key sights are in Zone 1, although the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport is in Zone 5 and Orly Airport is in Zone 4. A single ticket costs \u20ac1.50 and covers all Metro stations, RER stations (within the heart of Paris) and most buses. Buying a carnet of 10 tickets is better value than buying tickets seperately for each bus or Metro journey, and also saves waiting at the ticket office. It is better deal if you are planning eight journeys or more.\nBuses: Most buses are painted easy-to-see turquoise and run from 7am to 8.30pm, although some continue until around 12.30am. The route number is displayed on the front of the bus, along with the final destination. Hold your hand out to stop the bus. If you need to buy a ticket on board, have the exact money ready as drivers do not carry much change. You can buy only single tickets on board and they must be stamped in the machine next to the driver. You can buy various tickets/travelcards at Metro stations, on buses (single tickets only) and at some news stands.\nRER trains: The RER (Reseau Express Regional) dates from 1969 and is operated by RATP and SNCF. It serves Disneyland Paris to the east, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport to the North, Versailles to the West and the Orly Airport train link to the south. Trains run underground in central Paris and overground in the suburbs and operate from around 5.30am to 12.30am. A single Metro ticket is valid for RER journeys in central Paris and you can change lines (including Metro lines) on the same ticket. For journeys further afield, you'll need to buy a seperate ticket valid for the particular destination. Travelcards must cover all the zones you travel through.\nTaxis: The best way to find a taxi is to head to one of the city's 470 taxi stands, marked by a blue Taxis sign. You can phone for a taxi but this is more expensive as the meter starts running as soon as the taxi sets off to collect you. You can hail a taxi in the street, if you can find one that is free. A white light on the roof indicates that the taxi is available. When the light is off, the taxi is busy. Prices are regulated and tariffs should be displayed in each taxi. Daytime trips within central Paris should cost under \u20ac15.\nBatobus: The Batobus is a relaxing way to get around, allowing you to hop on and off at eight stops along the River Seine. It runs from early February to the end of November. Boats leave every 15-30 minutes stopping at the quais near the main sightseeing points. A one-day pass costs \u20ac12. You can buy passes at the stops or the tourist office.\nLooking for a great deal?\nSubscribe to our email newsletter\nYou'll be the first to know about our great offers\n"}, {"score": 1098.9797, "uuid": "e0530d27-286c-5844-80c5-17adce720af9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0009wb-90-05740", "target_hostname": "virtual-travel.info", "target_uri": "http://virtual-travel.info/paris/guidebooks.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>City</em> Travel Guide Books of <em>Paris</em>, France:", "snippet": "The opening section Introducing <em>Paris</em> locates the <em>city</em> geographically, sets modern Parisian its historical context and explains how Parisian life changes through the years. <em>Paris</em> At a Glance <em>is</em> an overview of the city&#x27;s specialties.

Kearney Global Cities Index which was released today in collaboration with Bloomberg.\nThe Global Cities Index, conducted every two years since 2008, provides a unique measure of global engagement for 66 cities across five dimensions \u2013 Business Activity, Human Capital, Information Exchange, Cultural Experience, and Political Engagement. The 2012 Global Cities Index was developed by A.T. Kearney and The Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\nRachel Bronson, Chicago Council on Global Affairs Vice President of Studies noted, \u201c While most other city rankings limit their focus to business or quality of life measures, the Global Cities Index provides a holistic look at what differentiates cities in generating, attracting and retaining global capital, people, and ideas.\u201d\nThe 2012 edition of the Global Cities Index includes the Emerging Cities Outlook 2012, a forward looking measurement of emerging cities that have the potential to improve their global standing in future years. Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei top this newly introduced perspective.\nMike Hales, A.T. Kearney partner and study co-leader commented, \u201cThe Global Cities Index is a tool that business executives can use to identify locations for regional headquarters that have the potential to attract and retain top talent. Many cities are also using the Global Cities Index to benchmark their development initiatives.\u201d\nFindings from the 2012 Global Cities Index\nDespite the financial turmoil of the past few years, New York and London have consistently led the rankings in all three editions of the Global Cities Index. Paris and Tokyo, although they alternate positions this year, are always far above the rest of the top ten. The top four cities demonstrate that having a balanced portfolio of strengths across several dimensions of globalization allows these cities to hold their positions at the top of the Index despite the recent global financial turmoil.\nAsian cities continued to perform well in the Global Cities Index, with at least three Asian cities featured in the top ten in all three editions of the Index. These results demonstrate the stability of Asia\u2019s significance on the world stage.\nGermany is the only European country with three cities ranking in the top half of the 2012 Index, although no German city has ever been ranked among the top 10 Global Cities. One of the linchpins of the Global Cities Ranking is the notion that globalization represents a transfer of power from national states to a network of global cities. Germany demonstrates this concept with Berlin (#20), Frankfurt (#23), and Munich (#31) representing a network of cities that should drive continued national success.\nCities in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) continue to work their way to the top of the Index at varying paces. Similar to their performance in prior Index rankings, the BRIC cities\u2019 rise is driven by their strength in business activity, rather than the other dimensions that make for a more well-rounded global city. Strong business activity should drive future development of the other dimensions, leading to the development of cultural institutions and international policy institutes.\nFindings from the Emerging Cities Outlook 2012\nThe Emerging Cities Outlook gauges each city\u2019s rate of change by measuring factors that will affect the future of two Index dimensions: Business Activity and Human Capital. These two dimensions drive a city\u2019s capacity to attract, retain and generate flows of ideas, capital and people. The rate of change is measured because it can be an indicator of future movement rather than current status. Change is also captured using factors that reflect both strengths and vulnerabilities. The top cities in the Emerging Cities Outlook can expect to move into the top rankings of the Global Cities Index within the next 10 to 20 years.\nEmerging Cities Outlook 2012\n"}, {"score": 1085.32, "uuid": "a9e8d434-5728-51a1-94cd-8c60d4fda436", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-59-05997", "target_hostname": "www.economist.com", "target_uri": "http://www.economist.com/node/18229536", "page_rank": 1.1831761e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "The French community in <em>London</em>: <em>Paris</em>-on-Thames | The Economist", "snippet": "French Londoners have their own magazines, cinemas and cultural centres, <em>which</em> are all the <em>better</em>-resourced for being patronised by hordes of British Francophiles.

The Eurostar trains to and from Paris even zoom past the club\u2019s Emirates Stadium, a corner of Islington that is forever France.\nThe Frenchification of Arsenal is perhaps the most famous example of a broader French influx to London. This, too, began in earnest in the 1990s as the city boomed with Britain\u2019s economy (though there has been a French presence since the Huguenot migration of the 17th century). Firm numbers are hard to come by; as European Union (EU) citizens, the French can move to Britain without registering with any authority. But their consulate estimates that up to 400,000 of London\u2019s 7.6m people are citizens of the republic, possibly making the French the largest minority nationality in the city.\nA similar number of Britons live in France, but mainly for a sunny dotage in the bucolic south. French Londoners are often in their prime. The archetype is a banker with children at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais in South Kensington, the established hub of the community (\u201cthe 17th arrondissement\u201d), who misses the food and weather of home. The City, a bigger financial centre than Paris, is keen on French workers, especially traders\u2014products of an educational system that turns out mathematics whizzes in droves. It is rational interests, rather than cultural affinity, that draw this type of Frenchman to London: high-paid work, lower taxes (especially on wealth), and the chance to raise bilingual children.\nIn this section\nLondon\nBut French Londoners have become a much more diverse group than this archetype allows. They can be found across the city, in gilded Marylebone, suburban Chiswick and the raucous east end. A new lyc\u00e9e will open in Kentish Town (near grungy Camden Town) this year. And though many come because of the favourable fiscal and regulatory climate created by successive British governments, some are here for reasons beyond ministers\u2019 direct control: the French invasion suggests both the ways that politicians can augment a city\u2019s allure, and how much of it is organic, spontaneous, and best left alone.\nAnything goes\nThe superior beauty and efficiency of Paris often come at the price of dynamism. Many young French arrivals in London say they are fleeing rigid social codes, hierarchical corporate culture and a sense of distance from the global swirl of people and ideas. \u201cIt is hard to go back once you have tasted the internationalism here,\u201d says Jessica Moyal, who works in private equity.\nFrench twenty-somethings see London as a \u201cgateway to globalisation\u201d, agrees \u00c9douard Braine, the French consul-general, who compares the ritual sojourns in the city taken by his younger compatriots to the globe-trotting gap years favoured by their British peers. Not all secure high-flying jobs: many come to study, or to work as au pairs or waiters while perfecting their English, or to find a niche in London\u2019s huge creative industries. Many young French of African or Arab origin also say that there is less discrimination in Britain.\nAs is true of many diasporas these days, amenities and technology allow the French to continue living a French life if they so choose, and not only because Paris is little more than two hours away by train. French Londoners have their own magazines, cinemas and cultural centres, which are all the better-resourced for being patronised by hordes of British Francophiles. French Radio London, which took to the airwaves last November, serves up French pop and news. There will even be a new constituency in the French parliament at next year\u2019s general election to represent citizens living in Britain and northern Europe (which mostly means London).\nBut many of the younger arrivals\u2014the ones to be found in grimy nightclubs in Dalston rather than the boutiques of Sloane Square\u2014come to London precisely to live a messier, less French life in the company of new people. Last year, Ewen Ledain, a French postgraduate student, conducted a survey of this neglected genre of French Londoner (\u201cLes oubli\u00e9s de St Pancras\u201d) for Le Centre Charles P\u00e9guy, a charity in Shoreditch that helps young French newcomers find jobs and accommodation. He found that very few cited a lack of work in France as their reason for coming. By far the most popular motivations were to improve their English and to experience something new.\nObservers of London\u2019s French community do not think the downturn has shrunk its numbers much. True, some bankers lost their jobs in the financial crisis, and the City is recruiting less. But France itself is hardly booming. Mr Braine says that many of the French workers in Dublin who were laid off as a result of the Irish economic crisis are trying their luck in London rather than heading straight home. London remains attractive to French entrepreneurs, too. Mathieu Laine, a 35-year-old Parisian, is moving to London to open a new branch of his firm Altermind, a business consultancy. Britain\u2019s low and falling corporation tax rate is part of his motivation; but so is the \u201cwind of freedom\u201d he feels whenever he visits the city. Crucially, the government\u2019s new restrictions on immigration do not apply to EU citizens.\nFar more likely to pull talented French people back home than Britain\u2019s economic doldrums is the prospect of France becoming more business-friendly. Nicolas Sarkozy is chipping away at taxes and regulations, and wants Paris to expand through private-sector development. That sort of thing is within the gift of politicians. But replicating the loose, globalised way of life in London\u2014the anything-goes culture that draws a certain kind of young French person\u2014will be much harder.\nfrom the print edition | Britain\n"}, {"score": 1083.1749, "uuid": "1eb614ab-8f50-50df-bdd6-c32b6cbac4dd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500wb-01-21508", "target_hostname": "www.gourmet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gourmet.com/travel/cityguides/paris/brasseries", "page_rank": 1.1772298e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Paris</em> Brasseries: <em>City</em> Guides : gourmet.com", "snippet": "Fan-patterned mosaic floors, etched-glass partitions, and wood paneling\u2014plus the frisson of impending arrivals and departures\u2014make Terminus Nord, across the street from the Gare du Nord, a good choice for a last meal before a trip to <em>London</em>, Brussels, <em>or</em> Amsterdam.", "explanation": null, "document": "City Guides\nNine Notable Paris Brasseries\nWith their metropolitan glamour, convenient hours, and gorgeous interiors, Parisian brasseries (the city's original beer halls) are easy to love. Unfortunately, most of them are now owned by one of two large chains, which has resulted in increasingly mediocre food. Here are some wonderful exceptions.\nThe Latin Quarter took up arms when Brasserie Balzar, a much-loved stalwart next to the Sorbonne, became part of the Groupe Flo chain nine years ago. Happily, not much has changed. Waiters in long white aprons still serve onion soup, marinated herring, and roast chicken to a stylish international crowd. Just across from the Bourse, Le Vaudeville is an intimate spot with a smoke-ambered Art Deco interior (and a tiny but pleasant terrace) that's ideal for a late supper of, say, oysters and grilled cod with potato pur\u00e9e. (Very popular; be sure to reserve.) Recently renovated, the bustling, good-humored Au Pied de Cochon, in the heart of town, still has its brass pigs'-feet door handles and frosted-glass sconces. It serves fine classics like oysters, onion soup, and the signature trotter. The main reason to go to La Coupole, the Art Deco dining room that has anchored Montparnasse since 1927, is the wildly heterogeneous crowd. Stick to simple dishes like oysters, soups, salads, and grilled meats. Fan-patterned mosaic floors, etched-glass partitions, and wood paneling\u2014plus the frisson of impending arrivals and departures\u2014make Terminus Nord, across the street from the Gare du Nord, a good choice for a last meal before a trip to London, Brussels, or Amsterdam. Christian Constant, formerly of the Crillon, has signed on as consultant at the recently renovated Les Grandes Marches, an airy, contemporary space next to the Op\u00e9ra Bastille. The terrine of crab and the guinea hen with wild mushrooms are particularly impressive. Dark-wood paneling, sassy waiters, and appealing dishes like coq au Riesling and choucroute garnie keep the long-running, tavernlike Brasserie de l'\u00cele St-Louis popular with Parisians and tourists alike. On the outer edge of the Latin Quarter (and lacking some of the buzz of the better-known places), Restaurant Marty serves some of Paris's best brasserie food. The escargots and navarin d'agneau make for a fine feast, and desserts like caramelized Mirabelle plums with vanilla ice cream in a pastry tulipe are impressive. The Alsatian connection (fresh choucroute is delivered weekly from a small producer near Strasbourg) explains the popularity of Chez Jenny, a festive spot in the 3rd arrondissement. Try the choucroute with rotisseried pork knuckle and (instead of one of the ordinary desserts) splurge on a good Riesling.\nBrasserie Balzar, 49 rue des \u00c9coles; 5th; 01-43-54-13-67\nLe Vaudeville, 29 rue Vivienne; 2nd; 01-40-20-04-62\nAu Pied de Cochon, 6 rue Coquilli\u00e8re; 1st; 01-40-13-77-00\nLa Coupole, 102 boulevard du Montparnasse; 14th; 01-43-20-14-20\nTerminus Nord, 23 rue de Dunkerque; 10th; 01-42-85-05-15\nLes Grandes Marches, 6 place de la Bastille; 12th; 01-43-42-90-32\nBrasserie de l'\u00cele St-Louis, 55 quai de Bourbon; 4th; 01-43-54-02-59\nRestaurant Marty, 20 avenue des Gobelins, 5th; 01-43-31-39-51\nChez Jenny, 39 boulevard du Temple; 3rd; 01-44-54-39-00\nKeywords\n"}], [{"score": 1082.738, "uuid": "ae1a8406-3d73-5dc0-a6ee-4b92d9607298", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-49-18001", "target_hostname": "www.eslworldwide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.eslworldwide.com/Europe/UK/London/Transport", "page_rank": 1.1713994e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>London</em>, Transport, Cheap accommodation <em>London</em>, <em>City</em> centre hotel <em>London</em>", "snippet": "Cycling <em>is</em> another option, though it wouldn\u2019t be advisable to cycle, as the <em>city</em> <em>is</em> not very bike friendly.

The airport has two official concessionaires, Airport Carz (booking office in the North Terminal arrivals area) and Checker Cars (booking office in the Northern Entrance building leading to the South Terminal). Cars with swivel seats can be ordered for disabled travelers. If someone is picking you up by car, they should not leave the vehicle unattended, as due to a strict security policy it may be towed away.\nHeathrow Airport\nTube\nThe only airport connected with the city by Tube (as the metro is called in the UK). The journey to a station by on the Picadilly Line (there are two stations, depending on which terminal you left from) takes about 50-60 minutes and Tubes run every 5 or 9 minutes (depending on the time of day). During the night you can get to Central London by the N97 bus.\nHeathrow Express\nA train service running every 15 minutes all year takes you to Paddington station in the heart of London. The station is located 15 to 20 minutes walk from the terminals and a one way journey costs 12 GBP\nBlack cabs\nFor about 45 GBP you can get to Central London by Black cab. The trip takes about one hour (going at night is about 50% more expensive).\nBuses\nMost coaches operate from the central bus station, situated by the London Underground station for Terminals 1, 2 and 3. Alternatively you can take an airbus (the A2 goes to Kings Cross via Holland Park, Nottinghill, Queensway, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, Baker Street, Great Portland Street, Euston and Russell Square from outside all Heathrow terminals.) Tickets for the airbus can be purchased from the Airbus lounges or on the bus and cost 7 GBP for adults (or 10 GBP if you buy a two way ticket) and 3 GBP for children and students.\nLondon City Airport\nYou can take the Green Bus, which for 2 GBP (or 1 GBP for children) will take you to Canning Town Station, 5 minutes walk from the Jubilee Tube Line or Docklands Light Railway. These will take you to the centre of London. The Blue Bus operates between the airport and Canary Wharf, from where you can take the Jubilee Line or Docklands Light Rail. The Blue Bus costs 3 GBP for adults and 1 GBP for children. You may prefer to take the Blue Bus all the way to Liverpool street (where you can change to the Central, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith and City Lines). Such a journey costs adults 6 and children 2 pounds.\nLuton Airport\nYou can choose a coach or express-coach, which stop at Brent Cross, Finchley Road Station, Baker Street, Marble Arch and Victoria.\nStansted Airport\nThe Stansted Express train will take you from the airport to Liverpool Street Station in 41 minutes. It runs every 15 minutes between 8am and 5 pm on weekdays, and every 30 minutes during early morning, evening and weekends. You can also choose between hiring a car service (information desk on the international arrivals concourse) or taking an airbus, which runs every half an hour all day and hourly during the night.\nPublic transport\nIf you are wondering what is the best way of getting around after reaching London, let us help you out.\nMETRO\nThe best public transport for London is the underground Metropolitan and the RER. It is an amazing network and you will find metro stations at most of the different places that you wish to go to. You could buy daily, weekly or monthly travel passes depending on the frequency of your travel, however a weekly or a monthly pass (Carte Orange Passes) would be a better bargain. Many of the sight seeing places are at a walking distance and walking around would also be a good option enjoying the view along the way. Cycling is another option, though it wouldn\u2019t be advisable to cycle, as the city is not very bike friendly. Bikes are not allowed in the metro\u2019s.\nBUS\nThere is a public bus system, which is not a very advisable option as the frequency is not worth a wait.\nSHUTTLES\nThere are river shuttles that ply the seine however they take very long routes and thus take a very long time so if your intention is to spend a leisure time, having a good ride, we would suggest you to get aboard these river shuttles. This will also be a good sight seeing experience.\nTAXI\nThe Londonian Taxi\u2019s help more than 5,00,000 travelers to commute everyday. Be it from the airport or within the city. They have a neon sign on the roof of the taxi indicating \u201cTAXI LONDONIEN\u201d and a taximeter displaying the fare. The fare would include a flag fall of 2.00 \u20ac and the meter charges The meter charges would depend on the length of your travel, the time of the day, the area and waiting time / Luggage charges if any.\n"}, {"score": 1064.1775, "uuid": "25180a5a-bfc4-5e99-829e-bb232c809736", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1608wb-84-26241", "target_hostname": "www.eslworldwide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.eslworldwide.com/Europe/France/Paris/Transport", "page_rank": 1.1713994e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Paris</em>, Transport, Top hotel <em>Paris</em>, <em>Paris</em> apartments, Budget hotel <em>Paris</em>", "snippet": "If you have landed at the Charles De Gaulle airport, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> one of the international hubs and has flights that can reach you almost anywhere, there are various ways to commute to the <em>city</em>.

To commute via the RER, take the line C , the \u201cGOTA or NORA\u201d trains, which will take you to Paris. A shuttle bus could also be a wise option which has a frequency of 7 minutes leaving either Antony / Orly Sud.

I know, cue the teeny-tiny pity violins. Whenever I lament feeling torn between New York and Paris, I get the \u201cpoor you\u201d rolling of the eyes. But truly, it\u2019s not easy choosing between the two best cities in the world. Let\u2019s see you do it.\nBeauty or Energy?\nNotre Dame in Paris or Snow in Manhattan? (Karigee)\nParis is dazzling. All you need to do is watch a Godard film or see a Doisneau poster to know that. But to actually walk the streets\u2014with the Plane trees and cobblestones; the rose-tinted street lamps, green bookstalls and golden limestone facades\u2014well, the French know a little something about seduction, don\u2019t they.\nBut in New York, you\u2019re swept away by everything and everyone around you: pedestrians, taxis, buses, street vendors, blinking neon signs, little dogs, big dogs, and, oh the freaks everywhere! To walk the streets of New York is to know what it means to feel alive.

Now it\u2019s de rigueur, thanks to the V\u00e9lib\u2019 system\u2019s more than 20,000 bikes at 1,800 stations. The V\u00e9lib\u2019 app , available on iTunes, tells you where to find the nearest station and the number of bikes there.

Four of us stayed here and did not get under one anothers feet. The apartment seemed secure, was clean, nicely decorated with good use of space and good sized rooms for a Paris residence! The linen was fresh and the bed in the bedroom plus the sofa bed in the living room was comfortable to sleep on. As a three seater the sofa was comfortable and roomy. There were some guide books and maps provided which was very nice. The location was ideal, a few minutes from Notre Dam Cathedral. It was very close to many amenities, restaurants, and shopping. The apartment was located in a lively area, within easy walking distance to many tourist destinations. Just outside the apartment building there were reasonably priced food bars with friendly owners and a creperie which was great when we did not want to travel to eat or for a late night snack. Being on the first floor meant it was extremely convenient in the evenings with few stairs to climb. All in all we had a fabulous stay here! The only thing that could have made our stay nicer would have been a little gesture of TLC to make us feel welcome. Some apartments offer a welcome snacks or a few breakfast items. Perhaps some coffee and tea and salt, pepper and sugar in the kitchen would have been appreciated. Some guidance on local supermarkets would also have been helpful. All in all we would defintely reccommend this apartment to others and would be happy to come back and stay here on another trip.\n26/01/2012\nstayed in Apartment 20971\nEveryone I dealt with was exceptionally helpful, Alvin in person and (sorry, but I have forgotten your name)and the gent on the phone; office based. The apartment was simply furnished and thankfully not overly decorated, which made it easier to keep clean and tidy - yes I know, we were on holiday, but I still can't live in my own squalor! It was a pleasure each morning strolling down to the bakery to get our pastries and bread, or popping in to the wine merchant to put a bottle of wine in to chill for later - it was great having everything on the doorstep, and even greater knowing that, after a hard day walking (we avoided the metro so we could sight see EVERYTHING) we had nibbles and wine waiting for us back \"home\" - that was how it felt\n25/01/2012\nstayed in Rambuteau\nBardzo dobra lokalizacja apartamentu - mozna dotrzec na piechote wszedzie przy okazji odkrywajac rozne ciekawe zakatki Paryza.

The city\u2019s rich cultural and historical base, coupled with its tendency to transform and develop, makes Paris an innovative and dynamic city.\nLiving and staying in the capital, is a pleasurable experience\u2026The diameter of the city is strategically cut by the River Seine. On the right bank, there are many of the most fashionable streets and shops, and such landmarks as the Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde, Louvre, the modern Pompidou Center (Beaubourg) and the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur. On the left bank, you can see governmental offices and is the site of much of the city's intellectual life. It is known for its old Latin Quarter and for such landmarks as the Sorbonne, the Luxembourg Palace and the Panth\u00e9on. The historic core of Paris is the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, a small island occupied in part by the Palais de Justice and the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Rising above the city is the Eiffel Tower.\nHow do you define a Parisian? In numbers, the population stands at an estimated 2 153 600 inhabitants. The usual clich\u00e9s would have us believe that they are always in a hurry, stressed and arrogant, though their image also blends with that of the French lover, romantic and \u201cbon vivant\u201d.\nFor more information on the city and culture\u2026 http://en.parisinfo.com/\nStudent Life\nUpon first visit, the Paris scene can be quite overwhelming. Not to worry, as a foreign student, you have plenty of opportunities to meet other students, and find your niche. As a major European city, Paris is used to welcoming foreigners. As a result, many institutions and organizations such as Erasmus and CROUS have extended their support towards new students. Specifics to help foreign students, http://www.etudiantdeparis.fr/ressources/ads-foreign-students or http://www.crous-paris.fr/\nErasmus is a student organization made up of international students. The Erasmus group is known for organizing events (large picnics, events at nightclubs), offering a stage for students to meet and interact. For more information regarding Erasmus and other student-based organizations abroad, look to http://www.erasmus-paris.com/\nEven if Erasmus exchanges only concern Europe, a lot of international events or associations use Erasmus word instead of international, and students from all countries are invited.\nIESEG School of Management Campus\u2026it is important to note that the campus lies right outside of Paris (RER A) in la Defense, under the Grande Arche (the symbol of la Defense). Built in 1989 to mark the bicentenary of the French Revolution, the Grande Arche is a huge marble-and-glass-clad concrete monument weighing over 300,000 tons. The roof is 110m high and has a panoramic viewpoint offering a magnificent vista of the historic axis extending from the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre.\nOn the 6000 m2 platform the IESEG Paris campus has 13 amphitheatres, 10 classrooms, 3 multimedia centres, 1 library (350 m2 ) 1 cafeteria and rooms available for school associations. This prime location allows the school to reinforce its links with companies and build on its already excellent reputation nationally and internationally.\nTo get familiar with expected budget or daily expenses as a student\u2026\nA Metro ticket is 1,70\u20ac (for one) and 12\u20ac for 10 tickets.\nMuseum full-price entry (plein tarif) tends to be between 7 and 12 \u20ac.\n1 sandwich is around 6 \u20ac.\n1 pizza around 8 or 12 \u20ac.\n1 caf\u00e9 is 1 \u20ac (at the bar) or 2 \u20ac (sitting).\n1 meal (entr\u00e9e, plat, dessert, without drink) is between 15 and 20 \u20ac (depending on the neighborhood).\n1 baguette is 1,00 \u20ac.\n1 beer at a caf\u00e9 is between 2 and 4 \u20ac.\n1 cinema ticket is 9 \u20ac.\nCompanies\nFrance is one of the world's major economic powers. More specifically, the north central region is the commercial, financial, industrial focus of France.\nParis, the food capitol of the world\u2026There is some merit to the clich\u00e9 Parisian, who walks around with a baguette in hand, drinks wine, and eats cheese. To put it briefly, gastronomie and eating is a passion in France. Needless to say, agriculture is important (about 60% of the land is used for farming). Over half of the value of agricultural output derives from livestock; leading crops are sugar beet, wheat, corn, barley, and potatoes.\n\u201cLa D\u00e9fense\u201d: Top European business district:\n1 500 companies\n150 000 employees\n3 000 000 m2 of office space\nAll the major companies\u2026Paris is the location of major headquarters (French and International companies: Darty, FNAC, NEspresso, etc).

In the coming years, architectural projects like the Triangle tower, at porte de Versailles, the development of the Mass\u00e9na-Bruneseau district, in the South-East, and the future Signal and Phare towers, at La D\u00e9fense, will forge links with neighbouring communes.\nWeather\nIn general, the Paris weather is mild, divided between four seasons.\nAutumn: 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 (expected rain)\nWinter: 1 to 10\u00b0\nSummer: 19 to 35\u00b0 (but still relatively mild)\nTransportation\nParis prides itself on having the cheapest transportation system, offering 16 lines covering 8 radial zones for public transport. These lines cover all neighborhoods of the city, and run about every 2 minutes depending on the time of day (for instance: there are more metro lines running during peak hours of the day, and less running at night or over the weekend).\nThe cost of the ticket depends on the number of zones you want to travel through. Zone 1 is related to Paris but all metro tickets are available for zones1&2. The metro is made up of 14 lines identified with the number or the name of the first and the last station (e.g. 3, Galli\u00e9ni \u2013 Pont de Levalois). You have also 5 RER (suburban trains) called by a letter (RER A, B, C, D, E).\nIn order to travel on the RATP (the state-owned company managing the metro) network, you must be in possession of a valid ticket at all times. Tickets must be validated in the turnstiles, found in the entrance of all metro and RER stations. When boarding a bus (with a metro ticket you can get on any bus) you must show your ticket to the driver if it is a travel card, or validate you metro ticket (not the travel cards!) in the machines provided.\nA single ticket, 1.70 \u20ac, is valid for ONE journey.

Our forecasts show that the airport is likely to grow steadily and that this growth would not be significantly affected by the addition of runway capacity at the major London airports. It is particularly well placed to serve a niche business market. Several of the surrounding local authorities supported growth to 5mppa. The airport operator believes that with some further development a higher throughput could be achieved.\"\nProgress Report\nOn 14th December 2006 the Department for Transport published a Report which reviewed the progress made on the in implementing the White Paper. In relation to London City Airport the Report says the Airport was likely to demonstrate steady growth, serving a niche business market to domestic and European destinations. The Airport had published its master plan which showed the Airport handling 8mppa by 2030. The Report concludes that \u0093the airport continues to be an important factor in local regeneration, business development, transport and tourism infrastructure\u0094.\nTop of Page\nAirport Master Plan\nJanet Goulton, the Airport\u0092s Long Term Strategy Manager, has been working on the the Airport Master Plan recommended by the White Paper.\nTo assist airports in producing these plans the Government in July 2004 issued Guidance which outlines the Government's view on what it would like to see in master plans and offers good practice advice on their preparation.\nThe Government asked airports to produce outline master plan statements by the end of 2004 to be followed by fully worked-up master plans by December 2005.\u00a0 In line with this the Airport in December 2004 submitted to the Government a Statement of Intent which included:\nthe Airport\u2019s case for its passenger forecast of 8mppa by approx 2030 (in drawing up the White Paper the Government assumed LCY would grow to 5mppa); and\nan indication of the physical changes at the Airport necessary to secure a passenger throughput of 8 mppa by 2030 and their phasing.\nA copy of this Statement suitable for web use (i.e. without the large plans) is attached (.pdf 172kb).\nAt its January 2005 meeting the Consultative Committee was told there would be discussions with the Government to ensure that growth to 8mppa was acceptable. Whatever the outcome of these discussions the next step would be to commission consultants fully to assess the impact of growth at the Airport to the agreed level. Once this work had been completed a full draft of the Master Plan would be drawn for consultation with the Committee, the local authorities and other interested bodies.\nThe Airport had hoped that consultations on the Master Plan could be launched in the summer of 2005 but the timetable slipped a little and it was not until 17th February 2006 that the Committee was briefed on the content of the Plan at a special joint meeting with the Airport Transport Forum. [Copies of the slides used in this briefing] . The Plan was published for consultation in March 2006 with a consultation period of 2 months. More than 1000 hard copies were distributed with a further 200 e-mails drawing attention to the draft of the Plan which was posted on the Airport's website.\nThe period for comments on the Plan expired on 31st May 2006. In October 2006 Janet Goulton told the consultative committee there had been 23 responses from a wide variety of sources including the Greater London Assembly, the local boroughs, the local resident and business communities and environmental groups. Thirteen of the responses had fully supported the Plan and there was support but with caveats from a further three. Five of the respondents had expressed no opinion and 2 had opposed some elements of the proposals. Most of the comments concerned the environmental impacts of the proposals, surface access issues and car parking. None of the respondents had expressed doubts about the Airport's passenger forecasts.\nThe final version of the plan was published at the end of November 2006 and a copy can be seen on the Airport's website - click here . In some instances the points made by respondents have been incorporated directly into the text of the Plan and these are highlighted in blue. Other comments and further questions are included at the end of the relevant Chapter along with the Airport's reaction to them. The Plan remains the same in essence. It has been submited to the Department for Transport who are reported to be very pleased with it.\nImplementing the Master Plan\nLimit on Weekday Movements\nBy the middle of 2006 the Airport was approaching the daily limit of 240 air transport movements. In October 2006 the Airport told the Consultative Committee that pending the finalising of the Airport Master Plan the Airport had applied for temporary planning permission to redistribute the current daily limits such that it would be permitted more daily movements on Mondays to Fridays in exchange for fewer movements on Saturdays and Sundays and during quieter holiday times. The total annual movement of 73,000 movements would not be affected by this change.\nDetails of the changes, approved unanimously by Newham Council's Development Control Committee on 24th January 2007, can be seen on our Operations Page\nTop of Page\nEast Apron Extension\nIn May 2007 the Airport announced it had placed a contract worth \u00a319m with support services and construction company Carillion for the eastwards extension of the apron to provide additional aircraft parking stands.\u00a0 The contract was for the construction of a 20,000 square metre concrete platform, supported by piles and built over the King George V Dock to the east of the existing terminal.\u00a0 There was also a sound screen to minimise the noise impact of aircraft operations on neighbouring houses.\u00a0 Construction started in June 2007 and the new stands came into service early in the the summer of 2008.\nTop of Page\nRefurbishment of Departure Lounge\nA phased programme to enlarge and refurbish the Airport's Departure Lounge ws completed in March 2009 - for more details see our Passengers page\nTop of Page\nPlanning Application - increasing the number of flights\nEarly in August 2007 the Airport applied to the London Brough of Newham to vary the limits in the airport planning permission so as to increase the number of permitted flights.\u00a0 If approved the new overall annual limit, which wouldl apply to all movements including those to and from the Jet Centre, would be 120,000 per annum compared with about 81,000 such flights in 2006. This would allow for about three years growth by which time traffic at the Airport would be operating broadly in line with the capacity of facilities already built or approved \u00a0\u00a0This \"interim\" application does not seek permission to construct any new facilities.\nAttached is a note about the application by the Airport's MD, Richard Gooding. A copy of the application itself, along with all the supporting documents, is available on the our Archive Page and there is more information on our Operations Page. The key details of the application are:\nApplication Number: 07/01510/VAR\nResponsible Planning Officer: Sunil Sahadevan, tel: 020 8430 2000;\ne-mail: sunil.sahadevan@newham.gov.uk\nThe documents associated with the application can be seen on the Counci's website at http://pa.newham.gov.uk/online-applications/ . To see the papers enter the planning application number 07/01510/VAR\nThe Council say they sent consultation letters to all households in Newham south of Newham Way (A13). The closing date for representations was extended until 1st November 2007.\nOn 9th November the Airport issued a Question and Answer leaflet which seeks to answer many of the questions which have arisen about the Airport's application. The leaflet was delivered to all homes which normally receive the Airport's periodic publication Runway News and a copy has been placed on the Airport's website.\nOn 20 November 2007 the Council wrote to the Airport's planning consultants seeking additional information for the Environmental Statement which accompanied the application and also clarification on a number of other matters. A copy of the Council's letter is attached . The letter said that once the further information had been provided they would advertise its availability, and also write to statutory consultees, and there would then be a further period for comment. At the meeting of the Committee held on Tuesday 8th January 2008 it was reported that the Airport had responded to this request for for more information which you can be seen on our Archive Page) . Attached is a copy of a letter sent out that day by the Council from which it will be seen that the extended period for representations about the application was extended until 6th February 2008.\nAt the meeting of the Consultative Committee held on Tuesday 1st April 2008 it was reported that the Council had written to ask the Airport for further information on issues which had arisen in relation to the application and that when this had been submitted there would be a further period for the submission of representations. [Minutes Items 5 and 10 refer] .\nOn 18th April the Committee heard from the Council [copy of letter] confirming that they had now received from the Airport the additional information they required.\u00a0 There was thus a third period of consultation ending on 7th May (i.e. 21 days after the date of the letter). The additional information submitted by the Airport has been posted to the Council's website and also to that of the Committee where it can be seen on the Archive Page \u0096 the files headed Environmental Impact Statement - Second Addendum (April 2008) refer.\nThe application was due to be considered at a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the London Borough of Newham on Wednesday 30th July 2008 at the Old Town Hall in Stratford starting at 2pm. A copy of the report of the Council's officers is attached (.pdf 271kb)\nThe Committee met as planned but only to report the receipt that very morning of a letter from the Mayor of London . The Borough Planning Officer accordingly recommended to the Committee that it should postpone its consideration of the Airport 's planning application .\nIt will be noted that the Mayor of London requested that consideration of the application should be deferred pending further consideration and discussion of the impact of the expanded Public Safety Zones on the case for the proposed Thames Gateway Bridge and the potential impact on a number of sites earmarked for regeneration.\nHaving resolved the issues raised by the Mayor, the application was duly considered at a meeting of the Council's Development Control Committee on Wednesday 8th October 2008 - click here to see an extract from the minutes of this meeting and the two reports [ Addendum Report and Pages from original report ] on the application prepared by officers. The Committee voted 5-1 in favour of the recommendations of their officers to approve the application in principle.\u00a0 The Council\u2019s officers were authorised to discuss with the Airport the s.106 agreement and once that is agreed and signed the Borough Planning Officer was authorised to grant planning permission. A full note of the Heads of Terms for the proposed new s.106 Agreement can be seen at Appendix 1 of the Addendum report prepared by the Council\u2019s officers.\nSubsequent to the Council\u2019s decision the Government indicated that it would not be \u201ccalling-in\u201d the application for determination by the Secretary of State.\nHowever the determination of the application was subject to further delay. Following the Committee\u2019s October decision late representations were received from Friends of the Earth saying that a race equalities impact assessment should be carried out before planning permission is granted. In spite of the earlier resolution to delegate authority to the Borough Planning Officer to grant planning permission, the Council\u2019s officers took the view that this issue should be referred back to Committee by way of an update, and for Committee to consider whether to revisit its recommendation to grant planning permission in light of the FoE representations.\u00a0 The Development Control Committee thus met to consider the application again at its meeting on 14th January 2009. The report submitted by officers is appended along with Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 and Appendix 5.\nThe Council officers recommended that the Committee should confirm its previous resolution for the reasons explained in section 2 of their Report. It was not considered necessary for a race equality impact assessment to be carried out. Officers were satisfied that the decision of the Committee as reflected in its previous resolution was compatible with the Council\u2019s duties under s.71 of the Race Relations Act (as amended). However, the matter was not determined because of further late representations in relation to the Race Equalities issue and further representations from the Friends of the Earth in relation to Climate Change. The minutes of the Committee's meeting are appended - item 6 refers.\nLate in June 2009 the Committee was alerted by the Council that the application was to be considered again at the meeting of the Council's Development Control Committee on 8th July 2009. Click here to see a copy pf the report submitted to the meeting by the Council's officers. The meeting the Committee resolved to adopt the recommendations of it's officers - see the first page of their report after the maps, i.e. to approve the Airport\u2019s application subject to conditions and to a s.106 agreement - for full details see the Minutes of the meeting on the Council's website. The Council's Decision Notice(1.87mb) was issued the following day, 9th July, and the s.106 agreement (24.2mb) was signed that day also. There is a short summary of the s.106 Agreement on pages 2 and 3 of the November 2009 edition of the Airport's community news sheet Runway News\nAt the meeting of the Consultative Committee held on 6th October 2009 it was reported that interests opposed to the Council\u2019s decision were mounting a challenge to the Council\u2019s decision by asking for a judicial review on the grounds that the Council had not properly consulted on the application and that the cimate change aspects of the application had not be properly considered. Notwithstanding this the Airport planned to press ahead with the implementation of the new s.106 agreement. The case was finally heard in the High Court on 18/19 November 2010 and the judgement (.pdf 1.14mb) upholding the Council's decision to grant planning permission was issued on 20th January 2011. There was then an appeal but by mid-2011 the opposition interests seem to have decided not to take the matter any further.\nOne of the requirements of the s. 106 Agreement entered into on 9th July 2009 is that on 1 July each year the Airport should send to the local planning authority an Annual Performance Report describing its performance and compliance with the planning agreement in the preceding calendar year. The Report is to be published on this website. The Report for 2010 and its Appendices (in two files click here and here ) was posted to this website on 1st August 2011. The Report for 2009 and its Appendices can also be seen on this website.\nMany of the documents submitted in connection with this application can be seen on our Archive page . Others will be added as they become available.\nTop of Page\nNO Second Runway\nDuring March 2009 a story was doing the rounds locally suggesting that it is planned to have a second runway at the Airport.\nApparently the story emerged from the election propaganda of one of the candidates in the local by-election then in progress to fill a vacancy in Newham Council's Royal Docks Ward. The assertion apparently flowed from a statement by Teresa Villiers, the Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, which was reported in the Times on 29 January.\u00a0 This said:\n\"The Conservatives said yesterday that they were willing to expand airport capacity in the South East despite the party\u2019s environmental opposition to a third runway at Heathrow.\n\u201cLuton, City Airport or Southend could be allowed increased numbers of flights or an extra runway under the Tories, even though they argued against Heathrow\u2019s expansion on the grounds that it could jeopardise the target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.\u201d\nThe Airport say there are NO plans for a second runway. The Airport Master Plan of 2006 still stands. The Airport are not even using the existing runway to its maximum capacity so they certainly would NOT need a second runway. There have been NO negotiations on this matter and the Conservative Party has NOT been in touch with the Airport regarding this statement or any kind of expansion at the Airport.\nTop of Page\nAirport Stand Replacement Project\nIn November 2011 the Airport launched a consultation about a new project known as the Airport Stand Replacement Project (ASRP). The consultation looked at options to change the way the airport\u2019s parking stands for planes are arranged. The Airport said it was doing this so that it would have the correct sized space to accommodate the newer planes which some of the airlines using the airport have ordered. The Airport emphasised that the project would not increase the number of flights or require a new runway. A number of exhibitions were held at the end of November to show local people the options.\nFull details of the options are to be found in the special edition of Runways News distributed to 33,000 homes locally on 13 December 2011. In the light of the feedback received the Airport will draw up a planning application for submission to the London Borough of Newham, probably in March 2012.\nTop of Page\nThe Future of Helicopter Operations in London\nAt the July 2006 meeting of the consultative committee the Airport said it had given evidence to the investigation into helicopter noise by the Environment Committee of the Greater London Assembly . In doing so the Airport noted the Mayor of London's Heliport Policy as set out in the London Plan ( Chapter 3, page 111, para 3.178 ) as follows:\nThe Mayor and boroughs should consider heliport proposals in terms of the need for such facilities and their wider environmental impact.\nWorking with boroughs in east London, the Mayor will consider the need and practicality of identifying sites in east London for an additional heliport to support London 's economy.\nBoroughs should, in general, resist proposals for private heliport facilities with the exception of predominantly emergency use facilities.\nThe London Plan notes that if further provision is felt to be necessary to support London 's economy, then this new provision should be located to the east of the City to serve it, the Isle of Dogs and the wider Thames Gateway area.\nAgainst this background the Airport had offered to produce a discussion document to stimulate debate and this was published in September 2006 [Helicopter Discussion Document] . The Airport emphasised it had no aspirations to provide heliport facilities at LCY \u0096 rotary wing operations would not mix very easily with the fixed regime at the airport and in any case helicopters were prohibited by the Airport's planning permission. However, the present free-for-all would not be viable as rotary wing traffic built up on the approach to the Olympics. There was no control over helicopter landing sites which could be used for up to 28 days without planning permission. It might be better to have a well-sited, purpose built facility with a noise management system and other environmental controls similar to those in place at LCY. Whether or not a new heliport facility was needed locally it was essential that there should be better regulation of the traffic. To see the full Report click here .\nThe deadline for comments on the report was 31st October 2006. At its January 2007 meeting the Airport told the Consultative Committee that the Report had attracted 30 responses from local residents and businesses as well as local councillors. There was general agreement that the use of helicopters in the local area gave rise to difficult issues. Meanwhile the Airport noted the publication of the London Assembly's comprehensive Review of Helicopter Noise in London and agreed with the Recommendations of that report for further study.\n"}, {"score": 1041.8262, "uuid": "c896921b-e923-5b47-94c6-933650730b12", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0504wb-13-23099", "target_hostname": "www.goaheadtours.com", "target_uri": "http://www.goaheadtours.com/tours/LPF/london-paris-the-chelsea-flower-show/guide-currency.aspx", "page_rank": 1.2351598e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Currency - <em>London</em>, <em>Paris</em> &amp; the Chelsea Flower Show | Go Ahead Tours", "snippet": "Airline fuel surcharges, as applicable at time of pricing, are included. * 316 reviews of Holiday Inn Express <em>London</em> <em>City</em> in <em>London</em> * Offering 135 reviews of Mercure <em>Paris</em> Montparnasse in <em>Paris</em> Prices are per person based on double occupancy and vary by departure date and gateway.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1036.378, "uuid": "61a28baf-9f21-514e-8c4a-6c7e96c6643f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-93-29003", "target_hostname": "www.smh.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/parisstyle-train-plan-for-city-20111005-1l9pp.html", "page_rank": 1.2025968e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Paris</em>-style train plan for <em>city</em>", "snippet": "The plan would convert about a third of the CityRail network to metro services similar to those in <em>Paris</em> <em>or</em> <em>London</em>.

They would have far fewer seats than they have now but offer greater frequency.\nAn assessment by Transport NSW of Sydney's long-term rail strategy, obtained by the Herald, reveals that seven options are being prepared as part of the state's next transport masterplan, due next year.\nAdvertisement: Story continues below\nThe wave of the future ... CityRail plans to develop a new metro train network. This image has been digitally altered.\nBut planners are pushing a so-called three-tier strategy, which would replace large tracts of the rail network with high-frequency metro trains.\nThe proposal argues that more modern rolling stock and signalling equipment would allow up to 28 trains an hour to cross the Harbour Bridge, avoiding the need for an expensive second crossing on what is the rail network's main choking point.\nAt present, 20 trains an hour can cross the bridge. Eighteen trains an hour already cross it during the morning peak, meaning it is approaching capacity.\nThe document, Long Term Rail Strategy Phase 5 Assessment, marked ''cabinet in confidence'' and dated August 2011, also reveals that:\nrail planners expect that so much money and expertise will be tied up building the north-west rail link until about 2019 that another big project is not considered possible until then;\nthe Epping to Parramatta line is being planned as a shuttle between the stations but is not expected to operate until 2036;\nif the government does not build extra capacity through the city, or deliver a significant upgrade to rail technology, it would mean that services would need to be cut because passengers would take so long to disembark from carriages.\nShifting to a metro-style network would be expensive - and intensely controversial. On the plans obtained by the Herald, commuters travelling to the city from Rouse Hill and Cabramatta would most likely need to stand.\nThe assessment does not specify how much extra capacity would be added on the bridge if 20 double-decked trains were replaced by 18 single-decked trains. And it does not reveal how much it would cost to upgrade the signalling and rolling stock needed for the conversion to metros.\nBut the report suggests the government faces a choice between two ''service philosophies'' - suburban and three-tier or some sort of hybrid - in deciding on a future for the network.\nThe present suburban system offers double-decked trains with lots of seats, which means they are preferred for longer trips. But the heavier and faster suburban trains need to run with at least three-minute gaps between them, limiting them to 20 services an hour.\nThe ''three-tier'' philosophy would add metro trains to the present ''two-tier'' mix of suburban trains and express services from outer areas such as Newcastle, the south coast and the Blue Mountains.\nThe metro trains would run over the bridge. But to facilitate the shift, the report says a ''relief'' line would be needed between Redfern and Wynyard to allow non-metro trains from the west into the city.\nThe Keneally government promised to build this line but never explained that the reason for it was in part to enable the ''three-tier'' network.\nThe main alternative to shifting to metros is to build another harbour crossing for the existing network, as promised by Labor in 2005.\nThrough a spokesman, the Transport Minister, Gladys Berejiklian, said the government would consult industry and the community to develop a masterplan.\nThe report says that the consultant MTR, which operates the train network in Melbourne, will review work by other consultants on Sydney's future rail needs.\nJoin the conversation\n"}], [{"score": 1035.4736, "uuid": "fa980ff6-e0f5-543b-b51a-fdef96459c9b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0408wb-05-27398", "target_hostname": "www.homesandproperty.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property_news/buying_abroad/parisnewyorkorromesetyoursightsonabigcity.html", "page_rank": 1.176067e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Paris</em>, New York <em>or</em> Rome: set your sights on a big <em>city</em> | Buying abroad", "snippet": "<em>Paris</em>, New York <em>or</em> Rome: set your sights on a big <em>city</em> Overseas <em>cities</em> are becoming a favourite with <em>London</em> second-home buyers who want to enjoy another vibrant lifestyle and a great rental return, says Cathy Hawker Ever since Dick Whittington fell for the story that the streets of <em>London</em> were paved", "explanation": null, "document": "Estate agents\nParis, New York or Rome: set your sights on a big city\nOverseas cities are becoming a favourite with London second-home buyers who want to enjoy another vibrant lifestyle and a great rental return, says Cathy Hawker\n\u00a9 Eric Nathan/Alamy\nParis from the summit of the Arc de Triomphe\nEver since Dick Whittington fell for the story that the streets of London were paved with gold, cities have exerted a strong gravitational pull. Gold may not be in abundance but culture is on tap, the populations are often cosmopolitan and youthful, and opportunity can often be found around every corner.\nCities occupy two per cent of the earth yet are home to 53 per cent of the world's population, a figure predicted to reach 75 per cent by 2050.\nFor discerning overseas home buyers, too, cities have become more attractive. While sun, sea and sand were once the overwhelming reasons to buy abroad, figures from Knight Frank show that 37 per cent of second homes are now in cities. At the same time, buyers are more concerned than ever about rental returns, eager to find property to enjoy that will also provide some income. So where are the cities that combine alluring lifestyle with a potential rental jackpot?\nTop-performing cities\nRecent research from rental website holidaylettings.co.uk on the best-performing overseas cities for rental occupancy show New York, Paris and Rome are the winners, achieving up to 45 weeks a year. That compares with prime summer sun destinations, such as Ibiza, where the occupancy norm is closer to 12 weeks.\n\"Both Paris and St Tropez have good renting seasons but while the season in southern France is April to October, Paris will perform better year-round,\" says Kate Stinchcombe-Gilles from Holiday Lettings. \"Good quality, well-located city apartments attract weekenders in any month.\"\n\u00a3622,430: a two bedroom, high-ceiling flat in New York's Upper East Side (+1 212 606 7769\nSavills latest global research also demonstrates the strength of rental returns in the world's most-visited cities. New York and Paris are not seeing the stellar capital growth of New World cities such as Hong Kong or Singapore, yet they out perform those cities for rental yields. \"Our research shows average yields in New York and Paris are 6.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively,\" says Yolande Barnes of Savills Residential Research.\n\"Comparable property prices in Hong Kong are almost twice as expensive but rental yields are 3.1 per cent. New York property in particular looks good value at present with capital values still 15 per cent below their 2007 highs.\"\nNew York - it's up to you\nThe housing market in the US is bad, acknowledges Elizabeth Stribling of Savills Stribling, with New York prices back to levels last seen in 2005 - but the Big Apple has ridden out the storm better than elsewhere.\n\"New York has had few foreclosures and most buyers are cash purchasers,\" she adds. \"The cheaper dollar, coupled with more affordable prices than London or Paris, help the market.\"\n\u00a3612,755: a renovated two-bedroom flat on the East Side, near Central Park (+1 212 606 7769)\nToday, a third of all new condo developments in New York are purchased by non-US buyers. They include Chinese who buy near universities for their children, Russians who choose large trophy properties, and hip Europeans spending \u00a3640,000 in Brooklyn.\nStribling has a two-bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan for \u00a3800,000, while across the East River in Brooklyn an airy three-bedroom apartment is \u00a3587,265. A handsome two-bedroom apartment close to the green expanse of Central Park is \u00a3612,755 through Sotheby's.\nWeak Euro boosts Paris\nInternational demand is also driving the market in Paris where the weak euro is encouraging South Americans and Russians to snap up property. The city's compact historic centre and a lack of new developments conspire to keep the supply of accommodation low and prices high.\n\"Look at the edge of the Marais in the 4th arrondissement, the southern end of the 6th towards Luxembourg Gardens and the borders of the 1st and 2nd to find value,\" suggests Mark Harvey of Knight Frank. \"But keep in mind that property in the more edgy spots may have shabby communal areas. Ask who manages the building, and whether there is a sinking fund for renovation to avoid facing a large bill for repairs.\"\n\u00a3511,300: a two-bedroom duplex flat in Parc Monceau, central Paris (020 3040 8210)\nChesterton Humberts has a two-bedroom apartment in the prestigious 8th arrondissement reduced from \u00a3546,000 to \u00a3511,300. A one-bedroom penthouse close to the Louvre is \u00a3563,000 with Knight Frank. Rental yields are strong but owners should remember, properties let for less than a year require a permit.\nHomes in vibrant Rome\nA well-located Rome apartment rents for 40 weeks each year according to Holiday Lettings figures, with Trastevere and the Centro Storico particularly popular. Average square-foot prices are \u00a3950 to \u00a31,210 with an elegant two-bedroom apartment in atmospheric Campo de'Fiori priced \u00a31.17 million, through Knight Frank.\n\"The Centro Storico is vibrant but noisy,\" says Cristina Casacci of Knight Frank. \"Parioli Pinciano, an upmarket residential area north-west of the centre with early 1900 buildings is more peaceful.\" Expect to pay from \u00a3433,400 for a compact 540 sq ft flat in this hilly part of Rome close to the shady pine trees of Villa Borghese.\nA high-ceiling, two-bedroom apartment there is \u00a3953,480 through Knight Frank.

David Packer here discusses the way London has been described as an imperial monster, a \u2018do as you please\u2019 Babylon, a polypus, a stain, a mighty carbuncle, William Cobbett\u2019s \u2018great wen\u2019, or Mayhew\u2019s vast \u2018bricken wilderness\u2019. It has always been considered ungovernable and a city of extremes and contrasts.\u00a0[ 1 ]\nLondon is no longer the centre of a global colonial empire on which the \u2018sun never sets\u2019. In 1900 London was the largest and richest city in the world, reaching the highpoint of its demographic and industrial expansion as late as 1938. However, from the 1960s onwards the decline of old industries, the docks and the city\u2019s population paralleled the relative decline of Britain.\nYet London has a history of re-inventing itself or at least of making adjustments to radically new conditions. With the recent growth and rebirth of the City\u2019 as a global financial centre, London continues to be one of the great cities of a rapacious globalised capitalism. As a metropolitan capital and global financier, London draws in wealth along with people - labour power - from every corner of the globe. It remains an imperial centre sucking the life-blood of the planet.\nLondon: The Imperial Vampire\nLondon has always been highly cosmopolitan, from its foundation 2000 years ago by the Romans. As Roy Porter emphasises, \u2018\u2019the story of London begins with the \u2018foreigner\u2019. Londoners owe their city, so to speak, to the Italians\u2019.\u00a0[ 2 ] London has, moreover, always been a centre of rule and exploitation. Roman Londinium was not a mere tribal capital (civitas) but an imperial city \u2013 an implanted seat of government of the province of Britannia. Londinium contained extensive port facilities, a colossal commercial Forum and Basilica, the largest complex north of the Alps (as large as St Paul\u2019s Cathedral) and a military barracks.\nMedieval London, still protected by the old Roman walls enclosing the area known today as the \u2018City\u2019, was also a major European port and commercial locus. However, the seat of Royal government had been shifted upstream to the royal borough of Westminster, so that the monarch could maintain some independence from the power and influence of the city merchants, artisans and especially the volatile London masses.\nFor more than three hundred years, from the late sixteenth, to the beginning of the twentieth centuries, London, together with Westminster (there are two cities at the centre of London), grew to become the largest, richest and most advanced capitalist city in the world. Medieval London was already large but during the sixteenth century it began its extraordinary expansion from approximately 50,000 to 250,000 by the end of Elizabeth reign. The destruction of the monasteries by Henry VIII had freed up vast sources of wealth, stimulating capitalism and laying the basis for the English bourgeois revolution in 1642.\nThis unprecedented expansion was linked to Britain\u2019s acquisition of a colonial empire. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the port of London, now shifted to the Thames estuary, became the greatest entrepot in the world and, as in Roman times, a major centre of the slave trade, along with Bristol and Liverpool. By the mid-1840s London was widely recognised as the greatest city in the world, a global centre of world trade and finance.\nMany of London\u2019s problems were associated with its rapid growth and monstrous size. By 1700 London had already become the largest urban conurbation in the world, with the possible exception of Edo (Tokyo), and by 1800, contained nearly one million people \u2013 about the size of Ancient Rome at its height. Between 1800 and 1900 London\u2019s population grew from just under a million to more than 4.5 million \u2013 a veritable super-city - which reflected its economic position as a world centre of finance capitalism and of the British Empire.\nHowever, by about 1850 Paris and New York had also passed the million mark and by 1900, with the rapid spread of capitalist industrialisation beyond the shores of Britain, there were sixteen cities with over one million people. During the twentieth century, New York became the first financial and industrial city to overtake London in size and wealth.\nThe nineteenth century acknowledged London as the centre of things, with the creation in 1884 of the Greenwich Meridian in which London put the world in its place with all the continents spreading out east and west. It was of course those quintessential products of the industrial revolution, the steamship and railway network which required the creation of a standardised national and international time.\nLondon has often been regarded as a city of consumption, rather than production - the centre of both elite and popular culture in Britain, for example, the theatre, literature, newspapers/information, fashion, commercial music and the art markets. But this image is one-sided. For several centuries London was the greatest manufacturing centre in the country with a significant export capacity. During the nineteenth and much of the twentieth century the number of industrial workers in London exceeded the whole population of Manchester.\nHowever, it was not London, but Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow that were the main centres of the industrial revolution. Compared to the great northern industrial cities, much London industry remained small-scale, with many sectors based on cheap, sweated, often immigrant labour \u2013 this is still the case today in much of East London.\nThe Imperial Melting Pot\nLondon is a city that has over time absorbed significant numbers of refugees and migrants, who have often experienced resentment and racism. During the Middle Ages, communities of traders and merchants \u2013 Jews, Lombards, and other Italians, and the Germans of the Baltic Hanseatic League lived and worked in the city. Religious refugees also flooded into the city from all over Europe, most notably Huguenots from France. Around 1700, according to Porter, fewer than half the city\u2019s inhabitants were actually Londoners born and bred.\nThe sources of immigration shifted during the eighteenth century, as the imperial beast became hungrier. Black people began to arrive in significant numbers - a spin off from London\u2019s thriving slave trade. In the late nineteenth century, Jews fleeing racial discrimination in Eastern Europe came to the East End as did immigrants from the Empire and by 1870 there were more Irish living in London than in Dublin.\nBut it was after the Second World War, when London and Britain as a whole required new sources of cheap labour, that immigration from the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent occurred on a large scale. Subsequently, further influxes of people from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe occurred.\nThis long history of demographic replenishment has been central to London\u2019s success and its capacity to revive and remake itself under new conditions. Today, its hospitals, transport system and many of its social services rely on migrant labour. London is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the World, a polyglot, multiracial city with hundreds of languages spoken.\nCity of Conflict: London\u2019s Super Rich and the London Mob\nLondon\u2019s rich were always very, very rich but its poor were among the most impoverished and degraded in the world. The centuries of capitalist growth saw many outbreaks of class war and violence \u2013 although in the long term London has remained relatively stable. During the eighteenth century there was agitation and rioting by numerous artisans and tradespeople, caused by rising food prices and creeping industrialisation. During this and especially the subsequent century,\n\u2026there was the notion that the mob would take over. Indeed with the Gordon Riots of 1780, radical activity in the age of the French Revolution, the Chartist rallies of the 1840s and the new trade unionism of the 1880s \u2013 grounded not in the industrial North but in London\u2019s docks \u2013 this was a justifiable fear\u2026 In a later age, the race riots that flared in Notting Hill in the 1950s [to which could be added the Brixton and Broad Water Farm riots in the 1980s] rekindled such anxieties.\u00a0[ 3 ]\nMany writers and commentators were both fascinated and appalled by the \u2018London crowd\u2019, including Frederick Engels, who was a great observer of imperial London. He was shocked by the levels of poverty and describes \u2018sickly\u2019 and \u2018half-starved children\u2019, living in an \u2018immense tangle of streets\u2019 and \u2018nameless misery\u2019. He noted that even among the better off, \u2018the brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each . . . is nowhere so shamelessly bare-faced . . . as just here in the crowding of the great city\u2026\u2019 And, with a premonition of future road and tube journeys: \u2018each keeps to his own side of the pavement, so as not to delay the opposing streams of the crowd, while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a glance.\u2019\u00a0[ 4 ]\nAt the same time Londoners of all classes have valued their independence from the seat of government and have often been powerful enough to assert it. London has always been a difficult problem for the ruling class. Even recently, and despite all the machinations of the national British establishment, media and Labour bureaucracy, Ken Livingstone was elected mayor of London by popular acclaim. And Thatcher had had to abolish the Greater London Council (GLC) to unseat him!\nEven a thousand years before, the Norman robber baron William the Conqueror, after crushing the Saxon nobility at the battle of Hastings in 1066, did not dare to lay siege to the city, still protected behind its Roman walls. William withdrew to negotiate a settlement with its burgers, with the result that London was granted a Charter ensuring all those privileges, exemptions and powers that it had traditionally accrued to itself, in exchange for their agreement to crown him King of England. London could and sometimes did become both kingmaker and regicide.\nLondon is a highly class polarised city and therefore a very political city, and political movements such as the peasant movements of the fourteenth century or Chartism in the nineteenth century, always found their reflection and often active support. Richard II had to assassinate Watt Tyler, leader of the Peasants Revolt of 1381, on Blackheath, in his desperation to stop the peasant army forging links with the London populace.\nNo less than in Paris, the London masses, traditionally described by bourgeois historians as \u2018the London mob\u2019, have always been greatly feared by the British ruling classes, both feudal and capitalist. Royal castles such as the Tower of London or military barracks have always been a feature of the city landscape. Modern Londoners have extended active support and solidarity to workers\u2019 movements, such as the General Strike of 1926 and the great miners\u2019 strike of 1984-5.\nUnfortunately, for those of us who seek revolutionary changes, the enormous power of the working people of London, recognised by the bourgeoisie, is far less understood by the working class itself. But London\u2019s public spaces have witnessed historic confrontations, from the Chartist demonstration of 1848 on Kennington Common to the more successful Trafalgar Square riots of the early1990s which helped bring down both the poll tax and its creator, Margaret Thatcher. Nearly two million people marched to Hyde Park in February 2003 to declare their opposition to the invasion of Iraq.\nIn the late nineteenth century the London County Council (LCC) was first established. London had lacked a unified government until then, but the political representatives of the ruling class had at last understood that the free market could not solve London\u2019s huge social problems, which were dangerously explosive. Developments in public health, water supply, municipal housing, transport and a \u2018welfare\u2019 approach to poverty required the development of a modern interventionist state, an important lesson from Victorian history that Margaret Thatcher failed to appreciate. Social control was also high on the agenda, but the Metropolitan Police force was thought to make London too powerful and it continued to be separately controlled by the government. The GLC was founded in 1964 with fewer powers,\u00a0[ 5 ] and the current regime has even fewer.\nLondon\u2019s Labour\nWith its tradition of sweatshops and small-scale manufacturing as well as a large retail and service sector, London is not the centre of British trade unionism, although workers in important sectors such as transport, including railways, docks and airports, and service workers in local government and hospitals have been highly unionised. They have often engaged in important struggles, including the \u2018new unionism\u2019 movement of unskilled and semi-skilled workers at the end of the nineteenth century.\nAs economic expansion gained momentum in the late eighteenth century, London became the focus of a high concentration of craft skills and established the city as the supreme manufacturer of quality wares. This led to a relatively high wage economy (for a layer of skilled male workers) which sucked thousands of people into the capital. The expanding port of London and the attendant processing industries \u2013 timber, sugar, tobacco, rum, molasses \u2013 together with transport sectors also provided new employment for less skilled workers. However, there was always a great pool of unemployed and casual labour.\nMuch female employment was generated in servicing the rich and the burgeoning middle classes. The 1841 census reveals that London employed 168,701 domestic servants, overwhelmingly women, as well as thousands of dressmakers and milliners, laundry-keepers, washers and manglers. Also, by 1859 there were approximately 80,000 prostitutes regularly working, servicing all classes, but especially the middle and upper classes. As large numbers of working class women and children of both sexes drifted in and out of prostitution, the figure may have been even higher. This made the sex industry easily the second largest employer of women in the capital.\nBy the end of the century, alternative forms of employment for women, in factories, or as shop assistants and clerks, raised the price of female labour, including in the traditional sectors \u2013 in domestic service, the rag trade and in the sex industry. It also tended to make women more independent and less subservient. The famous match girls\u2019 strike was indicative of this new class confidence. Increasingly the large middle class, in search of cheap, servile labour, turned to rural areas, Ireland, the wider Empire, or the European Continent.\nLondon: A Social View of its Urban Fabric\nLondon developed as a vast, chaotic, conurbation, made up of a multitude of local foci, originally small towns and villages, which have been swallowed up by urban sprawl. London\u2019s complex development does not conform to modern ideas of urban growth and planning, nor to the type of planning associated with older absolutist European monarchies. Centralised state planning in this tradition could still impose rigid urban schemes, epitomised by the later Haussmann boulevards that criss-cross Paris. Laissez-faire and deregulation were always more ideologically and economically in tune with the premier city of free market capitalism. The pockets of planned city that were built, only serve to emphasise the improvisation or chaos of all the rest.\nDuring the nineteenth century there was a gradual break with a past in which the poor had often lived cheek by jowl with the rich. With changes in the London economy and the development of manufacturing, the well to-do began to move to the suburbs to escape the overcrowding, squalor and pollution of the inner city. In the early twentieth century, vast new suburbs were created, including for the professional and skilled working classes. The process continues today. London is like a great onion, with its multiple centres embedded within the different layers of development, with each layer or period of expansion architecturally distinct.\nPresent-day London dominates the economy and demography of the whole of south east England. In the post-war period more than two million Londoners and many London businesses moved out to \u2018satellite\u2019 towns beyond the \u2018green belt,\u2019 while many villages were designated New Towns. Milton Keynes, for example, is today a substantial urban sprawl. Tens of thousands of middle class and professional workers also moved out to the more attractive small towns and villages in the Chilterns, or Kent and Sussex. 300,000 now commute into London daily.\nDespite the decanting of population to the New Towns, London\u2019s population during the fifties and sixties remained stable, at about 8.5 million. This was due to large-scale immigration from the ex-colonies. There was also the phenomenon of the \u2018gentrification\u2019 of old working-class neighbourhoods by new professional workers. However, Britain\u2019s post-war industrial decline eventually had an impact, reflected in demographic contraction from the late 1960s.\u00a0[ 6 ] More recently, however, from approximately 1984, re-expansion of service industries and international finance has reversed this decline.\nPostscript: Decline and Revival?\nLondon has long been a base for foreign financial operations, but when Thatcher abolished exchange controls in 1979 the protective barrier between the domestic and the international sectors of the city economy was pulled down. This enabled foreign firms to take over existing broking and jobbing houses and allowed the creation of highly competitive financial conglomerates. The \u2018Big Bang\u2019 of the 1980s consolidated London\u2019s International Stock Exchange. This continues today. According to Inwood, \u2018In 1994 London processed $300 billion of foreign exchange each day, as much as New York and Tokyo together, and five times as much as Germany.\u2019\u00a0[ 7 ]\nIt has been argued that the world-wide dispersal of industrial production in search of cheap labour, of which London itself, and especially its working class, has been a victim, has demanded the growth of these regional \u2018global cities\u2019. They are financial regulators, \u2018transterritorial market places\u2019 and \u2018command centres\u2019 of the \u2018new global economy\u2019 - cities which have the capacity to handle the massive and rapid financial flows required by international corporations. However, the gulf between London\u2019s rich and the working classes, especially its poorest sectors, ethnic minorities, unemployed and under-employed, has never been greater \u2013 it is potentially an explosive mix.\nBy 1994 London\u2019s unemployment rate had risen, according to the London Research Centre, to over 13 per cent, the highest in the UK, and with few prospects for the unskilled. By 1997, London possessed two-thirds of England\u2019s worst public housing, and contained a total of 230,000 dwellings unfit for human habitation. The crime-rate once again increased. All this is in the context of London\u2019s Gross Domestic Product in 1993 reaching $180 billion (18 per cent of national GDP) and it has continued to grow \u2013 its economy is twice the size of Saudi Arabia, bigger than Turkey and Russia and two-thirds that of India.\nA visit to central London will not only reveal the presence of many expensive residential districts, but an extraordinary large numbers of big limousines. But here is the rub - they are mostly Mercedes, BMWs and Lexuses from Germany and Japan \u2013 even Rolls Royce is now owned by Mercedes. How long London can maintain a leading role in the world economy - with Frankfurt snapping at its heels, and when Britain as a whole has suffered a disastrous decline in manufacturing production - is a moot point.\nDave Packer is a longstanding member of the Trotskyist movement in Britain.

City of lights! City of love!\nParis is all things to all people - a cosmopolitan nightclub, an artsy escapade, a gastronomic adventure, a tour down history's grand boulevards.\nSituated in the north of the country in the \u00cele-de-France region, Paris is the capital and largest city in France. The city is built on the banks of the River Seine and is densely populated with about two million in the city itself and almost twelve million in the Paris metropolitan area.\nThe lifestyle in Paris is one of its major draw cards and Paris has been recognised as one of the ten most liveable cities in Europe, as well as being ranked among the ten greenest European cities.\nThe Paris Region is also the powerhouse of the French economy and contributes more than 25 percent of France's GDP. Tourism plays an important part in the economy of Paris as it is one of the most popular destinations in the world, attracting more than 45 million visitors annually.\nA Brief History of Paris\nThe signs of the earliest settlements in the Paris region date from around 4200 BC.\nThe Romans claimed the area in 52BC with Roman settlements remaining there for hundreds of years. In the fifth century the area was colonised by Germanic Franks and then in the ninth century Paris was plagued by continual Viking invasions and occupations.\nThe city was briefly occupied by the English in the fifteenth century but returned to French rule and was again capital of the country in 1436. It remained under French rule for another 400 years until it was occupied by the Russians for a brief period in 1814.\nThere have been several periods of major disease throughout history and the Parisian population was devastated by the Black death in 1348, as well as the plague in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1849.\nDuring the 19th century there was massive growth in industry which began the modernisation of Paris into what we know today.\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889 showcased a technically advanced Paris to the world and brought to the city the 'temporary' structure of one of Paris' most famous landmarks - the Eiffel Tower.\nThe city was miraculously spared in World War One and the ensuing inter war period became a golden age in the art and culture scene in Paris. Dark days returned however, when Paris fell to the Germans in June 1940, and it was not until four years later that the city was once again liberated.\nIn the post-war years Paris recovered quickly and there was a great transformation of many neighbourhoods into social estates which were less industrialised than in the past. The Paris of today is a vibrant, living city with a history so rich it oozes out of every stone and brick, and can be seen in the faces of its people.\nThings to See and Do in Paris\nThe list of things to see and do in Paris is almost endless, with museums, art galleries, cathedrals and monuments on almost every block of the city.\nSome attractions not to be missed include amazing historical landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe - the 'Triumphal Arch' in the Place Charles de Gaulle that celebrates those who fought and died for France in the in the battles of the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary wars. The Eiffel Tower - the 'temporary structure' that is now one of Paris' most iconic and beloved landmarks. Be sure to get there early as there are always crowds waiting to buy tickets.\nThe Louvre is probably the most famous art gallery in the world. It houses many great works of art and is most notable for being home to the Mona Lisa\nThere are also famous buildings including the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale dating from the early 18th century and the seat of the French Parliament, and Chateau de Versailles - probably the most beautiful chateau in all of France.\nThe Ar\u00e8nes de Lutece in the Quartier Latin is an ancient Roman amphitheatre from the first century and is one of the most significant Gallo/Roman ruins in Paris. The Catacombs of Paris (l'Ossuaire Municipal) are located in an old stone mine where bones of around six million bodies from Paris' overcrowded cemeteries have been stored. This fascinating part of French history has been open to the public for more than 140 years.\nParis is not short of spectacular churches either such as the impressive Notre Dame Cathedral, an incredible Gothic Cathedral which was the inspiration behind The Hunchback of Notre Dame; the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Basilica which offers a marvellous view of Paris from the of the highest point in the city; and La Sainte Chapelle which is one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the whole of France right in the heart of Paris.\nParis is also home to many museums that display works of specific masters or artistic styles, such as the Picasso Museum, Rodin Museum, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan-Monet and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie.\nThere are so many events held in Paris throughout the year that there is likely to be something on during any visit. Annual events include Chinese New Year in February, Spring Fashion Week in March, F\u00eate de la Musique and the Gay Pride parade in June, Bastille Day Parade on July 14th, le Tour de France which culminates under the Arc de Triomphe on the last Sunday of July, the Paris Plage in July and August, Jazz \u00e0 la Villette in September, a second Fashion Week and Nuit Blanche in October, Festival de l'Automne in November.. the list goes on!\nSports\nApart from the amazing art and culture scene, Paris is also home to several international sporting events.\nThe French Tennis Open starts on the last Sunday in May and runs for two weeks attracting the best tennis players from all over the world.\nThe Six Nations Rugby Tournament is held in February and sees France, Wales, Scotland, England, Italy and Ireland battle it out for traditional rugby honours.\nThe Paris Marathon is held in April and attracts up to 40,000 runners every year.\nParis | Explore Full Paris Map\nLocal Flavours\nThere are countless cafes and restaurants throughout the city and the art of fine dining has been an important part of the city's culture for more than two centuries. Less expensive restaurants are usually crowded and you may be seated next to strangers, but it can be worth it just for the experience. It is best to book well in advance to ensure getting a table at any of the finer restaurants.\nAlthough there are speciality dishes from all over France and beyond available in Paris, some of the local flavours to enjoy while here are traditional pastries and breads including baguettes, croissants and sweet or savoury filled crepes, game meats (including boar and venison) as well as some amazing more traditional meat dishes, and seafood such as fresh mussels, sea snails, lobsters and oysters. Of course, no trip to Paris would be complete without sampling frogs legs and 'escargot and fois gras'.\nGetting In and Around Paris\nCharles de Gaulle International Airport is the main airport in Paris and the RER subway goes direct to the centre of the city. Most major cities around the world have flights to Paris .\nIt's not recommended to drive in the centre of Paris. The traffic is very busy and it's almost impossible to find a carpark. Taxis are relatively cheap but it's often quicker to walk or take the metro - especially during the day.\nOn foot is the best way to see all the sights. It's possible to walk across the city in a few hours and there are many walking tours available in the capital, which is a great way to ensure you see as much of the city as possible.\nTravelling by bicycle is another great way to see the city and there are many bike rental shops around. The streets are easy to travel and motorists are also very mindful of cyclists - maybe due to the hefty fines imposed for hitting a cyclist.\nBy far the best way to get around the city is by subway, known as the Metro. There are 16 metro lines that criss-cross the city and trains leave every few minutes. The trains run from 5am until 12:30am week days and till 01:30am on Sunday mornings.\nWhen travelling outside the city limits you will need to use the RER rail network. This is a different system from the metro and requires it's own tickets. Be sure to have the correct ticket as failure to do so will result in a hefty fine - and ticket inspectors won\u2019t hesitate to nab ignorant tourists! The other option is to hire a car, and there are plenty of Paris car hire places at the airport and around the city.\nThere is a comprehensive bus system that runs through the city. It can be quite complicated but it offers routes to areas the metro doesn't service.\nAnother great way to see the city is by boat, which takes a circular route past many of the most famous sites in Paris. You can buy a single or multiple day ticket which allows you to hop on and off as many times as you like.\nParis Weather\nParis experiences warm summers and cool winters with the nearby Atlantic ocean moderating the temperature extremes. Summer in Paris is warm and is thought by many to be the best time of year to visit, however this is peak season and many of the attractions are usually very crowded. Although Paris rarely gets any snow it can be beautiful to stroll through Paris in winter when the air is crisp and the crowds are small. Spring and Autumn are generally cool and wet and also less crowded than in summer.\nGood to Know\nRestaurants and cafes are usually very crowded as space is often at a premium. If you plan to dine out it is best to book far in advance as many of the finer restaurants are booked out months ahead.\nDriving in Paris is risky as the traffic is very dense and it's almost impossible to find a carpark. It's best to use the Metro to get around the city.\nIf taking the metro for a journey of only one or two stops in Paris it is often just as quick to walk instead. The metros generally run terminus to terminus but in peak hours they might terminate before the end of the line. This can be difficult to know so listen carefully to all announcements (in French). If the train starts going in the opposite direction you can be pretty confident what's happened! Children under 4 years get to travel free of charge on metros and busses. Transferring metro lines can often mean walking up and down many flights of stairs so if travelling with a lot of luggage it might be easier to travel by bus.\nThe French are generally very warm and helpful but like in any country be sure to be courteous, polite and smile a lot if asking for assistance. It is best to target younger Parisians for help as they are less likely to be in a hurry and their English is often much better than older generations.\nSome very helpful phrases in French are \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (do you speak English?),\"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\" (could you help me?), and \"Excusez-moi de vous d\u00e9ranger\" (I'm very sorry to bother you).\nStaying at Paris\nThere is an amazing range of accommodation in Paris ranging from cheap backpacker/hostel type dorms, to top class 5 star hotels with correspondingly high class rates. Peak season is from the end of spring and all through summer as well as the traditional Christmas season. Prices for accommodation are in line with the rest of Europe's major cities. In peak season it is important to book your Paris hotel in advance to avoid a frustrating trek looking for a room. However most hotels will cheerfully offer suggestions for alternative places to stay if they are booked out.\nAttractions in Paris:\n"}, {"score": 1002.91516, "uuid": "8235e12f-00f4-5955-898e-147e65304803", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-06-29606", "target_hostname": "www.soulstrut.com", "target_uri": "http://www.soulstrut.com/index.php/City_Guide/C157/", "page_rank": 1.3802602e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Soul Strut : <em>City</em> Guide : <em>London</em>", "snippet": "If you\u2019re visiting <em>London</em> and want to watch some proper football, you wont find anywhere <em>better</em> than this beautiful 60,000 seater stadium.", "explanation": null, "document": "Added by Ulysses31nicholas Wednesday, June 02, 2010\nThis is a Record Store\n8 Bradbury Street, London N16 8JN, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Wednesday, June 02, 2010\nThis is a Record Store\n7 Broadwick Street, London W1F 0DA, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Tuesday, June 01, 2010\nThis is a Restaurant\n10 Arcola Street, London E8 2DJ, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Tuesday, June 01, 2010\nThis is a Record Store 42 Langham Street, London W1W 7AT, United Kingdom\nAdded by djmario Wednesday, November 17, 2010\nSelf claimed to be \u201cmore than just a record store\u2026\u201d the guys at If certainly live up to their own proclamation. What you will find at If music is service second to none (no angry London hipster service here; rather the finely coiffed, suited and well spoken musings of Jean Claude et al.) A hand picked selection of new releases and rare original records you\u2019ll likely never have heard about without them and a store that is surely the definition of \u201cboutique\u201d (the listening station is two leather chairs next to a fireplace with a cooler containing Whisky poured for the customers?!!). Prices on new releases are competitive for the most part, and in some cases the cheapest you\u2019ll find in the UK. The used records tend to be on priced high, but you can expect the records you buy to be in excellent condition and rare as hell!!\nIf you only have time to visit one store in London, this is where I\u2019d head.\nThis is a Bar 5 Ravey Street, London EC2A 4QW, United Kingdom\nAdded by llmod1 Saturday, June 05, 2010\nGreat basement bar with cool atmosphere.\nCurrent home of Brillo, a monthly meet for London Diggers (out-of- towners of course are welcome) to show off their finds for that month.\nFile Under: Random Awesomeness 75 Drayton Park, London N5 1BU, United Kingdom\nAdded by Okem Thursday, June 03, 2010\nHome of the Arsenal.

If you can brave the distance you\u2019ll be rewarded with an old school record shop with a variety of good bits to be found. Bottom line, there are bargains here and it\u2019s worth spending some time, also some nice pieces on the wall. Alan is friendly and amicable and will usually negotiate on batch deals. There are a number of long standing vinyl piles in here that for some unknown reason don\u2019t really get disturbed until sale time - which is when Alan\u2019s is really most worth visiting - with sales typically at 25%. It\u2019s hard to know exactly when these take place unless you\u2019re a regular, but they are legendary events. In any case Alan\u2019s is definitely worth a visit if you\u2019ve never been.\nThis is a Record Store 8 Bradbury Street, London N16 8JN, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Wednesday, June 02, 2010\nOne of London\u2019s best kept secrets, the Eldica Vinyl shop is located on a backstreet behind the Dalston Kingsland train station, and is so tucked away you could easily miss it. In fact it looks like they sell beads and incense there. Go inside and you will find a small but lively selection of records thats big on funk, breaks and soul. Owner Andy Westbury is a friendly guy, a lifelong hip hop fan who is utterly passionate about the records he sells and the music he plays. Andy\u2019s stock caters to the collector, the bboy and the samplist - you\u2019ll find plenty of hip hop rareties here, boogie classics, funk and soul 45s, odd soundtracks, and much more. Prices are pretty fair, priced on condition and Andy is usually happy to negotiate on batch deals. Thus its no wonder that Eldica has counted the likes of Cut Chemist, Dj Format, Foreign Beggars, and more recently Dam Funk and Mayor Hawthorne amongst their many customers over the years.\nThis is a Record Store 7 Broadwick Street, London W1F 0DA, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Tuesday, June 01, 2010\nOne of the best known shops in London due to their legendary record label called Soul Jazz and their unmistakable ear for quality as well as nice pricing, Sounds Of The Universe are nowadays one of the last remaining record shops of the \u201cold school\u201d in bustling Soho. Very close to the Piccadilly Circus tube stop, they are always worth a visit, mostly for the excellent new reissues and compilations they do, as well as their constantly revolving stock of new gems and upfront white labels. If you\u2019re at all interested in checking out what is cutting edge in the UK music scene at any time, its likely to be found in here. The basement has an excellent selection of 2nd hand soul, jazz and funk rareties and gems too, at fair prices - its unlikely you\u2019ll find Boscoe in here for 50p however.\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth noting that they are big reggae, dub and jamaican music fans, and there is always a great selection of jamaican 7\"s as a result.\nThis is a Restaurant 10 Arcola Street, London E8 2DJ, United Kingdom\nAdded by Ulysses31nicholas Tuesday, June 01, 2010\nWhere to get the best kebab is a subject of much debate amongst Londoners. If you happen to be on the east side then Mangal 1 is definitely a contender for the crown. The kebabs are not at all greasy here and the meat is of high quality. The restaurant has an enjoyably grimey ambience and is tucked away behind bustling kingsland road, reducing the number of drunken patrons slightly as a result, but you\u2019ll need to get here early or book by phone to ensure a seat at the weekends, its that popular. Mangal counts pop artists Gilbert and George amongst their regulars and is a worthwhile visit for those unfamiliar with the authentic turkish kebab experience. NB - Mangal 2 owned by the same people is also worth a look if Mangal 1 is too busy.\nPage 1 of 1 pages\nLocations\n"}, {"score": 998.2122, "uuid": "38f0c5b2-0110-53c9-9e5c-995d27e02002", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1010wb-23-25297", "target_hostname": "www.theclassical.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theclassical.org/articles/paris-is-earning-part-5", "page_rank": 1.3519514e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Paris</em> <em>is</em> Earning, Part 5 | The Classical", "snippet": "\u201d identity.6 Further, until the late 1970s, <em>Paris</em> did not have a central, popularly elected mayor, <em>which</em>, Mignon suggests, limited civic schemes that could unify the <em>city</em> in terms of leisure pursuits.", "explanation": null, "document": "Paris is Earning, Part 5\nFree Market Football in the City of Light\nPhoto by\u00a0Moacir P. de S\u00e1 Pereira\nJanuary 13, 2012 - 9:30am\n| By Moacir P. de S\u00e1 Pereira\nParis has never had a soccer team befitting its image of itself as the center of the world. For 40 years, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club has failed to live up to the lucrative standard of the rest of the city. Despite underperforming teams and a largely working-class fan base, the club has always seemed like it should give its owners a license to print money. The question then: can you gentrify a team? PSG did what unscrupulous developers have done for decades: They changed the rules, preyed on fears of crime, and cynically played for a newer, richer kind of fan. The fifth of a five-part series examining what happens to a football club when everyone\u2019s eyes have turned to \u20ac\u20ac.\nPart 1 - Part 2 - Part 3 - Part 4 - Part 5 - Single page\nFor at least a year, the US sports columnist who has most successfully leveraged the frustrations of the common sports fan has been hammering away at how the live experience of sports \u201csucks.\u201d The ubiquity of \u201c65-inch HDTVs\u201d has made, in his opinion, fans less inclined to go see the real deal. The real deal costs money and involves dealing with negatives like traffic, strangers, bad sightlines, and a lack of statistical information on the fly. 1 In short, he maintains, there\u2019s a ton of value added in watching at home: it\u2019s easier on the checkbook\u2014er, credit card\u2014but it\u2019s also more comfortable. One has greater control over the environment, like the option to drink imported beers from glass bottles past the seventh inning if one feels eager to do so.\nIn October, Bill Simmons invited the CEO of Ticketmaster, Nathan Hubbard, to his podcast to talk about this growing disinterest on the part of fans to bother buying tickets to sports. 2 \u201cWe have a fan experience problem,\u201d Hubbard responded, saying that \u201ccasual fans\u201d have \u201cso many other options\u201d these days that Ticketmaster, along with teams, has to \u201cinnovate on the experience.\u201d The solution, for Hubbard, is to \u201cpersonalize the experience for everyone,\u201d to \u201csell the right experience\u201d at the right price to the right person, thereby building \u201ca lifelong fan\u201d who remains loyal to the individual attention. 3 In between jokes about domestic violence and nostalgia for Pearl Jam, Simmons and Hubbard speculated about how this \u201cright experience\u201d can be achieved.\nEverything relating to the fans\u2019 relationship to the team is now defined by the market. They don\u2019t consider going to the live games worth it. Their time is better spent playing Angry Birds on the couch. Ticketmaster, in turn, looks to the market for an answer. The solution for them is to attract casual fans (not \u201cfootball casual,\u201d as in hooligan) by individually negotiating the sale of each ticket with them. In providing various add-ons and deals for other tickets, Tickemaster can give a sense of value individually designed for that specific casual fan. There is no such thing as a generic \u201cseason ticket holder\u201d anymore, as each person has a different recorded buying history and set of incentives to which he or she responds\u2014their \u201cdigital fingerprint,\u201d in Hubbard\u2019s words\u2014that tips them to buy the tickets they do. At one point, Hubbard told Simmons that those running teams are now \u201cbrand managers,\u201d and teams have to maximize their brand\u2019s appeal to casual consumers. That is not at all new in the US. What he avoided mentioning was that, in a typical neoliberal turn, he is treating each individual customer as his or her own entrepreneurial brand manager as well. One individual consumer\u2019s brand needs, say, a 50% discount on U2 and Disney on Ice tickets added to the Clippers season tickets in order to make the cost of the basketball season tickets worthwhile.\nBut things get complicated when you square this casual fan experience issue with the situation regarding PSG. Simmons and Hubbard tout hyper-individualization as a solution to crumbling ticket sales\u2014as a way to get someone back to the stadium. But Parc des Princes had been posting a reasonable annual attendance average for over a decade. No huge collapses appeared over the past two years, as they had in the US. So PSG, with the Tous PSG ticket policy, willfully decided to henceforth attract only individual casual fans. Taking advantage of a public safety situation and sensationalist media coverage, they blew up a good thing and wiped the slate clean . The exiled former fans could only come back once they reregistered as casual fans, no longer eligible to be a part of the soul of the team.\nThe Tous PSG bet is that a sports team can be profitable catering only to casual fans, rendering history and association insignificant. Maybe it took an official stance against racism to lure back fans disgusted by the racist provocations at the stadium. But sweeping racism from the stadium did not require the radical makeover of telling 13,000 fans they were no longer wanted in the cheap seats. Further, all those fucking Pastore shirts suggest that, in a metropolitan area of 12m, it is not impossible to find 40,000 glory hunters every other weekend. Former Club President Leproux\u2019s calling cheap tickets for children an investment sounds like Hubbard\u2019s plan to commodify individual identities in order to build a \u201clifelong fan\u201d with a sellable experience, or, another way, a lifelong casual fan who comes because it\u2019s \u201cworth it,\u201d not be cause he or she feels the \u201cneed\u201d to support the team. The team is not interested in keeping you, specifically you, around for life. They\u2019ll find another you, if they need to. That other you will hopefully earn a bit more and be willing to pay a bit more for your ticket. But in the meantime, you\u2019ll suffice. Luckily for the new owners, PSG does not yet have to worry about how it will sell most of its tickets for every match. On the cold, grey, drizzly day I walked into Parc des Princes to have my photograph taken and get my Tous PSG card, however, I gave them my digital fingerprint for when they will.\nProfessional sports is a business. That is not the problem here. Unlike many soccer teams that emerged organically from, say, railroad workers kicking the ball around after hours ( Manchester United ) or young rich men who hoped that having their own team would impress local high society women ( Flamengo ), PSG was, always, first and foremost, a business proposition with a side trade in civic pride. 4 Dissolving the fan associations and creating 40,000 individual consumers at Parc des Princes, however, shows us what happens when everything becomes a business, when our entire lives are lived within the logic of the market.\nAgainst those 40,000 individual consumers buying tickets for each match and the money pouring into Qatari wallets from those ticket receipts, the passionate pride of the boycotting ex-viragiste as the \u201csoul\u201d of the team is simply out of joint. In one sense, it\u2019s quaint in its na\u00efve old-fashioned way. But it maybe also holds a share of a promise for those of us who refuse to accept that the current state of affairs is also the only possible state of affairs. If one believes that \u201canother world is possible,\u201d to borrow a phrase, then realizing the other world benefits from studying social structures, like supporter groups, that resist the neoliberal paradigm.\nIn holding out the boycott, the ex-viragistes maintain their unwillingness to become individual consumers, even though every successful season for PSG along the lines of this one (so far) will further marginalize the former members of the Kop of Boulogne and Virage Auteuil. At the same time, fans get more accustomed to the invasions of privacy and lockdown mentality demanded by Tous PSG. The market has become universal and normal\u2014other forms of engagement, like a romantic one, have become relics.\nFans leave early, anticipating a home defeat to Nancy\nParis has never had big-time soccer, at least not on a level befitting its greatness as a city. While teams from Marseille, Lyon, and even highway rest stop Saint-\u00c9tienne have found glory on the international stage, Paris has always been a bit of a joke. Writing in 2002, Patrick Mignon gives several reasons for this hiccup. First, in countries like Spain and Italy, you have intercity rivalries with socio-economic consequences that get played out by proxy on the soccer field; Madrid\u2019s efforts to dominate Barcelona, and the Catalan resistance to those efforts gets played out in the economy, in politics, and on the soccer field. In France, Paris is a city simply without peer, and the other cities must remain content jousting for domination of their small regions. 5 As a result, Paris becomes synonymous with France in the republican imagination, leaving the city without much of a specifically \u201cParisian,\u201d as opposed to \u201cFrench,\u201d identity. 6 Further, until the late 1970s, Paris did not have a central, popularly elected mayor, which, Mignon suggests, limited civic schemes that could unify the city in terms of leisure pursuits.\nFinally, \u201c Paris is not a city made of real Parisians .\u201d Very few people who live in the capital have roots that run as deep as they do elsewhere. The Arabic word \u201c bled \u201d has come to mean, in French slang, both a useless place in the boonies as well as the ancestral hometown, and it seems that Paris attracts people who are willing to leave behind their bled, be it in West Africa, Maghreb, Brittany and the rest of France, the overseas departments of France like Guadeloupe, or Spain, Portugal, Italy, Eastern Europe, or every corner of Asia. The world, in brief. Those who arrive here do so expecting to advance socially or economically\u2014not necessarily plant new roots. Mom and Dad don\u2019t live here, so neither should their soccer team play here. As a result, Mignon concludes, there is no history of \u201cpassionate or loyal\u201d support for Parisian soccer teams. \u201cThere is only the attraction of the spectacle and of the excursion that is going to Parc des Princes, but more in the style of the ironic fl\u00e2neur than in that of the loyal supporter.\u201d\nIn the end, of course, it\u2019s the ironic fl\u00e2neur/fl\u00e2neuse and his or her earning potential and disdain for sentimental, sanguine fervor who is courted by PSG. Screw the real fans, as long as the fucking Pastore shirts keep leaping off the shelves. 7 Onwards to the future with this new fanbase, 40,000 armies of one. 8\nAll autumn, a rumor kept bubbling up that, though now almost certain not to come true, provides a clean way to close this occasion for thinking through the problem of sports without fans in a world without society. In mid-September, the story broke that newly installed Sporting Director Leonardo was interested in signing 36-year-old David Beckham once his contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy expired on New Year\u2019s Day. Leonardo told the BBC that Beckham \u201cis more than a football player\u2014 he\u2019s a brand, a pop star . I would always consider him.\u201d The story continued to pop up from time to time, with other people offering their opinions on the dream move for PSG .\nBeckham is precisely the sort of player PSG would be trying to sign, now that they have a pretty good team on the field, because his main attraction\u2014his value\u2014lies off the field. Journalist Tony Karon brings up Beckham when writing about the growing popularity of soccer in East Asia , where fans are more attracted to teams with global brands, like Manchester United and Karon\u2019s own Liverpool, than to their local leagues or teams. For Karon, Real Madrid\u2019s 2003 signing of Beckham was a sign of the Spanish front office\u2019s interest in growing in this market. Beckham\u2019s \u201creal appeal is as an icon, the handsome, soft-spoken, family man\u2026 with a global pop-idol appeal\u2026 To put it unkindly, while Beckham\u2019s contribution to Real Madrid\u2019s performances on the field will always be eclipsed by the likes of Zidane\u2026 he has no peer when it comes to selling the club\u2019s shirts to teenagers in Asia.\u201d 9\nThough Beckham, for family reasons, decided not to bring his brand expansion show to France, the interest shown by the PSG front office in courting him showed, yet again, how willing PSG was to turn its back on the soul of the team. The soul can keep on marching, protesting, and boycotting as a mass. This mass, refusing to split up individual consumers and eager to remain a part of something bigger, remains important only to the police hired to make sure they do not get too rowdy outside the stadium. Only when they are willing to start buying tickets again, at inflated prices and with Tous PSG cards in hand, will they be welcomed back. Until then, the neoliberals in the PSG front office, believing in the permanence of the market, will sneer at the protestors, confident that nothing will ever change except the bottom line.\nI haven\u2019t lived in the US for a while, but I have trouble believing that US fans are staying away from $20 tickets to baseball because they have \u201c65-inch\u201d televisions hung on the walls of their modest homes. I\u2019ve never even seen a television that big in a residence, but the Sports Guy is the voice of the Joe the Supporter, so I\u2019ll defer to his measurements. \u21a9\nBeyond talking about 65-inch HDTVs, this episode of the BS Report has an especially 1% vibe to it, including an out-of-touch failure of a joke about Occupy Wall Street. \u21a9\n\u201cExperience\u201d is a good warning word that one is about to be dealing with the apotheosis of the focus on the individual. It no longer matters what a thing is (or what a thing means ) in comparison to how someone experiences it. Who cares if the Clippers lost? If the fan\u2019s experience of the loss was good, another ticket will be bought. \u21a9\nOK, Flamengo\u2019s first team was a rowing team, and soccer only came in later with the arrival of disgruntled ex-Fluminense players, but, Hollywood! Its origin story sits ready-made for the silver screen! Late 19th-century high society location shoots in Rio! Rowing practice montages with the Sugar Loaf Mountain in the background! Act now and you can have it in theaters by the Rio Olympics! \u21a9\nLondon might consider itself without peer in England, but Mignon points out that it is also much larger as an urban entity than Paris is, and, as a result, can support many, many professional teams. The Premier League is currently 25% London teams, for example, and there are London-based professional teams throughout the various lower divisions. \u21a9\nI have been criticized by Parisians for saying that Paris is in the \u201cnorthern\u201d part of France. Nonsense, they tell me. It\u2019s in the center! I give up, mumbling to myself that feeling again trumps cartography. \u21a9\nI am, of course, precisely this kind of consumer of PSG. They\u2019re not my team in France, but I don\u2019t hate them\u2014the only French team I hate is Arsenal. I don\u2019t go to a match unless I find someone also eager to go, which has been surprisingly difficult within my social circle. I\u2019m not sure that the team wants to attract fans other than those like me, however, and that\u2019s the fear here. Just because I don\u2019t breathe soul into PSG doesn\u2019t mean others shouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to do so under more egalitarian terms. \u21a9\nMignon elsewhere rightly points out that it is interesting that PSG has never had a sell-out season, suggesting that the project of big-time Parisian soccer is incomplete. Parc des Princes is small, considering the market it serves, but the tickets just don\u2019t move. If PSG win the league this year, though, next year may be a sell-out. I know I am considering season tickets just to have guaranteed spots for the Champions League. \u21a9\nMichel Platini repeats this sentiment when critiquing the proposed move to PSG, saying Beckham is not the player he once was and that the transfer is merely one to sell more shirts . \u21a9\n"}, {"score": 996.0232, "uuid": "985696a8-840f-52da-b09a-18b148d330aa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-16-11286", "target_hostname": "www.goaheadtours.com", "target_uri": "http://www.goaheadtours.com/tours/LPN/london-paris-amsterdam/guide-special-info.aspx", "page_rank": 1.2347519e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Special Information - <em>London</em>, <em>Paris</em> &amp; Amsterdam | Go Ahead Tours", "snippet": "Gaze at 17th- and 18th-century architecture as you stroll by tree-lined canals and soak in the history of this fascinating <em>city</em>, <em>which</em> in the mid-1900s grew to be the radical heart of Europe and remains the No. 1 destination for intellectuals, artists, historians and bohemians alike.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 988.64777, "uuid": "344a06b0-12ec-5106-9401-d85418fe8996", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-16-11281", "target_hostname": "www.goaheadtours.com", "target_uri": "http://www.goaheadtours.com/tours/LPN/london-paris-amsterdam/destination-Holidays.aspx", "page_rank": 1.2347519e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Holidays &amp; Festivals - <em>London</em>, <em>Paris</em> &amp; Amsterdam | Go Ahead Tours", "snippet": "Amsterdam <em>is</em> a <em>city</em> that hosts many arts and cultural festivals.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 995.4936, "uuid": "43e44f4b-8631-524f-b08c-3ff21bd085eb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1516wb-24-06522", "target_hostname": "thethirdestate.net", "target_uri": "http://thethirdestate.net/2010/02/why-secret-london-might-ruin-our-city/", "page_rank": 1.2538086e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Why Secret <em>London</em> might ruin our <em>city</em>", "snippet": "And if the same principle <em>is</em> applied across all <em>cities</em>, that they become a mere collection of places rather than spaces, we may lose the entire reason why <em>London</em> <em>is</em> <em>London</em>. * This <em>is</em> why liberals are losing the debate on immigration * Civilisation and Uncivilisation on <em>London</em> Transport.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted Under: London\n\u201cNot to find one\u2019s way around a city does not mean much. But to lose one\u2019s way in a city, as one loses one\u2019s way in a forest, requires some schooling. Street names must speak to the urban wanderer like the snapping of dry twigs, and little streets in the heart of the city must reflect the times of day, for him, as clearly as a mountain valley. This art I acquired rather late in life; it fulfilled a dream, of which the first traces were labyrinths on the blotting papers of my school notebooks.\u201d\n- Walter Benjamin, \u201cTiergarten\u201d, Berlin Childhood around 1900\nOver the last few weeks thousands upon thousands of people have been joining a facebook group called \u2018Secret London\u2019, and similar groups have been set up for other cities around the world. The point, apparently, is to tell absolutely everyone about those great places that aren\u2019t already filled with tourists. The result, I can only assume, will be for all of those lovely little places to quickly become overcrowded and not-so-lovely little places, but that is only the beginning.\nAlready we live in a city that is fractured, or rather shattered by transport. If a place doesn\u2019t have a tube station it barely exists in the consciousness of the average North Londoner. Where there\u2019s a tube that will take you somewhere, most people will never walk. London is split into confined areas set around specified destinations, and through this already begins to lack identity as a city.\nA few weeks ago, standing outside the Tate Britain, a couple of people asked me and a friend how to get to Liverpool street. We\u2019re both Londoners and gave the answer that the best way would be to \u201cgo up the river for a couple of miles, perhaps there\u2019s a bus that will take you along the Thames\u201d, but this way of thinking about London, the geographical connection of places, seems rarer and rarer. It is as a result of a lack of this kind of thinking that people even feel they need groups about how to find cool places to go.\nIt might seem that I am simply arguing for a quaint old-fashionedness in an approach to a city, fl\u00e2neurism even, but my point is more that the way that the city is split is of course not a result of the wills of the people who live in it. Maybe a better solution, instead of telling people where they can find a secret spot that is quite cool, would be to demand they challenge this edifice. To reclaim the city through a process of understanding that is so much challenged by the edifice of tube maps, transport systems, tourist information bureaux, city guides, etc. Without a doubt almost all of the secret places listed are random finds, so if we universalise this system of finding good places to go, we not only run the risk of losing our own secret places, but the entire way secret places may be found. And if the same principle is applied across all cities, that they become a mere collection of places rather than spaces, we may lose the entire reason why London is London.\nRelated Posts:\n"}, {"score": 988.41785, "uuid": "0e729d44-8fb6-57ab-b5de-288ac07ae151", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1615wb-72-18921", "target_hostname": "www.artec-usa.com", "target_uri": "http://www.artec-usa.com/05_news/newspaper/news_2009_02-orchestras-sound-better.html", "page_rank": 1.1795519e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Listen very carefully ... orchestras sound <em>better</em> outside <em>London</em>", "snippet": "It also has a large enough catchment area to support adventurous programming (<em>which</em> <em>is</em> increasingly less evident than it <em>is</em> in <em>cities</em> such as <em>Paris</em> and Berlin, although that&#x27;s another subject).", "explanation": null, "document": "February 2009 / News\nListen very carefully ... orchestras sound better outside London\nThe poor acoustics and cramped stages of many of the capital's venues are a nightmare for its resident musicians\nPhil Sommerich\nguardian.co.uk , Thursday 12 February 2009\nWith a sparkling new Royal Festival Hall and a buzzing Barbican, plus four resident symphony orchestras, London must be a world-class orchestral capital, no? In fact, many musicians will tell you that the capital does not rank inacoustic terms with many of our provincial cities. At least, they might tell you that over a pint in the backstage bar, but not in public. The trend in recent years for orchestras to be \"resident\" at nominatedconcert halls means the players are unlikely to tell paying punters that they are likely to hear the music better if they take a train to the Midlands, the north of England, Wales or Scotland.\nThere was a moment of blunt honesty recently during one of the excellent Discovery days the London Symphony Orchestra holds at the Barbican and its nearby base at St Luke's, on this occasion devoted to the Verdi Requiem. Four orchestra members had just performed Verdi's Quartet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a delicious minor piece well worth more frequent airing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and invited questions from theaudience. One of the first was: Are the acoustics of the Barbican, which was revamped a few years ago, as good now as at the relatively new concert halls in Birmingham and Manchester? The answer was a crisp and unanimous \"No\". The RFH has had very dry acoustics since its completion more than half a century ago, and the Barbican is little better. Such an ambience can cause discomfort for players cramped together on stage, and deny theaudience much of the colour and dynamic shading that is at the heart of the symphonic repertoire. Those acoustics did, though, seem to suit a fad in the 1960s and 70s for crisply defined sound.\nOn the Discovery day, a Radio 3 producer who hosted the Q&A session added a damning anecdote. The conductor Sir Colin Davis and the LSO were touring a programme from London to the Lahti concert hall in Finland, renowned for its acoustics , and then the legendary Musikverein in Vienna. The first item on the programme was Elgar's Enigma Variations, and when the double bassists played the low G early in the piece, there were looks of astonishment all round - they were hearing that note properly for the first time.\nOther musicians will tell you that music for choir and orchestra suffers particularly on the relatively cramped platforms of London venues.
