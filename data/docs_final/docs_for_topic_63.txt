The outdoor temperature was in the single digits, and the house temperature hovered in the 50s all day. The next day was warmer, but an ice storm soon followed. I made myself feel better by looking up the coldest places in the world.\nInternational Falls\nInternational Falls , Minnesota is known as the coldest spot in the lower 48 states. The town of almost 7,000 people has an average temperature of 36.4 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C). The average low for December, January, and February is below zero . The local Icebox Days festival features snowmobile racing, snow sculptures, bowling with frozen turkeys, and the \u201cFreeze Yer Gizzard Blizzard Run.\u201d Fraser, Colorado also claims the title of \u201cIcebox of the Nation\u201d. The two towns have disputed each other\u2019s claims for years. It\u2019s a matter for the courts even now .\nUmiat\nUmiat , Alaska is the coldest place in the United States, with an average temperature of 10.1\u00b0F. That beats Barrow easily. Considering that Umiat can reach the 70s in the summertime, you know the winters are bonechilling. However, the population hovers around five people with no permanent residents. You can follow weather conditions at Umiat Air Field online.\nBut those are warm, compared to other places on earth.\nSnag\nThis picture of Jim Brader shows what it\u2019s like to be a meteorologist in Alaska. The photo was taken as Brader was on his way to the Snag airstrip in Yukon, Canada. Snag was the site of the lowest temperature ever recorded in North America. On February 3rd, 1947, weathermen etched a notch in the thermometer, because the mercury was below the lowest indicator marks. When the thermometer was analyzed later, it was found that the temperature would\u2019ve read -81.4\u00b0F (-63\u00b0C). In temperatures that low, the voices of people could be heard four miles away. Frozen breath hangs in the air for up to 15 minutes, making it easy to find where someone has gone.\nNorthice Station\nThe coldest place in the western hemisphere is Greenland, although the country is historically claimed as part of Europe. The Northice Research Station in the middle of the Greenland Ice Sheet recorded a temperature of -87 \u00b0F (-66 \u00b0C) on January 9th, 1954. The researchers immediately packed up and went home to the coast. Just kidding! However, it must be too cold to take photographs, since I couldn\u2019t find any of Northice.\nYakutsk\nYakutsk , capital of the Yakutia region in Siberia claims to be the coldest city on earth. Considering it has a population of 200,000 people, that may be so. In January, daily high temperatures average around -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Residents often leave their cars running all day long to ensure they can get home. You are warned not to wear glasses outside, as they will freeze to your face and tear the flesh when you try to remove them. See more pictures and a video of Yakutsk here .\nVerkhoyansk\nVerkhoyansk, in the Yakutia region of Siberia, lies within the Arctic Circle, an eight-day drive from Yakutsk. But you can only drive there in the winter, when the lakes are frozen, because there are no land roads! 1,300 people live in Verkhoyansk, the biggest part of whom make their living herding reindeer and fur hunting. The area has abundant natural resources, including gold, but is too cold to develop profitable mining. The picture above was taken at the Pole of Cold in Verkhoyansk. Note the mammoth\u2019s tusks that mark the spot.\nTemperatures that have been recorded at the Verkhoyansk Weather Station have shown a record low of minus 72 degrees Celsius, and an average temperature for January being minus 49 degrees Celsius. Unfortunately, a nearby town by the name of Oimyakon is also trying to gain the title of Cold Pole, with an unofficial record low of minus 78 degrees Celsius. It is no wonder that this region has the nickname of \u201cStalin\u2019s Death Ring\u201d .\nWhen you think you are cold, check out the forecast for Verkhoyansk.\nOymyakon\nOymyakon , the other village that claims to be the coldest spot in the northern hemisphere, is also in the Yakutia region of Russia. In English, the name means \u201cOy, My Achin\u2019 Toes\u201d. Just kidding! In the Sakha language, it means \u201cnon-freezing water\u201d, because of the presence of a hot spring in the midst of the permafrost. On January 26, 1926, the temperature in Oymayakon was recorded as -96.2 \u00b0F (-71.2 \u00b0C). Some will argue with this figure because it was achieved through extrapolation instead of a direct thermometer measurement. Like Snag, Canada, Oymyakon lies in a bowl between mountains, which traps cold air. The temperature in winter is often lower than -50\u00b0F. It was -76\u00b0F just last week! See more pictures of Oymyakon here .\nVostok Station\nIn the southern hemisphere, there\u2019s no argument about the coldest place. The coldest temperature ever recorded on earth was at Vostok Station , a Russian research station in inland Antarctica. On July 21st, 1983, thermometers read -128.6 \u00b0F (-89.2 \u00b0C). The station is manned year-round. Russians are hardy people.\nLooking for smart gift ideas?

Up to 90 percent of the permafrost at the surface of the Northern Hemisphere could melt by the end of this century, leaving gaping holes in the ground and collapsed structures, roads and railways in northern regions.\nThe meltdown of northern soil is already underway. Other teams have noted sunken railways, damaged structures and increased numbers of rock-falls at high elevations owing to thawed boulders. Some 24 percent of land area in the Northern Hemisphere is underlain by perennially frozen ground. Scientists call this permafrost. Another 57 percent -- extending down into much of the United States and Europe -- freezes seasonally.\nBut these numbers are changing rapidly.\nSeasonally frozen areas in the Northern Hemisphere decreased by 15 to 20 percent during the 20th Century, said Tingjun Zhang of the University of Colorado at Boulder. \"In the last 20 years, the decrease is more dramatic,\" he said. In locations across the former Soviet Union, where long-running observations are starting to generate meaningful results, the warm-up has been documented as a 1-degree increase in the average temperature of soil 16 inches (40 centimeters) below the surface.\nAnd it is not just Earth that seems to be warming, the Solar System is: www.livescience.com/environm...ming.html\nnews.nationalgeographic.com/news....html <<<< Caused by the Sun.\nThere is a very interesting relationship between solar activity and temperature proxies via ice cores going back thousands of years. strata-sphere.com/blog/inde...hives/3434\nKhabibullo Abdusamatov, mathematician and astronomer at Pulkovskaya Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences: \"Global warming results not from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but from an unusually high level of solar radiation and a lengthy - almost throughout the last century - growth in its intensity...Ascribing 'greenhouse' effect properties to the Earth's atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated...Heated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion, ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away.\"\n________________________________________\nCOOLING:\nScientists announced in the July 21, 1999, edition of the journal Nature findings that suggest that global warming can sometimes lead to cold weather or even a worldwide freeze.\nScientists have long known that a severe cold spell occurred after the end of the Pleistocene glaciation, approximately 8,200 years ago. The cause, however, has been a mystery. The authors of the Nature article write that the centuries long cold spell might have been caused by meltwater from the disappearing glaciers, cooling the North Atlantic. www.dinosauria.com/jdp/news/freeze.html\nOne factor that causes a global cooling is \"Orbital Forcing (Milankovitch cycles): slow changes in the tilt of the planet's axis and shape of the orbit change the total amount of sunlight reaching the earth by a small amount and the seasonality of the sunshine by rather more. This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles, and understanding of it happened to be increasing rapidly in the mid-1970s.\nThe seminal paper of Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton \"Variations in the earths orbit: pacemaker of the ice ages\" qualified its predictions with \"forecasts must be qualified in two ways. First, they apply only to the natural component of future climatic trends - and not to anthropogenic effects such as those due to the burning of fossil fuels. Second, they describe only the long-term trends, because they are linked to orbital variations with periods of 20,000 years and longer. Climatic oscillations at higher frequencies are not predicted... the results indicate that the long-term trend over the next 20,000 years is towards extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooler climate\" .\nThe idea that ice ages cycles were predictable appears to have become conflated with the idea that another one was due \"soon\" - perhaps because much of this study was done by geologists, who use \"soon\" to refer to periods of centuries to tens of millennia or more. A strict application of the Milankovitch theory does not allow the prediction of a \"rapid\" ice age onset (rapid being anything under a century or two) since the fastest orbital period is about 20,000 years. Some creative ways around this were found, notably Nigel Calder's \"snowblitz\" theory, but these ideas did not gain wide acceptance.\nIn the science series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, physicist Carl Sagan warned of catastrophic cooling through the burning and clear cutting of forests. He postulated that the increased albedo of the earth's surface might lead to a new ice age.\nScientists, reporting their findings at the American Geophysical Conference in San Francisco, said vast urban firestorms ignited by war would send thick, dark clouds into the upper atmosphere, blocking the sun's rays and cooling much of the planet, with severe climatic and agricultural results. The soot might remain in the upper atmosphere for up to a decade.\n\"All hell would break loose,\" said Prof. Richard Turco of UCLA's department of atmospheric and ocean sciences.\nIn some places, the planet could cool more than it did during the so-called Little Ice Age of the 17th century, when glaciers advanced over much of northern Europe, said Alan Robock of Rutgers University, speaking Monday at a news conference at the Moscone Center, where the conference is being held this week.\nThe world apparently set a global cool weather record in 2007.\nAlthough what I am witnessing here in BC where I live, our area seems to be getting warmer and warmer with record high temperatures.\nSo what is happening?\nWe are SHIFTING.\nThe Hopi people have a Prophecy saying, \"Where it was hot will be cold and where it was cold will be hot.\" Also, \"Axis of earth will shift. Not sure when. Causes many Earth changes.\"\nI believe that is happening now.\n\"And the sun will rise in the west and set down in the east.\"\n\"\"On that day the sun will rise in the West, and all people seeing will believe\" (Moslem Prophecy)\nThe Prophet Muhammad gives a unique prophecy in the sense that he spoke of the earth reversing its axis and rotation (refer to Al-Bukhari 7121). The Hadith, tells us that the sun will certainly be made to rise in the west.\nNow how could this come about? The Sun setting in the West? The sun rises in east and sets in the west due to Earth's rotation. If we rotated the other way, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east.\nWith the Earth's magnetic field diminishing we can expect to see the directional effects of the Earth's resonator diminishing as well. This will affect the ratio of harmonics found in the Schumann resonance and that may be what is being measured.\nEARTH'S DIMINISHING MAGNETIC FEILD:\nWhile earth's \"pulse\" rate is rising, her magnetic field strength, on the other hand, is declining. According to Professor Bannerjee of the University of New Mexico, the field has lost up to half its intensity in the last 4,000 years. And because a forerunner of magnetic polar reversals is this field strength, Prof. Bannerjee believes that another reversal is due. Braden believes that because these cyclical Shifts are associated with reversals, Earth's geological record indicating magnetic reversals also marks previous Shifts in history. And, within the enormous time scale represented, there were quite a few of them.\nWhat is a Schumann Resonance?\nBelieve it or not, the Earth behaves like an enormous electric circuit. The atmosphere is actually a weak conductor and if there were no sources of charge, it's existing electric charge would diffuse away in about 10 minutes. There is a 'cavity' defined by the surface of the Earth and the inner edge of the ionosphere 55 kilometers up. At any moment, the total charge residing in this cavity is 500,000 Coulombs. There is a vertical current flow between the ground and the ionosphere of 1 - 3 x 10^-12 Amperes per square meter. The resistance of the atmosphere is 200 Ohms. The voltage potential is 200,000 Volts.\nGreg Bradens has a few points that support this shift:\n1. Time will appear to speed up as we approach Zero Point. A 24 hour day will seem to about 16 hours or less. Remember the Schumann Resonance (or \"heart beat\" of Mother Earth) has been 7.8 cycles for thousands of years, but has been rising since 1980. It is at about 12 cycles at present. It stops at 13 cycles.\n2. Zero Point or the Shift of the Ages has been predicted by ancient peoples for thousands of years. There have been many shifts including the one that always occurs every 13,000 years at each half of the 26,000 year, Procession of the Equinox.\n3. Zero Point or a flip of the magnetic poles will probably happen soon, within the next few years.\n4. It is said that after Zero Point the Sun will rise in the west and set in the east, approx.\n5. Most technology that we know will cease to operate. Possible exceptions could be technology based on so called \"Zero Point\" or free energy.\nIt should be noted here that \"Zero Point\" energy may or may not be the same thing as magnetic zero point that occurs during Earth's magnetic pole shift. During that time Earth's magnetic field collapses then re-establishes itself in a different direction. It does not just roll over. Technology is a word derived from tools. We will have different tools and therefore different technology.\nGregg scientifically proves that our planet frequency is increasing from 7.6 megahertz to 8.6 megahertz.

When the thermal changes have stopped, we say that the two objects (physicists define them more rigorously as systems) are in thermal equilibrium. We can then define the temperature of the system by saying that the temperature is that quantity which is the same for both systems when they are in thermal equilibrium.\nIf we experiment further with more than two systems, we find that many systems can be brought into thermal equilibrium with each other; thermal equilibrium does not depend on the kind of object used. Put more precisely, if two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they must also be in thermal equilibrium with each other, and they all have the same temperature regardless of the kind of systems they are. The statement in italics, called the zeroth law of thermodynamics may be restated as follows:\nIf three or more systems are in thermal contact with each other and all in equilibrium together, then any two taken separately are in equilibrium with one another.\nNow one of the three systems could be an instrument calibrated to measure the temperature - i.e. a thermometer. When a calibrated thermometer is put in thermal contact with a system and reaches thermal equilibrium, we then have a quantitative measure of the temperature of the system. For example, a mercury-in-glass clinical thermometer is put under the tongue of a patient and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in the patient's mouth - we then see by how much the silvery mercury has expanded in the stem and read the scale of the thermometer to find the patient's temperature.\nWhat is a Thermometer?\nA thermometer is an instrument that measures the temperature of a system in a quantitative way. The easiest way to do this is to find a substance having a property that changes in a regular way with its temperature. The most direct 'regular' way is a linear one: t(x) = ax + b\nWhere \"T\" is the temperature of the substance and changes as the property x of the substance changes. The constants a and b depend on the substance used and may be evaluated by specifying two temperature points on the scale, such as 32\u00b0 for the freezing point of water and 212\u00b0 for its boiling point.\nFor example, the element mercury is liquid in the temperature range of -38.9\u00b0 C to 356.7\u00b0 C (we'll discuss the Celsius \u00b0 C scale later). As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.\nThe mercury-in-glass thermometer illustrated in the above figure contains a bulb filled with mercury that is allowed to expand into a capillary. Its rate of expansion is calibrated on the glass scale.\nThe Development of Thermometers and Temperature Scales\nThe historical highlights in the development of thermometers and their scales given here are based on \"Temperature\" by T. J. Quinn and \"Heat\" by James M. Cork. One of the first attempts to make a standard temperature scale occurred about AD 170, when Galen, in his medical writings, proposed a standard \"neutral\" temperature made up of equal quantities of boiling water and ice; on either side of this temperature were four degrees of heat and four degrees of cold, respectively.\nThe earliest devices used to measure the temperature were called Thermoscopes.\nThey consisted of a glass bulb having a long tube extending downward into a container of colored water, although Galileo in 1610 is supposed to have used wine. Some of the air in the bulb was expelled before placing it in the liquid, causing the liquid to rise into the tube. As the remaining air in the bulb was heated or cooled, the level of the liquid in the tube would vary reflecting the change in the air temperature. An engraved scale on the tube allowed for a quantitative measure of the fluctuations. The air in the bulb is referred to as the thermometric medium, i.e. the medium whose property changes with temperature. In 1641, the first sealed thermometer that used liquid rather than air as the thermometric medium was developed for Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His thermometer used a sealed alcohol-in-glass device, with 50 \"degree\" marks on its stem but no \"fixed point\" was used to zero the scale. These were referred to as \"spirit\" thermometers. Robert Hook, Curator of the Royal Society, in 1664 used a red dye in the alcohol . His scale, for which every degree represented an equal increment of volume equivalent to about 1/500 part of the volume of the thermometer liquid, needed only one fixed point. He selected the freezing point of water. By scaling it in this way, Hook showed that a standard scale could be established for thermometers of a variety of sizes. Hook's original thermometer became known as the standard of Gresham College and was used by the Royal Society until 1709.\nIn 1702, the astronomer Ole Roemer of Copenhagen based his scale upon two fixed points: snow (or crushed ice) and the boiling point of water, and he recorded the daily temperatures at Copenhagen in 1708- 1709 with this thermometer. It was in 1724 that Gabriel Fahrenheit, an instrument maker of D\u00e4anzig and Amsterdam, used mercury as the thermometric liquid. Mercury's thermal expansion is large and fairly uniform, it does not adhere to the glass, and it remains a liquid over a wide range of temperatures. Its silvery appearance makes it easy to read.\nFahrenheit described how he calibrated the scale of his mercury Thermometer:\n\"placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy man.\" (D. G. Fahrenheit,Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)\nOn this scale, Fahrenheit measured the boiling point of water to be 212. Later he adjusted the freezing point of water to 32 so that the interval between the boiling and freezing points of water could be represented by the more rational number 180. Temperatures measured on this scale are designated as degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F). In 1745, Carolus Linnaeus of Upsula, Sweden, described a scale in which the freezing point of water was zero, and the boiling point 100, making it a centigrade (one hundred steps) scale. Anders Celsius (1701-1744) used the reverse scale in which 100 represented the freezing point and zero the boiling point of water, still, of course, with 100 degrees between the two defining points.\nIn 1948 use of the Centigrade scale was dropped in favor of a new scale using degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). The Celsius scale is defined by the following two items that will be discussed later in this essay:\n(1) The triple point of water is defined to be 0.01\u00b0C\n(2) A degree Celsius equals the same temperature change as a degree on the ideal-gas scale.\nOn the Celsius scale the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 99.975\u00b0C in contrast to the 100 degrees defined by the Centigrade scale.\nTo convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32. (\u00b0F = 1.8\u00b0C + 32 )\nIn 1780, J. A. C. Charles, a French physician, showed that for the same increase in temperature, all gases exhibited the same increase in volume. Because the expansion coefficient of gases is so very nearly the same, it is possible to establish a temperature scale based on a single fixed point rather than the two fixed- point scales, such as the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. This brings us back to a thermometer that uses a gas as the thermometric medium.\nIn a constant volume gas thermometer a large bulb B of gas, hydrogen for example, under a set pressure connects with a mercury-filled \"manometer\" by means of a tube of very small volume. (The Bulb B is the temperature-sensing portion and should contain almost all of the hydrogen). The level of mercury at C may be adjusted by raising or lowering the mercury reservoir R. The pressure of the hydrogen gas, which is the \"x\" variable in the linear relation with temperature, is the difference between the levels D and C plus the pressure above D.\nP. Chappuis in 1887, conducted extensive studies of gas thermometers with constant pressure or with constant volume using hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide as the thermometric medium. Based on his results, the Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures adopted the constant-volume hydrogen scale based on fixed points at the ice point (0\u00b0C) and the steam point (100\u00b0C) as the practical scale for international meteorology. Experiments with gas thermometers have shown that there is very little difference in the temperature scale for different gases. Thus, it is possible to set up a temperature scale that is independent of the thermometric medium if it is a gas at low pressure. In this case, all gases behave like an \"Ideal Gas\" and have a very simple relation between their pressure, volume, and temperature pV= (constant)T.\nThis temperature is called the thermodynamic temperature and is now accepted as the fundamental measure of temperature. Note that there is a naturally-defined zero on this scale - it is the point at which the pressure of an ideal gas is zero, making the temperature also zero. We will continue a discussion of \"absolute zero\" in a later section. With this as one point on the scale, only one other fixed point need be defined. In 1933, the International Committee of Weights and Measures adopted this fixed point as the triple point of water, the temperature at which water, ice, and water vapor coexist in equilibrium); its value is set as 273.16. The unit of temperature on this scale is called the kelvin, after Lord Kelvin (William Thompson), 1824-1907, and its symbol is K (no degree symbol used). To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, add 273. Formula+ K = \u00b0C + 273. Thermodynamic temperature is the fundamental temperature; its unit is the kelvin which is defined as the fraction 1 / 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\nSir William Siemens, in 1871, proposed a thermometer whose thermometric medium is a metallic conductor whose resistance changes with temperature. The element platinum does not oxidize at high temperatures and has a relatively uniform change in resistance with temperature over a large range. The Platinum Resistance Thermometer is now widely used as a thermoelectric thermometer and covers the temperature range from about -260\u00b0C to 1235\u00b0C.Several temperatures were adopted as Primary reference points so as to define the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968. The International Temperature Scale of 1990 was adopted by the International Committee of Weights and Measures at its meeting in 1989. Between 0.65K and 5.0K, the temperature is defined in terms of the vapor pressure - temperature relations of the isotopes of helium. Between 3.0K and the triple point of neon (24.5561K) the temperature is defined by means of a helium gas thermometer. Between the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033K) and the freezing point of silver (961.78\u00b0\u00b0C) the temperature is defined by means of platinum resistance thermometers. Above the freezing point of silver the temperature is defined in terms of the Planck radiation law.\nT. J. Seebeck, in 1826, discovered that when wires of different metals are fused at one end and heated, a current flows from one to the other. The electromotive force generated can be quantitatively related to the temperature and hence, the system can be used as a thermometer - known as a thermocouple. The thermocouple is used in industry and many different metals are used - platinum and platinum/rhodium, nickel-chromium and nickel-aluminum, for example. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains databases for standardizing thermometers. For the measurement of very low temperatures, the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic substance is used as the thermometric physical quantity. For some substances, the magnetic susceptibility varies inversely as the temperature. Crystals such as cerrous magnesium nitrate and chromic potassium alum have been used to measure temperatures down to 0.05 K; these crystals are calibrated in the liquid helium range.\nThis diagram and the last illustration in this text were taken from the Low Temperature Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology's picture archive. For these very low, and even lower, temperatures, the thermometer is also the mechanism for cooling. Several low-temperature laboratories conduct interesting applied and theoretical research on how to reach the lowest possible temperatures and how work at these temperatures may find application.\nHeat and Thermodynamics\nPrior to the 19th century, it was believed that the sense of how hot or cold an object felt was determined by how much \"heat\" it contained. Heat was envisioned as a liquid that flowed from a hotter to a colder object; this weightless fluid was called \"caloric\", and until the writings of Joseph Black (1728-1799), no distinction was made between heat and temperature. Black distinguished between the quantity (caloric) and the intensity (temperature) of heat.\nSource of Heat which is Excited by Friction\". Rumford had noticed the large amount of heat generated when a cannon was drilled. He doubted that a material substance was flowing into the cannon and concluded \"it appears to me to be extremely difficult if not impossible to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited and communicated in the manner the heat was excited and communicated in these experiments except motion.\"\nBut it was not until J. P. Joule published a definitive paper in 1847 that the the caloric idea was abandoned. Joule conclusively showed that heat was a form of energy. As a result of the experiments of Rumford, Joule, and others, it was demonstrated (explicitly stated by Helmholtz in 1847), that the various forms of energy can be transformed one into another. When heat is transformed into any other form of energy, or when other forms of energy are transformed into heat, the total amount of energy (heat plus other forms) in the system is constant.\nThis is the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy. To express it another way: it is in no way possible either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other means, to obtain a perpetual motion machine; i.e., one that creates its own energy (except in the fantasy world of Maurits Escher's \"Waterfall\"!) A second statement may also be made about how machines operate. A steam engine uses a source of heat to produce work. Is it possible to completely convert the heat energy into work, making it a 100% efficient machine? The answer is to be found in the second law of thermodynamics: No cyclic machine can convert heat energy wholly into other forms of energy. It is not possible to construct a cyclic machine that does nothing but withdraw heat energy and convert it into mechanical energy.\nThe second law of thermodynamics implies the irreversibility of certain processes - that of converting all heat into mechanical energy, although it is possible to have a cyclic machine that does nothing but convert mechanical energy into heat!\nSadi Carnot (1796-1832) conducted theoretical studies of the efficiencies of heat engines (a machine which converts some of its heat into useful work). He was trying to model the most efficient heat engine possible. His theoretical work provided the basis for practical improvements in the steam engine and also laid the foundations of thermodynamics. He described an ideal engine, called the Carnot engine, that is the most efficient way an engine can be constructed. He showed that the efficiency of such an engine is given by efficiency = 1 - T\"/T'.\nWhere the temperatures, T' and T\" , are the hot and cold \"reservoirs\" , respectively, between which the machine operates. On this temperature scale, a heat engine whose coldest reservoir is zero degrees would operate with 100% efficiency. This is one definition of absolute zero, and it can be shown to be identical to the absolute zero we discussed previously. The temperature scale is called the absolute, the thermodynamic , or the kelvin scale.\nThe way that the gas temperature scale and the thermodynamic temperature scale are shown to be identical is based on the microscopic interpretation of temperature, which postulates that the macroscopic measurable quantity called temperature is a result of the random motions of the microscopic particles that make up a system.\nThe Kinetic Theory-\nThis brief summary is abridged from a more detailed discussion to be found in Quinn's \"Temperature\"...\nAbout the same time that thermodynamics was evolving James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) and Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906) developed a theory describing the way molecules moved - molecular dynamics. The molecules that make up a perfect gas move about, colliding with each other like billiard balls and bouncing off the surface of the container holding the gas. The energy associated with motion is called Kinetic Energy and this kinetic approach to the behavior of ideal gases led to an interpretation of the concept of temperature on a microscopic scale. The amount of kinetic energy each molecule has is a function of its velocity; for the large number of molecules in a gas (even at low pressure), there should be a range of velocities at any instant of time. The magnitude of the velocities of the various particles should vary greatly - no two particles should be expected to have the exact same velocity. Some may be moving very fast; others, quite slowly.\nMaxwell found that he could represent the distribution of velocities statistically by a function known as the Maxwellian Distribution. The collisions of the molecules with their container gives rise to the pressure of the gas. By considering the average force exerted by the molecular collisions on the wall, Boltzmann was able to show that the average kinetic energy of the molecules was directly comparable to the measured pressure, and the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the pressure. From Boyles' Law, we know that the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature, therefore, it was shown that the kinetic energy of the molecules related directly to the temperature of the gas. A simple relation holds for this: average kinetic energy of molecules=3kT/2,\nwhere k is the Boltzmann Constant. Temperature is a measure of the energy of thermal motion and, at a temperature of zero, the energy reaches a minimum (quantum mechanically, the zero-point motion remains at 0 K).\nIn July, 1995, physicists in Boulder, Colo.achieved a temperature far lower than has ever been produced before and created an entirely new state of matter predicted decades ago by Albert Einsteinand Satyendra Nath Bose. The press release describes the nature of this experiment and a full description of this phenomenon is described by the University of Colorado's BEC Homepage.\nDealing with a system which contained huge numbers of molecules requires a statistical approach to the problem. About 1902, J. W. Gibbs (1839-1903) introduced statistical mechanics with which he demonstrated how average values of the properties of a system could be predicted from an analysis of the most probable values of these properties found from a large number of identical systems (called an ensemble). Again, in the statistical mechanical interpretation of thermodynamics, the key parameter is identified with a temperature which can be directly linked to the thermodynamic temperature, with the temperature of Maxwell's distribution,and with the perfect gas law.\nTemperature becomes a quantity definable either in terms of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work, or, with equal validity and identical results, in terms of a quantity which characterized the energy distribution among the particles in a system.With this understanding of the concept of temperature, it is possible to explain how heat (thermal energy) flows from one body to another. Thermal energy is carried by the molecules in the form of their motions and some of it, through molecular collisions, is transferred to molecules of a second object when put in contact with it. This mechanism for transferring thermal energy by contact is called conduction.\nA second mechanism of heat transport is illustrated by a pot of water set to boil on a stove - hotter water closest to the flame will rise to mix with cooler water near the top of the pot. Convection involves the bodily movement of the more energetic molecules in a liquid or gas. The third way that heat energy can be transferred from one body to another is by radiation; this is the way that the sun warms the earth. The radiation flows from the sun to the earth, where some of it is absorbed, heating the surface.\nA major dilemma in physics since the time of Newton was how to explain the nature of this radiation.\nThermal Radiation-\nThe nature of radiation has puzzled scientists for centuries. Maxwell proposed that this form of energy travels as a vibratory electric and magnetic disturbance through space in a direction perpendicular to those disturbances.\nIn the diagram, the electric (red) and magnetic (blue) oscillations are orthogonal to each other - the electric lying in the xy plane; the magnetic, in the xz plane. The wave is traveling in the x direction. An electromagnetic wave can be defined in terms of the frequency of its oscillation, designated by the Greek letter nu (v). The wave moves in a straight line with with a constant speed (designated as c if it is moving through a vacuum); the distance between successive 'peaks' of the wave is the wavelength, ,of the wave and is equal to its speed divided by its frequency. The electromagnetic spectrum covers an enormous range in wavelengths, from very short waves to very long ones.\nThe only region of the electromagnetic spectrum to which our eye is sensitive is the \"visible\" range identified in the diagram by the rainbow colors.\nThe sun is not the only object that provides radiant energy; any object whose temperature is greater than 0 K will emit some radiant energy.The challenge to scientists was to show how this radiant energy is related to the temperature of the object.\nIf an object is placed in a container whose walls are at a uniform temperature, we expect the object to come into thermal equilibrium with the walls of the enclosure and the object should emit radiant energy just like the walls of the container. Such an object absorbs and radiates the same amount of energy. Now a blackened surface absorbs all radiation incident upon it and it must radiate in the same manner if it is in thermal equilibrium. Equilibrium thermal radiation is therefore called black body radiation.\nThe first relation between temperature and radiant energy was deduced by J. Stefan in 1884 and theoretically explained by Boltzmann about the same time. It states: where the total energy is per unit area per second emitted by the back body, T is its absolute (thermodynamic) temperature and is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe great question at the turn of the century was to explain the way this total radiant energy emitted by a black body was spread out into the various frequencies or wavelengths of the radiation. Maxwell's \"classical\" theory of electromagnetic oscillators failed to explain the observed brightness distribution. It was left to Max Planck to solve the dilemma by showing that the energy of the oscillators must be quantized, i.e. the energies can not take any value but must change in steps, the size of each step, or quantum, is proportional to the frequency of the oscillator and equal to hv, where h is the Planck constant. With this assumption, Planck derived the brightness distribution of a black body and showed that it is defined by its temperature. Once the temperature of a black body is specified, the Planck law can be used to calculate the intensity of the light emitted by the body as a function of wavelength. Conversely, if the brightness distribution of a radiating body is measured, then, by fitting a Planck curve to it, its temperature can be determined.\nThe curves illustrated below show that the hotter the body is, the brighter it is at shorter wavelengths. The surface temperature of the sun is 6000\u00b0K, and its Planck curve peaks in the visible wavelength range. For bodies cooler than the sun, the peak of the Planck curve shifts to longer wavelengths, until a temperature is reached such that very little radiant energy is emitted in the visible range.\nThis figure (adapted from Adkins' \"Thermal Physics\") shows several Planck curves for black bodies. The Intensity is in units of energy per unit area per unit solid angle per unit time per unit wavelength interval. The broken line illustrates the variation with wavelength and temperature of the peaks of the curves.\nThis is a graphical representation of Wien's law, which states: (max) ~ 0.29/T,\nWhere (max) is the wavelength of maximum brightness in cm and T is the absolute temperature of the black body. The human body has a temperature of about 310\u00b0K and radiates primarily in the far infrared. If a photograph of a human is taken with a camera sensitive to this wavelength region, we get a \"thermal\" picture. This picture is courtesy of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA. A page developed by Compix gives a fine description of thermal images and their uses.\nJohn E. Will has pointed to several thermal images obtained during research in antenna pattern measurements, as another example of the use of thermal images.\n3 K - The Temperature of the Universe\nThe sun and stars emit thermal radiation covering all wavelengths; other objects in the sky, like the great clouds of gas in the Milky Way, also emit thermal radiation but are much cooler. These objects are best detected by infrared and radio telescopes - telescopes whose detectors are sensitive to the longer wavelengths.\nIn 1965,Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were conducting a careful calibration of their radio telescope at the Bell Laboratory at Whippany, New Jersey. The found that their receiver showed a \"noise\" pattern as if it were inside a container whose temperature was 3K - i.e. as if it were in equilibrium with a black body at 3 K. This \"noise\" seemed to be coming from every direction. Earlier theoretical predictions by George Gamow and other astrophysicists had predicted the existence of a cosmic 3 K background. Penzias' and Wilson's discovery was the observational confirmation of the isotropic radiation from the Universe, believed to be a relic of the \"Big Bang\". The enormous thermal energy released during the creation of the universe began to cool as the universe expanded. Some 12 billion years later, we are in a universe that radiates like a black body now cooled to 3 K. In 1978 Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for this discovery.\nA black body at 3 K emits most of its energy in the microwave wavelength range. Molecules in the earth's atmosphere absorb this radiation so that from the ground, astronomers cannot make observations in this wavelength region. In 1989 the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, was launched to measure the diffuse infrared and microwave radiation from the early universe. One of its instruments, the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) compared the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation with a precise blackbody.\nThe cosmic microwave background spectrum was measured with a precision of 0.03% and it fit precisely with a black body of temperature 2.726 K. Even though there are billions of stars in the universe, these precise COBE measurements show that 99.97% of the radiant energy of the Universe was released within the first year after the Big Bang itself and now resides in this thermal 3 K radiation field.\nA more detailed explanation of the origin of the microwave background radiation, and itspossible anisotropy, may be found here. A new mission selected by NASA is the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) will measure the small fluctuations in the background radiation and will yield more information on the details of the early universe. The European Space Agency has a similar mission planned.\nSummary\nThe concept of temperature is as fundamental a physical concept as the three fundamental quantities of mechanics - mass, length, and time. Through the study of such practical problems as how to make a highly efficient steam engine, fundamental physical theories emerge, including the concepts of the quantum theory and the two laws of thermodynamics. The second law, with its irreversibility requirement, predicts an inevitable evolution from other forms of energy into heat. It is the second law alone that provides an \"arrow\" for the concept of time.\nWe can record events (illustration from Low Temperature Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology)that cover 18 orders of magnitude in the temperature range, and we have one clearly defined lower limit to the temperature, absolute zero. Because of this 10-with-18-zeros-behind-it range in temperatures, there are many different kinds of thermometers developed to explore it and many different fields of research.\nOne of the beauties of \"publishing\" on the web is the interactive element it offers. Joachim Reinhardt has written to point out that the highest temperatures that are accessible on earth (only surpassed by the early stages of the big bang) occur in high-energy collisions of particles (in particular of heavy ions), during which one sees a \"fireball\" with a temperature of several hundred MeV (which corresponds to a temperature of 10 to the 12th power k). This fireball cools down by expanding and by radiating off particles, mostly pions, quite similar to the thermal black-body radiation. For more information on these phenomena, see the Fermi Lab tutorial.\n"}, {"score": 1148.6549, "uuid": "e95d1495-753b-586d-86d9-04f5677f678d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0806wb-78-09418", "target_hostname": "indianapublicmedia.org", "target_uri": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/the-coldest-spot-in-the-world/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Coldest</em> Spot in <em>the</em> World | A Moment of Science - Indiana Public Media", "snippet": "We said Antarctica\u2013in particular, <em>the</em> Russian station Vostok, at which a record- setting low <em>temperature</em> of one hundred <em>and</em> twenty-eight point six below zero Fahrenheit was <em>recorded</em> in 1983.

J. Quinn and \"Heat\" by James M. Cork.\nOne of the first attempts to make a standard temperature scale occurred about AD 170, when Galen , in his medical writings, proposed a standard \"neutral\" temperature made up of equal quantities of boiling water and ice; on either side of this temperature were four degrees of heat and four degrees of cold, respectively.\nThe earliest devices used to measure the temperature were called thermoscopes.\nThey consisted of a glass bulb having a long tube extending downward into a container of colored water, although Galileo in 1610 is supposed to have used wine. Some of the air in the bulb was expelled before placing it in the liquid, causing the liquid to rise into the tube. As the remaining air in the bulb was heated or cooled, the level of the liquid in the tube would vary reflecting the change in the air temperature. An engraved scale on the tube allowed for a quantitative measure of the fluctuations.\nThe air in the bulb is referred to as the thermometric medium, i.e. the medium whose property changes with temperature.\nIn 1641, the first sealed thermometer that used liquid rather than air as the thermometric medium was developed for Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His thermometer used a sealed alcohol-in-glass device, with 50 \"degree\" marks on its stem but no \"fixed point\" was used to zero the scale. These were referred to as \"spirit\" thermometers.\nRobert Hook, Curator of the Royal Society, in 1664 used a red dye in the alcohol . His scale, for which every degree represented an equal increment of volume equivalent to about 1/500 part of the volume of the thermometer liquid, needed only one fixed point. He selected the freezing point of water. By scaling it in this way, Hook showed that a standard scale could be established for thermometers of a variety of sizes. Hook's original thermometer became known as the standard of Gresham College and was used by the Royal Society until 1709. (The first intelligible meteorological records used this scale).\nIn 1702, the astronomer Ole Roemer of Copenhagen based his scale upon two fixed points: snow (or crushed ice) and the boiling point of water, and he recorded the daily temperatures at Copenhagen in 1708- 1709 with this thermometer.\nIt was in 1724 that Gabriel Fahrenheit, an instrument maker of D\u00e4anzig and Amsterdam, used mercury as the thermometric liquid. Mercury's thermal expansion is large and fairly uniform, it does not adhere to the glass, and it remains a liquid over a wide range of temperatures. Its silvery appearance makes it easy to read.\nFahrenheit described how he calibrated the scale of his mercury thermometer:\n\"placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy man.\" (D. G. Fahrenheit, Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)\nOn this scale, Fahrenheit measured the boiling point of water to be 212. Later he adjusted the freezing point of water to 32 so that the interval between the boiling and freezing points of water could be represented by the more rational number 180. Temperatures measured on this scale are designated as degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0 F).\nIn 1745, Carolus Linnaeus of Upsula, Sweden, described a scale in which the freezing point of water was zero, and the boiling point 100, making it a centigrade (one hundred steps) scale. Anders Celsius (1701-1744) used the reverse scale in which 100 represented the freezing point and zero the boiling point of water, still, of course, with 100 degrees between the two defining points.\nIn 1948 use of the Centigrade scale was dropped in favor of a new scale using degrees Celsius (\u00b0 C). The Celsius scale is defined by the following two items that will be discussed later in this essay:\n(i) The triple point of water is defined to be 0.01\u00b0 C.\n(ii) A degree Celsius equals the same temperature change as a degree on the ideal-gas scale.\nOn the Celsius scale the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 99.975 C in contrast to the 100 degrees defined by the Centigrade scale.\nTo convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32.\n\u00b0 F = 1.8\u00b0 C + 32\n\u00b0 K = \u00b0 C + 273.\n(Or, you can get someone else to do it for you!)\nIn 1780, J. A. C. Charles, a French physician, showed that for the same increase in temperature, all gases exhibited the same increase in volume. Because the expansion coefficient of gases is so very nearly the same, it is possible to establish a temperature scale based on a single fixed point rather than the two fixed- point scales, such as the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. This brings us back to a thermometer that uses a gas as the thermometric medium.\nIn a constant volume gas thermometer a large bulb B of gas, hydrogen for example, under a set pressure connects with a mercury-filled \"manometer\" by means of a tube of very small volume. (The Bulb B is the temperature-sensing portion and should contain almost all of the hydrogen). The level of mercury at C may be adjusted by raising or lowering the mercury reservoir R. The pressure of the hydrogen gas, which is the \"x\" variable in the linear relation with temperature, is the difference between the levels D and C plus the pressure above D.\nP. Chappuis in 1887 conducted extensive studies of gas thermometers with constant pressure or with constant volume using hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide as the thermometric medium. Based on his results, the Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures adopted the constant-volume hydrogen scale based on fixed points at the ice point (0\u00b0 C) and the steam point (100\u00b0 C) as the practical scale for international meteorology.\nExperiments with gas thermometers have shown that there is very little difference in the temperature scale for different gases. Thus, it is possible to set up a temperature scale that is independent of the thermometric medium if it is a gas at low pressure. In this case, all gases behave like an \"Ideal Gas\" and have a very simple relation between their pressure, volume, and temperature:\npV= (constant)T.\nThis temperature is called the thermodynamic temperature and is now accepted as the fundamental measure of temperature. Note that there is a naturally-defined zero on this scale - it is the point at which the pressure of an ideal gas is zero, making the temperature also zero. We will continue a discussion of \"absolute zero\" in a later section. With this as one point on the scale, only one other fixed point need be defined. In 1933, the International Committee of Weights and Measures adopted this fixed point as the triple point of water , the temperature at which water, ice, and water vapor coexist in equilibrium); its value is set as 273.16. The unit of temperature on this scale is called the kelvin, after Lord Kelvin (William Thompson) , 1824-1907, and its symbol is K (no degree symbol used).\nTo convert from Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.\nK = \u00b0 C + 273.\nThermodynamic temperature is the fundamental temperature; its unit is the kelvin which is defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\nSir William Siemens, in 1871, proposed a thermometer whose thermometric medium is a metallic conductor whose resistance changes with temperature. The element platinum does not oxidize at high temperatures and has a relatively uniform change in resistance with temperature over a large range. The Platinum Resistance Thermometer is now widely used as a thermoelectric thermometer and covers the temperature range from about -260\u00b0 C to 1235\u00b0 C.\nSeveral temperatures were adopted as Primary reference points so as to define the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968. The International Temperature Scale of 1990 was adopted by the International Committee of Weights and Measures at its meeting in 1989. Between 0.65K and 5.0K, the temperature is defined in terms of the vapor pressure - temperature relations of the isotopes of helium. Between 3.0K and the triple point of neon (24.5561K) the temperature is defined by means of a helium gas thermometer. Between the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033K) and the freezing point of silver (961.78\u00b0K) the temperature is defined by means of platinum resistance thermometers. Above the freezing point of silver the temperature is defined in terms of the Planck radiation law.\nT. J. Seebeck, in 1826, discovered that when wires of different metals are fused at one end and heated, a current flows from one to the other. The electromotive force generated can be quantitatively related to the temperature and hence, the system can be used as a thermometer - known as a thermocouple. The thermocouple is used in industry and many different metals are used - platinum and platinum/rhodium, nickel-chromium and nickel-aluminum, for example. The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) maintains databases for standardizing thermometers.\nFor the measurement of very low temperatures, the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic substance is used as the thermometric physical quantity. For some substances, the magnetic susceptibility varies inversely as the temperature. Crystals such as cerrous magnesium nitrate and chromic potassium alum have been used to measure temperatures down to 0.05 K; these crystals are calibrated in the liquid helium range. This diagram and the last illustration in this text were taken from the Low Temperature Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology's picture archive . For these very low, and even lower, temperatures, the thermometer is also the mechanism for cooling. Several low-temperature laboratories conduct interesting applied and theoretical research on how to reach the lowest possible temperatures and how work at these temperatures may find application.\n"}, {"score": 1100.5187, "uuid": "c5ab37da-59dc-5940-8692-7af5e6bf995d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1809wb-07-10387", "target_hostname": "www.middleburgbank.com", "target_uri": "https://www.middleburgbank.com/resources/enewsletter/the-greatest-snow-on-earth/", "page_rank": 1.2382902e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>The</em> Greatest Snow <em>on</em> <em>Earth</em>?", "snippet": "<em>What</em> makes Oymyakon truly amazing <em>is</em> that even as <em>the</em> record holder for <em>the</em> <em>coldest</em> regularly inhabited locale <em>on</em> <em>Earth</em>, it&#x27;s still only about three-quarters as cold as <em>the</em> <em>coldest</em> <em>temperature</em> <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> <em>on</em> land.", "explanation": null, "document": "Share |\nA look at some of the world's coldest places\nWinter is upon us and the thaw is still months off, yet many of us are already dreaming of warmer weather, lighter clothes and daylight hours that last beyond the workday. No matter how cold or blustery your winter has been, just remember it could always be worse. Comfort yourself by having a look at some of the world's coldest locations, and your own winter experience might end up seeming downright balmy.\nThe seasons are swapped in the Southern Hemisphere, making January an ideal time to check out South America, but unless you like losing feeling in your fingers, you'll want to avoid Argentina's Patagonia region during the winter months of June, July and August. The continent's coldest temperature was recorded at more than 20 degrees below zero in Sarmiento, a village tucked into a small fertile valley, and temperatures in the unpopulated areas of petrified forest likely drop even lower--and stay there for quite some time.\nThat doesn't even come close to the coldest place in North America, however, at minus 87 degrees Fahrenheit. This claim to fame belongs to the northern reaches of Greenland where there are no stable populations and where only researchers and adventurers dare tread. A few nights in a snow cave here would make an uninsulated Minnesota barn seem an attractive alternative.\nThen there's Russia where the snowflakes are big enough to catch you and the temperatures are just ridiculously low. Oymyakon, a small village in Siberia, has the not-so-coveted honor of experiencing the lowest recorded land temperature in a regularly populated area, and in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. In February of 1933, the temperature dropped to minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit; average temperatures for the winter months, which last more than half the year at this latitude, are regularly below minus 50 degrees F. Shoveling the driveway doesn't seem so bad when you reflect that the task at least has a foreseeable end.\nWhat makes Oymyakon truly amazing is that even as the record holder for the coldest regularly inhabited locale on Earth, it's still only about three-quarters as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on land. Researchers at the Vostok Station in Antarctica recorded a temperature of minus 128.6 degrees F on July 21, 1983, and this record is still going strong almost 30 years later. There usually are some residents at this station through the winter, though without bringing in sufficient supplies, the area would be completely uninhabitable by humans.\nYou can still get colder within the confines of Earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull, but you can't keep your feet on the ground. If you head straight up for about 80 miles, you'll come to the top of the mesosphere where temperatures stay at around minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit year-round and can dip as low as minus 140. The lack of oxygen up there creates other survival difficulties, but the cold alone is enough reason to discourage a trip to the upper atmosphere anytime soon. Instead, just be happy you're relaxing in a country where the average winter temperatures are actually above zero - practically swimsuit weather!\n"}], [{"score": 1089.817, "uuid": "8a15cf13-8445-54b2-94ed-49836d107d61", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-69-19191", "target_hostname": "www.global-greenhouse-warming.com", "target_uri": "http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/global-temperature.html", "page_rank": 6.353817e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Global <em>Temperature</em>", "snippet": "Heat waves were also registered in Brazil from January until March 2006 (e.g. 44.6\u00b0C&#x2F;112.3\u00b0F in Bom Jesus <em>on</em> 31 January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of <em>the</em> highest <em>temperatures</em> <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> in Brazil).

Instead, individual thermometer measurements taken every day at several thousand stations over the land areas of the world are combined with thousands more measurements of sea surface temperature taken from ships moving over the oceans to produce an estimate of global average temperature every month (see the sections on how climate is measured ).\nFrom these records, the ten warmest years in the instrumental record of global temperature (since around 1880) all occur within the 12 year period 1997-2008. Although 2008 data below show it was the coolest since 2000 due to the moderate to strong La Ni\u00f1a that developed in the latter half of 2007. However, the total global temperature increase from the 1850s throught to 2005 is 0.76\u00b0C (1.36\u00b0F) and the rate of warming averaged over the last 50 years is nearly twice that for the last 100 years. So don't be lulled by one year where it is relatively cooler, what we need to look at is decadal or long term trends.\nAn increasing rate of warming has taken place over the last 25 years. Above the surface, global observations since the late 1950s show that the troposphere (up to about 10 km) has warmed at a slightly greater rate than the surface, while the stratosphere (about 10\u00e2\u0080\u009330 km) has cooled markedly since 1979. This is in accord with physical expectations and most model results.\nConfirmation of a global temperature rise comes from the observed temperature increases in the oceans, observations of sea level rise, glacial melt, sea ice retreat in the Arctic and diminished snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. Global average temperature is forecast to rise 4\u00b0C (7.2\u00b0F) toward the end of the 21st century, and this is a mere 90 years away! Even if began today, and stopped most of our greenhouse gas emissions overnight, we would still see a temperature rise of around 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) by 2090-2100. David Spratt and Philip Sutton explain in their paper Code Red what will happen with three degrees of warming, and how dangerous this is.\nThis rapid rise in temperature is unmatched in the last million years, and even then, the data indicate that the global warming at the end of an ice age was a gradual process taking about 5,000 years. Our human ( anthropogenic ) actions have ramped up the rate of change not evidenced in any record, and we are leaving ourselves very little time to adapt.\nFigure Above: Annual average global temperature (black dots) along with simple fits to the data. The left hand axis shows global temperature anomalies relative to the 1961 to 1990 average and the right hand axis shows the estimated actual temperature (\u00b0C). Linear trend fits to the last 25 (yellow), 50 (orange), 100 (purple) and 150 years (red) are shown, and correspond to 1981 to 2005, 1956 to 2005, 1906 to 2005, and 1856 to 2005, respectively. Note that for shorter recent periods, the slope is greater, indicating accelerated warming.\nThe 4th IPCC Report also states that, \"analysis of long-term changes in daily temperature extremes has recently become possible for many regions of the world (parts of North America and southern South America, Europe, northern and eastern Asia, southern Africa and Australasia). Especially since the 1950s, these records show a decrease in the number of very cold days and nights and an increase in the number of extremely hot days and warm nights. The length of the frost-free season has increased in most mid- and high-latitude regions of both hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is mostly manifest as an earlier start to spring.\"\nRegional Temperature Anomalies\n2008 was a year with above-average temperatures all over Europe. A large geographical domain, including north-western Siberia and part of the Scandinavian region, recorded a remarkably mild winter. January and February were very mild over nearly all of Europe. Monthly mean temperature anomalies for these months exceeded +7\u00b0C in some places in Scandinavia. In most parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden, winter 2007-08 was the warmest recorded since the beginning of measurements. In contrast, the boreal winter was remarkably cold for a large part of Eurasia extending eastward from Turkey to China. Some places in Turkey had their coldest January nights in nearly 50 years. This extreme cold weather caused hundreds of casualties in Afghanistan and China.\nIn January 2009 Melbourne experienced three successive days of temperatures above 43\u00b0C for the first time in recorded history. In March 2008, southern Australia experienced a record heatwave that brought scorching temperatures across the region. Adelaide experienced its longest running heatwave on record, with 15 consecutive days of maximum temperatures above 35\u00b0C. Persistent extreme heat affected much of eastern Australia from late December 2005 until early March with many records being set (e.g. second hottest day on record in Sydney with 44.2\u00b0C/111.6\u00b0F on 1 January). Spring 2006 (September-November) was Australia\u2019s warmest since seasonal records were first compiled in 1950. Heat waves were also registered in Brazil from January until March 2006 (e.g. 44.6\u00b0C/112.3\u00b0F in Bom Jesus on 31 January \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Brazil).\nSeveral parts of Europe and the USA experienced heat waves with record temperatures in July and August of 2006. Air temperatures in many parts of the USA reached 40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F or more. The July European-average land-surface air temperature was the warmest on record at 2.7\u00b0C above the climatological normal.\nAutumn 2006 (September-November) was exceptional in large parts of Europe at more than 3\u00b0C warmer than the climatological normal from the north side of the Alps to southern Norway. In many countries it was the warmest autumn since official measurements began: records in central England go back to 1659 (1706 in The Netherlands and 1768 in Denmark).\nArctic sea ice extent during the 2008 melt season dropped to its second-lowest level since satellite measurements began in 1979, reaching the lowest point in its annual cycle of melt and growth on 14 September 2008. Average sea ice extent over the month of September, a standard measure in the scientific study of Arctic sea ice, was 4.67 million km2. The record monthly low, set in 2007, was 4.3 million km2.\nSummary\nBased on science from the IPCC 4th Report, and consistent with observed increases in global temperature, there have been:\n- decreases in the length of river and lake ice seasons.\n- worldwide reduction in glacial mass and extent in the 20th century.\n- melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has recently become apparent.\n- snow cover has decreased in many Northern Hemisphere regions.\n- sea ice thickness and extent have decreased in the Arctic in all seasons.\n- the oceans are warming\n- sea level is rising due to thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of land ice.\nThe rapid rise in global temperature is unmatched in the last million years. Normally, and when the Earth has warmed after an ice age, it is a gradual process taking about 5,000 years.\nPage updated 21 January 2011\nHave Something To Say About This Topic?\nShare your comments or insight into rising global temperatures!\nEnter Your Title\nClose Help\nEntering your story is easy to do.

Despite that, I chose to honor the confidentiality request of the author Dr. Richard Muller, even though I knew that behind the scenes, they were planning a media blitz to MSM outlets. In the past few days I have been contacted by James Astill of the Economist, Ian Sample of the Guardian, and Leslie Kaufman of the New York Times. They have all contacted me regarding the release of papers from BEST today.\nThere\u2019s only one problem: Not one of the BEST papers have completed peer review.\nNor has one has been published in a journal to my knowledge, nor is the one paper I\u2019ve been asked to comment on in press at JGR , (where I was told it was submitted) yet BEST is making a \u201cpre-peer review\u201d media blitz.\nOne willing participant to this blitz, that I spent the last week corresponding with, is James Astill of The Economist, who presumably wrote the article below, but we can\u2019t be sure since the Economist has not the integrity to put author names to articles:\nThe full article is here . Apparently, Astill has never heard of the UAH and RSS Global Temperature records, nor does he apparently know that all the surface temperature records come from one source, NCDC.\nNow compare that headline and subtitle to this line in the article:\nIt will be interesting to see whether this makes it past the review process.\nAnd, The Economist still doesn\u2019t get it. The issue of \u201cthe world is warming\u201d is not one that climate skeptics question, it is the magnitude and causes.\nI was given a pre-release draft copy of one of the papers, related to my work as a courtesy. It contained several errors, some minor (such as getting the name of our paper wrong i.e. Fell et al in several places, plus a title that implied global rather than USA) some major enough to require revision (incorrect time period comparisons).\nI made these errors known to all the players, including the journal editor, and the hapless Astill, who despite such concerns went ahead with BEST\u2019s plan for a media blitz anyway. I was told by a BEST spokesperson that all of this was \u201ccoordinated to happen on October 20th\u201d.\nMy response, penned days ago, went unheeded as far as I can tell, because I\u2019ve received no response from Muller or the Journal author. Apparently, PR trumps the scientific process now, no need to do that pesky peer review, no need to address the errors with those you ask for comments prior to publication, just get it to press.\nThis is sad, because I had very high hopes for this project as the methodology is looked very promising to get a better handle on station discontinuity issues with their \u201cscalpel\u201d method. Now it looks just like another rush to judgement, peer review be damned.\nBelow is my response along with the draft paper from BEST, since the cat is publicly out of the bag now, I am not bound by any confidentiality requests. Readers should note I have not seen any other papers (there may be up to 4, I don\u2019t know the BEST website is down right now) except the one that concerns me.\nMy response as sent to all media outlets who sent requests for comment to me:\nIn contradiction to normal scientific method and protocol, I have been asked to provide public commentary to a mass media outlet (The Economist) on this new paper. The lead author,\u00a0 Dr. Richard Muller has released me from a previous request of confidentiality on the matter in a written communication on\n10/14/2011\n. 10/15/2011 at 4:07PM PST in an email.\u00a0 The paper in question is:\nEarth Atmospheric Land Surface Temperature and\u00a0 Station Quality [Tentative title, may have changed] by Muller et al 2011, submitted to the AGU JGR Atmospheres Journal, which apparently has neither completed peer review on the paper nor has it been accepted for publication by JGR.\nSince the paper has not completed peer review yet, it would be inappropriate for me to publicly comment on the conclusions, especially in light of a basic procedural error that has been discovered in the methodology that will likely require a rework of the data and calculations, and thus the conclusions may also change. The methodology however does require comment.\nThe problem has to do with the time period of the data used, a time period which is inconsistent with two prior papers cited as this Muller et al paper being in agreement with. They are:\nFall et al (2011), Analysis of the impacts of station exposure on the U.S. Historical Climatology Network temperatures and temperature trends J. Geophys. Res.\nand\nMenne et al\u00a0 (2010), On the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record, J. Geophys. Res.\nBoth papers listed above (and cited by Muller et al) do an analysis over a thirty year time period while the Muller et al paper uses data for comparison from 1950 \u2013 2010 as stated on lines 142-143:\n\u201cWe calculated the mean temperature from 1950 to the present for each of these sites, and subtracted the mean of the poor sites from the OK sites.\u201d\nI see this as a basic failure in understanding the limitations of the siting survey we conducted on the USHCN, rendering the Muller et al paper conclusions highly uncertain, if not erroneous.\nThere is simply no way siting quality can be established as static for that long. The USHCN survey was based on photographs and site surveys starting in of 2007, plus historical metadata. Since the siting of COOP stations change as volunteers move, die, or discontinue their service, we know the record of siting stability to be tenuous over time. This is why we tracked only from 1979 and excluded stations whose locations were unknown prior to 2002. 1979 represented the practical limit of which we assumed we could reasonably ascertain siting conditions by our survey.\nWe felt that the further back the station siting changes occurred, the more uncertainty was introduced into the analysis, thus we limited meaningful comparisons of temperature data to siting quality to thirty years, starting in 1979.\nOur ratings from surfacestations.org are assumed to be valid for the 1979 \u2013 2008 period, but with Muller et all doing analysis from 1950, it renders the station survey data moot since neither Menne et al nor Fall et al made any claim of the station survey data being representative prior to 1979. The comparisons made in Muller et al are inappropriate because they are outside of the bounds of our station siting quality data set.\nAlso, by using a 60 year period, Muller et al spans two 30 year climate normals periods, thus further complicating the analysis. Both Menne et al and Fall et al spanned only one.\nBecause of the long time periods involved in Muller et al analysis, and because both Menne et al and Fall et al made no claims of knowing anything about siting quality prior to 1979, I consider the paper fatally flawed as it now stands, and thus I recommend it be removed from publication consideration by JGR until such time that it can be reworked.\nFor me to comment on the conclusions of Muller et al would be inappropriate until this time period error is corrected and the analysis reworked for time scale appropriate comparisons.\nThe Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature analysis methodology is new, and may yield some new and potentially important results on siting effects once the appropriate time period comparisons are made. I welcome the BEST effort provided that appropriate time periods are used that match our work. But, by using time period mismatched comparisons, it becomes clear that the Muller et al paper in its current form lost the opportunity for a meaningful comparison.\nAs I was invited by The Economist to comment publicly, I would recommend rejecting Muller et al in the current form and suggest that it be resubmitted with meaningful and appropriate 30 year comparisons for the same time periods used by the Menne et al and Fall et al cited papers. I would be happy to review the paper again at that time.\nI also believe it would be premature and inappropriate to have a news article highlighting the conclusions of this paper until such time meaningful data comparisons are produced and the paper passes peer review. Given the new techniques from BEST, there may be much to gain from a rework of the analysis limited to identical thirty year periods used in Menne et al and Fall et al.\nThank you for your consideration, I hope that the information I have provided will be helpful in determining the best course of action on this paper.\nBest Regards,\nAnthony Watts\ncc list: James Astill, The Economist, Dr. Joost DeGouw, JGR Atmospheres editor, Richard A. Muller,\u00a0Leslie Kaufman, Ian Sample\nDespite my concerns, The Economist author James Astill told me that \u201cthe issue is important\u201d and decided to forge ahead, and presumably produced the article above.\nHere is the copy of the paper I was provided by Richard Muller. I don\u2019t know if they have addressed my concerns or not, since I was not given any follow up drafts of the paper.\nBEST_Station_Quality (PDF 1.2 MB)\nI assume the journalists that are part of the media blitz have the same copy.\nI urge readers to read it in entirety and to comment on it, because as Dr. Muller wrote to me:\nI know that is prior to acceptance, but in the tradition that I grew up in (under Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez) we always widely distributed \u201cpreprints\u201d of papers prior to their publication or even submission.\u00a0 That guaranteed a much wider peer review than we obtained from mere referees.\nPlease keep it confidential until we post it ourselves.\nThey want it widely reviewed. Now that The Economist has published on it, it is public knowledge.\nThere might be useful and interesting work here done by BEST, but I find it troubling that they can\u2019t wait for science to do its work and run the peer review process first. Is their work so important, so earth shattering, that they can\u2019t be bothered to run the gauntlet like other scientists? This is post normal science at its absolute worst.\nIn my opinion, this is a very, very, bad move by BEST. I look forward to seeing what changes might be made in peer review should these papers be accepted and published.\nUPDATE: Judith Curry, who was co-author to some of these papers, has a post on it here\nAlso I know that I\u2019ll be critcized for my position on this, since I said back in March that I would accept their findings whatever they were, but that was when I expected them to do science per the scientific process.\nWhen BEST approached me, I was told they were doing science by the regular process, and that would include peer review. Now it appears they have circumvented the scientific process in favor of PR.\nFor those wishing to criticize me on that point, please note this caveat in my response above:\nThe Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature analysis methodology is new, and may yield some new and potentially important results on siting effects once the appropriate time period comparisons are made. I welcome the BEST effort provided that appropriate time periods are used that match our work. But, by using time period mismatched comparisons, it becomes clear that the Muller et al paper in its current form lost the opportunity for a meaningful comparison.\nGiven the new techniques from BEST, there may be much to gain from a rework of the analysis limited to identical thirty year periods used in Menne et al and Fall et al.\nMy issue has to do with the lost opportunity of finding something new, the findings may agree, or they may be different if run on the same time periods. I think it is a fair question to ask since my peer reviewed paper (Fall et al) and NOAA\u2019s (Menne et al) paper both used 30 year periods.\nIf BEST can run their comparison on the 30 year period for which our data is valid, instead of 60 years, as stated before, I\u2019ll be happy to accept the results, whatever they are. I\u2019m only asking for the correct time period to be used. Normally things like this are addressed in peer review, but BEST has blown that chance by taking it public first before such things can be addressed.\nAs for the other papers supposedly being released today, I have not seen them, so I can\u2019t comment on them. There may be good and useful work here, but it is a pity they could not wait for the scientific process to decide that.\nUPDATE2: 12:08 PM BEST has sent out their press release, below:\nThe Berkeley Earth team has completed the preliminary analysis of the land surface temperature records, and our findings are now available on the Berkeley Earth website, together with the data and our code at\nFour scientific papers have been submitted to peer reviewed journals, covering the following topics:\n1.

II.\nThere are ways to infer from other evidence what the climatological record was, going back for quite a long time, thousands of years. 6\nA surface temperature record, containing recordings from many weather stations around the world (the vast majority of them no longer operating, such as many in the Canadian Arctic), is available at the website of the Goddard Institute for Space Sciences. 7\nSource: GISS\nConsider also the explanation offered by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies following that graph:\nGlobal Surface Air Temperature is based on surface air measurements at meteorological stations. Click for temperature maps and more detailed data. Since corresponding data are unavailable over the ocean, surface air temperature anomalies are combined with ocean temperature anomalies to obtain a 'Land-Ocean Temperature Index'.\nThat is not the only problem afflicting the data reflected in the graph. \u00a0 A major issue of concern is that the total number of land-based weather stations declined over time.\u00a0 Not only that, but an increasingly disproportionate number of the weather stations remaining in operation are located in urban and not in rural areas.\u00a0 The following graph shows an example of what these differences are.\nKeep in mind that although these differences are well known and corrections have ostensibly been made to take them into account, the GISS data base used in the calculations of global warming trends nevertheless contains them.\u00a0 The results of the calculation of regional and global averages are therefore tainted by the presence of the bias introduced through the heat-island effect.\nHowever, consider also that even though airports are in the open, they do have large areas of paved runways that store day-time heat which they release slowly during the night.\u00a0 I don't know where the temperature gauges for the Edmonton International Airport are located in relation to the runways, but the airport buildings are at the SE end of the expanse of the runways.\nThe calculations done by General Circulation Models (GCMs) are the main source of the information that fuels the global warming hysteria.\u00a0 Nevertheless, not one of them comes acceptably close to accurately calculating what the climate presently is at any location, let alone of the whole Earth.\u00a0 Not only that, but all of the GCMs differ widely from one another as to what the climate was in the past, and as to what it is supposed to be in the future.\nTherein lies the problem.\u00a0 No one in his right mind will base any decisions about the future on tools that cannot determine with acceptable accuracy what the present is and the past was.\nUpdate 2009 12 11:\nThe GISS temperature record can no longer be trusted.\nOn or around about Nov. 14, 2009, GISS began to use a new global temperature data set that deleted temperature records relating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\u00a0 Not only that, but the temperature data that remained in use were adjusted downward for dates preceding the year 2000 (increasingly downward the farther back in the temperature record they go), thereby creating or exaggerating \"warming\" trends for individual locations.\nA discussion thread at http://wattsupwiththat.com details the nature of the data fiddling.\nFrom that discussion thread:\nhttp://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/\n\u0093Nov. 14, 2009: USHCN_V2 is now used rather than the older version 1.

How do we define this point in space? The answer is more complex than we'd think, as there are several ways of defining this southernmost extreme:\nGeographic South Pole \u2013 This is the intersection between Earth\u2019s surface and its axis of rotation. It isn't actually a well defined point, because the earth \u201cwobbles\u201d a little. Like anywhere on earth, its location on the earth\u2019s surface is the result of a mathematical projection onto a spherical approximation of the Earth; our own way of locating ourselves in space is, at some level of precision, uncertain. So where are we, really, when we have defined our own \u201csense of space\u201d?\nCeremonial South Pole \u2013 This is actually a \u201cpole\u201d stuck into the ice at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (U.S.) , supposedly marking the Geographic South Pole. However, because the ice drifts approximately 10 m (33 ft) a year, the pole must is repositioned every New Years\u2019 Day (see Continental Ice ). The pole can be hard to find when buried in ice and snow from passing storms.\nCelestial South Pole \u2013 This is the projection of the Geographic South Pole onto the celestial sphere. The Noth Celestial Pole is easy to find because of Polaris. Finding the South Celestial Pole, however, requires some more complex geometry involving the Southern Cross, the stars Canopus and Achernar, and some galaxies called the Magellanic Clouds. It isn't a point on the surface of the Earth, but it strengthens the \u201cotherworldly\u201d quality of the South Pole.\nThe Magnetic South Pole is drifting\nMagnetic South Pole \u2013 This is the point where Earth\u2019s magnetic field points directly upwards. Technically, this is the definition for the Magnetic North Pole, so the Magnetic South Pole is actually the Magnetic North Pole, and vice versa. The Magnetic South Pole is always wandering, and Earth\u2019s magnetic field has completely reversed several times in geologic history. In 1909, three men from Shackleton 's expedition claimed to have reached the Magnetic South Pole, which was then on land. By now the Magnetic South Pole has drifted off the coast of Antarctica.\nGeomagnetic South Pole - Because the Earth's magnetic field is not an exact dipole, the Geomagnetic South Pole does not coincide with the Magnetic South Pole. It is now somewhere on the ice near Vostok Station, and is wandering as well.\nAntarctica \u2013 The continent of Antarctica is currently on top of the South Pole. Since the location of the continents and oceans has shifted over time, this has not always been the case, for much of Earth's history (see Geology ). But humans have encountered Antarctica at the South Pole, and throughout human history, the South Pole has been synonymous with the Antarctic in the public imagination. This white continent, of unparalleled size, remoteness, and harshness, is the main thing that distinguishes the South Pole from the North Pole. In the current climatic and geophysical state, we have come to associate the South Pole with the imagery of Antarctica's landforms: its ice , mountains , and volcanoes .\nThe Southern Pole of Inaccessibility was reached in 1958 by a Soviet expedition\nSouthern Pole of Inaccessibility - This is the point on the Antarctic continent that is furthest away from the coastline.

In the Northern Hemisphere, several places in eastern Siberia compete for the title of Northern Pole of Cold.

During the 1960s, weather experts found that over the past couple of decades the trend had shifted to cooling. With a new awareness that climate could change in serious ways, in the early 1970s some scientists predicted a continued gradual cooling, perhaps a phase of a long natural cycle or perhaps caused by human pollution of the atmosphere with smog and dust. Others insisted that the effects of such pollution were temporary, and humanity's emission of greenhouse gases would bring warming over the long run. All of them agreed that their knowledge was primitive and any prediction was guesswork. But understanding of the climate system was advancing swiftly. The view that warming must dominate won out in the late 1970s as it became clear that the cooling spell (mainly a Northern Hemisphere effect) had indeed been a temporary distraction. When the rise continued into the 21st century, penetrating even into the ocean depths, scientists recognized that it signaled a profound change in the climate system. Nothing like it had been seen for centuries, and probably not for millennia. The specific pattern of changes, revealed in objects ranging from ship logs to ice caps to tree rings, closely matched the predicted effects of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u2014 G.S. Callendar (1)\nIf you had a certain type of mind, temperature statistics could be more absorbing than a book of crossword puzzles. Ever since the invention of the thermometer, some amateur and professional scientists had recorded the temperature wherever they happened to be living or visiting. Government weather services began to record measurements more systematically during the 19th century. By the 1930s, observers had accumulated millions of numbers for temperatures at stations around the world. It was an endlessly challenging task to weed out the unreliable data, average the rest in clever combinations, and compare the results for each particujlar region with other weather features such as droughts. Many of the players in this game pursued a hope of discovering cycles of weather that could lead to predictions. Perhaps, for example, one could correlate rainfall trends with the eleven-year sunspot cycle.\n- LINKS -\nHints of Warming (1930s-1950s) TOP OF PAGE\nAdding interest to the game was a suspicion that temperatures had generally increased since the late 19th century \u2014 at least in eastern North America and western Europe, the only parts of the world where reliable measurements went back so far. (2) In the 1930s, the press began to call attention to numerous anecdotes of above-normal temperatures. The head of the U.S. Weather Bureau's Division of Climate and Crop Weather responded in 1934. \"With 'Grand-Dad' insisting that the winters were colder and the snows deeper when he was a lad,\" he said, \"...it was decided to make a rather exhaustive study of the question.\" Averaging results from many stations in the eastern United States and some scattered locations elsewhere around the world, the weather services found that \"Grand-Dad\" was right: since 1865 average temperatures had risen several degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) in most regions. Experts thought this was simply one phase of a cycle of rising and falling temperatures that probably ambled along for centuries. As one scientist explained, when he spoke of the current \"climate change\" he did not mean any permanent shift, but a long-term cyclical change \"like all other climate fluctuations.\" (3)\n= Milestone\nIt may have been the press reports of warming that stimulated an English engineer, Guy Stewart Callendar, to take up climate study as an amateur enthusiast. He undertook a thorough and systematic effort to look for historical changes in the average temperature of the entire planet. One 19th-century German had already made an attempt at this, seeking a connection with sunspot cycles. Otherwise, if anyone else had thought about it, they had probably been discouraged by the scattered and irregular character of the weather records, plus the common assumption that the average climate scarcely changed over the span of a century. But meteorologists around the world had meticulously compiled weather records, and Callendar drew upon that massive international effort. After countless hours of sorting out data and penciling sums, he announced that the mean global temperature had definitely risen between 1890 and 1935, by close to half a degree Celsius (0.5\u00b0C, equal to 0.9\u00b0F). (4)\n=> CO2 greenhouse\nCallendar's statistics gave him confidence to push ahead with another and more audacious claim. Reviving an old theory that human emissions of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) from burning fuel could cause a \"greenhouse effect,\" Callendar said this was the cause of the warming. (For the details of the theory, click on the link in the righthand column from the essay on Simple models of climate. For scientists' views on the theory in Callendar's day, click on the link higher up to the essay on the CO2 greenhouse effect.)\n<= Simple models\nIt all sounded dubious to most meteorologists. Temperature data were such a mess of random fluctuations that with enough manipulation you could derive all sorts of spurious trends. Taking a broader look, experts believed that climate was comfortably uniform. \"There is no scientific reason to believe that our climate will change radically in the next few decades,\" the highly respected climatologist Helmut Landsberg explained in 1946. \"Good and poor years will occur with approximately the same frequency as heretofore.\" (5) If during some decades in some region there was an unmistakable climate change, the change must be just part of some local cycle, and in due time the climate of the region would revert to its average.\n<= Simple models\n(By the end of the 20th century, scientists were able to check Callendar's figures. They had done far more extensive and sophisticated analysis of the weather records, confirmed by \"proxy\" data such as studies of tree rings and measurements of old temperatures that lingered in deep boreholes. The data showed that the world had in fact been warming from the mid 19th century up to about 1940, but it was caused by natural fluctuations. As it happened, much of the warming had been in the relatively small patch of the planet that contained the United States and Europe \u2014 and thus contained the great majority of scientists and weather records. If not for this accident, people would probably have paid little attention to the idea of global warming for another generation. That would have severely delayed our understanding of what we face.)\n<=> CO2 greenhouse\nDuring the 1940s only a few people looked into the question of warming. A prominent example was the Swedish scientist Hans Ahlmann, who voiced concern about the strong warming seen in some northern regions since early in the century. But in 1952, he reported that northern temperatures had begun to fall again since around 1940. (6) The argument for warming caused by CO2 emissions, another eminent climatologist wrote in 1949, \"has rather broken down in the last few years\" when temperatures in some regions fell. (7) In any case (as yet another authority remarked), compared with the vast slow swings of ice ages, \"the recent oscillations of climate have been relatively small.\" (8)\nIf the North Atlantic region was no longer warming, through the 1940s and 1950s it remained balmy in comparison with earlier decades. People were beginning to doubt the assumption of climate stability. Several scientists published analyses of weather records that confirmed Callendar's finding of an overall rise since the 1880s. (9) An example was a careful study of U.S. Weather Bureau data by Landsberg, who was now the Bureau's chief climatologist. The results persuaded him to abandon his belief that the climate was unchanging. He found an undeniable and significant warming in the first half of the century, especially in more northern latitudes. He thought it might be due either to variations in the Sun's energy or to the rise of CO2. (10) Others pitched in with reports of effects plain enough to persuade attentive members of the public. Ahlmann for one announced that glaciers were retreating, crops were growing farther north, and the like. (11) Another striking example was a report that in the Arctic \"the ice is thinner at the present than ever before in historic times;\" before long we might even see an open polar sea. (12) Such high-latitude effects were exactly what simple models suggested would result from the greenhouse effect warming of increased CO2.\n=> Chaos theory\n\"Our attitude to climatic 'normals' must clearly change,\" wrote the respected climate historian Hubert H. Lamb in 1959. Recent decades could not be called normal by any standard of the past, and he saw no reason to expect the next decades would be \"normal\" either. Actually, since the 1930s the temperatures in his own homeland, Britain, had been heading down, but Lamb would not speculate whether that was the start of a cyclical downtrend. It could be \"merely another wobble\" in one region. Lamb's main point, reinforced by his scholarly studies of weather reports clear back to medieval times, was that regional climate change could be serious and long-lasting. (13) Most meteorologists nevertheless stuck to their belief that the only changes to be expected were moderate swings in one part of the world or another, with a fairly prompt return to the long-term average. If there was almost a consensus that for the time being there was a world-wide tendency to warming, the agreement was fragile.\nWarming or Cooling? (1960s-1974) TOP OF PAGE\nIn January 1961, on a snowy and unusually cold day in New York City, J. Murray Mitchell, Jr. of the U.S. Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology told a meeting of meteorologists that the world's temperature was falling. Independently of Callendar (who had meanwhile been updating and improving his own global temperature history), Mitchell had trudged through all the exacting calculations, working out average temperatures for most of the globe, and got plausible results. He confirmed that global temperatures had risen until about 1940. But since then, he reported, temperatures had been falling. There was so much random variation from place to place and from year to year that the reversal to cooling had only now become unambiguous. (14*)\n=> Solar variation\nAcknowledging that the increasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere should give a tendency for warming, Mitchell tentatively suggested that smoke from recent volcanic eruptions and perhaps cyclical changes in the Sun might partly account for the reversal. (Later studies confirmed that volcanoes and solar changes probably did have some cooling effect around that time, along with a natural long-term cycle of Pacific Ocean weather.) But he rightly held that \"such theories appear to be insufficient to account for the recent cooling,\" and he could only conclude that the downturn was \"a curious enigma.\" He suspected the cooling might be part of a natural \"rhythm,\" a cycle lasting 80 years or so. (15) The veteran science correspondent Walter Sullivan was at the meeting, and he reported in the New York Times (January 25 and 30, 1961) that after days of discussion the meteorologists generally agreed on the existence of the cooling trend, but could not agree on a cause for this or any other climate change. \"Many schools of thought were represented... and, while the debate remained good-humored, there was energetic dueling with scientific facts.\" The confused state of climate science was a public embarrassment.\n= Milestone\nThrough the 1960s and into the 1970s, the average global temperature remained relatively cool. Western Europe in particular suffered some of the coldest winters on record. (Studies in later decades found that a quasi-regular long-term weather cycle in the North Atlantic Ocean had moved into a phase in the 1960s that encouraged Arctic winds to move southward there.) (16) People (including scientists) will always give special attention to the weather that they see when they walk out their doors, and what they saw made them doubt that global warming was at hand. In the early 1970s, wherever climate experts got together they debated whether the world was due to get warmer or cooler. Callendar found the turn worrisome, and contacted climate experts to discuss it. (17) Landsberg returned to his earlier view that the climate was probably showing only transient fluctuations, not a rising trend. While pollution and CO2 might be altering the climate in limited regions, he wrote, \"on the global scale natural forces still prevail.\" He added, however, that \"this should not lead to complacency\" about the risk of global changes in the distant future. (18)\n=> Aerosols\nOne source of confusion was increasingly debated. Weather watchers had long recognized that the central parts of cities were distinctly warmer than the surrounding countryside. In urban areas the absorption of solar energy by smog, black roads and roofs, along with direct outpouring of heat from furnaces and other energy sources, created an \"urban heat island\" effect. This was the most striking of all human modifications of local climates. It could be snowing in the suburbs while raining downtown. (19) Some people pushed ahead to suggest that as human civilization used ever more energy, in a century or so the direct output of heat could be great enough to disturb the entire global climate. (20) If so, that would not happen soon, and for the moment the main consequences were statistical.\nSome experts began to ask whether the warming reported for the decades before 1940 had been an illusion. Most temperature measurements came from built-up areas. As the cities grew, so did their local heating, which might have given a spurious impression of global warming. (21*) Callendar and others replied that they were well aware of urban effects, and took them fully into account in their calculations. Mitchell in particular agreed that population growth could explain the \"record high\" temperatures often reported in American cities \u2014 but it could not explain the warming of remote Arctic regions. (22*) Yet the statistical difficulties were so complex that the global warming up to 1940 remained in doubt. Some skeptics continued to argue that the warming was a mere illusion caused by urbanization.\nWhile neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way. The reassuring assumption of a stable \"normal\" climate was rarely heard now. In the early 1970s, a series of ruinous droughts and other exceptionally bad spells of weather in various parts of the world provoked warnings that world food stocks might run out. Fears increased that somehow humanity was at fault for the bad weather \u2014 if we were not causing global warming with greenhouse gases, then perhaps we were cooling the globe with our smoke and smog. Responding to public anxieties, in 1973 the Japan Meteorological Agency sent a questionnaire to meteorological services around the world. They found no consensus. Most agencies reported that they saw no clear climate trend, but several (including the Japanese themselves) noted a recent cooling in many regions. Many experts thought it likely that the world had entered a long-term cool spell. (23)\n<= Aerosols\nPublic pressure was urging scientists to declare where the climate was going. But they could not do so without knowing what caused climate changes. Haze in the air from volcanoes might explain some cooling, but not as much as was observed. A few experts worried that pollution from human sources, such as dust from overgrazed lands and haze from factories, was beginning to shade and cool the planet's surface. But most experts doubted we were putting out enough air pollution to seriously affect global climate. A more acceptable explanation was a traditional one: the Earth was responding to long-term fluctuations in the Sun's output of energy. (24)\n<= Solar variation\nAn alternative explanation was found in the \"Milankovitch\" cycles, tens of thousands of years long, that astronomers calculated for minor variations in the Earth's orbit. These variations brought cyclical changes in the amount of sunlight reaching a given latitude on Earth. In 1966, a leading climate expert analyzed the cycles and predicted that we were starting on the descent into a new ice age. (25) In the early 1970s, a variety of measurements pinned down the nature and timing of the cycles as actually reflected in past climate shifts. Projecting the cycles forward strengthened the prediction. A gradual cooling seemed to be astronomically scheduled over the next few thousand years. Later and better calculations would make that tens of thousands of years, but at the time a few people speculated that we might even see substantial natural cooling within centuries. (26) Unless, that is, something intervened.\nWarming Resumed (1975-1987) TOP OF PAGE\nIt scarcely mattered what the Milankovitch orbital changes might do, wrote Murray Mitchell in 1972, since \"man's intervention... would if anything tend to prolong the present interglacial.\" Human industry would prevent an advance of the ice by blanketing the Earth with CO2. A panel of top experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences in 1975 tentatively agreed with Mitchell. True, in recent years the temperature had been dropping (perhaps as part of some unknown \"longer-period climatic oscillation\"). And industrial haze might also have a cooling effect, perhaps reinforcing the natural long-term trend toward a new ice age. Nevertheless, they thought CO2 \"could conceivably\" bring half a degree of warming by the end of the century. (27) The outspoken geochemist and oceanographer Wallace Broecker went farther. He suspected that there was indeed a natural cycle responsible for the cooling in recent decades, perhaps originating in cyclical changes on the Sun. If so, it was only temporarily canceling the greenhouse warming. Within a few decades that would climb past any natural cycle. He asked, \"Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?\" (28*)\n=> Public opinion\nMeanwhile in 1975, two New Zealand scientists reported that while the Northern Hemisphere had been cooling over the past thirty years, their own region, and probably other parts of the Southern\u00a0Hemisphere, had been warming. (29) There were too few weather stations in the vast unvisited southern oceans to be certain, but other studies tended to confirm it. The cooling since around 1940 had been observed mainly in northern latitudes. Perhaps cooling from industrial haze counteracted the greenhouse warming there? After all, the Northern Hemisphere was home to most of the world's industry. It was also home to most of the world's population, and as usual, people had been most impressed by the weather where they lived. (30*)\n=> Aerosols\nThe tendency of some scientists in the early 1970s to suspect that the world was cooling now collapsed. Science journalists reported that climate scientists were openly divided, and those who expected warming were increasingly numerous. A good example is Hubert Lamb, the historian of climate who in the 1950s had called attention to climate changes without attempting to predict them. Generalizing from the unusually good historical records in his native England, Lamb had depicted a globally warm \"Medieval Climatic Optimum\" followed in the early modern period by a \"Little Ice Age.\" During the chilly 1960s he was persuaded by the studies of natural cycles that a new ice age was likely to arrive over thousands of years. But after the hot English summer of 1976 he joined the emerging viewpoint that human greenhouse gas emissions would \"become dominant over the natural climate fluctuations by about A.D. 2000.\" (31)\n=> Public opinion\nIn an attempt to force scientists to agree on a useful answer, in 1977 the U.S. Department of Defense persuaded two dozen of the world's top climate experts to respond to a complicated survey. Their main conclusion was that scientific knowledge was meager and all predictions were unreliable. The panel was nearly equally divided among three opinions: some thought further cooling was likely, others suspected that moderate greenhouse warming would begin fairly soon, and most of the rest expected the climate would stay about the same at least for the next couple of decades. Only a few thought it probable that there would be considerable global warming by the year 2000. (31a)\n=> Public opinion\nGovernment officials and scientists wanted more definite statements on what was happening to the weather. Thousands of stations around the world were turning out daily numbers, but these represented many different standards and degrees of reliability \u2014 a disorderly, almost indigestible mess. Just storing the records was a formidable challenge. Already in 1966, \"From storage rooms to hallways, punch card file cabinets containing the nation\u2019s archive of climate data filled every conceivable space at the National Weather Records Center (NWRC)... There was concern that the NWRC building was in imminent danger of a structural collapse.\" Although computer memory storage technology improved with tremendous speed, the ever-increasing volume of data kept pace. (31b)\nAround 1980 two groups undertook to work through the mass of numbers in all their grubby details, rejecting sets of uncertain data and tidying up the rest. To contrive an entirely fictional example, suppose in the 1910s there were only eight stations measuring temperatures across a million square miles of the Canadian Arctic, and six of them were in the southern half of the territory. How do you combine the numbers to get an average for that entire segment of the globe? If one of the stations was moved in 1915 from a riverbank to a higher point that was usually colder, how do you adjust? What if one of the stations gave inconsistent results in the winter, and you suspect that the fellow stationed there didn't care to go out to read the thermometer on really cold days, but made up the numbers? The final values for an average temperature in a region resulted from countless difficult decisions.\nOne of the groups that undertook the task was in New York, funded by NASA and led by James Hansen. They understood that the work by Mitchell and others mainly described the Northern Hemisphere, since that was where the great majority of reliable observations lay. Sorting through the more limited temperature observations from the other half of the world, they got reasonable averages by applying the same mathematical methods that they had used to get average numbers in their computer models of climate. (After all, Hansen remarked, when he studied other planets he might judge the entire planet by the single station where a probe had landed.) In 1981, the group reported that \"the common misconception that the world is cooling is based on Northern Hemisphere experience to 1970.\" Just around the time that meteorologists had noticed the cooling trend, such as it was, it had apparently reversed. From a low point in the mid 1960s, by 1980 the world had warmed some 0.2\u00b0C. (32)\nHansen's group looked into the causes of the fluctuations, and they got a rather good match for the temperature record using volcanic eruptions plus solar variations. Greenhouse warming by CO2 had not been a major factor (at least, not yet). More sophisticated analyses in the 1990s would eventually confirm these findings. From the 1940s to the early 1960s, the Northern Hemisphere had indeed cooled while temperatures had held roughly steady in the south. Some of the change certainly came from natural variations, probably including changes in the Sun's output and a modest spate of volcanic eruptions. More significantly, a sharp increase in haze from pollution such as sulfate aerosol particles had probably helped to temporarily cool the industrialized Northern Hemisphere (it was hard to be sure, since nobody had been measuring global pollution back then). After the 1960s, with pollution growing less rapidly while CO2 continued to accumulate in the air, warming resumed in both hemispheres. (32a)\n<= Aerosols\nThe temporary northern cooling had been bad luck for climate science. By feeding skepticism about the greenhouse effect, while provoking a few scientists (and rather more journalists) to speculate publicly about the coming of a new ice age, the cool spell gave the field a reputation for fecklessness that it would not soon live down.\n=> Public opinion\nSo long as global pollution from smoke, smog and dust was increasing, its cooling effects would hold back some of the temperature rise. Furthermore, as a few scientists pointed out, the upper layer of the oceans must have been absorbing heat. This too was hiding the buildup of heat energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the air. For only ten percent of the heat added through the greenhouse effect went into heating up the atmosphere; nearly all the rest quickly sank into the oceans. However, Hansen's group and others calculated that these effects could delay atmospheric warming by no more than a few decades. His group boldly predicted that considering how fast CO2 was accumulating, by the end of the 20th century \"carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climatic variability.\" An increasing number of other scientists using different calculations were coming to the same conclusion \u2014 the warming would show itself clearly sometime around 2000. (A few scientists had already said as much as far back as the 1950s.) (33*)\n= Milestone\nThe second important group analyzing global temperatures was the British government's Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, founded by Lamb in 1971 and now led by Tom Wigley. Help in assembling data and funding came from American scientists and agencies. The British results agreed overall with the NASA group's findings \u2014 the world was getting warmer. In 1982, East Anglia confirmed that the cooling that began in the 1940s had turned around by the early 1970s. 1981 was the warmest year in a record that stretched back a century. (34*) Returning to old records, in 1986 the group produced the first truly solid and comprehensive global analysis of average surface temperatures, including the vast ocean regions, which most earlier studies had neglected. They confirmed that there had been considerable warming from the late 19th century up to 1940, followed by some regional cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. Global conditions had been roughly level until the mid 1970s. Then the warming had resumed with a vengeance. The warmest three years in the entire 134-year record had all occurred in the 1980s. (35*)\nTom Wigley (r.) with a later director of the CRU, Phil Jones (l.) in Villach, 1985.\n(photoshopped)\n=> Simple models\nConvincing confirmation came from Hansen and a collaborator. They too analyzed records going back a century, using quite different methods from the British, and came up with substantially the same results. It was true: an unprecedented warming was underway, at least 0.5\u00b0C since the late 19th century. (36)\nIn such publications, the few pages of text and numbers were the visible tip of a prodigious unseen volume of work. Many thousands of people in many countries had spent most of their working lives carefully measuring the weather. Thousands more had devoted themselves to organizing and administering the programs, improving the instruments, standardizing the data, and maintaining the records in archives. In geophysics not much came easily. One simple sentence (like \"last year was the warmest year on record\") might be the distillation of the labors of a multi-generational global community. And it still had to be interpreted. (36a)\n<= International\nMost experts saw no solid proof that continued warming lay in the future. After all, reliable records covered barely a century and showed large fluctuations (especially the 1940-1970 dip). Couldn't the current trend be just another temporary wobble? Stephen Schneider, one of the scientists least shy about warning of climate dangers, acknowledged that \"a greenhouse signal cannot yet be said to be unambiguously detected in the record.\" Like Hansen and some other scientists, he expected that the signal would emerge clearly around the end of the century, but not earlier. (37)\nGlobal temperature 1850-2008 Average annual surface temperature, based on measurements by meteorological stations, ships and satellites, as reported independently by three different groups: NOAA (NCDC) and NASA (GISS) in the US, and the combined Hadley Centre and Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in the UK (HadCRUT3).\nControversy (1988-1990s) TOP OF PAGE\nKnowledge of the global temperature record was becoming so important (and to some, controversial) that the work by the groups in New York and East Anglia no longer seemed enough. A new major effort to track the trends was getting underway at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The Center had been established in 1951 as the National Weather Records Center, with the task of organizing the data that the Weather Bureau and military services had accumulated since the 1940s. The staff had assembled the world's largest collection of historical weather records. A team led by Thomas Karl began to tediously review the statistics for the world and especially the United States. Making their own decisions about how to combine data, they got results that inevitably differed in minor details from what the other groups reported. But there was no disagreement about the recent general trend. (In 2006 the Japan Meteorological Agency would provide yet a fourth independent analysis, confirming the others.)\nEach of the three groups began to issue annual updates, which the press reported prominently. When all the figures were in for 1988, the year proved to be a record-breaker (the 1980s now included the four warmest years since global measurements began). But in the early 1990s, average global temperatures dipped. Most experts figured the cause was the huge 1991 Pinatubo volcanic eruption, whose emissions dimmed sunlight around the world. After rains washed out the volcanic aerosols, the temperature rise resumed. 1995 was the warmest year on record, but 1997 topped it. 1998 beat that in turn by a large margin. Of course these were global averages of trends that varied from one region to another. The citizens of the United States, and in particular residents of the East Coast, had not felt the degree of warming that came in some other parts of the world \u2014 if they had, the politics of the matter might have been different. But looking at the world as a whole, in the late 1990s the great majority of experts at last agreed. Yes, a serious warming trend was underway. (38*)\n=> Public opinion\nThis consensus was sharply attacked by a few scientists. Some pulled out the old argument that the advance of urbanization was biasing temperature readings. In fact, around 1990 meticulous re-analysis of old records had squeezed out the urban heat-island bias to the satisfaction of all but the most stubborn critics. Moreover, long-term warming trends showed up in various kinds of data measured far from cities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in particular, over the oceans. The global warming trend was no statistical error. Meanwhile, in urban areas whatever global warming the greenhouse effect might be causing did get a strong addition of heat, and the combination would significantly raise the mortality from heat waves. (39*)\nWith the urbanization argument discredited, the skeptics turned to measurements by satellites that monitored the Earth. Since 1979, when the first of these satellites was launched, they had provided the first truly comprehensive set of global temperature data. The instruments did not measure temperatures on the surface, but at middle heights in the atmosphere. At these levels, analysis of the data indicated, there had been no rise of temperature, but instead a slight cooling. The satellites were designed for observing daily weather fluctuations, not the average that represented climate, and it took an extraordinarily complex analysis to get numbers that showed long-term changes. The analysis turned out to have pitfalls.What began as a normal controversy among scientists about the best way to analyze data became politicized, as if this one set of observations could prove or disprove that the planet was warming. (40)\n=> Public opinion\nIn an attempt to settle the controversy, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences conducted a full-scale review in 1999. The panel concluded that the satellites seemed reliable (balloon measurements, although far less comprehensive, also failed to find warming in mid-atmosphere). The satellite instruments simply were not designed to see the warming that was indeed taking place at the surface.\nThe measurements indicating that middle layers of the atmosphere had not noticeably warmed were embarrassing to the scientists who were constructing computer models of climate, for their models predicted significant warming there. They suspected the discrepancy could be explained by temporary effects \u2014 volcanic eruptions such as Pinatubo, or perhaps the chemical pollution that was depleting the ozone layer? While the skeptics persisted, most scientists believed that although the computer models were surely imperfect, the satellite data analysis was too ambiguous to pose a serious challenge to the consensus that global warming was underway.\n= Milestone\n(This hunch was confirmed in 2004 when meticulous analysis of both satellite and balloon observations turned up systematic errors. The mid levels had in fact been warming. It was one of several cases where computer modelers had been unable to tweak their models until they matched data, not because the models were bad but because the observations were wrong. To be precise, the raw data were fine, but numbers are meaningless until they are processed; it was the complex analysis of the data that had gone astray. \"This is the answer \u2014 I wish we had recognized it ourselves,\" said the chair of the 1999 Academy survey.In the public sphere, deniers of global warming continued to cite the satellites and other erroneous data; once an idea gets on the internet it can never be removed from circulation.) (41*)\n=> Models (GCMs)\nBy the late 1990s, many types of evidence showed a general warming at ground level. For example, the Northern Hemisphere spring was coming on average a week earlier than in the 1970s. This was confirmed by such diverse measures as earlier dates for bud-break in European botanical gardens, and a decline of Northern Hemisphere snow cover in the spring as measured in satellite pictures. Turning to a more fundamental indicator, the temperature of the upper layers of the oceans \u2014 where most of the heat entering the climate system was stored \u2014 again a serious rise was found in recent decades. (42*) (Link from below) The 1990s were unquestionably the warmest decade since thermometers came into common use, and the trend was accelerating.\nFingerprints (1990s-2000s) TOP OF PAGE\nMost climate scientists now took it for granted that greenhouse gases were the cause of the global warming, but critics pointed out that other things might be at work. After all, the greenhouse effect could not have been responsible for much of the warming that had come between the 1890s and 1940, when industrial emissions had still been modest.Announcements that a given year was the warmest on record, when the record had started during the 19th-century cold spell, might not mean as much as people supposed. The warming up to 1940 (and the dip that followed until the 1970s) might have been caused by variations in the Sun's radiation or by random volcanic eruptions. Another influence was decades-long fluctuations in the atmosphere-ocean systems of the North Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic regions, which drove gradual variations in regional weather patterns; these quasi-cyclical fluctuations had been suspected since the 1920s, but only started to become clear in the late 1990s. Until all the possible influences were sorted out, the cause of the warming since 1970 would remain controversial.\n<= The oceans\nHowever, there were \"fingerprints\" (or a \u201csignature\u201d) that pointed directly to greenhouse warming. One measure was the difference of temperature between night and day. Tyndall had pointed out more than a century back that basic physics declared that the greenhouse effect would act most effectively at night, as the gases impeded radiation from escaping into space. Statistics did show that it was especially at night that the world was warmer. Overall, minimum temperatures were rising three times faster than maximum temperatures (bad news for farmers, since warm nights hurt crops threatened by drought). (42a)\n<= Simple models\nNo less convincing, Arrhenius at the turn of the century, and everyone since, had calculated that the Arctic would warm more than other parts of the globee, as the melting of snow and ice exposed dark soil and water. (This effect would not be expected in Antarctica, with its colossal year-round ice cover, and in fact warming was not seen there \u2014 except around the coasts and on the long peninsula that projected beyond the ice sheet.) Arctic warming was indeed glaringly obvious to scientists as they watched trees take over mountain meadows in Sweden and the Arctic Ocean's ice pack grow ever thinner. Alaskans and Siberians didn't need statistics to tell them the weather was changing, when they saw buildings sag as the permafrost that supported them melted.\n<=> Public opinion\nA team of computer modelers at the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California, led by Benjamin Santer, predicted that greenhouse gases would cause a particular geographical pattern of temperature change. It was different from what might be caused by other external influences, such as solar variations. The maps of observed changes did in fact bear a rough resemblance to the computers' greenhouse-effect maps. \"It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities,\" the researchers concluded, \"although many uncertainties remain.\" (43) Even before Santer's finding was published, it impressed the community of climate scientists. An important 1995 report by the world's leading experts (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) offered the \"fingerprint\" as evidence that greenhouse warming was probably underway. By 2006, when the warming had progressed considerably farther and the computer models were much improved, their judgment was confirmed. A thorough analysis concluded that there was scarcely a 5% chance that anything but humans had brought the pattern of changes observed in many regions of the world. (43a)\nBen Santer\n<= Solar variation\nMeanwhile a variety of new evidence suggested that the recent warming was exceptional even if one looked back many centuries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 another unambiguous fingerprint of human influence. Beginning in the 1960s, a few historians and meteorologists had labored to discover variations of climate by digging through historical records of events like freezes and storms. For example, had the disastrous harvest of 1788 helped spark the French Revolution? Scholars found it difficult to derive an accurate picture, let alone quantitative data, from old manuscripts. Increasingly laborious projects hacked away at the problem. (43b) As one example among many, by 2004 an international team had analyzed hundreds of thousands of weather observations recorded in 18th and 19th century ships' logs in a dozen languages. Whaling ships in particular might have the only record for vast stretches of the planet. Analyzing old records was tricky \u2014 for example, ocean temperatures measured with a thermometer in a bucket of sea water had to be adjusted for the cooling that took place as the bucket was hauled aboard. It was thus necessary to dig out just how temperatures had been taken. The effort paid off in 2008 when a group reported that a switch of methods in 1945 had created a spurious drop in ocean temperature readings, exaggerating the global temperature dip of the 1950s. (44) The labor of reconciling different types of measurements seemed endless, but the magnitude of the errors was gradually beaten down.\nFor the distant past, tree rings in fossil wood were the most widely used measure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and therefore the most controversial. As early as the 1920s, a few scientists had used rings in ancient logs as a measure of past climates, claiming that the width of a ring varied with a season's rainfall. The studies were attacked as unreliable until the 1960s, when new research showed that the rings did track rainfall in dry regions, but elsewhere they varied according to other factors. In particular, temperature was the crucial factor for certain trees at high altitudes and high latitudes. For example, the venerable bristlecone pines of California survive for millenia on their bleak mountaintops like taoistic recluses in a Chinese painting, growing imperceptibly in close harmony with the changes of snow cover and sunlight.\nBristlecone pines\nCalibration was difficult, however, for some trees (although not the bristlecones) began to act strangely in the late 20th century, thanks perhaps to acid rain and other pollution as well as global climate change. This \"divergence problem\" could be worked around by relying on earlier data, but the adjustments were tricky. The adjustments became a lightning-rod for critics who insisted that the tree experts were analyzing the data incorrectly (even, some exclaimed, dishonestly). Fortunately there were other climate proxies, and scientists worked to derive past temperatures entirely without the use of tree rings. Ingenious analysis of coral reefs, fossil pollen, layers in stalactites, and so forth engaged experts from a variety of obscure specialties. Unexpected sources of error turned up here too. But years of analysis by different and often rival groups produced increasingly reliable numbers, all pretty much in agreement with one another and with tree rings. The trees proved useful as a check, and for exploring climate change in times and places where nothing else was available. (44a)\nA particularly tellilng independent proxy was a uniquely straightforward method, the measurement of old temperatures directly in boreholes. Data from various locations in Alaska, published in 1986, showed that the top 100 meters of permafrost was anomalously warm compared with deeper layers. The only possible cause was a rise of average Arctic air temperature by a few degrees since the last century, with the heat gradually seeping down into the earth. (45) In a burst of enthusiasm during the 1990s, scientists took the temperature of hundreds of deep boreholes in soil and rock layers around the planet. The averages gave a clear signal of a global warming accelerating in the 20th century. A still more important example of the far-flung efforts was a series of heroic expeditions that labored high into the thin air of the Andes and even Tibet, hauling drill rigs onto tropical ice caps. The hard-won data showed again that the warming in the last few decades exceeded anything seen for several thousand years. The ice caps themselves, which had endured since the last ice age, were melting away faster than the scientists could measure them. (46)\n=> Sea rise & ice\nBy 2005 glaciologists had gathered enough evidence to report that everywhere from Argentina to New Guinea, the majority of mountain glaciers and icecaps were in retreat. As the ice melted back it was revealing mummies that had been frozen for thousands of years. Striking changes in the Alps, in Glacier National Park in the United States, and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa made a particularly strong impression on the public. But every glacier has its own personality, depending as much on variations in snowfall as on temperature. What impressed scientists were studies of the total mass of ice, which revealed a net loss since the 1970s in every region of the globe. (47)\nLoss of glaciers, ice caps and Arctic sea ice is a particularly visible (and worrying) demonstration of global warming. See the separate essay on Ice Sheets and Rising Seas .\nThe Hockey Stick and Beyond TOP OF PAGE\nA group headed by Michael Mann combined a variety of measures to construct a graph of estimated temperatures averaged over the Northern Hemisphere over the past ten centuries. An apparent downward trend from a \"Medieval Warm Period,\" roughly as warm as the 1950s, into the cooler \"Little Ice Age\" gave way to a steep rise in the 20th century. The movement from warm to cool and back toward warm had been debated by Lamb and other historians and climatologists since the 1920s; what was new and startling was the abrupt climb since the 1950s. (47a) A gray shaded area showed the range of incomplete data, but most attention went to a dark solid line showing temperatures averaged over each half-century or so. The temperatures of the 1990s soared to the top of the chart. Apparently 1998 had been not just the warmest year of the century, but of the millennium. The graph ( shown below ) was widely reprinted and made a strong impression. It was dubbed the \"hockey stick\" because it displayed a flat thousand-year trend followed by a sharp upward turn.\nMichael Mann\nphoto: Greg Rico\nThe \"hockey stick\" graph was prominently featured in a report the IPCC issued in 2001. The image immediately became a powerful tool for people who were trying to raise public awareness of global warming \u2014 to the regret of some seasoned climate experts who recognized that, like all science at the point of publication, the graph was preliminary and uncertain. The dedicated minority who denied that there was any global warming problem promptly attacked the calculations. For example, in 2003 a few scientists argued that the Earth had been as warm a thousand years ago as in the late 20th century. (48*)\nOther climatologists took up the question, looking at data for the entire world. They found a scattering of warm and cold periods in different places at different times, overall below the level of the recent general warming. It turned out that the supposed Medieval Warm Period had caught the eye of historical climatologists because it was prominent in well-studied parts of the Northern Hemisphere. (Greenland had been particularly warm. The Arctic in general, however, had been mostly cool until the steep rise of the late 20th century.)\nOther critics claimed that the recent warming was simply a \"recovery\" from the Little Ice Age. Studies inspired by the controversy found that the planet had indeed been cooler on average a few centuries ago (probably because of a lull in the Sun's activity along with an unusual spate of volcanic eruptions). But this too was not a striking global phenomenon like the recent warming. Northern continental areas and a few southern regions had been particularly cold, but the Southern Pacific Ocean, tropical Eurasia, and some other areas had been as warm as at present. (48a*)\n<=> Solar variation\nRegardless of what had happened in past centuries, the warming since then was now as certain a fact as anything in science. A few critics continued to seek confirmation of their denial of the warming in data on air temperatures from weather stations and satellites. In particular, former TV weatherman Anthony Watts established a popular website that mobilized people to report continental U.S. weather stations that were poorly located, for example near the exhaust of air conditioners. A study by members of the NOAA National Climatic Data Center separately analyzed the sites that Watts's volunteers identified as faulty, comparing them with the acknowledged good sites. They found that any bias introduced by poor siting had been mostly compensated for by the data reduction, which was designed precisely to remove biases by comparisons over regions and time. But if the raw data only were considered, the poor sites tended to show not a lesser warming than NOAA had reported (as Watts had assumed) but a greater warming. (49)\nIn any case geophysicists noted that the real buildup of heat energy was easily seen, less in the thin and variable atmosphere than in the masses of solid earth sampled by boreholes. Still more unequivocal, the upper layers of water in ocean basins \u2014 which were gradually absorbing most of the heat energy \u2014 showed an increasingly clear pattern of recent warming. (See above and see graph below ). The pattern roughly matched what computer modellers had expected would result from the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the air, but not warming from any other cause. (Submarine volcanoes, for example, would warm from the bottom, but the oceans were warming from the top down.) Deniers found a chance to question this too, when a paper was published in 2006 reporting that the oceans had cooled in the past few years. However, the authors soon announced that they had made an embarrassing mistake in the way theyhad compared the data from older and newer instruments. It was just another example of the difficulties of interpreting science amid an uproar of politicized controversy. (49a)\n=> Public opinion\nTalk radio callers and right-leaning columnists continued to exclaim about one or another unusually cold winter in this or that locality. They pointed out that some regions showed no warming at all, notably the massive Antarctic ice sheet. This was no surprise, but an effect predicted as far back as 1981 by Stephen Schneider and a collaborator. Noting that the Southern Hemisphere was mostly ocean, which would tend to take up heat and delay the rise of atmospheric temperature in the region, they had warned that people \"may still be misled... in the decade A.D. 2000-2010\" by cool weather there. (It turned out, however, that this and later computer studies were too conservative: in the 2000s, regions around Antarctica began to show a bit of warming and significant loss of ice.)\nAs the world-ocean took up heat it delayed the rise of atmospheric temperature for decades. A further time-lag was introduced by the sluggish response of forests and tundra as they adjusted to the changing climate. The system had so much inertia that once the world had warmed to a given level, we were already committed to substantially more warming. Scientists understood this by the end of the 20th century, but most policy-makers had yet to grasp the implications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 another dangerous time-lag. (50)\n<= CO2 greenhouse\nAround 2008 the deniers began to publicize a new claim: the world had supposedly gotten no warmer in the decade since 1998. Indeed that had been an extraordinarily warm year, for a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\" event, the strongest of the century, had pumped some extra heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere. No year since had been noticeably hotter (although 2005, 2008 and 2010 roughly matched it). While the claim excited comment among internet bloggers and a few politicians, the actual scientific literature gave scant attention to such short-term fluctuations, in this case probably caused by a sharp decline in solar activity. (50a) Anyone who looked at the ten-year average of air temperatures near the surface \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was what the weather statistics measured \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would see that the decade 1999-2008 was substantially hotter than the decade before, which was in turn hotter than the preceding decade, and so forth back to the 1970s. Indeed all of the ten warmest years on record had come since 1997.\n=> Public opinion\nThe natural variability of climate could make for a still longer pause in surface warming, like the two decades of fluctuations in the mid-20th century. If that happened again it would give comfort only to those who ignored all the other data on changes in the climate system.In particular, there were now reliable measures of the upper ocean layers. And through the 2000s, as in earlier decades, the heat content of the oceans rose steadily. (51) The people who publicly denied there was any need to worry about global warming were increasingly relying on a narrow, sometimes disingenous, selection of evidence while ignoring all the rest.\nIf you compared the climbing curve of late 20th-century temperatures with the curves produced by computer models that calculated the effects of the rise of greenhouse gases (with adjustments for volcanic eruptions, solar variations and aerosol pollution), the match was close indeed. Temperatures were soaring much as scientists had been predicting, with increasing confidence, for half a century. Few could believe any longer that this was mere coincidence. By now the world\u2019s community of experts had finally agreed, with little dissent, that it was highly likely that the strong global warming seen since the 1970s was in large part the work of humanity. In a 2007 consensus report, the IPCC went on to point to greenhouse warming as a likely cause of the more frequent and more intense summer heat waves and droughts, warmer winters, earlier springs, dwindling glaciers, and other changes in weather patterns that were increasingly seen to be underway... as predicted.

I am on the opposite side of the fence, however. This does not mean that either of us have a \"misguided\" sense of reason, nor does it mean that we are not capable of understanding the truth as it pertains to the science of climate change.\nDeduction is part of the scientific process - one might deduce that if someone is a \"Global Warmer\" they most likely are aware of at least some of the facts you listed in your post, though there is much you left out... I'm assuming for the purposes of keeping it short.\nThe evidence, in my humble opinion, points to man-induced climate change. A bad winter in one part of the world does not mean the rest of the world is experiencing the same below average temperatures. In fact, extreme weather, even blizzards, can be a by-product of above average global temperatures. As far as flooding and blizzards, one might argue that it is due to more moisture in the atmosphere - a product of higher than average temperatures.\nTo claim that because someone believes in the greatest man-made disaster in history that we must be big followers of the media, and therefore we must be a mindless buffoons incapable of conducting research on our own is just plain old fashioned ludicrous.\nHappy New Year!\n09:23 December 27, 2010 by salalah\nHahaha always something to complain about and to turn into a debate!!!\nWhy are there no anti-Swedish or racist remarks this time?\nWhat happened?

However, a warmer \"climate\" means there's more energy in the atmosphere...and these models predict more severe weather (i.e., stronger hurricanes, more of them, and, as we transition to this warmer climate, stronger blizzards and even severe winters in the higher latitudes).\nI'm curious, what sort of \"science\" do you work in that affords you the luxury to ignore what is generally regarded as scientific consensus on the matter? Do you doubt evolution as well? Perhaps the theory of gravity is suspect in your mind??\nHere are data you may find interesting (Source: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change http://www.ipcc.ch/):\n*Of the last 12 years, 11 have ranked among the warmest years since 1850.\nThe warming trend of the last 50 years is nearly double that of the last 100 years, meaning that the rate of warming is increasing.\n*The ocean's temperature has increased at least to depths of 3,000 meters (over 9,800 feet); the ocean absorbs more than 80 percent of all heat added to the climate system.\n*Glaciers and snow cover have decreased in regions both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, which has contributed to the rise of sea levels.\n*Average Arctic temperatures increased by nearly twice the global average rate over the last 100 years (the IPCC also noted that Arctic temperatures have are highly variable from decade to decade).\n*The area covered by frozen ground in the Arctic has decreased by approximately 7 percent since 1900, with seasonal decreases of up to 15 percent.\n*Precipitation has increased in eastern regions of the Americas, northern Europe and parts of Asia; other regions such as the Mediterranean and southern Africa have experienced drying trends.\n*Westerly winds have been growing stronger.\n*Droughts are more intense, have lasted longer and covered larger areas than in the past.\n*There have been significant changes in extreme temperatures -- hot days and heat waves have become more frequent while cold days and nights have become less frequent.\n*While scientists have not observed an increase in the number of tropical storms, they have observed an increase in the intensity of such storms in the Atlantic correlated with a rise in ocean surface temperatures.\nAlso, during the last 100 years, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen from 290 parts per million (ppm) to 369 ppm, with strong evidence pointing to the burning of fossil fuels as a primary cause of these increases.

You can view the segment by going here . These complex computer models are an important part of developing adaptation strategies at the regional and someday even local level. And they become even more useful (and policy-relevant) when we focus on timescales over the next several decades. Because the strengths and weaknesses of these models are at the heart of how we plan climate adaptation strategies, we wanted to take this opportunity to drill down and provide some background on what these models are and provide a frank discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.\nA climate model is essentially a 'twin earth'. It's a handy way to run experiments on the planet and see how variables like temperature and precipitation change over time when we add things like CO2 to our atmosphere. These models represent the surface of the Earth, the depth of the oceans and the layers of the atmosphere as a set of regularly shaped boxes. Thinking for simplicity only about the surface of the Earth, just imagine taking the globe and overlaying it with a mesh grid and you can get a pretty good sense of what it looks like. (see picture ).\nCalculations are performed within each grid cell that represent how that area reacts to the winds, the sun, the surface, and the amount of GHG's. These models serve as a way to fast forward in time and project how much warmer (or wetter) things could get in the future. Climate models are designed to simulate the decade-to-decade evolution of climate, but not to predict precisely what a single day will look like - they are different in that sense from weather forecast models.\nHere is the map that we presented in the broadcast of the difference (in degrees F) between July temperatures by 2050 and the current July climatology. These temperature differences presented were calculated by averaging together the output of twenty Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations of the Earth's future temperature assuming that greenhouse gases will continue to rise.\nModel Resolution and Uncertainty\nThe resolution of these models is determined by the size of the squares (we refer to them as grid cells) overlaid on the globe. The current generation of models uses grid cells of about 120 by 120 miles (200 x 200 km) in size. They are this size mainly because of computing resource constraints. The smaller the grid cells, the higher the resolution. Computing power continues to increase, and the next generation of models that will be using smaller cells for their grids. Because of current constraints, however, the models have to approximate processes that can't be simulated explicitly because they are happening \u00c2\u00c2\u0091within the grid cell'. Atmospheric convection, is a good example, since we all know that a thunderstorm cloud does not generally span hundreds of kilometers in size.\nApproximations inevitably introduce uncertainty, but that is why we take an average of 20 climate model projections (called an 'ensemble'). Different models will use different solutions to approximate what they cannot represent directly in each grid box, and as a result, they project different degrees of warming. This ensemble approach is a way to start working towards a probability distribution of the changes in store, in other words, to get at the statistics of what the possible future temperature range looks like, and hence what might be more or less likely to occur. If we are pressed to present a single estimate, choosing the ensemble average is a way of relying on the consensus of these models, rather than on any single one. The assumption is that the approximation errors among models tend to cancel each other when we average their projections, and the common, most robust tendencies are thus brought out.\nAs mentioned in the video piece, the rise in greenhouse gases was determined by what is known as the \"A1B scenario\". This scenario has concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) increasing from 385 parts per million (ppm) today to 600+ ppm by 2050, hypothesizing a rate of increase of 1.7% per year. This can be viewed as an optimistic pathway for future emissions because of the recent acceleration in the rate of greenhouse gases emissions at the global scale from 1.3% in the decade 1990-1999 to 3.3% between 2000 and 2006. If this recent increase in the pace at which we emit continues, i.e., were we to follow a \"business as usual\" scenario, we would find ourselves well beyond the 600 ppm concentration level by 2050.\nThus an important source of uncertainty is the actual quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG's) present in the atmosphere by 2050. But because the temperature response to these gases builds up slowly (and in fact a lot of the warming we are likely to experience is already built in the system because of our past and current emissions), the effect of GHG's in the atmosphere by 2050 is actually quite similar across the different emissions scenarios . But by 2100, the effects vary widely because the atmosphere has had ample time to respond to the GHG forcing, which varies significantly depending on the emission pathway. This highlights the difficulty of predicting, responding and limiting man-made climate change in that its effects are happening on long timescales, and this makes our choices today play out very slowly over time as well.\nOne thing we'd like to caution is that this is not a map of the exact difference in temperature between July 2008 and July 2050. Specifically, the map shows the difference between the average temperature during two periods of time; in other words two 20-year means, one centered around 1990, and one centered around 2050, what we call \"climatologies\". Also, do not think of this as a fine resolution map that we should trust blindly over regions of complex topography (mountains and coastline which create microclimates). Rather, think of these maps as hopefully robust estimates. Finally, as we already pointed out, the map is an average future of what twenty models project if we follow a particular path. It is not a definitive prediction, but a glimpse of a potential future.\nWhy Do We Have Confidence in Them?\nThese models are approximations, but they are a collection of much of what we know about how the climate system works. The models have gone through decades of incremental developments, tests and validation. They reproduce many aspects of changes in the climate that have occurred so far, or that happened during natural experiments, which gives us confidence that they are capturing the key forces at play going into the future. This is especially true of their simulations of temperature, which changes relatively smoothly and gradually over time and space, at least at the where decadal averages are concerned.\nAll models unanimously agree that warming is part of our future, i.e., this map of average warming does not hide any model disagreement in terms of the overall direction of temperature change. There is more disagreement for changes in rainfall, which in some regions of the world are so uncertain that some models predict increases and some models predict decreases in the amount of precipitation for a given region. And, if anything, scientists are worried that the range of warming displayed by this ensemble of models has a lower upper limit compared to what could actually happen because of the many complexities that models don't yet include -- such as the response of the vegetation to climate change.\nLocal Warming\nThe US July difference map shows that the Midwest and West are the most dramatic hot spots. Temperatures there are expected to rise roughly four to five degrees. The reason is because high pressure sets up and dominates in these regions. We mentioned in the video piece this is consistent with what we've already seen over the past 30 to 40 years. Here is a look at how July temperatures averaged over the period 1998 to 2007 (the most recent decade) compared to July average temperatures from 1968 to 1996.\"\nWe also presented a closer look at three specific cities: New York, Kansas City, KS and Boise, Idaho. The average high temperature in July in New York City today is 84 degrees but by the year 2050 it jumps up to 88 degrees. For Kansas City, July average high temperatures today are 88 degrees but by 2050 they're up five degrees. And for Boise, Idaho, you go from an average high of 90 all the way to 96 degrees, a six-degree difference.\nWe produced this comparison by looking at the changes in mean temperature in the grid box where each city is located. Other climate processes too detailed to be represented in such boxes may influence temperature in big cities; in particular, the effect of the urban heat island. Of course, that would likely enhance the degree of warming projected here.\nEven by imposing changes in mean temperatures onto the current maximum temperature to project changes in these \"extremes\" we may be acting in a conservative manner. This is all about the statistical characteristics of the temperature records at a location, whose distribution, when collected over time, would look like a bell-shaped curve around a mean value. The way we are estimating changes in maximum temperatures, which are the measurements falling in the right tail of the bell-shaped curve, is to assume that the change in mean temperature will simply shift the entire distribution to the right, without changing its shape. Studies have indicated that these extreme changes may actually take on a life of their own, with changes in variability (the width of the bell-shaped curve) adding back on to changes in the mean. If that is true, the tail of the distribution is not just shifting but stretching to the right, making higher temperatures more and more likely. So, we caution against taking these projected changes in max temperatures too literally, but if anything we would bet on them being conservative estimates.\nPosted at 11:11 am ET\n"}, {"score": 1003.60114, "uuid": "6017efbf-97aa-5507-8171-19bba9374dd3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800wb-47-22321", "target_hostname": "metofficenews.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/tag/temperature/", "page_rank": 2.8095626e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>temperature</em> \u00ab Met Office News Blog", "snippet": "To give an idea of how warm it would have to be to break records, <em>the</em> warmest <em>temperature</em> <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> in December <em>is</em> 18.3 deg C at Achnashellach, Highland, <em>on</em> 2 December 1948.

Analysing these structures could help to determine the forces that shape our Galaxy and trigger star formation. The images are a scientific by-product of a mission which will ultimately provide the best picture ever of the early Universe.\nPlanck images a galactic web of cold dust\n(Credit: ESA / HFI Consortium / IRAS)\nDr David Parker, Director of Space Science and Exploration at the British National Space Centre (BNSC), said, \u201cLess than a year since it was launched, Planck is producing some spectacular results. The Planck spacecraft is just one of a family of cutting edge scientific missions in which the UK is already playing a major role. I'm looking forward to fresh discoveries and continued involvement in such exciting missions with the forthcoming creation of a UK executive space agency.\u201d\nESA\u2019s Planck satellite \u2013 the first European mission designed to study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - has begun the second of four full-sky surveys, which will ultimately provide the most detailed information yet about the size, mass, age, geometry, composition and fate of the Universe. Although the primary goal of Planck is to map the CMB, by surveying the entire sky with an unprecedented combination of frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity, Planck will also provide valuable data for a broad range of studies in astrophysics. This is clearly demonstrated in the new images which trace the cold dust in our Galaxy and reveal the large-scale structure of the interstellar medium filling the Milky Way.\nOne of the key advantages of Planck is its ability to measure the temperature of the coldest dust particles and locate the coldest dusty clumps in the Galaxy, areas where star formation is about to occur. Image 1 demonstrates how Planck measures this cold dust: reddish tones correspond to temperatures as cold as 12 degrees above absolute zero, and whitish tones to much warmer ones (a few tens of degrees) in regions where massive stars are currently forming. As the clumps shrink, they become denser and better at shielding their interiors from light and other radiation. This allows them to cool more easily and collapse faster. Planck excels at detecting these dusty clumps across the whole sky and contributes the crucial information required to measure accurately the temperature of dust at these large scales.\n\u201cWhat makes these structures have these particular shapes is not well understood,\u201d says Jan Tauber, ESA Project Scientist for Planck. The denser parts are called molecular clouds while the more diffuse parts are \u2018cirrus\u2019. They consist of both dust and gas, although the gas does not show up directly in this image. There are many forces at work in the Galaxy to help shape the molecular clouds and cirrus into these filamentary patterns. For example, on large scales the Galaxy rotates, creating spiral patterns of stars, dust, and gas. Gravity exerts an important influence, pulling on the dust and gas. Radiation and particle jets from stars push the dust and gas around on smaller scales, and magnetic fields also play a role, although to what extent is presently unclear.\nThe space between stars is not empty but rather is filled with clouds of dust and gas, intimately mixed together and known as the \u201cinterstellar medium\u201d. Image 2, covers the same region as image 1: about 55 degrees across and looking in the direction of the centre of our Galaxy. The plane of the Galaxy is seen as the horizontal band across the bottom of the image. Above the plane, the filamentary structure of the interstellar medium in the solar neighbourhood (within a few hundred light years of the Sun) can be seen.\nFilamentary structures are apparent at large and small-scales in the Milky Way.\n(Credit: ESA / HFI Consortium. Credits for inset: ESA / SPIRE and PACS consortia / P. Andr\u00e9 (CEA Saclay) for the Gould\u2019s Belt Key Programme Consortium)\nThe image on the left in image 2 shows a typical \u201cstellar nursery\u201d (about 3 degrees across) in the constellation of Aquila, recently imaged by the Herschel Space Observatory. The filamentary structures seen at the smallest scales by Herschel are strikingly similar in appearance to those seen at the largest scales by Planck.\nThe richness of the structure that is observed, and the way in which small and large scales are interconnected, provide important clues to the physical mechanisms underpinning the formation of stars and of galaxies. This example illustrates the synergy between Herschel and Planck; together these missions are imaging both the large-scale and the small-scale structure of our Galaxy.\nDr David Clements from Imperial College London, said, \"These wonderful new images from Planck clearly show its power for revealing new things about the universe. We always knew there would be a lot of great new science found as we peeled away the layers of the cosmic onion to reach the microwave background, and these results demonstrate that happening in our own galaxy. What I hadn't really grasped was just how beautiful the Planck foreground images were going to be!\"\nTom Bradshaw from the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u2019s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) added, \u201cPlanck is a satellite designed to measure the temperature of deep space to unprecedented accuracy. The technology to achieve this has been under development for over 15 years. A significant part of this was developed in the UK. After all the hard work that has been put into what is probably one of the most complex satellites ever flown, it is gratifying to see such stunning images that will help us understand our place in the universe.\u201d\nNotes to editors\nImages and captions\nImage 1 : Planck\u2019s ability to measure the temperature of the coldest dust particles will provide an important indicator of the physical processes at play in the interstellar medium, and in regions of star formation.\nThe image above covers a portion of the sky about 55 degrees across. It is a three-colour combination constructed from Planck\u2019s two shortest wavelength channels (540 and 350 micrometres, corresponding to frequencies of 545 and 857 GHz respectively), and an image at 100 micrometres obtained with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). This combination effectively traces the dust temperature: reddish tones correspond to temperatures as cold as 12 degrees above absolute zero, and whitish tones to significantly warmer ones (a few tens of degrees above absolute zero) in regions where massive stars are currently forming. Overall, the image shows local dust structures within 500 light years of the Sun.\nThis Planck image was obtained during the first Planck all-sky survey which began in mid-August 2009. By mid-March 2010 more than 98% of the sky had been observed by Planck.

Because of the way Planck surveys the sky, the last bit of the first scan will be completed by late-May 2010. Planck will gather data until the end of 2012, during which time it will complete four sky scans. A first batch of astronomy data, called the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue, is scheduled for release in January 2011. To arrive at the main cosmology results will require about two years of data processing and analysis. The first set of processed data will be made available to the worldwide scientific community towards the end of 2012.\nESA\u2019s Herschel space telescope can be used to study cold regions in detail, but only Planck can find them all over the sky. Launched together in May 2009, Planck and Herschel are both studying the coolest components of the Universe. Planck looks at large structures, while Herschel can make detailed observations of smaller structures, such as nearby star-forming regions.\nThe HFI data were recorded as part of Planck\u2019s first all-sky survey at microwave wavelengths. As the spacecraft rotates, its instruments sweep across the sky. During every rotation, they cross the Milky Way twice. Thus, in the course of Planck\u2019s mission to precisely map the afterglow of the big bang, it is also producing exquisite maps of the Galaxy.\nUK role in Planck\nThe UK is playing a major role in the Planck mission, with funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). The UK is the second largest financial contributor to the ESA Science Programme which builds and launches space missions such as Planck using leading-edge technology from the UK space industry. In addition, STFC has invested \u00a317.4M to build instrumentation for Planck.\nA number of UK institutes and companies form part of the consortium building the two focal plane instruments, HFI and LFI. The Jodrell Bank Observatory at The University of Manchester has produced critical elements of the LFI receiver modules. Cardiff University, STFC RAL and SEA have been involved with hardware development for HFI, while various UK research groups including Imperial College London and University of Cambridge form the London Planck Analysis Centre and Cambridge Planck Analysis Centre. These groups are involved with data analysis and simulation for the HFI data analysis and simulation software.\nMore information can be found in the\n"}, {"score": 947.71545, "uuid": "8d98f370-2e42-5613-bb4d-ecd71e011f03", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-64-01978", "target_hostname": "www.realclimate.org", "target_uri": "http://www.realclimate.org/?p=196", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "RealClimate: Global warming <em>on</em> <em>Earth</em>", "snippet": "everything that has <em>ever</em> happened <em>and</em> could <em>ever</em> happen into \u201cnatural\u201d events.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u2014 gavin @ 13 October 2005 - (\n)\nThe Washington Post picked up on the latest update to the 2005 temperature anomaly analysis from NASA GISS .

When the thermal changes have stopped, we say that the two objects (physicists define them more rigorously as systems) are in thermal equilibrium. We can then define the temperature of the system by saying that the temperature is that quantity which is the same for both systems when they are in thermal equilibrium.\nIf we experiment further with more than two systems, we find that many systems can be brought into thermal equilibrium with each other; thermal equilibrium does not depend on the kind of object used. Put more precisely, if two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they must also be in thermal equilibrium with each other, and they all have the same temperature regardless of the kind of systems they are. The statement in italics, called the zeroth law of thermodynamics may be restated as follows:\nIf three or more systems are in thermal contact with each other and all in equilibrium together, then any two taken separately are in equilibrium with one another.\nNow one of the three systems could be an instrument calibrated to measure the temperature - i.e. a thermometer. When a calibrated thermometer is put in thermal contact with a system and reaches thermal equilibrium, we then have a quantitative measure of the temperature of the system. For example, a mercury-in-glass clinical thermometer is put under the tongue of a patient and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in the patient's mouth - we then see by how much the silvery mercury has expanded in the stem and read the scale of the thermometer to find the patient's temperature.\nWhat is a Thermometer?\nA thermometer is an instrument that measures the temperature of a system in a quantitative way. The easiest way to do this is to find a substance having a property that changes in a regular way with its temperature. The most direct 'regular' way is a linear one: t(x) = ax + b\nWhere \"T\" is the temperature of the substance and changes as the property x of the substance changes. The constants a and b depend on the substance used and may be evaluated by specifying two temperature points on the scale, such as 32\u00b0 for the freezing point of water and 212\u00b0 for its boiling point.\nFor example, the element mercury is liquid in the temperature range of -38.9\u00b0 C to 356.7\u00b0 C (we'll discuss the Celsius \u00b0 C scale later). As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.\nThe mercury-in-glass thermometer illustrated in the above figure contains a bulb filled with mercury that is allowed to expand into a capillary. Its rate of expansion is calibrated on the glass scale.\nThe Development of Thermometers and Temperature Scales\nThe historical highlights in the development of thermometers and their scales given here are based on \"Temperature\" by T. J. Quinn and \"Heat\" by James M. Cork. One of the first attempts to make a standard temperature scale occurred about AD 170, when Galen, in his medical writings, proposed a standard \"neutral\" temperature made up of equal quantities of boiling water and ice; on either side of this temperature were four degrees of heat and four degrees of cold, respectively.\nThe earliest devices used to measure the temperature were called Thermoscopes.\nThey consisted of a glass bulb having a long tube extending downward into a container of colored water, although Galileo in 1610 is supposed to have used wine. Some of the air in the bulb was expelled before placing it in the liquid, causing the liquid to rise into the tube. As the remaining air in the bulb was heated or cooled, the level of the liquid in the tube would vary reflecting the change in the air temperature. An engraved scale on the tube allowed for a quantitative measure of the fluctuations. The air in the bulb is referred to as the thermometric medium, i.e. the medium whose property changes with temperature. In 1641, the first sealed thermometer that used liquid rather than air as the thermometric medium was developed for Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His thermometer used a sealed alcohol-in-glass device, with 50 \"degree\" marks on its stem but no \"fixed point\" was used to zero the scale. These were referred to as \"spirit\" thermometers. Robert Hook, Curator of the Royal Society, in 1664 used a red dye in the alcohol . His scale, for which every degree represented an equal increment of volume equivalent to about 1/500 part of the volume of the thermometer liquid, needed only one fixed point. He selected the freezing point of water. By scaling it in this way, Hook showed that a standard scale could be established for thermometers of a variety of sizes. Hook's original thermometer became known as the standard of Gresham College and was used by the Royal Society until 1709.\nIn 1702, the astronomer Ole Roemer of Copenhagen based his scale upon two fixed points: snow (or crushed ice) and the boiling point of water, and he recorded the daily temperatures at Copenhagen in 1708- 1709 with this thermometer. It was in 1724 that Gabriel Fahrenheit, an instrument maker of D\u00e4anzig and Amsterdam, used mercury as the thermometric liquid. Mercury's thermal expansion is large and fairly uniform, it does not adhere to the glass, and it remains a liquid over a wide range of temperatures. Its silvery appearance makes it easy to read.\nFahrenheit described how he calibrated the scale of his mercury Thermometer:\n\"placing the thermometer in a mixture of sal ammoniac or sea salt, ice, and water a point on the scale will be found which is denoted as zero. A second point is obtained if the same mixture is used without salt. Denote this position as 30. A third point, designated as 96, is obtained if the thermometer is placed in the mouth so as to acquire the heat of a healthy man.\" (D. G. Fahrenheit,Phil. Trans. (London) 33, 78, 1724)\nOn this scale, Fahrenheit measured the boiling point of water to be 212. Later he adjusted the freezing point of water to 32 so that the interval between the boiling and freezing points of water could be represented by the more rational number 180. Temperatures measured on this scale are designated as degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F). In 1745, Carolus Linnaeus of Upsula, Sweden, described a scale in which the freezing point of water was zero, and the boiling point 100, making it a centigrade (one hundred steps) scale. Anders Celsius (1701-1744) used the reverse scale in which 100 represented the freezing point and zero the boiling point of water, still, of course, with 100 degrees between the two defining points.\nIn 1948 use of the Centigrade scale was dropped in favor of a new scale using degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). The Celsius scale is defined by the following two items that will be discussed later in this essay:\n(1) The triple point of water is defined to be 0.01\u00b0C\n(2) A degree Celsius equals the same temperature change as a degree on the ideal-gas scale.\nOn the Celsius scale the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 99.975\u00b0C in contrast to the 100 degrees defined by the Centigrade scale.\nTo convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32. (\u00b0F = 1.8\u00b0C + 32 )\nIn 1780, J. A. C. Charles, a French physician, showed that for the same increase in temperature, all gases exhibited the same increase in volume. Because the expansion coefficient of gases is so very nearly the same, it is possible to establish a temperature scale based on a single fixed point rather than the two fixed- point scales, such as the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. This brings us back to a thermometer that uses a gas as the thermometric medium.\nIn a constant volume gas thermometer a large bulb B of gas, hydrogen for example, under a set pressure connects with a mercury-filled \"manometer\" by means of a tube of very small volume. (The Bulb B is the temperature-sensing portion and should contain almost all of the hydrogen). The level of mercury at C may be adjusted by raising or lowering the mercury reservoir R. The pressure of the hydrogen gas, which is the \"x\" variable in the linear relation with temperature, is the difference between the levels D and C plus the pressure above D.\nP. Chappuis in 1887, conducted extensive studies of gas thermometers with constant pressure or with constant volume using hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide as the thermometric medium. Based on his results, the Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures adopted the constant-volume hydrogen scale based on fixed points at the ice point (0\u00b0C) and the steam point (100\u00b0C) as the practical scale for international meteorology. Experiments with gas thermometers have shown that there is very little difference in the temperature scale for different gases. Thus, it is possible to set up a temperature scale that is independent of the thermometric medium if it is a gas at low pressure. In this case, all gases behave like an \"Ideal Gas\" and have a very simple relation between their pressure, volume, and temperature pV= (constant)T.\nThis temperature is called the thermodynamic temperature and is now accepted as the fundamental measure of temperature. Note that there is a naturally-defined zero on this scale - it is the point at which the pressure of an ideal gas is zero, making the temperature also zero. We will continue a discussion of \"absolute zero\" in a later section. With this as one point on the scale, only one other fixed point need be defined. In 1933, the International Committee of Weights and Measures adopted this fixed point as the triple point of water, the temperature at which water, ice, and water vapor coexist in equilibrium); its value is set as 273.16. The unit of temperature on this scale is called the kelvin, after Lord Kelvin (William Thompson), 1824-1907, and its symbol is K (no degree symbol used). To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, add 273. Formula+ K = \u00b0C + 273. Thermodynamic temperature is the fundamental temperature; its unit is the kelvin which is defined as the fraction 1 / 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\nSir William Siemens, in 1871, proposed a thermometer whose thermometric medium is a metallic conductor whose resistance changes with temperature. The element platinum does not oxidize at high temperatures and has a relatively uniform change in resistance with temperature over a large range. The Platinum Resistance Thermometer is now widely used as a thermoelectric thermometer and covers the temperature range from about -260\u00b0C to 1235\u00b0C. Several temperatures were adopted as Primary reference points so as to define the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968. The International Temperature Scale of 1990 was adopted by the International Committee of Weights and Measures at its meeting in 1989. Between 0.65K and 5.0K, the temperature is defined in terms of the vapor pressure - temperature relations of the isotopes of helium. Between 3.0K and the triple point of neon (24.5561K) the temperature is defined by means of a helium gas thermometer. Between the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033K) and the freezing point of silver (961.78\u00b0\u00b0C) the temperature is defined by means of platinum resistance thermometers. Above the freezing point of silver the temperature is defined in terms of the Planck radiation law.\nT. J. Seebeck, in 1826, discovered that when wires of different metals are fused at one end and heated, a current flows from one to the other. The electromotive force generated can be quantitatively related to the temperature and hence, the system can be used as a thermometer - known as a thermocouple. The thermocouple is used in industry and many different metals are used - platinum and platinum/rhodium, nickel-chromium and nickel-aluminum, for example. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains databases for standardizing thermometers. For the measurement of very low temperatures, the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic substance is used as the thermometric physical quantity. For some substances, the magnetic susceptibility varies inversely as the temperature. Crystals such as cerrous magnesium nitrate and chromic potassium alum have been used to measure temperatures down to 0.05 K; these crystals are calibrated in the liquid helium range.\nThis diagram and the last illustration in this text were taken from the Low Temperature Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology's picture archive. For these very low, and even lower, temperatures, the thermometer is also the mechanism for cooling. Several low-temperature laboratories conduct interesting applied and theoretical research on how to reach the lowest possible temperatures and how work at these temperatures may find application.\nHeat and Thermodynamics\nPrior to the 19th century, it was believed that the sense of how hot or cold an object felt was determined by how much \"heat\" it contained. Heat was envisioned as a liquid that flowed from a hotter to a colder object; this weightless fluid was called \"caloric\", and until the writings of Joseph Black (1728-1799), no distinction was made between heat and temperature. Black distinguished between the quantity (caloric) and the intensity (temperature) of heat.\nSource of Heat which is Excited by Friction\". Rumford had noticed the large amount of heat generated when a cannon was drilled. He doubted that a material substance was flowing into the cannon and concluded \"it appears to me to be extremely difficult if not impossible to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited and communicated in the manner the heat was excited and communicated in these experiments except motion.\"\nBut it was not until J. P. Joule published a definitive paper in 1847 that the the caloric idea was abandoned. Joule conclusively showed that heat was a form of energy. As a result of the experiments of Rumford, Joule, and others, it was demonstrated (explicitly stated by Helmholtz in 1847), that the various forms of energy can be transformed one into another. When heat is transformed into any other form of energy, or when other forms of energy are transformed into heat, the total amount of energy (heat plus other forms) in the system is constant.\nThis is the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy. To express it another way: it is in no way possible either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other means, to obtain a perpetual motion machine; i.e., one that creates its own energy (except in the fantasy world of Maurits Escher's \"Waterfall\"!) A second statement may also be made about how machines operate. A steam engine uses a source of heat to produce work. Is it possible to completely convert the heat energy into work, making it a 100% efficient machine? The answer is to be found in the second law of thermodynamics: No cyclic machine can convert heat energy wholly into other forms of energy. It is not possible to construct a cyclic machine that does nothing but withdraw heat energy and convert it into mechanical energy.\nThe second law of thermodynamics implies the irreversibility of certain processes - that of converting all heat into mechanical energy, although it is possible to have a cyclic machine that does nothing but convert mechanical energy into heat!\nSadi Carnot (1796-1832) conducted theoretical studies of the efficiencies of heat engines (a machine which converts some of its heat into useful work). He was trying to model the most efficient heat engine possible. His theoretical work provided the basis for practical improvements in the steam engine and also laid the foundations of thermodynamics. He described an ideal engine, called the Carnot engine, that is the most efficient way an engine can be constructed. He showed that the efficiency of such an engine is given by efficiency = 1 - T\"/T'.\nWhere the temperatures, T' and T\" , are the hot and cold \"reservoirs\" , respectively, between which the machine operates. On this temperature scale, a heat engine whose coldest reservoir is zero degrees would operate with 100% efficiency. This is one definition of absolute zero, and it can be shown to be identical to the absolute zero we discussed previously. The temperature scale is called the absolute, the thermodynamic , or the kelvin scale.\nThe way that the gas temperature scale and the thermodynamic temperature scale are shown to be identical is based on the microscopic interpretation of temperature, which postulates that the macroscopic measurable quantity called temperature is a result of the random motions of the microscopic particles that make up a system.\nThe Kinetic Theory-\nThis brief summary is abridged from a more detailed discussion to be found in Quinn's \"Temperature\"...\nAbout the same time that thermodynamics was evolving James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) and Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906) developed a theory describing the way molecules moved - molecular dynamics. The molecules that make up a perfect gas move about, colliding with each other like billiard balls and bouncing off the surface of the container holding the gas. The energy associated with motion is called Kinetic Energy and this kinetic approach to the behavior of ideal gases led to an interpretation of the concept of temperature on a microscopic scale. The amount of kinetic energy each molecule has is a function of its velocity; for the large number of molecules in a gas (even at low pressure), there should be a range of velocities at any instant of time. The magnitude of the velocities of the various particles should vary greatly - no two particles should be expected to have the exact same velocity. Some may be moving very fast; others, quite slowly.\nMaxwell found that he could represent the distribution of velocities statistically by a function known as the Maxwellian Distribution. The collisions of the molecules with their container gives rise to the pressure of the gas. By considering the average force exerted by the molecular collisions on the wall, Boltzmann was able to show that the average kinetic energy of the molecules was directly comparable to the measured pressure, and the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the pressure. From Boyles' Law, we know that the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature, therefore, it was shown that the kinetic energy of the molecules related directly to the temperature of the gas. A simple relation holds for this: average kinetic energy of molecules=3kT/2,\nwhere k is the Boltzmann Constant. Temperature is a measure of the energy of thermal motion and, at a temperature of zero, the energy reaches a minimum (quantum mechanically, the zero-point motion remains at 0 K).\nIn July, 1995, physicists in Boulder, Colo.achieved a temperature far lower than has ever been produced before and created an entirely new state of matter predicted decades ago by Albert Einsteinand Satyendra Nath Bose. The press release describes the nature of this experiment and a full description of this phenomenon is described by the University of Colorado's BEC Homepage.\nDealing with a system which contained huge numbers of molecules requires a statistical approach to the problem. About 1902, J. W. Gibbs (1839-1903) introduced statistical mechanics with which he demonstrated how average values of the properties of a system could be predicted from an analysis of the most probable values of these properties found from a large number of identical systems (called an ensemble). Again, in the statistical mechanical interpretation of thermodynamics, the key parameter is identified with a temperature which can be directly linked to the thermodynamic temperature, with the temperature of Maxwell's distribution,and with the perfect gas law.\nTemperature becomes a quantity definable either in terms of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work, or, with equal validity and identical results, in terms of a quantity which characterized the energy distribution among the particles in a system.With this understanding of the concept of temperature, it is possible to explain how heat (thermal energy) flows from one body to another. Thermal energy is carried by the molecules in the form of their motions and some of it, through molecular collisions, is transferred to molecules of a second object when put in contact with it. This mechanism for transferring thermal energy by contact is called conduction.\nA second mechanism of heat transport is illustrated by a pot of water set to boil on a stove - hotter water closest to the flame will rise to mix with cooler water near the top of the pot. Convection involves the bodily movement of the more energetic molecules in a liquid or gas. The third way that heat energy can be transferred from one body to another is by radiation; this is the way that the sun warms the earth. The radiation flows from the sun to the earth, where some of it is absorbed, heating the surface.\nA major dilemma in physics since the time of Newton was how to explain the nature of this radiation.\nThermal Radiation-\nThe nature of radiation has puzzled scientists for centuries. Maxwell proposed that this form of energy travels as a vibratory electric and magnetic disturbance through space in a direction perpendicular to those disturbances.\nIn the diagram, the electric (red) and magnetic (blue) oscillations are orthogonal to each other - the electric lying in the xy plane; the magnetic, in the xz plane. The wave is traveling in the x direction. An electromagnetic wave can be defined in terms of the frequency of its oscillation, designated by the Greek letter nu (v). The wave moves in a straight line with with a constant speed (designated as c if it is moving through a vacuum); the distance between successive 'peaks' of the wave is the wavelength, ,of the wave and is equal to its speed divided by its frequency. The electromagnetic spectrum covers an enormous range in wavelengths, from very short waves to very long ones.\nThe only region of the electromagnetic spectrum to which our eye is sensitive is the \"visible\" range identified in the diagram by the rainbow colors.\nThe sun is not the only object that provides radiant energy; any object whose temperature is greater than 0 K will emit some radiant energy. The challenge to scientists was to show how this radiant energy is related to the temperature of the object.\nIf an object is placed in a container whose walls are at a uniform temperature, we expect the object to come into thermal equilibrium with the walls of the enclosure and the object should emit radiant energy just like the walls of the container. Such an object absorbs and radiates the same amount of energy. Now a blackened surface absorbs all radiation incident upon it and it must radiate in the same manner if it is in thermal equilibrium. Equilibrium thermal radiation is therefore called black body radiation.\nThe first relation between temperature and radiant energy was deduced by J. Stefan in 1884 and theoretically explained by Boltzmann about the same time. It states: where the total energy is per unit area per second emitted by the back body, T is its absolute (thermodynamic) temperature and is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe great question at the turn of the century was to explain the way this total radiant energy emitted by a black body was spread out into the various frequencies or wavelengths of the radiation. Maxwell's \"classical\" theory of electromagnetic oscillators failed to explain the observed brightness distribution. It was left to Max Planck to solve the dilemma by showing that the energy of the oscillators must be quantized, i.e. the energies can not take any value but must change in steps, the size of each step, or quantum, is proportional to the frequency of the oscillator and equal to hv, where h is the Planck constant. With this assumption, Planck derived the brightness distribution of a black body and showed that it is defined by its temperature. Once the temperature of a black body is specified, the Planck law can be used to calculate the intensity of the light emitted by the body as a function of wavelength. Conversely, if the brightness distribution of a radiating body is measured, then, by fitting a Planck curve to it, its temperature can be determined.\nThe curves illustrated below show that the hotter the body is, the brighter it is at shorter wavelengths. The surface temperature of the sun is 6000\u00b0K, and its Planck curve peaks in the visible wavelength range. For bodies cooler than the sun, the peak of the Planck curve shifts to longer wavelengths, until a temperature is reached such that very little radiant energy is emitted in the visible range.\nThis figure (adapted from Adkins' \"Thermal Physics\") shows several Planck curves for black bodies. The Intensity is in units of energy per unit area per unit solid angle per unit time per unit wavelength interval. The broken line illustrates the variation with wavelength and temperature of the peaks of the curves.\nThis is a graphical representation of Wien's law, which states: (max) ~ 0.29/T,\nWhere (max) is the wavelength of maximum brightness in cm and T is the absolute temperature of the black body. The human body has a temperature of about 310\u00b0K and radiates primarily in the far infrared. If a photograph of a human is taken with a camera sensitive to this wavelength region, we get a \"thermal\" picture. This picture is courtesy of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA. A page developed by Compix gives a fine description of thermal images and their uses.\nJohn E. Will has pointed to several thermal images obtained during research in antenna pattern measurements, as another example of the use of thermal images.\n3 K - The Temperature of the Universe\nThe sun and stars emit thermal radiation covering all wavelengths; other objects in the sky, like the great clouds of gas in the Milky Way, also emit thermal radiation but are much cooler. These objects are best detected by infrared and radio telescopes - telescopes whose detectors are sensitive to the longer wavelengths.\nIn 1965,Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were conducting a careful calibration of their radio telescope at the Bell Laboratory at Whippany, New Jersey. The found that their receiver showed a \"noise\" pattern as if it were inside a container whose temperature was 3K - i.e. as if it were in equilibrium with a black body at 3 K. This \"noise\" seemed to be coming from every direction. Earlier theoretical predictions by George Gamow and other astrophysicists had predicted the existence of a cosmic 3 K background. Penzias' and Wilson's discovery was the observational confirmation of the isotropic radiation from the Universe, believed to be a relic of the \"Big Bang\". The enormous thermal energy released during the creation of the universe began to cool as the universe expanded. Some 12 billion years later, we are in a universe that radiates like a black body now cooled to 3 K. In 1978 Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for this discovery.\nA black body at 3 K emits most of its energy in the microwave wavelength range. Molecules in the earth's atmosphere absorb this radiation so that from the ground, astronomers cannot make observations in this wavelength region. In 1989 the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, was launched to measure the diffuse infrared and microwave radiation from the early universe. One of its instruments, the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) compared the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation with a precise blackbody.\nThe cosmic microwave background spectrum was measured with a precision of 0.03% and it fit precisely with a black body of temperature 2.726 K. Even though there are billions of stars in the universe, these precise COBE measurements show that 99.97% of the radiant energy of the Universe was released within the first year after the Big Bang itself and now resides in this thermal 3 K radiation field.\nA more detailed explanation of the origin of the microwave background radiation, and itspossible anisotropy, may be found here. A new mission selected by NASA is the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) will measure the small fluctuations in the background radiation and will yield more information on the details of the early universe. The European Space Agency has a similar mission planned.\nSummary\nThe concept of temperature is as fundamental a physical concept as the three fundamental quantities of mechanics - mass, length, and time. Through the study of such practical problems as how to make a highly efficient steam engine, fundamental physical theories emerge, including the concepts of the quantum theory and the two laws of thermodynamics. The second law, with its irreversibility requirement, predicts an inevitable evolution from other forms of energy into heat. It is the second law alone that provides an \"arrow\" for the concept of time.\nWe can record events (illustration from Low Temperature Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology)that cover 18 orders of magnitude in the temperature range, and we have one clearly defined lower limit to the temperature, absolute zero. Because of this 10-with-18-zeros-behind-it range in temperatures, there are many different kinds of thermometers developed to explore it and many different fields of research.\nOne of the beauties of \"publishing\" on the web is the interactive element it offers. Joachim Reinhardt has written to point out that the highest temperatures that are accessible on earth (only surpassed by the early stages of the big bang) occur in high-energy collisions of particles (in particular of heavy ions), during which one sees a \"fireball\" with a temperature of several hundred MeV (which corresponds to a temperature of 10 to the 12th power k). This fireball cools down by expanding and by radiating off particles, mostly pions, quite similar to the thermal black-body radiation. For more information on these phenomena, see the Fermi Lab tutorial.\n"}, {"score": 923.792, "uuid": "4a483fc8-759b-5a19-b542-84a129283304", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1709wb-89-09952", "target_hostname": "www.ecology.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/10/tilting-earth-shaping-seasons/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Earth</em>: Shaping Our Seasons <em>and</em> Climates | Ecology Global Network", "snippet": "A close second <em>is</em> Death Valley in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, which registered 134\u00b0F <em>on</em> July 10, 1913. * <em>The</em> <em>coldest</em> <em>temperature</em> <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> <em>on</em> <em>the</em> planet\u2019s surface did not occur at <em>the</em> South Pole but at Vostok, Antarctica, <em>on</em> July 31, 1983.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Eric McLamb , September 10, 2011\nIn early January each year, Earth reaches its closest distance to sun. At this time, the northern hemisphere experiences winter while the southern hemisphere experiences summer. The Earth travels to its farthest point from the sun at the beginning of July each year , when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.\nEarth\u2019s Movements\nEarth travels around the Sun at about 18.4 miles per second while rotating on its axis at about 1,070 miles per hours. Pictured above is Earth during summer for the Northern Hemisphere where the North Pole (center of the Arctic Ice Cap) receives sunlight 24 hours a day. Image: University of Toledo)\nHurtling through space at an average speed of 18.4 miles per second (30km per second), Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun. Not only is the Earth orbiting around the sun, but it also rotating on its axis at 1,070 miles per hour (1,722 km per hour), the speed at the equator. It is, however, a common misconception that the Earth\u2019s distance from the sun determines how warm or cold the planet gets.\nWhile it is true that Earth does have a perihelion , or point at which it is closest to the sun, and an aphelion, its farthest point from the sun, the difference between these distances is too minimal as to have any significant impact on the Earth\u2019s seasons and climate. The average distance of the Earth from the sun is about 93 million miles (149.6 million km) also referred to as one astronomical unit or AU. At its closest point, the Earth is about 91.1 million miles (147 million km) from the sun; conversely, the sun is about 94.8 million miles (152 million km) away when it is at aphelion. With these numbers, it\u2019s easy to figure out that the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun is not so much elliptical (oval) as it is circular, and that the Earth\u2019s distance from the sun remains relatively constant throughout its annual orbit.\nSo what does the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun have to do with our planet\u2019s constantly changing temperatures and changing seasons? The answer is\u2026 everything! The Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun. That\u2019s because the Earth tilts in relation to the sun. That is what creates the differences in the seasons and the annual warming and cooling cycles of the Earth\u2019s Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nThe Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis, a straight line through the planet from the North Pole to the South Pole. The Earth spins around, or rotates, on this axis as it orbits the sun. The key here is that as the Earth orbits the sun, different regions on Earth tilt both towards and away from the sun, depending on the region\u2019s respective hemisphere. This causes the sun\u2019s light and energy to hit the different regions of the Earth at different angles throughout the course of one orbit, or one full year.\nThe Seasons\nThis diagram indicates the orbital position of the Earth as it reaches winter, spring, summer and fall. Note the tilt in relation to the Sun. Source: NOAA\nWhen the North Pole tilts most toward the sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer. This occurs when the Earth is farthest away from the sun, and begins around June 21-22. Astronomers refer to the arrival of this event as the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. This is the time when Earth reaches its closest orbital distance to the sun. As the Earth continues along its path around the sun, its angle constantly shifts the North Pole away from the sun and the South Pole toward the sun. The sun\u2019s energy is more concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere where its rays hit the Earth more directly and are thus more intense. At the same time, however, the Southern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, causing the sun\u2019s rays to hit the region more at an angle and with less intensity. This brings about winter in the Southern Hemisphere , called the Winter Solstice.\nThe Equinoxes\nSpring and Fall (or Autumn) occur midway on the Earth\u2019s journey from winter to summer and from summer to winter. These times occur when the sun appears to be directly over the Earth\u2019s equator, and the length of days and nights are equal over most of the planet. On March 20 or 21 of each year, the Earth reaches the vernal equinox , which marks the arrival of Spring in the north and Fall in the south. The autumnal equinox occurs on September 22-23 and marks the arrival of Fall in the north and Spring in the south.\nPutting It All Together\nVenus' surface (pictured) maintains an average temperature of about 882\u00b0F due to the extremely high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in its atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas that also exists in Earth's atmosphere but at lower concentration levels that help maintain life-sustaining temperatures. Source: NASA\nWe know that Earth rotates on its axis as it travels around the sun in an almost circular orbit. We also know that, because the Earth tilts on its axis, its seasons change as it orbits the sun. When it is Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is Winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and this has nothing to do with how close or far the Earth gets to or away from the Sun in its orbit. It\u2019s all because the Earth is tilted on its axis.\nThe Earth\u2019s overall orbit or distance from the sun would make a difference if it was located where, for instance, Mercury is or where Pluto is. As Dr. Jack Hall from ecology.com\u2019s Dr. Jack\u2019s Natural World says: \u201cIt\u2019s the three bears syndrome. We\u2019re not too close to the sun, and we\u2019re not too far away. We\u2019re j-u-u-u-u-st right!)\nAll this does not explain why our planet maintains its relatively warm, life-sustaining temperatures and climates that can \u2014 for the most part \u2014 sustain life. It also does not explain why life on Earth doesn\u2019t burn up. For Earth to maintain its average temperature of 61\u00b0F (16.1\u00b0C), it requires a very delicate balance within its atmosphere, oceans and solid Earth.\nThe Sahara Desert, pictured, records the hottest temperatures on Earth. Located in the northern part of Africa, the Sahara's highest temperatures average around 130\u00b0F. Image: MIT\nEarth\u2019s coldest temperature averages about minus 60\u00b0F (-45\u00b0F to -97\u00b0F) and its hottest temperature averages about 130\u00b0F-plus. While these extremes make most life impossible to naturally exist or thrive, they occur only in remote areas of the planet, such as the Antarctic (coldest average temperatures) or the Sahara Desert (hottest). Still, these temperatures are relatively warm (or cool) compared to other planets.\nEarth\u2019s \u201cChecks and Balances\u201d\nEarth has a built-in, naturally-occurring \u201cforce field\u201d around it that creates and helps maintain viable living conditions for its plant and animal inhabitants. The atmosphere contains greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to keep the Earth warm, and an ozone layer to protect the Earth from harmful and incinerating (burning) radiation.\nThe Earth also has other checks and balances that help it absorb and retain the sun\u2019s heat and energy (such as the oceans) as well as reflect its energy back into space (such as the polar ice caps). Wind and ocean currents also help distribute this heat around the globe, all within the Earth\u2019s protective atmosphere. The point is that Earth is unique in its ability to create and maintain sustainable living conditions, because all of its systems and influences are connected to each other, from its atmosphere, oceans and land, to its seasons, its living inhabitants and the sun.\nDid you know\u2026.?\nThe hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth is 136\u00b0F in El Azizia , Libya, in Northern Africa on the northern fringe of the Sahara Desert. A close second is Death Valley in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, which registered 134\u00b0F on July 10, 1913.\nThe coldest temperature ever recorded on the planet\u2019s surface did not occur at the South Pole but at Vostok, Antarctica , on July 31, 1983. It was -128.6\u00b0F\nIt is the Sahara Desert\u2019s dryness, not heat, that makes it a desert. The frozen continent of Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, is so dry that some scientists consider it a desert, too.\nOur solar system orbits around the center of the Milky Way, our home galaxy. It takes approximately 225 million years for the sun to make one revolution or trip around the Milky Way.\nThe speed of the Earth is fastest when it is closest to the Sun, in January, and slowest when it is farthest away from the sun, in July. In other words, in January, it will be moving faster than average, and in July, it will be moving slower than average.\nEarth\u2019s solar system is located on the outer edge on the Milky Way , about 28,000 light years from the center of the galaxy. Most of the Milky Way\u2019s 200 billion other stars and their planets are clustered in the center. This leads many scientists to believe that if the solar system were located more toward the center of our giant galaxy, life on Earth would be impossible because of the overwhelming heat and energy emitting from those stars.\nAlthough most planets spin on their axis that are tilted only a few degrees, the third largest planet, Uranus , spins on an axis that is virtually perpendicular to the sun. Still, it is hotter at its equator than at its poles, the reasons for which are unknown.\n"}, {"score": 920.866, "uuid": "2d126fe0-1af9-55d4-9959-cf32b6e10628", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0808wb-92-11014", "target_hostname": "energyandenvironmentblog.dallasnews.com", "target_uri": "http://energyandenvironmentblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/07/edf-its-not-a-hoax-theres-no-c.html", "page_rank": 1.191617e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "EDF: It&#x27;s not a hoax, there&#x27;s no conspiracy, <em>the</em> <em>Earth</em> <em>is</em> warming | Texas", "snippet": "For a more detailed explanation you really need to go <em>the</em> link I provided <em>and</em> download <em>the</em> report.

Lets take a breath. What we have here is a failure to communicate. The failure is in the Jargon of science. In science, theories are actually more important that facts. I know this sounds weird, and a lawyer would throw a fit if I said that. But that is only because we have different Jargon.\nTry this thought experiment.\nFACT:I throw a rock, and it breaks a window. Could I then conclude that throwing all rocks will make all windows break? No, a small rock will not break a thick window. A fact is only a single event. It means nothing.\nTheory: Energy = 1/2 Mass * Speed^2, so if I have a large enough rock and throw it fast enough, then I will give it enough energy to break the glass. Is that a FACT? No. I could never test this using every possible rock and every possible window. That is why we say it's a THEORY. Theories are built on top of LOTS AND LOTS of facts.\nThe same is true with the THEORY of global warming, and the THEORY of evolution, and to that extent, the THEORY of gravity.\nPosted by dallasm @ 1:40 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nWhile I'm at it, another big problem with science Jargon is the word \"uncertainty\". To normal people 'uncertainty' means that that person doesn't know. If you were the only eye witness in a murder trial, and you admitted to the defense attorney that you were 'uncertain' about what you saw, the defendant would probably be acquitted.\nOn the other hand, scientists use this word very differently. The word 'Uncertainty' to a scientist describes the accuracy of his measurements. For example, use a ruler to measure the length and width of a sheet of paper. What do you get? Is it EXACTLY 8.5\" x 11\"? Are you sure its not 8.51\"? How about 8.500000000000000001\"? Are you actually sure that your ruler is accurate? Every measurement in science has a level of uncertainty because it is impossible to truly make a perfect measurement.\nWhen models predict that the sea levels will rise 6' +/-2', the +/-2' is the uncertainty. That means that we are nearly 100% certain that sea levels will rise. We are just uncertain if they will rise 4' or 8'.\nPosted by rke @ 1:42 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nThe EDF?\nAnd in other breaking news the NRA if pro gun, the KKK doesn't think much of black people, and Greenpeace is against whaling.\nPosted by Russ Postlewait @ 2:34 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nit is laughable to think that this face of global warming over the last decade or even the last century is a man made/caused phenomenon. do you dupes not reallize that before humans were even in existence this planet went through two ice ages..two, in between these ice ages the earth warmed...SIGNIFICANTLY!! understand that the earth goes through cycles and is capable of getting \"sick\" just as we are.. the thought of insignificant peons such as the human race being able to alter or even affect the planet or universe in any way whatsoever is laughable..and if you believe otherwise please get your head checked.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 3:25 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nDallasm - well said.

How much evidence would it actually take to convince you that global warming was real? Is there any amount at all that you would convince you or have you completely closed your mind to the matter?\nPosted by Russ Postlewait @ 4:15 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nhere is another good read for you mark, something you won't hear al gore or keith olberman barking about because they tend to simply push there progressive agendas without scientific basis\nhttp://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/1078\nPosted by Frank @ 4:18 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nOn another blog there was a lively discussion of the accuracy of the NASA or GISS temperatures. The EDF is using these same temperatures to support its claims. These are mean temperatures prone to fudging. The GISS is also fond of listing these temperatures as a variation from a not very well explained norm. The rest of their 10 statements are political.\nIf numbers of scientists mean anything there are at least more than the 200 scientists who participate in the IPCC who disagree with the its conclusions, including some of those 200 scientists. BTW all the scientists who ring in on the side of man made climate change are NOT climatologists. Both sides of the issue require folks from many disciplines.\nThe theory of a CO2 driven global climate change has taken some serious hits. There are peer reviewed studies that all but disprove CO2 as the primary driver. The models do not agree with observed climate.\nThe bald eagle population which declined to stresses in its environment, in part from man's encroachment, was already on the rebound before DDT was banned. Rachel Carson made critical errors, to be kind, in her book. Subsequent scientists testified in Congress that laboratory studies did not support the claims against DDT's impact on birds. DDT was banned by Interior Secretary Ruckelhaus in spite of the scientific community's evidence.\n99% of the species that ever existed are extinct. Most of these extinctions occurred before man. So, the point is?\nPosted by russ p. @ 4:20 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nno not at all that is not what i am saying..i understand that climate change is occuring and has been for millions of years..the facts are that we have been in a cooling trend for the last 8 years and furthermore i didn't say i don't believe in the concept of global warming i just truly don't believe that humans are the main reason...\nPosted by russ postlewait @ 4:22 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nFrank...my point exaclty you are just so much better with words than I\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 4:27 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nRuss,I am not sure I get your point. The point I am making is our effect is significant enough to effect the climate and the rapidity of that is highly detrimental to us and the planet as a whole.\nOn to the fish story...\nCoal burning puts mercury in the air. It eventually settles or gets rained out onto land and in water. Once in water microorganism convert the mercury to methyl mercury and that's bad. Methyl mercury is bio available meaning it can be taken up in the tissues.\nFish, eat the stuff and it builds as you go up the food chain. When it lands on your pregnant wife's plate she is taking in a heavy metal. The effects of heavy metals on developing fetuses or newborns is pretty well understood.\nGo to the Monteray Bay Aquarium site to see the fish recommendations for pregnant or nursing moms.\nIts a fragile, interconnected planet, and we are a fragile species.\nPosted by russ postlewait @ 4:33 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nMark, very interesting, but in my rambling before i was just basically trying to say that just because we are here and co2 emissons have increased along with global temperatures in no way means that we as humans caused this phenomenon..thre is a problem with the logic more specifically with sufficiendy and necessity...it is simply a correlation. so many other factors that are beyond our scope may be at play which is what the buckeye institue article references. i don't deny that global warming exists i just don't think humans can do anything to regulate or control it through policy. all we would be doing is hurting ourselves economicaly, finacially, and productively.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 4:42 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nFrank - the species I listed became extinct in man's time.\nThat's revisionist history on the bald eagle.\nYou wrote... \"that all but disprove CO2 as the primary driver\"\nAll but prove? Hold yourself to the same standard you hold others...prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n200 scientists that disagree with the IPCC conclusions? Reference? And disagreeing with projections doesn't count because that's not the subject here.\nLastly, this argument that my scientists are more or better qualified than yours is a waste of time.\nShow me the large portion that do the research, get into the field, study the core data, collect all the samples, send up the satellites etc etc.\nShow me the large group of scientist deniers that do science rather than pick at others work. Just show me one group of deniers that has a theory, and experiments, and data, that they have gathered to support their theories.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 6:00 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nJames, Elizabeth, friends -\nI too have heard of this 31,000 signatures on a petition. I had a little time so I went to their web site.\nHere is what I gleaned from the site.\nFirst, this petition started in 1998 around the discussions of the Kyoto treaty. During that time \"thousands of signatures were gathered\".\nThe site does not say how many signatures, was it 30,999? I too would have signed it in 1998 and would still if the science was as incomplete as it was then. So many signatures were tied to that time and they don't say how many, hmmm.\nBetween 99 and 2007 it \"grew gradually\" again no numbers.\nThen in 07 they started a new campaign. It says \"The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after Oct. 2007.\"\nSo something more than half of the unknown number \"signed or re-signed\" which doesn't make sense because were are talking about the original signers. (?)\nThe new \"campaign in 2007 was prompted by an escalation\" because of \"claims of consensus\" in the Inconvenient Truth.\nI too would have signed it for that reason alone at that time. Most republicans would have as well.\nWhat we don't know is how many signed it after the IPCC report, nor do we know how anyone gets their name off the list if they changed their mind. Or even if that's possible.\nSo, it's an old petition with old signatures of unknown numbers based on issues and data that have been surpassed by events and new findings. Interesting, but hardly relevant to today's cap and trade bill. I wish I could have that half hour back.\nPosted by Frank @ 6:27 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nMark, I have referred you several times to Roger Pielke's site where you will find no shortage of studies. Knock yourself out. If you want information on satellite temperature measurement, check John Christy, University of Alabama Huntsville. He has been doing it for a long time. Work on the iris effect and clouds, Roy Spenser, Sven Svenmark. There are many who are involved in the collection of ice core samples on both sides of the issue. Again, the studies are out there if you are interested. It takes time to look it all up. I've spent over 10 years following the discussion and reading papers. Why? Because it made no sense to me that people were making assumptions about the climate of a planet millions of years old based on 100 years of data, a fly speck in the earth's age.\nAs for disproving CO2 is the cause of climate change, the difficulty in disproving it in a traditional sense is that there is no experiment on which this theory is based. Traditionally scientists construct experiments to prove a theory. As long as that experiment can be repeated with the same results, the theory is considered valid. Global warming relies on computer models which, not one but several. The results of each vary and do so widely. The best counter I have seen is the one I've described before, performed by Physicist Willie Chu and colleagues. He demonstrated that the CO2 models were wildly inaccurate while models which assumed that the weather in any given year would have a 95% chance of being like the year before was nearly dead on. I would consider that disproof. Part of the problem with the global warming theory is that those who are pushing it consider everything consistent with their theory. If it warms, it is consistent with CO2 driven climate change. Same is true if it cools. I have actually read a discussion where one of the proponents admitted exactly this. This makes the theory neither provable nor disprovable. Thus, it is not science.\nBTW: the bald eagle story is not revisionist history. You won't like the website this came from, but J, Gordon Edwards is a professor of entomology at San Jose State and did testify in the hearings I mentioned. http://www.junkscience.com/ddtfaq.html#ref12\nPosted by anon @ 8:49 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nA little bird told me they invented ballistic missiles that could should scientific instruments into space. These instruments can even measure temperature.\nI hope the climate police don't get me for saying such things exist.\nPosted by Robert @ 9:24 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nThere is no long-term evidence that CO2 drives global temperature change. NONE.\nThe slender evidence that global warming alarmists relied upon was the correlation of CO2 with temperature in the positive multi-decadal oscillation from the late 70's through the late 90's. That brief correlation has now evaporated with the onset of the negative multi-decadal oscillation that began around year 2000. Temperatures have been cooling since then, and will continue to cool for the next twenty years ... if we are lucky.\nIf we are not so lucky, temperatures will continue in a downward trend towards the next major cooling period. Check the historical information about the Little Ice Age. While you're checking, look at the Medieval Warm Period before that, the Dark Ages Cooling, and the Roman Warming before that. Climate changes, it always has, and it has nothing to do with CO2.\nAnd oh yes, check how cold it will get when we head down into the next real Ice Age. The Vostok Ice Core data provides a chilling record supporting the fact that we are in a glacial climate period and have been for the last 30 million years.\nClimate is driven by solar intensity cycles, the earth's orbital dynamics (orbit, precession, and wobble), ocean current patterns, and other factors. The PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) has recently shifted into negative mode, which will reduce El Nino episodes and influence more cooling. The earth's CO2 concentration is near the lowest ever in the earth's history, because plant life has sucked it up from the atmosphere. More CO2 would actually improve agriculture, something nursery owners do in their (real) greenhouses when they want to stimulate plant growth.\nThe man-made global warming hysteria would be funny if the consequences of its nonsense were not so serious.\n- Robert (professional engineer and Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences)\nElizabeth, before you lecture us too much, what's your degree?\nPosted by Tim @ 10:36 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nThis is an issue about creating a whole new type of financial instrument which can be bought and sold on an exchange that sets the price which power companies will 'tax' us to permit the emission of carbon we need for our power. This is not, and should not be a debate on global warming, scientific theory, or climate change. It's very obvious that climate change and it's proponents and opponents are staked out on an ideological battlefield. The science behind our studies and models will continue to be proven and disproven until we reach an even greater consensus of something else entirely. For these reasons we should avoid soapboxing about saving the world, or proving the world is cooling or warming and simply focus on whether the bill makes sense. I am not a denier but I am a bad legislation opponent and here are my arguments against this bill:\n1) I disagree that there needs to be a 'market' created to trade carbon credits. Carbon credits or rather carbon offsets are almost intangible. What a credit is worth, is likely to prove as difficult as it was during the credit default swap (CDS) craze. With the number of non-governmental organization (NGO) environmental groups, and recently bailed out financials (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan) I expect us to fall victim to a market manipulation of sorts similar to the one we experienced in the summer of 2008 and there is nothing we can really do about it. This trading is largely obscure and will likely have heads of analysts 'unrelated' to the financials investment arm making televised predictions equivalent to the $200 a barrel.\nI propose that we eliminate the market concept entirely and if we are to proceed with a carbon reduction at all it be done with a carbon-tax which is simple, straight forward and unable to be manipulated. This should disappoint a lot of the trading industries. This would also prevent spending it on the creation, oversight, and enforcement of yet another market which the CFTC and SEC admit are understaffed for the ones they currently oversee. (Nevermind that they can't agree on who oversees what).\nWhy should it be traded? if the price is wildly fluctuating it will harm both the consumer and those expecting to get paid for creating them while benefiting only the people involved in the investment aspect. I think we are all aware of the tomfoolery that brought us into this economic downturn. Trusting the 'market' is not a good idea when the billions of dollars in capital we paid to merrill lynch simply swapped hands and ended up in the pockets of GS, JP, and MS dollar for dollar. They've done enough thank you.\n#2) I don't particularly like the way the money generated from the trading is simply spent within the bill. So we're getting an unknown tax and we could either be adding to the deficit or making a little bit of money. Again, a straight forward tax can be adjusted, forecasted and used to establish budgets for industry and consumers alike.\n#3) I know that the basis for this program\nstems from the very successful program for sulfur-dioxide. However, Sulfur Dioxide is a byproduct of the chemical\nreaction that takes place to generate energy. Sulfur, which is not a\nfuel source but is carried along as a contaminant of some sorts, bonds\nwith oxygen in the high heat of the primary fuel combustion be it\ncarbon, gas, or oil. SO2 mitigation was successful because the SO2\ncould be handled by reducing the sulfur content before the combustion\nor afterward through selective catalyst (like in a car).\nThe problem here is that CO2 is the primary reaction: you can't\nselectively reduce it beforehand because the hydrocarbons generate the\npower. The basic form of the equation has the H-C bond being broken\nby combustion with Oxygen to yield CO2 and H20. Elements in the\natmosphere like N2 and elements in the fuel (like Sulfur) create NO2\nand SO2 but this is because they were merely passengers. Hence this\nis why carbon capture methods rely on pure oxygen combustion to yield\nas pure of a feed of H2O and CO2.\n#4 The renewable PTC is very effective and will get us there for a lot\nless money. This program creates real jobs for people working to\ninstall, manufacture, and service real hardware. The jobs created by\nthe cap and trade will largely be government oversight and inside the\nfinancial companies or the companies which specialize in trading\n#5 The EDF's responses are mostly rhetoric akin to a come-back. The truth is that the rural midwestern states will suffer more. Rural areas rely on the cheaper smaller fossil fuel plants because the demand isn't there for nuclear and distributed generation works well. If solar isn't there, if wind isn't there what are they going to do? I don't believe that the nation has to accept wiping out of a regions people as a sacrifice for the greater good. Carbon capture is not proven yet, and with many of the pilot plants using pure oxygen combustion I can imagine many plant operators becoming nervous about adopting these new techniques if and when they are proven.\n#6 The debate is never over. EDF and similar groups are equally likely to push their agenda as those funded by oil-companies are. Ideology goes both ways and so does money.. To answer their open question for why there would be a conspiracy: You're getting paid for it! Duh. People get paid to say the opposite and that's why this has got to be a debate about the nuts and bolts of the bill and not about emotions. I truly think this is not the answer for us. I think it wastes too much money and energy in creating a market rather than simply doing what we'll need to do anyway: Build power generation, or rather replace generation with new generation. Every state budget needs a tax increase due to the drop in economic activity, the same thing could be said for washington. We should not make it more complicated than it needs to be.\nIn conclusion of sorts:\nCarbon tax if anything, and it should fund programs like the PTC as well as domestic programs aimed at reducing energy demand by using all available resources. For example why aren't we building our new homes with a few solar thermal collectors? There is more than enough sunlight here to at least replace the gas we use for that.......I understand the material costs but I can make the decision on my own that I believe its better to not burn gas when I can simply aim something at the sun and get the energy from there.\nPosted by Robert @ 11:20 PM Wed, Jul 01, 2009\nTim -\nIf there is nothing wrong with carbon, why do we need to regulate or tax it? Isn't it just an excuse to tax and regulate something everyone needs anyway, just a Democrat's dream come true?\nCarbon is the essential building block of all life. All the cells in our bodies are built upon carbon-based molecules. Carbon dioxide is simply the oxidized form of carbon, which is exhaled by all animals, and then as part of the carbon cycle CO2 becomes an essential nutrient to plants without which they could not exist.\nCarbohydrates, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, calcium carbonate, etc., etc., all part of the carbon cycle that goes on and has gone on for billions of years. The oceans contain over 70 times as much CO2 as the atmosphere. When the oceans cool more CO2 is absorbed, when they warm more CO2 is released. Just basic physics.\nCarbon dioxide does not drive global warming and never has. There is no evidence to substantiate this, none whatsoever. If you have the evidence, please show it to me. You can't because it isn't there.\nThe U.N. Climate Panel has been trying desperately for over 20 years to prove that CO2 is something bad, and all their predictions have been wrong: temperature, CO2 levels, greenhouse gas signature, etc. Their climate models can't even hindcast, much less forecast. Junk in, junk out. Why would you believe anything a U.N. panel told you? Do you think the U.N. IPCC is suddenly going to discover anything except results that keep their jobs alive?\nThis whole global warming argument has been driven by extreme environmentalists and empty headed media talking heads who love dire theories, but have no grasp of the real science behind it. And oh yes, folks like Al Gore who are invested in companies that will profit from the \"green\" delusion.\nIf you bother to dig into the historical data beyond the twentieth century it becomes obvious that the earth is simply following natural cycles. CO2 represents less than 0.0004 of our atmosphere. You could double this very small number and it would still be a very small number. But the plants would appreciate it, they need CO2 to survive. And by the way, we need plants ourselves to survive, so that is a good thing. CO2 is good and we would all benefit from more of it.\n- Robert\nPosted by Eric @ 12:25 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nMan made global warming makes me laugh, if anybody thinks this cap and tax bill is anything other than a money and power grab i think you will be in for a rude awakening. actually everybody will because even though the debate that never happened is over actual data and facts are starting to come out, and the new EPA report clearly shows that. You can use Al Gore's findings as basis for truth, models that can predict the weather 50 years from now when in reality they can't 2 days from now. give me real proof, don't say the caps are melting, don't say that one year was really hot, well the sun is hot and the last 10 years have been cooling. Transparency and a new way of doing things!!!!\nI have some x-ray glasses for sale if anybody is interested\nPosted by C. Bruce Richardson Jr. @ 12:28 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nBoth sides tend to use linear regressions to make their case. That produces a straight line that tilts up, tilts down, or is level depending on where you start and stop the data. I think that's where the 10 year claim might come from. The global warming crisis folks often use a linear regression to show that the warming is continuing even now. Nature doesn't normally do straight lines. Especially not with climate. Linear regressions aren't the best way to show trends in climate.\n.\nOut of curiosity, I started downloading the data and plotting it myself about a year ago. Using Hadley Center data (HadCRUT3) and smoothing it honestly, I find that there has been a cooling trend since around 2004. That isn't ten years but it is five years. Hadley isn't a skeptical source. GISS, UAH, and RSS were all showing variations of the same recent cooling trend the last time I checked.\n.\nElizabeth Souder's article said \"The planet is warming. Period.\" That's not true. Depending on how you smooth the data, it has been cooling since around 2004. It might start warming again next month, but for now it is trending cooler.\n.\nThe cooling shouldn't be a surprise. Solar activity has gone from being higher than at any time since the late 1700's to being low now. It is expected to remain low for at least the next two solar cycles (around 22 years). Several other natural cycles have switched from warming to cooling recently too.\n.\nThere are many experts in climate science who think that we could be entering a cooling period similar to that that occurred between around 1940 and 1980, around 1900, and around 1850 (Dalton Minimum). Some are even concerned that we might be entering a period similar to the \"Little Ice Age.\" If we do, we might wish for a return to the good old days of global warming.\n.\nThere seems to be an attempt to keep the recent cooling trend under wraps. I suppose the fear it that if the public becomes aware of the recent cooling, they might think that it isn't warming.\nPosted by Elizabeth Souder @ 3:11 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\n@Robert:\nI have no business lecturing anyone. I'm not a scientist, simply a curious observer. My job is to pose ideas to you all, and read the discussion. I only ask that we apply the same level of critical thinking to each idea and source of information.\nPosted by ken @ 6:18 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nFollow the money. No such thing as global warming.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 10:07 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nRobert, thanks for the insight and information. I didnt see anything in there I havent heard before, a laundry list of denial.\nGo here and look at the charts, a cooling trend? No not really, more of a pause in the warming trend.\nhttp://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/globalwarming/ar4-fig-3-6.gif\nBut it's not fair for you to criticize climate prediction models and then immediately cite your own favorite pet theories of future cooling on a minor blip in the overall trend. Please show the non warming trend models so we can laugh at those next year.\nThere is a simple experiment that has been repeated many times. Carbon (and aerosols) in the atmosphere reflects the warmth back that would have otherwise left our atmosphere. Proven yes?\nNow you will argue its not enough to make a difference.\nLook at the chart link I provided again. even in a cooling blip, temps are higher than they have been in the near term record.\nAnd we already know that's not solar activity, earth wobbles etc etc.\nWe don't have any experiments that shows how gravity works but we have plenty that says it does. We may not have the whole climate warming pinned down to an exact science, but we shouldn't ignore the effects.\nI have been to Pielke's site at your suggestion and it seems to be making my points, not yours.\nBut here's the bottom line. Humans take very long term stored carbon and release it into the atmosphere in a very short time. Oil millions of years old is burned in an instant.\nOur delicate planet isn't immune to those emissions because we make the natural cycles way too short. A warmer planet and a higher CO2 concentration isn't bad as long as we have a few million years to adapt.\nWe don't have a few million years and the charts I posted make it clear we cant ignore that trend line if it continues.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 10:31 AM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nTim, Robert, Frank etc,\nAs citizens I believe we have a responsibility to determine if the consequences are indeed dire and then do something about it.\nOne can't deny it's warming, and one can't deny man has some effect.\nThe challenge is, can we have a positive effect by reversing our standard operating procedure of sending CO2, methane and black carbon particulates into our atmosphere without concern?\nGiven the potential for our 6.7 billion people to starve or be displaced it seems irresponsible to insist on exact models, perfect science, and perfect legislation.\nWe don't have any idea if we can cope with one more degree of warming. Do you really want today's children to have to learn that the hard way?\nSo what finally made me a believer is one haunting thought...what if we could have stopped it and didn't?\nPosted by Bob @ 12:55 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nOr another haunting thought. What if we ruined the economy and lost a bunch of jobs and wrecked a bunch of lives to stop it, and it didn't really even exist?\nOne can easily prove it's not warming and easily prove man has no effect. Perhaps waiting for some scientific evidence of disaster before having a panic attack knee jerk reaction isn't a bad idea after all.\nPosted by chris @ 2:01 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nSorry to hear about your Global Warming Problems. I live outside of Phoenix where we have scientific proof of no warming for the last decade. We\u2019re lucky to have an Atlas Testing facility 30 miles north of town. Atlas Testing is a Global Leader in weathering testing and weathering test equipment. They post temps for the last decade on their site. Anyone can do the analysis.\nWe do have \u201cHeat Island Effect\u201d. Those studies are conducted by ASU, in the center of town. To experience the difference, walk to the middle of your street after sun down. Heat Island and Global Warming are causal opposites. The challenge here is that increased Heat Island Effect is more an indicator of increased sun activity, reducing greenhouse gasses or both.\nPhoenix just had the coldest summer in about 100 years. New York came within a quarter inch of setting an all time record for rain. Canada had the first \u201cwhite Christmas\u201d, coast-to-coast, in recorded history. Alaska gained glacier snow pack for the last two years.\nDo you all remember when the four Kyoto Protocol Greenhouse Gasses were the issue? Do you know why we\u2019re only talking about CO2 now? Because the growth rate of the other three gasses is decreasing. In fact, Methane had a \u201cnegative growth rate\u201d for most of the last decade. The U.N. IPCC Reports comment (Report 2, Page 142), \u201cThe reasons for the decrease in the atmospheric CH4 growth rate and the implications for future changes in its atmospheric burden are not understood (Prather et al., 2001) but are clearly related to changes in the imbalance between CH4 sources and sinks.\u201d\nIn \u201cvalid\u201d science, when the outcome disagrees with the theory, the theory is adjusted.\nOne last scientific point, a \u201cgame changer\u201d missed by the IPCC Report and others. Greenhouse Gas is not evenly distributed around the planet. All Greenhouse Gas is in the Troposphere. The Troposphere is 12 miles thick at the equator and zero to 4 miles thick at the poles. During the summer, the oceans warm, \u00e2\u0080\u0098exhale\u2019 greenhouse gas, and there is 4 miles of Troposphere at the poles. During the winter, the oceans cool, \u00e2\u0080\u0098inhale\u2019 greenhouse gas, and the Troposphere is indistinguishable at the poles. That is why there are Northern Lights on the North Pole every winter.\nPosted by steve @ 2:03 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nThe climate is going to change one way or another - always has, always will. Humans do not have any influence over it. The only thing we can do is be clever and resourcefull enough to adapt to it.\nThis fight is over who is going to have the resources to adapt. 2/3 of the humans on the earth do not have the resources to survive a drastic climate change in either direction, although warming would be less devastating than cooling, which would hamper our ability to feed ourselves.\nSo this is clearly just a tax on industrial energy usage. I can't figure out how that benefits the 3rd world populations that will be dying off if either catastrophe comes to pass.\nPosted by russ p. @ 3:30 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nwell for all of you that don't know there have been similiar warming trends on Jupiter, Pluto, and Neptunes moon...i'm sure our carbon emissions must have caused this as they obviously caused it here on planet earth...Hmmm, is there some giant, self-luminous ball of burning gas with a mass more than 300,000 times that of Earth and a core temperature of more than 20-million degrees Celsius, that for the past century or more has been unusually active and powerful? Is there something like that around which they all revolve that could be causing this multi-globe warming? Naw! They must all have congested commuter highways, coal-fired power plants and oilsands developments that are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into their atmospheres, too.\nHabibullah Abdussamatov of the Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in St. Petersburg, Sami Solanki of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon of the Solar and Stellar Physics Division of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a host of the rest of the world's leading solar scientists are all convinced that the warming of recent years is not unusual and that nearly all the warming in the past 150 years can be attributed to the sun.\nMr. Abdussamatov concedes manmade gasses may have made \"a small contribution to the warming in recent years, but it cannot compete with the increase in solar irradiance.\"\nMr. Soon showed as long ago as the mid-1990s that the depth of the Little Ice Age -- the coldest period in the northern hemisphere in the past 1,500 years -- corresponded perfectly with a solar event known as the Maunder Minimum. For nearly seven decades there was virtually no sunspot activity.\nAt the very least, the fact that so many prominent scientists have legitimate, logical objections to the current global warming orthodoxy means there is no \"consensus\" among scientists about the cause.\nPosted by Frank @ 6:12 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nMark if you have read any number of the articles and the discussions on Pielke's site, if you have watched John Christy's video lecture, if you've read the other posts by Robert, Tim and others and you still find that it is all denial talking points than man driven global warming for you is a matter of faith, not science.\nPosted by Robert @ 6:16 PM Thu, Jul 02, 2009\nFrank, C. Bruce Richardson, Chris, and russ p., thanks for some well-researched comments. Mark in Dallas, you need to do some real in-depth research into the literature, because your blase shotgun remarks are only demonstrating your lack of understanding.\nOurs is not \"a very fragile planet.\" If it were that fragile, it probably wouldn't have still been here when humans arrived. The earth has gone through some pretty rough changes. The notion that we will reach some critical \"tipping point\" on CO2 is just not borne out by the data. But to understand this you have to really dig into the subject, get the technical papers and resist the urge to cherry pick a fact here and there.\nI would no more accept on face value the comments of the Environmental Defense Fund than if these were from ExxonMobil or Peabody Coal. I would rightly assume each had an agenda, and therefore a conflict of interest in providing objective conclusions. It is useful to begin with sources that are not in scientific dispute.\nThe comments from the above contributors in this blog about global temperature data are key. The U.N. IPCC has relied on surface data from Hadley CRU (and its companion NCDC) which utilize ground monitoring stations. These are notoriously subject to error, but guess what, the errors are always towards reporting warmer temperatures. The NCDC methods have recently come under scathing criticism \"Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?\" available at www.globalwarmingheartland.org.\nThe U.N. IPCC has resisted using the more accurate satellite temperature tracking databases from RSS and UAH. The satellite methods are routinely calibrated using radiosonde balloon data. There is no way to calibrate surface data from Hadley and NCDC. How convenient.\nNevertheless, all four temperature tracking databases show a decrease in global temperature using least squares regression analysis from about 2002.\nThe U.N. IPCC has been called to task on a number of their conclusions, including the \"hockey stick\" graph which was discredited. IPCC simply dropped using it with no comment as to why. It goes on. The number of instances of data tampering from the IPCC is just too much to go into here, but it borders on scientific fraud, and I don't say that lightly. I would not trust anything in their reports, it is all manipulated to produce the results they prefer.\nAnd Mark, I do not rely on models, but data. Data is a record of something that actually happened.\n- Robert\nPosted by Frank @ 9:12 AM Fri, Jul 03, 2009\nAn interesting note about the \"hockey stick.\" The data up until the last 100 years or so consists of data derived from proxies for both temperature and CO2. The temperature data came from tree rings which was part of the problem. The CO2 data from gas bubbles in ice cores. The final 100 years came from actual data. Putting these together on the same graph should set off alarms for critical mind. That this is never or rarely discussed by the media is jaw dropping.\nPosted by Bob @ 12:47 PM Fri, Jul 03, 2009\nI have a couple of questions for Dr. Robert,\nYou wrote the following:\n\"And oh yes, check how cold it will get when we head down into the next real Ice Age. The Vostok Ice Core data provides a chilling record supporting the fact that we are in a glacial climate period and have been for the last 30 million years.\"\nI am a student studying atmospheric chemistry and I don't understand how the Vostok core supports that we have been in a glacial period for 30 million years when it only goes back ~450 thousand years. Could you elaborate on this?\nYou also wrote this:\n\"CO2 represents less than 0.0004 [percent] of our atmosphere. You could double this very small number and it would still be a very small number. But the plants would appreciate it, they need CO2 to survive. And by the way, we need plants ourselves to survive, so that is a good thing. CO2 is good and we would all benefit from more of it.\"\nDo you also believe that the minuscule amounts of chlorine radical added to the stratosphere by photolysis of transported CFCs had no effect on our planet's long intact self-regulatory mechanisms? If so, what are the alternative hypotheses for degradation of the polar stratospheric ozone layers? To me, this case is a fantastic representation of man's ability to influence global processes.\nI would also like to (somewhat cheekily) point out that when a human suffocates, it is not because they lack oxygen, but because their hemoglobin is inundated with CO2, so let's just be careful how much CO2 we wish for.\nLastly, you also wrote the following:\n\"And Mark, I do not rely on models, but data. Data is a record of something that actually happened. \"\nDo you really think that we have been making measurements accurately enough, for a long enough time with a great enough time resolution to even begin to address the question of whether or not CO2 mixing ratio belongs on the ordinate axis in the correlation between CO2 and temperature demonstrated in the paleoclimate record?\nMy personal thoughts on the matter are that we will have to live through a climate cycle while making accurate measurements in order to definitively address this question. In the mean time, there are probably better reasons to provide incentives to move away from fossil fuels. Whether Waxman-Markey is a good way to do that is questionable. It certainly seems like cap-and-trade would promote a more gradual change and be more gentle on the consumer than simply shifting all of the fossil fuel industry subsidies to fund alternative energy research and letting the consumer flounder in the interim.\nThanks for providing a non-dogmatic voice,\nBob\nPosted by Bob @ 12:51 PM Fri, Jul 03, 2009\nSorry Dr. Robert,\nOne last question. You wrote:\n\"The comments from the above contributors in this blog about global temperature data are key. The U.N. IPCC has relied on surface data from Hadley CRU (and its companion NCDC) which utilize ground monitoring stations. These are notoriously subject to error, but guess what, the errors are always towards reporting warmer temperatures. The NCDC methods have recently come under scathing criticism \"Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?\" available at www.globalwarmingheartland.org.\"\nIf you are investigating a data trend does it matter if there is a systematic bias? Won't the slope in the data still be the same even if the absolute value of each individual point is not accurate?\nThanks again,\nPosted by Robert @ 6:47 PM Fri, Jul 03, 2009\nBob -\nThanks for your questions. I will try and answer them.\nMy statement about the Vostok Ice Core data and the earth currently being in a glacial pattern may not have been clear. I did not mean to infer that the Vostok Ice Cores go back 30 million years, you are correct they only go back about 450,000 years. What the data does demonstrate is that we are indeed in a glacial climate pattern of about 100,000 year cycles. In such a pattern, the earth spends about 80,000 years with a much colder climate (as in Ice Age) and 15-20,000 years in an interglacial warm period. That's where we are now, but we are much nearer the end of that warm period than the beginning.\nThe 0.0004 number cited is a fraction, not a percent. The more precise concentration is 385 ppm.\nYou are correct that much of our data from the earth's history is based upon proxies. Since few of us have the time to be experts on every single scientific discipline, I find it useful wherever possible to rely on scientific data that is widely cited and not in dispute. That the earth's current CO2 concentration is near its lowest point in the last 500 million years is not in dispute based upon my findings.\nAccording to my research, the strongest climate drivers are solar cycles, the earth's orbital variations and orientation to the sun, ocean current and temperatures patterns (such as the PDO, NAO, and AOO), and the relative position of continents, as determined by tectonic plate movement. Paleogeologists hold that when the earth has at least one large polar continent, and at least one continental land mass that stretches nearly from pole to pole, then the earth's climate operates in a glacial pattern as described above. We have had such a continental orientation for the past 30 million years. This also does not appear to be in dispute.\nWith regard to the last question about Hadley and NCDC temperature data as compared to RSS and UAH satellite data, your point might be correct if the bias were consistent. There are numerous problems with the way NCDC and Hadley data have been measured and collected, including placement of monitoring stations in \"heat island\" locations, failure of consistent human reporting with subsequent arbitrary data interpolation, subjective \"adjustments\" to the raw data, and use of non-standard coatings on the Stevenson screens that house the enclosed thermometers. The survey conducted on the NCDC monitoring stations indicated that 89% of them do not meet NOAA's own standards and NOAA has now agreed to conduct its own investigation. I have no idea what they will do about fixing the 1221 monitoring stations in the U.S. or in correcting the past error-prone database.\nIn my opinion, the most accurate global temperature measurement data comes from satellites that monitor the well-mixed lower troposphere and can be verified (calibrated) by another accepted monitoring method (radiosonde). These avoid the many sources of error that surface stations encounter. Satellites provide uniform data over the entire span of the globe, while surface stations are limited to land (about 1/3 of the earth's surface) with a few stations on ships that travel mostly on the same sea lanes and are also error-prone. I fail to see why after all the problems that have been identified with surface monitoring, IPCC does not convert to using satellite data.\nI think you are confusing my comments about trends and absolute temperature data. All four of the principal databases show a downward trend since 2002, so this is not in dispute. But the two surface methods show a higher absolute temperature when compared with the satellite methods. For a more detailed explanation you really need to go the link I provided and download the report. If you read the report and are not concerned about what is being recorded and forwarded to the IPCC, then I probably cannot say anything that would convince you otherwise.\nI do have an opinion, and I believe it is an educated opinion. Even if you subscribe to man-made global warming, the bottom line is that by the IPCC's own projections, the amount of temperature increase that would happen, and the resulting environmental and ecological change so minor, that it is not worth bankrupting the world to try and delay an effect by a few years that is going to happen anyway.\nThe effects of a global cooling episode would be much more serious than global warming. The reduction in worldwide food production could cause extreme hardship - think Little Ice Age and famine.\nI am an environmental scientist by education and an engineer by profession. I worked for the U.S. EPA for a number of years. I have worked many sides of the environmental street. I got into this line of work because I was, and still am, interested in fact-based pollution control and real environmental protection. In my professional opinion CO2 is not a pollutant. I have not seen Mr. Alan Carlin's report yet. Carlin is the EPA employee whose report was covered up by EPA management because he cited misgivings about CO2's role in global warming. Wouldn't be surprised if our findings about CO2 are in agreement.\n- Robert\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 10:01 AM Sat, Jul 04, 2009\nRobert -\nThe system wouldn't allow me to post. Please don't think I have acquiesced.\nIn my personal experience, as a non-scientist, I found AGW to be a very difficult subject to sort out. In fact the more I searched the more I couldn't get to the bottom of all the details. It's a hugely complex subject. Your last post illustrates this.\nSo as a citizen and a voter I decided there had to be a better way to form an opinion than arguing over details. So here is my thought process.\nFirst I concluded, no one really knows on either side. The science is too young and our data either too short a period of time or subject to too much argument for it to be definitive.\nSecond, it dawned on me during research that the past record, while interesting, doesn't really matter that much. There are too many people and too much fixed farmland and too many crowded species to compare the past with the present. I concluded that everything that is happening has happened before but not with us crowding the planet.\nOur 6.7 billion people don't allow much migration for anyone or anything.\nThirdly, it's not change per-se but rapidity of change that makes my second aha moment so important. The planet's inhabitants and species can't handle rapid changes in the environment. We are way too dependent on the earth's ability to feed us.\nIn the end I went to the current reliable data that clearly show a rapid rise in global temperatures. And, I know you don't know whether that trend will or wont continue. Nor am I convinced anyone does.\nBut, if it does, we have big problems. Problems I wouldn't wish on anyone, including our children.\nSo, for the same reasons you can doubt all the scientist who conclude we are rapidly warming, I doubt all those that question that conclusion.\nI just think that doubt and lack of certainty is not a reason to not act on the possibility. I am happy for everyone to keep arguing as long as we are making progress towards a carbon neutral economy.\nThere are a huge number of benefits to that action.\nPosted by Frank @ 12:57 PM Sun, Jul 05, 2009\nMark, how do you determine what is a rapid rise in temperature. In Texas we experience a 25 degree increase in temperature every day. That is rapid. To look at a series of temperatures over even a 100 year period, especially temperatures that have been \"averaged,\" is hardly indicative of anything. As I stated once before, there was a sudden change in the climate some 20,000 t0 25,000 years ago which caused the extinction of a agrarian society living in the Eastern grasslands. This certainly wasn't caused by man. So, climate can change quite suddenly, all by itself.\nFurther, you keep mixing in concerns over population. Those concerns are entirely separate from concerns over a changing climate. Man is quite adaptable and should, indeed, be spending resources on adaptation. This has been the story of civilization.\nPosted by Mark - Dallas @ 11:19 AM Mon, Jul 06, 2009\nFrank,\nI think its pretty well known that the earth as an ecosystem, all things considered, has about a five degree window of global average temperature. Anything above or below this \"window\" throws the system off catastrophically.\nIt's amazing to think our system is that delicate but it's complexity is what keeps it all working in very finely tuned balance. Of course it has had many millions of years to get to that point of balance.\nWe are throwing the system out of balance. I roll my eyes when those who think a few parts per million couldn't possibly harm us and claim immunity from nature. Nature has shown us many times how a small toxicity can change big things. Like pine borers.\nBut I think you illustrated the point well about the \"agrarian society\". It's a delicate balance.\nBut the reason why our climate changed rapidly is either meteor strikes or super volcanoes. Otherwise it doesn't to any great degree in the short term. Sure solar cycles and earth wobbles make a small difference, but we understand that. Millions of years can also make a difference.\nBut looking at the charts, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/globalwarming/ar4-fig-3-6.gif\nit's pretty clear something is up and it isn't volcanoes or meteors and we don't have millions of years.\nPosted by Robert @ 6:40 PM Mon, Jul 06, 2009\nMark -\nAs a self-professed non-scientist, you certainly make a lot of profound statements.\nAs an example, where did you get the idea that there is a five-degree \"window\" that is \"pretty well known?\" Pretty well known by whom besides yourself? It is obvious you haven't done your homework.\nI do not believe that one must be a scientist to state a credible opinion, just being a reasonably intelligent individual who has researched the topic of discussion will do just fine. But one must do enough research to understand the complexity of real climate dynamics. A major source of the current global warming nonsense is individuals who have selected a narrow segment of data - and sometimes not even real data - to \"prove\" a result they already have fixed in their mind.\nMark, you really need to take a break and do some real research. I was going to suggest sobering up, but it appears you are on a nonstop stream of gibberish. And give the population doomsday scenario a rest, you don't know much about that either.\nYou understand solar cycles and earth wobbles? Sure. A quick check-out on Wikipedia?\nUntil you do some real study, you should stop wasting your time and ours on this blog, because you distract from those who really do have a credible opposing viewpoint.\n- Robert\nPosted by Tom @ 9:14 PM Mon, Jul 06, 2009\nDallasm posed a question which struck to the heart of the matter. \"How much evidence would it actually take to convince you that global warming was real?\" The issue is really whether carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is responsible for global warming, more correctly. The answer is that there is only one way to convince me of that, and that is to publish a theory which allows one to compute, based on the known and measurable properties of CO2, atmospheric temperatures.\nI am not averse to simulations, per se. There are many examples in applied science, of systems which are too complex for closed form mathematics to solve, but there is always, in those computational models, a level at which the computational process proceeds from experimentally provable science. This is not true in the carbon dioxide theory of global warming. The atmospheric simulations that the IPCC uses, all of them, depend on a feedback mechanism which cannot be tested or explained. You just have to believe.\nIn the realm of science, if you don't have a theory that allows you to predict verifiable outcomes, you don't have anything. \"Consensus among scientists\" is of no value whatsoever, which might shock some people. Consensus may have some value in politics or religion, but it has no value and no place in science.\nPosted by Robert @ 11:20 PM Mon, Jul 06, 2009\nTom -\n\"How much evidence would it actually take to convince you that global warming was real.\" Based upon my research, global warming is indeed real ... in the relatively short term. LOOK AT THE DATA. The earth has been in a warming cycle since it began recovery from the Little Ice Age in the late 1700's.\nWarming has been occurring at about 0.5C per century, as confirmed by linear regression. Along this trend line multi-decadal oscillations occur - every 25-30 years, most likely in response to solar cycles that wax and wane as evidenced by sunspot activity. These multi-decadal oscillations produce temporary warming or cooling. Between 1945 and 1975 we were in a cooling cycle, and between 1975 and 2000 we have been in a warming cycle. Now we have commenced another temporary cooling cycle, Solar Cycle 24.\nWarming and cooling cycles have been occurring throughout the Holocene interglacial period from about 12,000 years ago: Holocene optimums were the warmest, it became much warmer than today, then later the Roman Warming, Dark Ages Cooling, Medieval Warm Period (also warmer than today), Little Ice Age, and now the Modern Warm Period. We are about 200-250 years into the current warming cycle, which means we will start trending down again before many decades.\nThere is NO scientific evidence that CO2 is a greenhouse gas of any significance, but there is a lot of scientific evidence that it isn't. I use the word \"significance\" because CO2 does have a greenhouse gas effect, but its effect is so miniscule that it cannot even be detected against other major temperature driving influences. Please refer to Sherwood Idso, \"CO2-induced Global Warming: A Skeptic's View of Potential Climate Change,\" Climate Research, Vol 10:69-82, April 1998. Idso's research shows that CO2 has most of its small greenhouse-gas influence at 40 ppm, and above that concentration its effect rapidly attenuates. At current levels of 385 ppm its effect is virtually nil.\nThe second confirmation of the non-effect of CO2 upon global temperature is the absence of the much-heralded \"Greenhouse Gas Signature.\" This has been predicted by the IPCC as a confirmation of CO2-induced global warming. The IPCC predicted that a warming in atmosphere would occur in the lower troposphere between the equator and 30 degrees north and south latitudes because of the influence of greenhouse gases. But after over 20 years of monitoring by radiosonde balloon monitoring no such effect has been detected. Instead, the area has been relatively cool. So much for that IPCC prediction. They have also missed temperature and CO2 forecasts based upon their climate models. Garbage in, garbage out. So far they are batting 0.000, but their funding continues.\nThe third confirmation is this: if CO2 is a major temperature driver, why is it cooling while CO2 continues to increase? Whoops.\nI have challenged anyone to produce evidence that CO2 drives global temperature increase and I have yet to see any presented. Temperature is indeed increasing in this Modern Warm Period, and from natural causes. When it begins to cool, it will be again from natural causes.\nI don't know what they will call the next cool period - maybe the Post-Modern Cool Period, or maybe the Second Little Ice Age. In any case, I will probably be long dead. By then, the Global Warming scare will be a distant memory and a source of jokes.\nMore CO2 would be good for the plants and us too.\n- Robert\nPosted by John Lloyd Scharf @ 12:57 AM Tue, Jul 07, 2009\n2008 was the coolest year since 2000, according to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS).\nPosted by Tom @ 8:05 AM Tue, Jul 07, 2009\nRobert - I did not respond as to whether global warming is real or not, because I view that as largely irrelevant. Maybe Dallasm meant that - I assumed he did not. The great debate seems to be whether or not global warming is caused by CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and whether we could ameliorate that warming by restricting CO2 emissions. Al Gore famously stated that the correlation of atmospheric CO2 and temperature was a cause and effect relationship, a dubious claim, and I think one that has been shown to be untrue. Nevertheless, that idea is widely held. Gore's movie marked a turning point in the move from a scientific debate to a political and religious one, and one that the warming enthusiasts seem to be winning, at least until Mother Nature votes.\nSomehow, the discussion has devolved into, \"My theory is better than your theory\", rather than \"Your theory is wrong\". You may be right about the causes of climate change, but I think \"Not sure\" is a more than adequate explanation. There are a great many things in science that are \"not sure\". I don't view it as a negative.\nPosted by Ted @ 10:03 AM Thu, Jul 16, 2009\nGLOBAL WARMING: OUR BEST GUESS IS LIKELY WRONG\nNo one knows exactly how much Earth's climate will warm due to carbon emissions, but a new study this week suggests scientists' best predictions about global warming might be incorrect. The study, which appears in Nature Geoscience, found that climate models explain only about half of the heating that occurred during a well-documented period of rapid global warming in Earth's ancient past. The study contains an analysis of published records from a period of rapid climatic warming about 55 million years ago known as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, or PETM.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 During the PETM, for reasons that are still unknown, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere rose rapidly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 For this reason, the PETM, which has been identified in hundreds of sediment core samples worldwide, is probably the best ancient climate analogue for present-day Earth.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 In addition to rapidly rising levels of atmospheric carbon, global surface temperatures rose dramatically during the PETM.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Average temperatures worldwide rose by about 7 degrees Celsius -- about 13 degrees Fahrenheit -- in the relatively short geological span of about 10,000 years.\nBased on findings related to oceanic acidity levels during the PETM and on calculations about the cycling of carbon among the oceans, air, plants and soil, the researchers determined that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by about 70 percent during the PETM.\nThat's significant because it does not represent a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Since the start of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels are believed to have risen by about one-third, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If present rates of fossil-fuel consumption continue, the doubling of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels will occur sometime within the next century or two.\nDoubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide is an oft-talked-about threshold, and today's climate models include accepted values for the climate's sensitivity to doubling. Using these accepted values and the PETM carbon data, the researchers found that the models could only explain about half of the warming that Earth experienced 55 million years ago.\nThe conclusion, Dickens said, is that something other than carbon dioxide caused much of the heating during the PETM. \"Some feedback loop or other processes that aren't accounted for in these models -- the same ones used by the IPCC for current best estimates of 21st Century warming -- caused a substantial portion of the warming that occurred during the PETM.\"\nSource: Press Release, \"Global warming: Our best guess is likely wrong,\" Rice University/University of Hawaii/University of California-Santa Cruz/Nature Geoscience/E!

According to this study little or none of the late 20th century global warming and cooling can be attributed to human activity.\nThe research, by Chris de Freitas, a climate scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, John McLean (Melbourne) and Bob Carter (James Cook University), finds that the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a key indicator of global atmospheric temperatures seven months later. As an additional influence, intermittent volcanic activity injects cooling aerosols into the atmosphere and produces significant cooling.\nAccording to de Freitas:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The surge in global temperatures since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean that made warming El Ni\u00f1o conditions more likely than they were over the previous 30 years and cooling La Ni\u00f1a conditions less likely.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Internal global climate-system variability accounts for at least 80 percent of the observed global climate variation over the past half-century.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 It may even be more if the period of influence of major volcanoes can be more clearly identified and the corresponding data excluded from the analysis.\nClimate researchers have long been aware that ENSO events influence global temperature, for example causing a high temperature spike in 1998 and a subsequent fall as conditions moved to La Ni\u00f1a. It is also well known that volcanic activity has a cooling influence, and as is well documented by the effects of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption.\nBob Carter, one of four scientists who has recently questioned the justification for the proposed Australian emissions trading scheme, says that this paper has significant consequences for public climate policy:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The close relationship between ENSO and global temperature, as described in the paper, leaves little room for any warming driven by human carbon dioxide emissions.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The available data indicate that future global temperatures will continue to change primarily in response to ENSO cycling, volcanic activity and solar changes.\n\"Our paper confirms what many scientists already know: which is that no scientific justification exists for emissions regulation, and that, irrespective of the severity of the cuts proposed, ETS (emission trading scheme) will exert no measurable effect on future climate,\" says Carter.\nSource: Marc Morano, \"Nature Not Man Responsible for Global Warming,\" Climate Depot, July 23, 2009; based upon: J.D.

Longitude brings one to Greenland in only 1,450 miles. Therefore, the land Admiral Byrd discovered beyond the pole covered with lush green vegetation must be located within the North Polar Opening.\nThat land has been sighted out over the Arctic wastes by several different explorers from different directions at different times.\u00a0 It is a land that has been sighted always in the same direction, whether seen from Greenland, Alaska or northern Russia.\u00a0 The Russians called it Sannikov land, and have seen it north of the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 Admiral Peary on his way to the pole in 1909 sighted land northwest of Cape Thomas Hubbard on the northwest coast of Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada.\u00a0 With him, Lt. Green, MacMillan and their Eskimos also saw it and even later went on an expedition out on the ice to find it and only turned back when their Eskimos claimed it only to be a mist.\u00a0 MacMillan swore it looked every bit like real land.\u00a0 Admiral Peary did also, and so he named it Crocker land.\u00a0 Dr. Cook on his way to the pole in 1906 saw it also towards the northwest of his trek to the pole from Ellesmere Island, and even took a picture of it.\u00a0 Then from Harrison Bay on the north coast of Alaska, Captain Keenan sighted land also towards the northwest.\u00a0 Jan Lamprecht in his book, Hollow Planets, makes an excellent case that these sightings of mirages of land in the arctic, could easily actually be land within a Polar Opening, seen as a doubly inverted mirage caused by the warm air that comes up out of the polar hole.\nSeveral of us can trace our ancestry back to the intrepid Viking explorers that settled northern Europe in the 7th century.\u00a0 Some later migrated to Iceland and some even further to the west coast of Greenland.\u00a0 These hardy arctic colonizers discovered every year that the more plentiful hunting was further to the north.\u00a0 Then in\u00a01721 when Greenland was resettled, it was noticed\u00a0that the Viking colonists\u00a0had disappeared from Greenland.\u00a0 This was the subject of Arctic author Vilhajalmur Stefansson's book, Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic.\u00a0 He thought they died out.\u00a0 But Lt. Green discovered where they went when he befriended the Eskimos and asked them point blank.\nThe Eskimos told Lt. Green that the Viking colonists had migrated further and further north, then one day a hunting party returned saying they had discovered a paradise in the north -- a place the Eskimo had always known about, but generally stayed away from because they believed it to be inhabited by evil spirits.\u00a0 When the Viking exploration party had returned and delivered the wonderful news of their discovery, the Eskimos say that the Viking colonists all promptly packed their bags, and singing songs, departed happily northward out over the ice and never returned.\u00a0 Their cattle, chickens and other animals were later found wandering around their abandoned settlement by European visitors, but no settlers.\u00a0 They didn't think to ask the Eskimos what had happened to them.\u00a0 Lt. Green wrote an article in the December 1923 issue of Popular Science Monthly , that the Eskimo tradition is that out over the ice towards the northwest of Greenland, in the direction Admiral Peary sighted Crocker land and Dr. Cook sighted Bradley land, \"...is a land that is warm; is clothed in summer verdure the year around; is populated by fat caribou and musk-ox.\u00a0 It lies,\" they say even to this day, \"in the direction of the coastal trail-route north .\"\nThis polar expedition proposes that we seek out that land where our cousins, the Greenland Vikings went, and visit them in their hidden land within the North Polar Opening that is within the hollow of our earth.\u00a0 Indications are that that land is inhabited.\u00a0 The story of the Scandinavian explorer Olaf Jansen and his father who attained that land through the north polar opening in 1829, maintains the people there are friendly, highly advanced in the sciences, arts, and geometry.\u00a0 And that they are ardent worshipers of the Israelite god Jehovah, whom they believe has a throne on the sun of inner earth.\u00a0 Most likely, since their god is Jehovah, these peoples of inner earth are actually the legendary Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, whom the Apocryphal author Esdras wrote, escaped the Assyrians in 687 BC and migrated to a region in the north called Arsareth, taking a year and half to reach that land.\u00a0 It's a veritable paradise.\u00a0 Deuteronomy 30:4 calls it the \"outmost parts of heaven\" where the lost tribes were driven from their original home in Palestine.\u00a0 Jeremiah called it \"the land of the north.\" (Jer. 3:12-18)\u00a0 Other scriptures refer to it as the \"north countries.\"\u00a0 It is a land where there is much gold, and abundance of precious stones, metals and giant forests.\u00a0 It is a veritable Garden of Eden.\u00a0 Indeed, Olaf Jansen claims that this is where the original Garden of Eden is located to this day -- within Our Hollow Earth.\u00a0 He was taken there on a monorail train of inner earth by friendly inner earth inhabitants.\u00a0 It is located on the highest mountain plateau of the inner continent where \"...all manner of fruits, vines, shrubs, trees, and flowers grow in riotous profusion.\u00a0 In this garden four rivers have their source in a mighty artesian fountain.\u00a0 They divide and flow in four directions.\u00a0 The place is called by the inhabitants, the 'navel of the earth' or the beginning, 'the cradle of the human race.'\u00a0 The names of the rivers are Euphrates, the Pison, the Gihon, and the Hiddekel.\" ( The Smoky God , p.114)\nIt is hoped that this expedition can find this outmost parts of Eden, a land within the North Polar Opening at or near 87.7 N. Latitude, 142.2 E. Longitude, about 1,700 miles directly north of the New Siberian Islands.\nFor scientific purposes, gyroscopes will be taken to help determine the beginning of the entrance to inner earth.\u00a0 At the geographic North Pole, a gyroscope will be set horizontally.\u00a0 It will be used to detect a curvature greater than the normal earth curvature of 68.9 statute miles to a polar degree.\u00a0 Entrance into a polar opening will cause the gyroscope to tip gradually vertical.\u00a0 When it reaches vertical orientation, the ship should be located approximately half way through the polar opening.\u00a0 The ship's radar could then be bounced off the opposite side of the opening straight above the ship to determine the diameter of the polar opening at it's neck.\u00a0 A quarter of the way into the polar opening the inner sun should come within view over the horizon to the north, such as was reported by Olaf Jansen and Fridtjof Nansen.\u00a0 Thermometer readings from the crows nest should show a higher temperature from air emanating from within the hollow interior of the earth, than air down next to the ice.\u00a0 Temperatures farther south should be colder than further north with a north wind, such as was reported by Fridtjof Nansen.\u00a0 The sea should be tested periodically to find that point on the polar lip where centrifugal force separates the salt from the fresh water from iceberg melt water leaving fresh water on the surface of the ocean, as reported by Olaf Jansen and Fridtjof Nansen.\u00a0 A lookout should be maintained for drift wood, plants, dirt and rocks scraped off inner earth river banks and deposited on the icebergs as they were pushed out to sea.\u00a0 Land will be expected to be reached at a distance of about 1,700 statute miles north of the northernmost coast of Arctic lands, as reported by Admiral Byrd.\u00a0 Large rivers emptying into the sea should be found with land covered with lush vegetation.\u00a0 The inhabitants of inner earth will likely contact us with one of their ships or flying saucer type craft.\u00a0 Permission will be requested from them for further entrance into their world domain.\u00a0 Descendants of the original Lost Tribes and Viking colonists will hopefully be found there.\nWith the verification that Our Earth IS indeed hollow with polar openings into the interior where descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel and Greenland Viking colonists live, a revolutionary change will be required in all areas of history, education, the sciences and art.\u00a0 The theory of gravity will have to be revised to account for an inner earth surface upon which people can dwell normal earth-bound lives with their feet firmly planted on the ground, and not floating around in zero gravity, as orthodox science maintains would be the case in a hollow earth.\u00a0 The theory of evolution will be dealt a decisive blow with the establishment of the location of the actual, original Garden of Eden, indicating the historical accuracy of the Bible and the reality of our first parents, Adam and Eve.\u00a0 For example, in the Lost Books of the Bible, in the Book of Adam and Eve, is given to understand our first parents originated from inner earth.\u00a0 After being driven from the Garden of Eden by God for partaking of the forbidden fruit, they were told to dwell in the Cave of Treasures, where they got lost.\u00a0 When they finally found their way out, the sun that came up in the morning was different than the soft sun light that shown in the Garden of Eden.\u00a0 This new sun burned them.\u00a0 Our hotter, harsher sun that shines on the outside of our world, is different from that sun that shines in the Garden of Eden.\nBe prepared to be astounded, amazed and exhilarated!\nA Russian Nuclear Icebreaker with 70,000 horsepower and a range of 4 years, that cuts through the ice like butter will be at our disposal.\u00a0 This ship has it all.\u00a0 We will be traveling through the most hostile climate and conditions on earth with the utmost in comfort and ease.\u00a0 It is a veritable motel on ice.\nIf in the event\u00a0we are unable to locate the North Polar Opening and enter into Inner Earth, we will continue south on the 141st Meridian from the geographic North Pole to the New Siberian Islands and spend a couple of days there checking out the exotic animal remains thought by Hollow Earth researchers to be of inner earth origin.\nOn the northern shores of the New Siberian Islands, we would\u00a0look for\u00a0the legendary deposits of mammoth skeletons and other exotic wildlife remains deposited after originating from a land within the North Polar Opening, according to Hollow Earth theorists. Rivers that empty into the Arctic ocean from inner earth, are covered with ice in winter, where animals wandering from nearby pastures sometimes fall into the crevasses in the ice and are instantly frozen.\u00a0 Later when the rays of the summer sun shine through the polar opening, the inner earth rivers thaw out and push their freshwater icebergs out to sea loaded with their loads of frozen dead animals.\u00a0 Thus remains of woolly rhino, steppe lions, giant deer, mammoth and foxes and a hardy breed of horse which scientists claim are all prehistoric are preserved in the Arctic ice, but which Hollow Earth theorists claim more than likely come from inside the earth through the north polar opening, floating out in their tombs of ice, later unloading them onto arctic shores.\nAs of December 15, 2003, a group in Argentina made a presentation to interested voyagers.\u00a0 Our friends there have put together a video clip in with background music announcing our Voyage to Our Hollow Expedition Cruise.\nYou can download the movie clip at http://www.erks.org/expedition9.zip .\nThere are 108 total possible reservations, with a minimum of 78 bookings necessary to make this cruise happen.\nA write-up of our expedition appeared November 11 with the BYU University newspaper, The Daily Universe.\u00a0 The newspaper interviewed me as author of World Top Secret:\u00a0 Our Earth Is Hollow! and Steve Currey, our previous expedition organizer for our Voyage to Our Hollow Earth expedition, asking us what our objectives are with this expedition.\u00a0 You can read the BYU newspaper article at: BYU announces Voyage to Our Hollow Earth Expedition Cruise\nTuesday, November 25, we did a Radio Show with a radio station in Japan.\nSome of the objectives we hope to achieve with this expedition are:\n1. Prove our earth is hollow with polar openings to an interior where dwells a highly advanced civilization we think are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.\n2. This will initiate a whole new thrust in the science of inner earth/ inner planets science.\n3. It will require a revision in the theory of gravity in which scientists insist that everywhere in a hollow planet there is zero gravity.\u00a0 Since those living on the inside surface of our planet have their feet as firmly planted on the ground's surface as we do, gravity theory will have to be revised. This revision of gravity theory will lead to the development of free energy technology, and lead to outer space travel and the exploration of other planets by the common people.\n4. We expect this discovery will establish the truth of the holy scriptures and completely destroy the theory of organic evolution.\n5. We hope to obtain the scriptural record of the Lost Ten Tribes which will help to establish that the Book of Mormon and the Bible are true history.\n6. This discovery will prove the Ice Age never happened, and the Flood of Noah did, because we will now have the evidence of where the waters came from that caused the Flood -- from Inner Earth.\n7. We will establish that the arctic remains of frozen mammoths, woolly rhino, steppe lions, giant deer and other animals found on the northern shores of Siberia and Alaska originate from inner earth and are still living there, and were not suddenly frozen in some supposed Ice Age catastrophe.\n8. We hope to establish that the true inherited and worthy throne of David is located in the Hollow Earth, which throne is prophesied to be delivered to Jesus Christ at His Coming at Adam-Ondi-Ahman.\n9. We will establish and expect to verify that the political Kingdom of God already exists within the earth, and will merge with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when the Lost Tribes emerge to expand that Kingdom to outer earth in the near future.\n10. We will establish that the lost Garden of Eden is actually located within Our Hollow Earth, and that our first parents arrived on the surface world through communicating caverns following their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.\n11. We expect to establish that the inner earth peoples are a friendly people to we, the people of outer earth and are NOT our enemies.\n12. We expect to establish that the people of inner earth are primarily the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.\n13. We hope to find there also the descendants of the Lost Viking colony that settled Greenland in about 985 AD and which disappeared from there sometime before 1721 AD when Greenland was recolonized by Europeans.\u00a0 The Greenland Eskimos say the Lost Viking colony migrated into the northern paradise they've always known about, but don't go there believing it to be guarded by evil spirits.\n14. We expect to establish that the earth has an inner sun suspended in the hollow of the earth by electrostatic ion repulsion.\n15. We expect to establish that the belief of the inner earth inhabitants is that the inner sun is the throne of Jehovah, or Jesus Christ, on this earth, and as such is the heaven of this earth or Paradise, where the spirits of the righteous dead go at death.\n16. We expect to prove the earth is hollow with no molten interior, that volcanoes are caused by the reaction of water with highly reactive deposits of space metals from which the earth was created which as the interaction of gravity between the planets, moon and sun causes the earth to expand and contract causing cracks to open up in the previous volcanic crust allowing water to leak down into these deposits of explosive reactive metals and substances such as phosphorus, sodium and sulphur.\n17. We expect to prove the auroras are caused by the solar wind of the inner sun emanating through the polar openings and that the Van Allen Radiation Belts consist of that same inner sun solar wind being trapped in the magnetic field of the earth.\n18. We expect to establish that the earth's electromagnetic field is caused by the rotation of the earth's hollow shell about a nearly stationary inner sun.\n19. We plan on taking radar readings giving the size and diameter of the North Polar Opening, the hollow interior, and the Inner Sun.\nWe have had several requests for more information on our planned expedition.\u00a0 We will address these now:\nLocating the North Polar Opening\nJane MacRoss from Australia wrote asking if we could describe in more detail how we are going to locate the entrance to Our Hollow Earth on our expedition.\u00a0 And also address the concern of her friend who is an ex-US navyman of his awareness of the \"official\" manipulation of the GPS system and the misinformation techniques that have made the hollow earth one of the most heavily concealed \"secrets\" of the centuries.\nRESPONSE:\nYes, we are aware that discovery that our earth is Hollow and inhabited within is still the World Top Secret!\u00a0 We are going on faith that the Lord will guide us, help us and protect us on our voyage.\u00a0 We are going as a friendly visit to Inner Earth through the North Polar Opening with our only intention of just getting acquainted with the hollow earth inhabitants and visiting their land.\u00a0 Some of us believe they may be our long lost relatives of the Lost Tribes of Israel, or the Lost Viking Colonies of Greenland.\u00a0 As we locate and enter the North Polar Opening, we expect to be met by a craft of the Inner Earth inhabitants where we will request their permission to enter into their Hollow Earth domain.\nOur ship, the Yamal, is a Russian nuclear icebreaker with a four-year range of fuel, and uses GPS (global positioning system) for navigation.\u00a0 However, we plan to use our own navigation system for locating the polar opening.\u00a0 Briefly this will consist of a 24 hour clock with hands and two gyroscopes that we can see the spinning wheels.\u00a0 At 2.2 GMT (Greenwich Meridian Time) at Murmansk, Russia, the sun will be opposite the north pole from us when we board the ship.\u00a0 At this time we will set a vertical gyroscope towards the sun.\u00a0 This will give us the direction to travel to the north pole and also the direction towards Murmansk from which we can get our bearing to 141 E when we get to the pole.\u00a0 At this same time we will set a second gyroscope at Murmansk horizontally inclined toward the sun 21 degrees down.\u00a0 When we get to the pole, the horizontal gyroscope should be horizontal, as determined with a level.\nFrom the pole we will direct our course south on the 141st E meridian.\u00a0 At 2.2 GMT, the vertical gyroscope will be pointing to Murmansk.\u00a0 At this time, 108 degrees to the left of the direction to Murmansk is 141 E Longitude.\nMy estimate is that the north polar opening covers 890 miles from crest to crest from where it begins to dip into the earth.\u00a0 We can detect the opening if we come within 400 miles of it using the horizontal gyroscope.\u00a0 So there is an area of 890 miles from crest to crest within which we can detect the polar opening.\u00a0 At the pole, the horizontal gyroscope will be horizontal as verified by a level.\u00a0 As we enter the polar opening, the horizontal gyroscope will gradually turn vertical.\u00a0 If we do not enter directly into the opening, but within 400 miles of it, we will detect the location of the aperture with the horizontal gyroscope.\nSay we are missing the opening, but are within 400 miles of it, the gyroscope will dip up as we enter into the depression, but at the bottom of the depression, it will then stop dipping up and then as we start out of the depression, it will start dipping down.\u00a0 At this point, we turn around, go back down to the bottom of the depression and make a right angle turn to the right or to the left.\u00a0 If the gyroscope then continues dipping up then we will be headed in the right direction through the 90 mile opening.\u00a0 If it starts dipping down, then we know we are headed out of the depression.\u00a0 At this point, we make a 180 degree turn and then we will go directly through the opening in the opposite direction.\nWe are fairly confident that we can come within 400 miles of the polar opening based on the direction mirages of land have been seen in the arctic.\u00a0 That direction has been sighted north of the New Siberian Islands by the Russians which they called Sannikov land.\u00a0 Crockerland has been sighted many times northwest of Cape Thomas Hubbard from Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada by Admiral Peary, MacMillan and Lt. Green and some Eskimos.\u00a0 Dr. Cook sighted Bradley Land northwest of his line of travel to the pole in 1906 from Ellesmere Island and even took a picture of it.\u00a0 Keenan Land has been sighted northwest of Harrison Bay, Alaska, by Captain Keenan and some Eskimos.\u00a0 Olaf Jansen discovered the north polar opening by traveling northeast of Franz Josef Land in 1829.\nI have added blue lines on this arctic map by Jan Lamprecht to indicate my estimated location of the north polar opening by drawing lines in the direction all these mirages have been seen.\u00a0 They all cross at 87.7 N Latitude, 142.2 E Longitude.\nIf we come within 400 miles of the polar opening, we will find it using our gyroscopes.\nThe Russians travel the Artic Ocean all the time.\u00a0 We have chartered their ship, the Yamal, to take us on a scientific expedition to check out the hollow earth theory.\u00a0 The Yamal cuts through ice up to 15 feet thick.\u00a0 Most ice in the Arctic Ocean is 6-10 feet thick with many leads.\nMeasurements made between two submarine studies between the years 1958-1976 and 1993-1997 indicate that the ice in the Arctic has thinned 40 percent.\u00a0 The greatest thinning (-2.6 meters) was discovered in the area near our proposed Polar Opening.\u00a0 So this is a good time to be going.\u00a0 We will be traveling mostly in the leads.\u00a0 The Yamal has a helicopter to scout out ahead to help us find the leads.\u00a0 We are confident we will find the polar opening and enter therein.\nThe Polar Opening on the Russian Side of the Pole\nA question was brought up as to my estimated location of the North Polar Opening.\u00a0 The question was:\u00a0 Could the polar opening be located on the 141 West meridian rather than on my estimated 141 East meridian?\nI am confident that the North Polar Opening is more likely located on the 141 East meridian.\u00a0 First, the 141 West meridian would put it north of Canada.\u00a0 This was the area MacMillan thought the mirage of Crocker Land was located, as you can read in Jan Lamprecht's book, Hollow Planets (see http://www.hollowplanets.com/ also available on Amazon.com .\nMacMillan, Lt. Green and some Eskimos took an expedition northwest of Cape Thomas Hubbard on the northwest coast of Ellesmere Island in northern Canada and traveled over 200 miles out over the ice in the direction of the mirage of Crockerland.\u00a0 But curiously, the farther they advanced, the mirage just kept receding and looked just as large as before no matter how far they went.\u00a0 So they turned back.\u00a0 My conviction is that if they had followed it to 87.7 N Latitude, 142.2 E Longitude, they would have found the north polar opening and reached the inner continent.\nMany years later, Lt. Green remembered this.\u00a0 He then proposed that this lost continent must be located more towards the Russian side of the pole.\u00a0 In his 1923 article in Popular Science Monthly magazine, Lt. Green concluded that the Lost Viking colonies of Greenland had migrated to that unknown land.\u00a0 In his article, Lt. Green announced a US Navy dirigible expedition to check out his theory.\u00a0 But the dirigible crashed before it could attempt the flight.\nSeveral years later in 1926, Amundsen and Ellsworth flew over the North Pole from Spitzbergen to Alaska by dirigible hoping to make a sighting of Crockerland.\u00a0 They crossed directly over the location Lt. Green thought Crockerland was located and found nothing.\u00a0 However, they did notice higher temperatures at the pole and afterwards much fog which seemed to them to indicate a proximity to that illusive land.\u00a0 The fact that when they arrived in Alaska they discovered they were 100 miles to the west of Point Barrow where they had hoped to land, indicates to me that perhaps they dipped down into one edge of the polar opening causing their line of flight to be skewed to the right 100 miles by the time they arrived in Alaska.\u00a0 This would indicate that the polar opening was to their right after passing the North Pole.\nAnother evidence the polar opening is not on the Canadian side of the pole are all the flights made in the attempted rescue of the Lost Soviet Flyers who disappeared in the region of the pole as described in Stefannson's Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic.\u00a0 In 1937, the Soviet flyers had attempted to fly north of the Kara Sea towards Alaska.\u00a0 If you draw a line straight across the Arctic from the Kara Sea north of Russia to Alaska, that line of flight would take you directly over 87.7 N Latitude, 142.2 E Longitude -- our estimated location of the North Polar Opening.\u00a0 Curiously, radio transmissions from that ill-fated flight were received, but grew fainter and fainter until they were received no more -- exactly what would be expected if they flew into the North Polar Opening.\u00a0 Moscow called off the search after 7 months.\u00a0 Stefansson has a map in his book showing all the flight paths of the U.S. airplanes that assisted in that search effort.\u00a0 They flew all over that area north of Canada in the region of 141 West.\u00a0 This further confirms that the Polar Opening is located on the 141 East Meridian on the Russian side of the pole.\nIn our opinion, this will be the greatest expedition of all time!\u00a0 Our goal is the discovery of a new world inhabited by a people at least as civilized as ourselves.\u00a0 We even venture to propose that all indications are that they are MORE advanced than we and infinitely more peaceful.\nSaturday, April 3, 2004, I did an interview with Daniel Ott of THE EDGE Radio Program at http://www.theedgeam.com .\nSteve Currey, our previous expedition organizer returned from promoting the expedition in South America.\u00a0 At a seminar in Buenos Aires where 100 interested voyagers met with him, Steve learned some very interesting things.\nFirst, there are many interested voyagers, but who are unable to come up with the funds to buy their ticket on the cruise.\nIt must be understood that this expedition has no sponsors.\u00a0 This is a we, the people expedition.\u00a0 No military, no government, no organization is sponsoring and paying for this trip.\u00a0 Just us interested voyagers that have always wanted to find a way to go to visit the hollow in our earth -- that land \"beyond the pole\" that Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd discovered, which discovery was never given him credit, and which has ever since been held as World Top Secret by those that sent him there.\u00a0 But we give him credit.\u00a0 We want the whole world to know who discovered Our Hollow Earth in modern times.\nSome have objected at our reasons for going.\u00a0 As organizers of this expedition, we have been asked what our reasons are for going.\u00a0 We are honest.\u00a0 We have spoken our reasons.\u00a0 We don't hide behind unknown names and addresses or front organizations.\u00a0 Anyone can contact us or visit us.\u00a0 And we are forthright in our answers.\u00a0 We invite any interested person to join us on this the greatest expedition by the common people in all of recorded history.\u00a0 Whereas Columbus discovered a new continent for the people, this expedition will discover a new world.\u00a0 We want everyone to know about this greatest geographical discovery of all time.\u00a0 And you are welcome to voice YOUR reasons for going, if you so wish.\nSecond, we have received a confirmation from those that KNOW our earth is hollow, that we are RIGHT ON in our estimated location for the north polar opening.\u00a0 Steve Currey, while presenting the expedition in the seminar in Buenos Aires, Argentina was approached by a representative of the Illuminati.\u00a0 He offered to fill the ship with voyagers.\u00a0 Steve at first didn't realize who this representative was.\u00a0 The thought of getting the ship filled really did excite Steve.\u00a0 The only requirement given was that the expedition would be financed through a Foundation they would set up for the expedition in Utah.\u00a0 Then Steve discovered that this was a representative of the Illuminati.\u00a0 This is the way they work to control the world, with foundation money.\u00a0 Steve realized that if they would be sponsoring and paying for the expedition, they could determine where we would go in the arctic.\u00a0 He realized that this would be unacceptable.\u00a0 We cannot accept money and sponsorship of someone who would prevent us from going in the direction we estimate the North Polar Opening is located.\nOn May 27, 2004 Steve flew to Buenos Aires, Argentina where Prof. Marcelo Martorelli had 200 people coming to a conference on Our Voyage to Our Hollow Earth Expedition Cruise.\u00a0 They also prepared a presentation to be shown on the TV program \"Infinito\" with 6 million Latin American viewers.\nMeanwhile we have been getting some publicity for our expedition here in the USA.\nOutside Magazine interviewed me on our expedition and the hollow earth theory.\nOn April 3, 2004, I was on http://www.TheEdgeAM.com internet radio program.\u00a0 You can listen to the program from the link on my New Items page on my website at http://www.ourhollowearth.com/RodneyCluff.mp3 .\nI have been getting some interesting questions from these media people.\u00a0 For example, Daniel Ott asked me if the earth has a molten core.\u00a0 I told him there is no scientific evidence whatsoever for a molten core.\u00a0 On the contrary, every time there is a large earthquake, the earth rings like a bell.\u00a0 A bell is hollow.\u00a0 The earth could not ring like a bell if it were full of molten lava.\u00a0 The molten lava would absorb all the vibrations.\nIn fact, whenever there is a large enough earthquake to ring the earth like a bell, there appears on the opposite side of the earth a shadow zone, where no or very few seismic waves arrive.\u00a0 This happens because the seismic waves from the earthquake cannot pass through the hollow interior of the planet.\u00a0 The shadow zone is THE evidence for a hollow interior.\nAlso, Prof. Marcelo Martorelli, our expedition recruiter in South America, was kind enough to put his movie short in English for us.\u00a0 You can find it on my New Items page, or by clicking here:\nwww.erks.org/expedition2.wmv (Media player)\nOn Thursday, on April 22, 2004, I was interviewed on the TV cable program, Unscrewed by http://www.techTV.com .\u00a0 They were kind enough to give me some air time to announce our expedition cruise and invite any interested voyagers on what we believe will be the greatest expedition of all time, where, we, the people, are actually going ourselves to check out the hollow earth theory, to see if we can find the North Polar Opening, and attempt to enter therein, that is, of course, with the permission of the inner earth inhabitants, whom we believe are most likely the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, and very possibly also, the Lost Viking Colonists of Greenland.\nOur advertising apparently has struck a cord in the professional establishment.\u00a0 We have received several emails from professors, engineers and scientists asserting that we are a bunch of Morons, Hollow Heads, Stupid, and some other epithets I won't mention.\u00a0 Of course, what they lack in proof of their side of the debate is made up in throwing out hideous name calling in an effort to intimidate us.\u00a0 They have NO proof that the earth is not hollow and name calling is their only recourse when they have no evidence of their FALSE solid/liquid interior earth theory.\nGravity and Our Hollow Earth\nOne question brought up by these brain washed (and well paid) Learned Heads is how does a hollow earth account for gravity.\u00a0 They claim that the earth would not have enough matter in it to produce the gravity we experience on its surface.\nEstablishment science teaches that everywhere inside a hollow planet there would be ZERO gravity.\u00a0 If there were any interior earth inhabitants, they would be floating around in zero gravity.\nInevitably, questions such as these arise when considering the hollow earth theory.\u00a0 Questions arise, such as, how could there exist a hole in the Arctic Ocean that leads to a hollow in the earth?\u00a0 Wouldn't all the ocean water drain down such a big hole and empty the Arctic Ocean?\u00a0 Wouldn't any inner earth inhabitants that supposedly live on the inner surface \"fall\" into the Inner Sun?\nSo, if you may have had any such questions, I will attempt to describe how gravity can work in a hollow earth.\nFirst of all, could enough matter exist in a hollow earth to provide us the surface gravity acceleration we observe on the outside of the earth?\nI originally thought that perhaps there may have been a miscalculation in the gravitation constant which scientists have used to determine the strength of gravity exerted by a certain measured amount of matter.\u00a0 On first thought, also, it would seem that if the earth were hollow, that it would have less matter.\u00a0 After an extensive review of the theory behind the gravitation constant, I was unable to find any error in it and it's use in determining the acceleration of gravity exerted by mass.\nSo I decided to apply the Newtonian gravity to a hollow earth to see if it could contain the mass calculated to exist in the earth.\u00a0 According to the Inner Earth Guide in ETIDORPHA, the earth has an earth shell thickness of 800 miles.\u00a0 So one half the total volume of the earth is contained in its shell.\u00a0 Since the Inner Sun is relatively small, and is most likely a hollow crystal itself, most of the earth's mass would be located in the earth's shell.\u00a0 I have calculated that 99.99% of the earth's mass is located in the earth's shell.\nThe\u00a0 Density of Shell = Mass of Earth/Volume of Shell, so the density of the shell would be:\n5.978541732 x 10^27 gms / 5.342261531 x 10^26 cc\n= 11.19 gm/cc\nAs you can see, Newtonian physics would require an average shell density almost as dense as lead (11.3).\u00a0 And since surface rocks are 2.7, then the interior of the shell would have to be greater than the average density.\nThe interior density using the Newtonian mass of the earth requires than the interior of the shell would have a density of 2 * 11.19 - 2.7 = 19.68, which is denser than gold (19.3).\u00a0\u00a0 Platinum is 21.4, so an inner shell density of 19.68 is not beyond the realm of possibility.\u00a0 In fact, if the earth is hollow as we maintain, the inner shell would necessarily need to be of a greater density to give the hollow planet enough strength to keep its hollow shape.\nSo we can say that a shell density of 11.19 gm/cc could be in the realm of possibility.\u00a0 After all, the earth DOES ring like a bell after a rather large earthquake.\u00a0 A bell is hollow and is made of metal, just as a hollow earth may be.\u00a0 So amazingly, we find that Newtonian gravity IS consistent with a hollow earth.\u00a0 A hollow earth COULD feasibly contain all the earth's estimated mass and thus be able to exert the surface acceleration of gravity we observe on the earth's outer surface.\nSecond, where would the center of gravity be located in a hollow earth and what do empirical experiments indicate in regards to this?\u00a0 In other words, would the water of the Arctic Ocean drain down into a polar opening and would inner earth inhabitants be drawn into the central sun?\nThese are interesting questions, and the answers may surprise you.\nIn a hollow earth with a central sun, there exists two centers of gravity.\u00a0 One in the central sun, and the other is actually a sphere located between the inner and outer surfaces of the shell, closer to the inner surface than the other, as reported by the Inner Earth Guide in ETIDORPHA, who said it is located at a 700 mile depth in the 800 mile thick shell.\u00a0 The fact that earthquakes occur no deeper than 450 miles indicates that beyond that point, the shell density increases causing the central sphere of gravity to be located closer to the inner surface than the outer.\nThe center of gravity in the inner sun has very little if any effect on us because the inner sun is so small, estimated to be about 600 miles in diameter.\u00a0 I have estimated that 99.99% of the earth's total mass is located in the earth's 800 mile thick shell.\u00a0 So gravity of the shell is what affects us the most by far.\nThe central sphere of gravity located in the shell is supported by a couple of experiments I have located.\nGravity Experiments in Mine Shafts\nThe first experiment was carried out in the early 1900's, as reported in Scientific American.\nIn a solid earth, the center of gravity would be located in the center of the earth.\u00a0 So the experiment was to measure the distance apart that two plumb bobs suspended a mile into the earth would be closer at the bottom than the top, which if the earth were solid, the plumb bobs would be closer at the bottom than at the top because the plumb lines would be expected to point to the center of the earth.\nWhat they found was exactly the opposite.\u00a0 The plumb bobs were measured at the bottom of the mine shafts and found to be farther apart at the bottom of the mine shaft than at the top.\u00a0 In fact, they were exactly the distance farther apart at the bottom than at the top that would be expected if the center of gravity were 4000 miles out in space!\u00a0 The experimenters were unable to explain this so they just wiped the whole thing from their minds.\nSome hollow earth theorists took this as evidence that we are living on the inside of a hollow planet.\nObviously, this is not the case.\u00a0 We are living on the outside of a hollow planet.\u00a0 We routinely send satellites into orbit about the earth and to other planets.\u00a0 We obviously are living on the outside surface of the planet.\u00a0 Pictures of the earth taken by our satellites show our earth to appear as a ball as observed from the outside of it.\nSo what does this experiment mean?\u00a0 What it means is that the center of gravity is NOT in the center of the earth -- at least for us living on the outer surface of the planet.\u00a0 Another thing this experiment indicates is that gravity is not what we all thought it was, assumed to be an attraction of matter.\u00a0 What it does indicate is that gravity is something else.\nMy study indicates that gravity consists of a flow of an etheric gas that fills the universe into the nucleus of all atoms.\u00a0 It appears that all atoms are hollow, with an electron shell and interior nuclear radiation generator.\u00a0 My theory of gravity requires that the particles in the nucleus of atoms concentrate the ether of space down into spinning balls of ether which become the smallest particle of matter, and are ejected by the nucleus out the south polar opening of the atom and become what we know as the electromagnetic field of the atom.\u00a0 These gyroscopic particles are met by incoming ether which causes the gyroscopic particles to curve around the atom towards the north pole, traveling between layers of electrons orbiting more or less at right angles to the magnetic field lines.\u00a0 The inflow of the ether into the nucleus also keeps the electrons in orbit about the nucleus.\nThe concentration of the ether of space down into spinning balls of matter creates a vacuum in the nucleus in the ether.\u00a0 The ether gas surrounding the atom, then rushes in to fill that vacuum.\u00a0 As it accelerates into the nucleus it exerts a pressure force on all particles of matter it passes pushing them towards the central nucleus. The effect we feel as the ether gas passes through us into the matter of the earth is the weight we feel of our bodies pressing onto the surface of the planet.\u00a0 This ether gas accelerates into the earth and then spreads out in all directions at the central sphere of gravity 700 miles down.\u00a0 The spreading out of the ether gas as it enters the earth's shell and approaches the central sphere of gravity is what caused the plumb bobs to be farther apart at the bottom of the mine shaft than at the top.\u00a0 The plumb bobs actually point to the SOURCE of gravity, which is the ether of space that accelerates into the earth.\nThe discovery that gravity consists of a flow of ether gas has lead to the discovery of gravity control, popularly called anti-gravity.\u00a0 With electrostatic forces using specially shaped capacitors, gravity control has been achieved and is what flying saucers use for propulsion and control.\u00a0 Our government has succeeded in using high powered radar beams to knock some flying saucers out of the sky and have been able to back engineer their gravity control technology.\u00a0 The alien saucers actually are not extraterrestrial, but come from inner earth, where exists a civilization a couple of thousand years more advanced than we are.\u00a0 Their study of the inner sun led them to the discovery of gravity control.\nThe Greenland Ice-hole Gravity Experiment\nA ice-hole gravity experiment in Greenland reported in the February 27, 1989 Physical Review Letters journal discovered that the acceleration of gravity decreases faster than if the center of gravity were in the center of the earth, which would be the case if the earth is hollow.\nA gravity meter lowered toward the central sphere of gravity located in the shell of a hollow earth would require a much more rapid decrease in the acceleration of gravity (red in the chart - actual measurement) than the much more gradual decrease in acceleration (purple in chart - calculated) that would be required to reach zero acceleration in the 4,000 miles to the center of a liquid-solid earth.\nIt could be, also, that the earth's inner sun has a reverse gravity flow together with its solar wind and electromagnetic radiation which allows it to repel the inner surface and helps to keep the inner sun centrally suspended in the hollow.\u00a0 This may also contribute to a healthy inner surface gravity as reported by those explorers who have been there -- that the the inner earth inhabitants have their feet planted just as firmly on the inner surface as we do on the outer.\u00a0 They certainly are not floating around in zero gravity as the science books say would be the case in a hollow planet.\u00a0 Gravity ether flowing into the inner surface towards the central sphere of gravity in the shell also would help to provide an inner surface gravity, although it is suspected to be less than our outer surface gravity.\nI have also recalculated the densities of all the so-called \"gaseous\" planets, including the sun, and if they are all hollow with shell thicknesses about 10% of their diameter, they would all have solid surfaces, except Saturn.\u00a0 It would have to have a shell that is 5% of his diameter in thickness to have a solid surface.\u00a0 Even the sun I have calculated would have a solid surface at a density of 2.9.\u00a0 It is known that the surface of the sun is cooler than it's atmosphere.\u00a0 My study indicates that the sun is a hollow crystal ball.\u00a0 Solar radiation generating cells were discovered by Skylab to be stationary, indicating it has a solid surface.\u00a0 Gravity ether flowing into the sun is converted by these solar magnetic cells into electromagnetic radiation and solar wind particles.\nThe sun has an electromagnetic field caused by the rotation of its crystal shell about its inner sun. If the sun were a gaseous planet, it could not produce an electromagnetic field. From an article in the Scientific American comes this significant confession: \"In 1934, Thomas G. Cowling of the University of Leeds in England proved that single, symmetrical fluid flows cannot generate magnetic fields...Astronomers cannot explain the galaxies or solar magnetic fields.\" (Mystery of the Missing Dynamo, Scientific American, p. 24, January 1995)\nBecause astronomers believe stars are gaseous and planets have liquid interiors they cannot explain the observed magnetic fields in suns or planets. Scientists today teach that the sun and stars are composed entirely of gases. But Skylab photography revealed that the nuclear reactions on the sun emanate from permanent stationary \"nuclear cells.\" Such permanency strongly indicates that the surface of the sun is solid, not liquid nor gaseous. In fact, the surface of the sun is relatively quite cool compared to its upper atmosphere.\u00a0 If the sun has a shell that is perhaps 10% of the planet's diameter in thickness, I have calculated that it's shell would be solid having a density of 2.86 gm/cc, which is a little denser than glass.\u00a0 As such, the sun could easily be a giant crystal globe!\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, Skylab discovered that the sun has permanent coronal holes at its poles taken in X-ray and ultra violet images that could indicate it has polar openings also.\nMy study of gravity indicates that our earth as well as all planets are actually hollow.\u00a0 The sun and the supposedly gaseous planets all have strong magnetic fields.\u00a0 They could not have magnetic fields if they are completely gaseous, or if the planets have liquid interiors.\u00a0 This indicates that they have solid shells that rotate at different speeds than their inner suns.\u00a0 By recalculating the planets and sun's masses assuming that the greatest portion of their mass is in the shell, all would have solid surfaces -- thus making it possible that these planets can generate the magnetic fields that they have been observed to have.\nAll the outer planets were found by the Voyager spacecraft to emit more energy than they receive from the sun.\u00a0 Radiation is emitted from their polar openings from their inner suns to light up auroras over their poles just like our inner sun does here on earth.\nSo how does gravity work in a polar opening?\u00a0 The answer is that since by far the greatest portion of the earth's mass is located in its shell, then that is where gravity accelerates towards.\u00a0 Therefore, as one advances through the polar opening, the water and the ship are not accelerated towards the center of the earth, but towards the central sphere of gravity located in its shell.\u00a0 As such, the water of the ocean adheres to the side of the polar opening, just as the earth's oceans adhere to the sides of its outer surface.\u00a0 More than likely, however, one would weigh less at the neck of the polar opening than further outside of it because of the mass of the earth that would at that point be directly above one's head.\u00a0 Admiral Byrd was amazed when he flew through the south polar opening and saw what appeared to be a continent hanging in the sky above his head.\u00a0 As Olaf Jansen sailed through the north polar opening in 1829, he saw the sun reflecting off the ocean on the opposite side of the polar opening and said it appeared to be a very bright star he could see for several days as they were sailing through an open sea after they passed the ice.\u00a0 He did not know what star it was or what caused it, but was surprised to see a star in the bright sunlight of day.\u00a0 Of course, it was not a star, but the sun being reflected off the surface of the ocean on the opposite side of the opening as they sailed through it.\u00a0 Olaf reported it being quite warm for Arctic weather as they passed through the polar opening. The sun would circle high up in the sky and then almost down to the horizon each day as they passed through the opening.\u00a0 At noon, the sun was observed to be directly overhead as if they were at the equator.\u00a0 This could only happen if they were actually passing through a quite large polar opening, where at one point on the curvature into the interior, our outer sun would shine down directly from above.\nWe will observe this when we go on our expedition to the inner earth.\u00a0 We will use the ship's radar to bounce radio waves off the opposite side of the opening and so determine the exact shape and size of the north polar opening.\u00a0 Once on the interior, we will also use the radar to determine the distance to the inner sun and the opposite side of the hollow, and thus confirm the thickness of the earth's shell.\u00a0 We will take a weight scale with us and use it to determine the gravity difference going through the polar opening and on the earth's interior as compared to the outside surface of the planet.\u00a0 We will document all of this and our scientific observations will shatter the inner earth sciences taught in our schools today.\u00a0 These professors and scientists who call us Morons and Hollow Heads and claim to know so much about our earth's interior will have to eat their own words.\nWe believe this expedition will be the greatest expedition in all of history.\u00a0 The truths we will return with will be earth shattering to establishment science.\u00a0 It will all be documented in color, theater format for all the world to witness.\nOn December 23, 2004, I was\u00a0on the Art Bell Coast to Coast AM Radio Show with George Noory.\u00a0 See my Coast to Coast AM interview with George Noory Thursday, December 23, 2004 .\nAlso, on November 30, 2004, I did an interview with a Journalist from Greece, Ioannis Moutsos, with the ALTER Channel, regarding the Hollow Earth theory and our upcoming expedition, Voyage to Our Hollow Earth Expedition Cruise.\u00a0 He had some interesting questions to ask.\u00a0 His\u00a0first question\u00a0was:\nWhere does the theory of the Hollow Earth stem from?\nI related to this Greek journalist that the Hollow Earth theory is a very old theory.\u00a0 I just received in the mail today a book written by Dorothy Leon, Quest for Inner Earth, from TGS Publishers, http://www.HiddenMysteries.com in which she quotes many of these ancient hollow earth theorists and explorers.\nThe very first hollow earth explorer we have any record of was Enoch.\nEnoch lived before the world-wide flood of Noah.\u00a0 In fact, Noah was\u00a0Enoch's great grandson.\u00a0 Enoch was a prolific writer, writing many dozens of books, only one or two of which have survived the centuries for us to read.\u00a0 He was a prophet of God, leader of the City of Zion, who defended his people by the word of God, from all the armies of the world.\u00a0 In Moses 7.13, we read, \"And so great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.\" So effective was his teaching that his people became so righteous that eventually he and his city were taken alive -- buildings and all \"up into heaven,\" to the Heaven of this earth -- to the Inner Sun of Our Hollow Earth.\nEnoch's\u00a0City of Zion has actually been seen by some who have died, who were then later medically resuscitated.\u00a0 While out of the body, one such person described being taken through a dark tunnel through the earth's shell, and coming out into the brilliant light\u00a0of the Inner Sun.\u00a0 She said, \"I went through this dark tunnel...I went into the black tunnel and came out into brilliant light...A little bit later on I was there with my grandparents and my father and my brother, who had died...There was the most beautiful, brilliant light all around. And this was a beautiful place. There were colors -- bright colors -- not like here on earth, but just indescribable. There were people there, happy people... People were around, some of them gathered in groups. Some of them were learning... Off in the distance...I could see a city. There were buildings -- separate buildings. They were gleaming, bright. People were happy in there. There was sparkling water, fountains... a city of light I guess would be the way to say it... It was wonderful. There was beautiful music. Everything was just glowing, wonderful... But if I had entered into this, I think I would never have returned... I was told that if I went there I couldn't go back (to life on earth) ...that the decision was mine.\" (REFLECTIONS ON LIFE AFTER LIFE, by Raymond Moody, pp. 15-17)\nJesus Christ had great admiration for Enoch and quoted from him several times\u00a0as recorded in the gospels of the Bible.\u00a0 Yet none of Enoch's books were included in the Bible.\u00a0\u00a0Fragments from ten of Enoch's manuscripts were found in the caves of Qumran in Palestine\u00a0in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovery.\nOne Book of Enoch, written in the Aramaic language of Jesus' time has survived the centuries, and was translated by R. H. Charles.\u00a0\u00a0In this book, Enoch wrote, \"And I went from then to the MIDDLE OF THE EARTH, and I saw a blessed place in which there were trees with branches abiding and blooming.\" (Chap 26:1)\u00a0 He speaks also of the ABYSS in the earth -- his word for the hollow of our earth.\u00a0 He spoke of \"columns of FIRE\" that struggle \"together to the end of the ABYSS\" referring to the solar wind from the inner sun that emanates out through the polar openings\u00a0to light up the auroras\u00a0at the polar ends of the earth.\u00a0(Chap 21:4-5) He speaks of the four rivers that come out of the Garden of Eden that \"take their course in the CAVITY OF THE NORTH\" indicating that he knew the north polar opening exists and within the earth is located the lost Garden of Eden and its four rivers that flow to the four points of the compass thus giving the earth \"four corners\" that the scriptures speak of. (see Isa 11:12).\u00a0 Enoch knew that the righteous dead are taken to the inner sun Paradise or Heaven of the Spiritual World of this earth saying, \"and thus have the spirits of the righteous been separated.\u00a0 Namely, by a CHASM (the hollow), by WATER (the earth's shell covered with oceans), and by LIGHT (the inner sun) above it.\"(Chap 22:9-10).\nIn the Book of Moses, revealed to the American prophet Joseph Smith, in a passage about Enoch is recorded, \"And it came to pass that Enoch looked upon the earth; and he heard a voice from the BOWELS thereof saying:\u00a0 Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; I am pained, I am weary, because of the wickedness of my children.\u00a0 When shall I rest, and be cleansed from the filthiness which is gone FORTH OUT OF ME?\u00a0 When will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest, and righteousness for a season abide upon my FACE?\"\u00a0 (Moses 7:48)\nEnoch knew, as was revealed to Job, that our \"Mother\" earth has a WOMB from whence our first parents emerged to outer earth.\u00a0 The fresh water icebergs of the Arctic also emerge from Inner Earth through the North Polar Opening.\u00a0 To Job, the Lord asked, \"Out of WHOSE WOMB came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who had gendered it?\u00a0 The waters are hid as with a stone (icebergs), and the face of the deep is frozen.\" (Job 37:14,15)\u00a0 Many exotic animals from Inner Earth have been found entombed in the Arctic ice on Arctic shores, such as the woolly mammoth, hairy rhinoceros, giant deer, and lion, that, according to\u00a0Hollow Earth explorer, Olaf Jansen ,\u00a0fell into inner earth rivers that freeze over in the Arctic winter where they instantly died, frozen and subsequently\u00a0washed out to sea\u00a0ending up on\u00a0the shores of Siberia.\nFrom the Forgotten Books of Eden, in\u00a0the Book of Adam and Eve, we learn that our first parents were inhabitants of Our Hollow Earth, and journeyed to outer earth through communicating caverns from the Garden of Eden within.\u00a0 When the Lord expelled them from the Garden of Eden, he told them to go dwell in the Cave of Treasures, where they got lost.\u00a0 After wandering many, many days in the cavern they emerged to our outer world and remarked that our sun was hot and more brilliant than the soft light of the inner sun that shone in the Garden of Eden of the Inner World.\u00a0 Chapter XVI says that, \"Inasmuch as while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and the sound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the brilliant light of the sun, neither did the flaming heat thereof touch his body.\"\nHollow Earth researcher, Bruce Walton, made an excellent case that I-AM-THE-MAN of the book, ETIDORPHA, was actually William Morgan , an initiate of Free Masonry\u00a0who decided to publish their secret rites in 1826.\u00a0 I have a copy of his book.\u00a0 For publishing their secret rites, the Free Masons had him thrown in jail for a small debt.\u00a0 They then kidnapped him out of jail and threw a dead body in a lake saying it was William Morgan's, but\u00a0actually took him to a cavern in Kentucky and condemned him to a journey\u00a0 with an Inner Earth Guide to Our Hollow Earth through communicating caverns.\u00a0\u00a0Many years later, I-AM-THE-MAN returned with a manuscript of his journey to Our Hollow Earth which\u00a0was published by John\u00a0Uri Lloyd as ETIDORPHA OR THE END OF THE WORLD in 1896.\u00a0\u00a0That cavern in Kentucky most probably is the Mammoth Cave, the most extensive cavern system in North\u00a0America.\u00a0 It is reported that the end of\u00a0this cavern system has not been found.\u00a0 Perhaps it was\u00a0through this cavern system that our first parents, Adam and Eve, emerged to our outer world from the Garden of Eden from the world within.\nThroughout the centuries, as explained in Dorothy Leon's book, explorers have reached Our Hollow Earth, and many authors have written about this Secret of the Ages. The Epic of Gilgamesh, from the Myths from Mesopotamia, by N. K. Sanders, Peguin, MD, 1960, an explorer reached Inner Earth through communicating\u00a0tunnels (probably built by the anti-deluvians).\u00a0 The epic relates, \"After nine leagues in the TUNNELS, he felt not the wind on his face, but the darkness was thick...After eleven leagues the dawn of light (Inner Sun) appeared.\u00a0 At the end of twelve leagues the (inner) SUN streamed out...There was the Garden of the Gods.\"\nAmong those\u00a0authors\u00a0and explorers that have proposed\u00a0our Earth is Hollow, interestingly enough, were some\u00a0highly respected scientists of the early Industrial\u00a0Revolution.\u00a0 In 1692, British astronomer Edmund Halley,\u00a0theorized that our earth is hollow with several inner concentric shells to explain the earth's electromagnetic field which curiously is not aligned with the earth's rotational axis, as logic would indicate it should. Author Augus Armitage wrote, \"Halley, in fact conceived the Earth as consisting of an OUTER SHELL with two magnetic poles, and an INNER NUCLEUS, concentric with the shell and possessing two poles of its own. The magnetic axis or shell and nucleus were INCLINED TO EACH OTHER (they do not coincide) and to the axis of the Earth's diurnal rotation, about which the two components TURNED AT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RATES; this DIFFERENCE GAVE RISE TO A SLOW RELATIVE MOTION OF THE MAGNETIC POLES with a consequent change in the magnetic variation. In the period required for the shell to gain (or lose) one complete rotation on the nucleus, the variation would go through a complete cycle and return everywhere to its initial value. This period might well be a long one, PERHAPS ABOUT 700 YEARS...he thought that the nucleus was rotating more slowly than the shell.\"\nThe rotational orientation of the Inner Sun is different than the rotational axis of the Earth -- causing the magnetic poles to be located half way between the two axis.\u00a0 Since the Inner Sun rotates slowly -- taking about 700 years to make one rotation, this causes the earth's magnetic field to rotate slowly around the earth.\u00a0 Scientists estimate that the North Magnetic Pole, presently located in Northern Canada moves northwest at about 8 miles per year.\u00a0 The different rotational rate of the Inner Sun as opposed to the earth's shell, both having electrical charges, is what gives rise to earth's strong magnetic field.\nAnother scientist, a Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, theorized in 1741 that the Earth is hollow with an interior sun and is inhabited within.\u00a0 Euler was a famous mathematician and his formulas in engineering are still taught in universities today.\nA Scottish scientist, Sir John Leslie, in the early 1800's theorized that the earth is hollow, but proposed that it contains two inner suns orbiting about each other.\nIn 1913, and again in 1920, Marshall B. Gardner, wrote a book, A Journey to the Earth's Interior, Or Have the Poles Really Been Discovered.\u00a0 His book was very well researched.\u00a0 He sent it to the United States government and challenged them to check out the hollow earth theory.\u00a0 Most likely, the government DID take Gardner up on his challenge, and sent Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd to check the theory out.\u00a0 In 1981, I took my family and we flew to Fairbanks, Alaska to check out the hollow earth theory.\u00a0 While there, I met\u00a0John Gagne, who had gone to Alaska several years previously searching for evidence of Our Hollow Earth.\u00a0 He related to me that while working as a Radio Anchorman in Juneau, the Alaska capitol, one weekend he was out with his friends up a canyon near the city, they saw a UFO light up on the top of a nearby mountain.\u00a0 It presently turned red and zipped off into space.\u00a0 Back on the radio station he brought up the subject of the UFO he and his buddies had seen.\u00a0 Shortly after that, he related, a woman named Sylvia Darvell came into his office and told him about her dear friend, Admiral Richard E. Byrd's discovery.\u00a0 She said she had been involved in Alaskan politics for many years and was a close friend of the Admiral.\u00a0 She said that after the Admiral had made a flight into the Arctic in the winter of 1947, he had come to her and told her what he found.\u00a0 The Admiral told her that after flying beyond the pole he had come to open ocean, then a continent covered with lush vegetation where a mammoth was sighted wandering below.\u00a0 He reported that soon he was sided by flying craft that have since come to be known as flying saucers, which took control of his craft and landed him near an inner earth city.\u00a0 He was taken into the inner earth city and interviewed by a government official of that land beyond the pole, who gave him a message to return to the United States government.\u00a0 The message was that the Inner Earth government was concerned about our use of nuclear weapons, and that they don't want us using nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We had just blown up Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan the year before and the Inner World peoples\u00a0told Admiral Byrd that they don't want us using nuclear weapons anymore.\u00a0 Admiral Byrd was then taken back to his airplane and put back in the air.\u00a0 When he returned to outer earth, he delivered the Inner Earth message to Washington, where he was put under strict orders not to reveal his discovery to anyone.\u00a0 But Admiral Byrd just couldn't keep his discovery a secret.\u00a0 He tried time and again to let people know about the greatest discovery of all time -- that Our Earth IS HOLLOW and is inhabited by a very far advanced race of people that know all about us of the outer world.\u00a0 The Admiral confided his discovery to his close friend Sylvia Darvell of Alaska.\u00a0 He let his family know of his discovery, and they say that he even wrote a book about his discovery and had it in the bookstores, but they were all confiscated by government agents.\u00a0 John Gagne told me that the Admiral's close relatives let him know that they have a copy of that book, but keep it constantly under lock and key.\u00a0 Admiral Byrd died a very sad man because he was not allowed by our government to disclose his discovery that Our Earth is Hollow to we, the people.\nOther scientists have proposed that not only is Our Earth\u00a0Hollow, but also our Moon.\u00a0\u00a0In the mid 1970's Vasin and Shcherbakov from the Soviet Academy of Sciences suggested that our moon is hollow.\u00a0 Author Don Wilson picked up on their theory and wrote a very well documented book, Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon , showing that\u00a0evidence from the Apollo moon\u00a0missions indicate that\u00a0our moon\u00a0is a hollow planet also.\nEvidence indicates that all planets are hollow.\u00a0 On my website I have a photo of the North Polar Opening of MARS , taken by the Space Hubble Telescope, showing what looks like a giant crater at the north pole of Mars.\u00a0 If you look closely, you can see the clouds down inside the depression on the sides of the polar opening into the interior of Mars.\u00a0 Not only is Our Earth Hollow, and inhabited within, but our Moon is hollow, as well as Mars.\u00a0\u00a0Evidence continues to accumulate that all the planets, moons, and even the Sun are hollow planets, and most likely all inhabited WITHIN.\nIn our upcoming expedition, Voyage to Our Hollow Earth, we are inviting any of you interested scientists, explorers, tourists and journalists\u00a0to join us in a real life attempt to discover Our\u00a0Hollow Earth.\u00a0 We intend to prove the validity of this theory. We\u00a0are chartering a Russian nuclear icebreaker, the Yamal, to journey to the north pole from Murmansk, Russia, through the ice, and then south on the 142nd Meridian towards 87.7 N latitude where we estimate\u00a0the North Polar Opening is located.\u00a0 We will attempt to\u00a0enter therein and visit the friendly people of\u00a0Inner Earth.\u00a0 We invite all interested voyagers to join us on this --\u00a0the greatest expedition\u00a0of all time, by\u00a0we, the people of outer earth.\nFrom Murmansk, Russia, that Arctic port city where my brother-in-law\u00a0says he used to watch very closely via US spy satellites to see all the coming and goings of the Russian northern military fleet, we will head north toward the geographic north pole.\u00a0 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the fleet of nuclear icebreakers, although owned by the Russian government, have been\u00a0leased and operated by the private Murmansk company to take tourists on polar expeditions.\u00a0 We are chartering the Yamal to take us to the North Polar Opening leading to Inner Earth.\nAfter leaving Murmansk, we will be traveling north through open ocean for about a thousand miles.\u00a0 We will come into ice\u00a0near the Franz Josef Land islands, which\u00a0belongs to Russia.\u00a0 It was from Franz Josef Land that the Norwegian fishermen Olaf and Jens Jansen sailed northeast through a lead in the ice in 1829 and accidentally discovered the North Polar Opening, as described in his book, The Smoky God , published in 1908 by his friend Willis George Emerson, a US western entrepreneur, realtor and author, shortly after Olaf died as his dying wish.\nThrough the open ocean our ship travels at a speed of about 19.5 knots, which is 22.4 miles an hour, so we should arrive at the Franz Josef Land islands in about two days from Murmansk.\u00a0 As we begin our journey through the arctic ice from the Franz Josef Land islands to the pole, the going will be slower, about 12 knots, which is about 13.8 miles an hour.\u00a0 Our ship, the Yamal, carries a helicopter on its rear helicopter pad that is used at times to scout out over the ice to find leads of open water to go through to make the going easier and faster.\u00a0 Voyagers may take turns going out on these scouting excursions on the helicopter.\u00a0 From the Franz Josef Land islands to the pole is about 400 miles, so we should arrive at the geographic north pole in about 1 1/2 days, where the plank\u00a0will be lowered to the ice and any that want can go down on the ice and dance around a pole we will drive into the ice to represent the north pole end of the earth.\nAfter the north pole dance and celebration, we will take up the plank and set our bearings south on the 141st meridian, which is the meridian that goes over the New Siberian Islands north of Siberia, Russia, where many thousands of mammoth tusks and skeletons have been found down through the ages.\u00a0 Some dead mammoths have even been found frozen in the arctic ice that have washed up on these shores, and have been cut up for meat.\u00a0 Other wild exotic animal life that has also washed up on these shores are the woolly rhino, steppe lions, giant deer,\u00a0foxes and a hardy breed of horse which scientists claim are all prehistoric, but which Hollow Earth theorists claim more than likely came from the north through the polar opening from inside the earth where these animals live today.\u00a0 In winter they often\u00a0wander out onto the ice frozen-over river mouths of inner earth. Some fall into crevasses\u00a0in the ice, then come summer\u00a0they are\u00a0washed out to sea eventually floating out\u00a0of the polar opening in their tombs of ice, later unloading them onto arctic shores.\u00a0 Curiously, the greatest number of woolly mammoth remains\u00a0have been found directly south of the location we estimate the polar opening to be located -- washed up on the New Siberian Islands and on down into northern Siberia.\u00a0 Many of them may have been washed out of Inner Earth by Noah's flood, 3,300 years before Christ.\nMy estimate is that we will enter the North Polar Opening going south on the 142nd meridian from the geographic north pole.\u00a0\u00a0The first 570 miles will be through ice before we reach the open ocean within the polar opening.\u00a0 In\u00a0another 630 miles, we will reach the inner continent which I estimate is located\u00a0about half-way through the polar opening.\u00a0 Mirages of this continent have been sighted all around the arctic for centuries.\u00a0 Admiral Peary sighted it northwest of\u00a0Ellesmere Island on the northern shores of Canada in 1909 on his way to the pole.\u00a0 He believed it was real land he was seeing and even named it Crockerland.\u00a0 Dr. Cook\u00a0in 1906 saw it also northwest of his trek to the pole from Ellesmere Island and even took a picture of it as a background to his dogs and sledges.\u00a0 He named it Bradleyland.\u00a0 Captain Keenan sighted this land northwest of Harrison Bay, Alaska.\u00a0 The Russians have seen it north of the New Siberian Islands and named it Sannikov land.\u00a0\u00a0All these sightings of land in the arctic sea all point in one direction -- to 142 E Longitude and 87.7 N Latitude, the coordinates where I have\u00a0triangulated the location of the North Polar Opening based on the direction that\u00a0sightings of mirages of land have been seen from all around the Arctic Ocean.\nIt must be realized that\u00a0in the Arctic, a mirage is the exact opposite of a mirage down in the lower latitudes.\u00a0 In the lower latitudes, if you are looking down a highway on a hot day and a hot layer of air is rising from the pavement,\u00a0it looks like water, because it is reflecting the sky.\u00a0 In the far northern arctic, warm air rising up out of the polar opening rises\u00a0high up above one's head and so if you look up and see land, you are actually seeing land, because the warm layer of air above you reflects the ground below.\u00a0 It is called temperature inversion, because in the lower latitudes, it usually gets colder the higher up you go.\u00a0 In the Arctic and Antarctic, it is the opposite.\u00a0 There it is coldest down next to the ice, and gets warmer with altitude -- because\u00a0the warm air rising up out of the openings rises up above the ice.\u00a0 This layer of warm air causes what is called the \"water sky\" -- in which the surface of the ocean at times can be seen in the sky showing leads in the ice, which explorers would use to help guide their way around the leads.\nLt. Green, the physicist explorer with Admiral Peary believed that land actually exists out in the polar sea, which is not marked on any map today.\u00a0 In his 1923 article in Popular Science Monthly magazine, Lt. Green concluded that the Lost Viking colonies of Greenland had migrated to that unknown land.\u00a0 He asked the Greenland Eskimos what had happened to the colonists who had lived in Greenland for almost a thousand years from the time Eric the Red discovered Greenland west of his home in Iceland in 985 A.D.\u00a0 The Eskimos said that one year a hunting party came back from the north and told the colonists they had found a paradise out over the Arctic wastes -- a place the Eskimo had always known about but didn't go there for fear of \"evil\" spirits they believed protected the place.\u00a0 It lies\", they say, even to this day, \"in the direction of the coastal trail-route north\" in a direction northwest of the northwestern tip of Greenland in the same direction Admiral Peary had sighted a mirage of his Crockerland from Ellesmere Island, Northern Canada.\u00a0 Lt. Green thought it was an island out in an unexplored part of the Arctic sea. His map in his article shows this island located near where I have estimated the North Polar Opening is located.\u00a0 In his article, Lt. Green indicated that he had convinced the Navy to outfit a dirigible to go check out his theory.\u00a0 In 1926, Amundsen and Ellsworth flew a dirigible from Spitzbergen across the pole to Alaska and did not see it, but saw a lot of anomalous fog and noticed an increase of temperature close to the pole.\u00a0 Years later, a Disney movie was made based on Lt. Green's theory that there exists a hidden island in the Arctic Ocean northwest of Ellesmere Island where the Viking Colonists disappeared to.\u00a0 The movie is called Island at the Top of the World.\u00a0 I am certain this land exists, but is actually the inner continent within the polar opening, mirages of which have been seen all around the Arctic basin by Arctic explorers.\nAnother question that is constantly asked of me, is there any danger of\u00a0our ship as it travels on the ocean through the polar opening,\u00a0of\u00a0falling into the hollow earth.\u00a0 The answer is no\u00a0-- because, as any student of physics knows, matter is what causes the phenomenon we know as gravity.\u00a0 Gravity\u00a0accelerates to where the mass of the earth is located, and 99.9% of the mass of\u00a0our hollow\u00a0earth is located in its 800 mile thick shell.\u00a0 As we go through the 90 mile in diameter neck of the polar opening, our ship will be floating on the arctic ocean that gravity has grounded to the sides of the opening -- because gravity accelerates towards the location of the greatest mass -- which will\u00a0always be directly beneath our feet even on the sides of the polar opening.\u00a0 As we pass through the polar opening, we will be able to look up and see the Sun shining off the opposite side of the opening where the ocean is grounded to that side of the opening.\u00a0 The reflection of the Sun off the surface of the ocean directly above our heads 90 miles up will look like a brightly shining star -- just like Olaf saw this reflection and thought it was a star as he was sailing through the north polar opening in 1829.\u00a0 We will notice that the temperature\u00a0begins to increase\u00a0as we pass through the polar opening.\u00a0 We may keep our eyes out for\u00a0floating subtropical trees in the ocean or driftwood that originates from that land beyond the pole.\nA\u00a0lot of people email me and express their concern that we may be impeded in our journey through the polar opening into inner earth by military forces from outer earth wanting to keep the discovery that our earth is hollow from the masses.\u00a0 This is a possibility, but I think unlikely.\u00a0 Certainly, we will pray that the good Lord will protect\u00a0and guide us and help us find the polar opening to\u00a0pass safely through to inner earth on this friendly visit we are attempting to take.\u00a0 Discovery that our earth is hollow is presently considered World Top Secret by those that control the governments of the world.\u00a0 Admiral Byrd was ordered to keep a strict silence about his greatest discovery in all of history -- that our earth is hollow with polar openings.\u00a0 But he couldn't.\u00a0 He kept telling people, and eventually lost his life because of this.\u00a0 However, there are people who have been to our hollow earth and returned, so obviously the Inner Earth peoples are not strictly against people of outer earth knowing about them, or they would not have let them return.\u00a0 What possible harm could knowledge of the friendly people of inner earth be to people of outer earth?\u00a0 None.\u00a0 But our governments are very much afraid of them.\u00a0 They are 2,000 years more advanced than we are in technology.\u00a0 The Inner Earth government regularly sends its flying saucers out to reconnoiter the militaries of outer earth.\u00a0 Their flying saucers piloted by their androids are consistently seen at our atomic weapons bases, military bases, and every time a satellite is lifted off the launching pad into space.\u00a0 They have warned our outer earth governments through Admiral Byrd against our use of nuclear weapons because they share this earth with us and don't want it destroyed.\nWhen Steve was approached by an agent of the Illuminati in Argentina at a Voyage to Our Hollow Earth conference held there, he was even offered to have this expedition paid for by them.\u00a0 So they must not be too opposed to our going there.\u00a0 Certainly not enough to send the military to impede us from entering Inner Earth.\u00a0 The secrecy they maintain of the discovery that our earth is hollow is maintained primarily through their control of the governments, media, business\u00a0and education -- through silence and false inner earth theories such as the molten core.\u00a0 Their scientists ignore the fact that the earth rings like a bell for several hours after a large earthquake.\u00a0 The earth was reported to be ringing after a couple of weeks after the earthquake in the south Pacific that caused the recent Tsunami.\u00a0 A bell is hollow and made of metal, just as our earth most likely is.\u00a0 Actually, they are hoping that their scientists will be able to back engineer the flying saucers the military has knocked out of the sky, which Dr. Greer's ex-military\u00a0expert witnesses have testified that they have knocked at least a dozen out of the sky, and have actually been able to build a version of these flying saucers in underground black projects.\u00a0 They\u00a0hope they will be able to build enough of these craft so that some day in the future they will be able to stand up to the power of Inner Earth.\u00a0\u00a0My take on this is that\u00a0indications from scriptural prophecy are that they will be unsuccessful in their power quest over Inner Earth.\nWhich brings me to the next big concern of many who email me --\u00a0regarding the RISK of attempting to venture into inner earth through the polar opening.\u00a0 I concede there is a risk.\u00a0 There is a risk in anything we do.\u00a0 Any day, any one of us can venture out of our homes onto the streets and be killed in\u00a0a car accident.\u00a0 But I think the opportunity we have here of making it to Inner Earth to discover what has been hidden from us by our servants in the government far outweighs any risk we may encounter.\u00a0 Certainly, the comfort and amenities of our cruise ship will indeed make our excursion most pleasurable with climate controlled cabins all with a port hole window to see out onto the arctic sea -- with a highly experienced crew that will feed us all like kings.\u00a0 With the cruising range\u00a0of the Yamal\u00a0of over 4 years worth of nuclear fuel, there is no chance we will get lost.\u00a0 The greatest RISK I see are all those that are staying\u00a0BEHIND here on outer earth.\u00a0 Many voyagers will be ecstatic to visit the peace loving people of inner earth where no wars, no sickness and disease have plagued them for millennia.\u00a0 Many voyagers have indicated that they\u00a0even want to stay when we get there.\nWhen I say there is a greater RISK of those staying behind, consider this.\u00a0 A couple of years ago, the auditing offices of both the executive and legislative bodies of the US federal government reported that we will be unable to sustain the national debt past the year 2009.\u00a0 Which means the US federal government is going to go bankrupt.\u00a0 Not only will this destroy the US economy, but the oil companies owned by the Illuminati can then cut off our oil and bring all transportation to a halt.\u00a0 This is actually prophesied in scripture.\nMicah 5:9-15, also 3 Nephi 21:\n10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:\n11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:\n12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:\n13 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.\n14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.\n15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.\nWith all trucking stopped, food into the cities will also stop,\u00a0the people will begin to starve.\u00a0 Since governments at all levels run on money, with no money, governments will cease to function -- and anarchy and chaos will ensue.\nThen there is an even greater danger.\u00a0 Since the 1700's when Amchel Rothchild set\u00a0up the first central bank in Germany, and then sent his sons out to set up central banks in all other countries, and eventually even the US\u00a0Federal Reserve Bank, which,\u00a0contrary to what you might suppose, is not an agency of the federal government, but is actually a privately owned bank -- owned by the Super Rich International Bankers of the Illuminati, Amchel figured out how to get a government to pay up should it default on its loans to his bank.\u00a0 His solution was use the interest money made to build up an enemy country or countries which he could then use to repossess the defaulting country.\u00a0\u00a0This is exactly what happened to Germany in the Second World War.\u00a0 The allies were the pawns in the hands of the Illuminati International Bankers in repossessing Hitler's Germany because shortly after he was elected Chancellor of Germany before the war he had nationalized their central bank when he\u00a0learned they were refusing to lend money to his farmers!\nNow the US\u00a0has just repossessed another country for\u00a0the bankers\u00a0-- Iraq.\u00a0 But what most people don't realize here in the US, is we're next!\u00a0 When the US federal government goes bankrupt, we will be invaded by all the countries of the world that the Illuminati can throw against us -- to repossess us of what\u00a0our faithful servants in Congress have so blindly\u00a0done in mortgaging our whole country to the Fed.\u00a0 Think about it.\u00a0 What happens\u00a0when you don't make\u00a0the mortgage payment on your house?\u00a0 Of course, your house gets repossessed by the bank!\u00a0 The same happens for countries, and hence we find the cause of all the wars that have plagued us over the centuries.\u00a0\u00a0The bankers have a wonderful time making money off both sides of a war, while we, the people, pay for this in blood, sweat and tears.\u00a0 When Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, and then passed the Income Tax to pay the interest on money borrowed by our government, they set up a gigantic PONZI scheme.\u00a0 And how does it work?\u00a0 No money is put into circulation until someone borrows from the Fed.\u00a0Federal Reserve dollars are Notes -- a debt instrument.\u00a0 But no money is ever put into circulation to pay the interest on that debt.\u00a0 So as debt is paid off, that money goes out of circulation.\u00a0 And since no money is created to pay the interest, a certain number of individuals and businesses every year must go bankrupt to pay the interest.\u00a0 So then the bankers get hard goods for worthless paper.\u00a0 Thus the Illuminati owners of the Federal Reserve have been slowly coming into ownership of most of America -- through their ponzi banking scheme that causes bankruptcies.\u00a0 The federal government at the end of the Great Depression discovered that they had\u00a0become the customer of last resort in this ponzi scheme, in order to keep the\u00a0economy\u00a0going -- by continually borrowing more and more money to keep money in circulation so the economy won't go into a slump.\u00a0 So now our national debt is going straight up like a rocket\u00a0with $7 trillion and counting -- and our own government accounting offices estimate\u00a0the economy\u00a0will be unable to pay the interest on this mushrooming\u00a0debt by the year 2009.\u00a0 It could happen sooner because of the great expense of President Bush's war on terror,\u00a0his\u00a0Medicare\u00a0for drugs boondoggle, and continuous pork\u00a0spending\u00a0by a Congress that sees no tomorrow.\nOur first President, George Washington, saw in a vision given to him by an angel at Valley Forge, that at the end of the age, our country would be attacked by all the countries of the world.\u00a0 He saw that the good Lord would send help towards the end of the war when our countrymen were almost to give up the fight for our freedom -- but not without great loss.\u00a0 This\u00a0also has been predicted in scripture, see Joel 2, Isaiah 3:12-26 and Ezekiel 39:6.\u00a0 See my paper on The Coming Attack on the United States on my website.\nMy question is:\u00a0 Do you want to be here at that time? Or do you yearn for what\u00a0many of our voyagers want -- to go to\u00a0Inner Earth where peace has always ruled -- in the inner earth Kingdom of God.\u00a0 Olaf Jansen reported that their God is Jehovah -- the God of the ancient Israelites.\u00a0 So we believe they are the Lost Tribes of Israel.\u00a0 Many of us are descendants of the Vikings who settled Europe in the middle ages and who trace their ancestry back through mounds where\u00a0they would\u00a0bury their dead everywhere they migrated back to the Ten Tribes of Israel who after escaping the Assyrians in 687 B.C., escaped up over the Caucasus Mountains -- hence many of us are Caucasians -- actually descendants of the Tribes of Israel.\u00a0 But the Biblical Apocrypha states that a large group of the Ten Tribes went further north.\u00a0 A few years ago, archeologists found a burial of Caucasians in northern Mongolia.\u00a0 Perhaps that is the route they took.\u00a0 North of Mongolia are the New Siberian Islands, and north of the New Siberian Islands have been the sightings of the mirage of Sannikov land -- that land within the polar opening that Arctic explorers have seen mirages of from all around the Arctic Ocean.\u00a0 There must be a port city on that inner continent bordering on the open polar sea -- because at times when the arctic air is right a mirage of a city has been seen in Alaska towards the north\u00a0of curious architecture.\u00a0 Could it be the port city of Jehu that Olaf Jansen and his father were taken to after being picked up on the River Hiddekel soon after reaching the inner continent?\nWe hope to find out.\u00a0 On our Voyage to Our Hollow Earth, as we arrive at the inner continent, we will attempt to locate the River Hiddekel, which Olaf and his father\u00a0sailed up after reaching the inner continent.\u00a0 Perhaps we will be met there by a ship from inner earth, just as Olaf and his father were, when\u00a0they were taken to their port city called Jehu.\u00a0 Olaf and his father were taken in by a family of Inner Earth and taught their language, which he reported is similar to Sanskrit.\u00a0 But inner earth peoples have since also learned\u00a0to speak English.\u00a0 Reinhold Schmidt of Los Angeles was taken to Inner Earth by a flying saucer through the north polar opening in 1958.\u00a0 Being of German descent, Reinhold\u00a0said that the ufonauts\u00a0looked like humans but larger in stature, spoke to him in perfect English, but between themselves spoke a language his father had taught him called High German.\nAfter spending a year at Jehu, Olaf and his father were taken overland to their capital city of Eden on a monorail train he said were powered by anti-gravity flywheels above each car.\u00a0 At Jehu, our expedition hopes to also take this monorail trip to the capital city of Inner Earth, located around that primeval lost Garden of Eden\u00a0where our first parents,\u00a0Adam and Eve\u00a0dwelt, there to visit the palace of the King of the Inner World, called by Olaf Jansen, the Great High Priest over all the Land.\u00a0 My research indicates that he is a Jew, a descendant of King David, whom the Lord promised that there never would be a time when a son of his would not reign over the House of Israel on the throne of the Kingdom of God ( Psalms 89:3, 4, 28-37) .\u00a0 The scriptures indicate that this King in the last days would be called David, after his ancestor, and that he will deliver his throne to Jesus Christ at this Second Coming ( JEREMIAH 23:5-8, EZEKIEL 34:22-24).\u00a0 Rev. Chapter 9 indicates that\u00a0flying saucers from this Kingdom will emerge from Inner earth like locusts toward the end of the coming attack on the United States.\u00a0 I believe they will be the help the Lord will send to save our country from total destruction in the coming war of repossession.\nDo you want to come with us on our Voyage to Inner Earth?\u00a0 We are certain we will find the North Polar Opening.\u00a0 Many of us would just rather stay there once we arrive -- just like in the movie Lost Horizon.\u00a0 The second version of this movie was done in full color, in which Richard Conway and fellow travelers\u00a0were kidnapped in a DC-3 and flown into the Himalaya mountains where they were taken in by the people of Shangri-la.\u00a0 It is based on the 1937 novel by James Hilton, the movie which can be obtained through www.moviehunter.tv .\u00a0 It\u00a0is actually based on the Tibetan legend of Agharta, which is their name for hollow earth.\u00a0\u00a0In the movie, the cavern leading to Shangri-la is only about 500 feet long from the blowing blizzard outside to the warm sun-shinning valley inside of Shangri-la.\u00a0 Steve Currey, our expedition organizer\u00a0discovered the place where this cavern actually exists behind a hidden falls in the Tsangpo Gorge in Tibet, as graphically portrayed in a National Geographic video commentary, a copy of which Steve has.\u00a0 The cavern actually leads to\u00a0Our Hollow Earth and\u00a0is much longer than the movie depicted.\u00a0 It leads all the way\u00a0through the 800 mile thick shell of\u00a0our hollow\u00a0earth to Inner Earth, but as reported by one adventurer is sealed off by a great metal door several miles beneath the surface.\u00a0The Tibetan lamas yearly take pack animal excursions down to the door and knock on it hoping the King of Agharta will emerge with his people to help establish world peace as he promised\u00a0in 1890 when he emerged from that cavern to speak to their ancestors.\u00a0 His prophecy to them indicates this will happen in 2011.\nThe voyagers going on this expedition are very special people \u2013 we will be the first persons this century visiting the paradise of Inner Earth -- that we know of.\nIf you would like to get an idea of what the paradise of Inner Earth is like, you may want order Lost Horizon, the full color 1973 version, at www.moviehunter.tv .\u00a0 I was able to get this video at that website after searching for 20 years for it.\u00a0 It is not sold in any store.\u00a0 It\u2019s the story of Richard Conway and his 4 fellow travelers that were kidnapped and flown into the Himalayan mountains where the pilot from Shangri-La crash landed their DC-3 in a canyon and was killed on impact, but the passengers were unscathed and rescued by people from a nearby Lamasery in a valley of the mountains called Shangri-La.\u00a0 After walking through the blizzard and snow up the mountain, the rescuers of Shangri-La took Conway and his friends through a cavern.\u00a0 The blizzard was blowing fiercely as they entered the cavern, but when they emerged on the other side, there was nice sun shinny weather with flowers everywhere in blossom \u2013 a veritable paradise.\nLost Horizon was based on the Tibetan legend of Agharta.\u00a0 This cavern actually does exist.\u00a0 But it is not near the top of a mountain, but behind a hidden falls that our expedition organizer, Steve Currey found in the year 2000 while river rafting down the Tsangpo gorge in Tibet.\u00a0 He was told by the Tibetans that behind that falls is a cavern that goes to Agharta \u2013 their name for Hollow Earth.\u00a0 And the cavern isn\u2019t 500 feet long, as in the movie, but goes through the 800 miles of the earth\u2019s shell to the inner surface of Our Hollow Earth.\nAgharta is not just a legend, but an actual place.\u00a0 It is a paradise \u2013 the location of the Lost Garden of Eden.\u00a0 To think that next year we can actually visit this place \u2013 a place where there is no sickness or disease, where people live to be hundreds of years old with perfect health \u2013 is just mind boggling.\u00a0 I would not miss this for anything in the world.\u00a0 I have been dreaming about going there for over 30 years.\u00a0 And now it is possible.\nDown through the ages, the lost Garden of Eden has been sought by many explorers.\u00a0 Christopher Columbus was in hopes of finding it when he discovered America.\u00a0 Bernardino de Sahagun recorded in his History of the Things of New Spain that the original settlers of America, the ancestors of the American Indians, came in boats from the East in search of the terrestrial paradise. They settled in Central America near the highest mountains they could find, because they had with them an account that the earthly paradise is a very high mountain.\nIndeed, the Garden of Eden is located on the highest mountain plateau of the Inner Continent.\u00a0 The lost Garden of Eden \u2013 the home of our first parents, Adam and Eve \u2013 was found in Our Hollow Earth in 1830 by Olaf and Jens Jansen, the story of which you can find on my website.\u00a0 My estimate of it's location is 800 miles beneath Independence, Missouri, USA.\nOlaf Jansen described the Garden of Eden saying that in this place\u00a0 \"...all manner of fruits, vines, shrubs, trees, and flowers grow in riotous profusion. In this garden four rivers have their source in a mighty artesian fountain. They divide and flow in four directions. This place is called by the inhabitants, the 'navel of the earth' or the beginning, 'the cradle of the human race.' The names of the rivers are Euphrates, the Pison, the Gihon, and the Hiddekel.\" ( THE SMOKY GOD , p. 114) Olaf reported that the capital of the inner world is the City of Eden, which is built around this primeval garden.\nOlaf Jansen was never a Christian. To his dying day, Olaf Jansen was the ardent worshiper of the Norwegian gods, Odin and Thor \u2013 his ancestors. His purpose was not to advance the reality of religion, but in recording his experience in the Garden of Eden, he was reporting exactly what he saw and what the people who live there told him. They explained to him that the garden he was taken to inside Our Hollow Earth was none other than the \"navel of the earth,\" and \"the cradle of the human race,\" and is called \"Eden.\"\nIn the Book of Genesis we read about the Garden of Eden which Olaf Jansen discovered to be located inside Our Hollow Earth:\n\"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah where there is gold, And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia, And the name of the Third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria, And the fourth river is Euphrates.\" (GENESIS 2:8-14)\nThe directions in Our Hollow Earth are the inverse of the directions of the compass on our outer world.\u00a0 Like an electromagnetic coil , where the flux inside the coil flows from the south pole to the north pole, the north pole of the hollow earth is our south pole and our north pole is their south pole.\u00a0 The magnetic flux of the earth\u2019s electromagnetic field flows out of their north pole, which is our south pole, continues north on the outside surface of the earth and then flows into our north pole, which is their south pole.\u00a0\u00a0 When Olaf Jansen and his father entered the hollow earth near our north pole, they discovered the River Hiddekel \u2013 the river that flows out of the Garden of Eden towards their south pole \u2013 which is our north pole.\u00a0 So the first river mentioned in Genesis, the river Pison flows towards their north pole , which is our south pole.\u00a0 East is towards the right of the north pole of inner earth \u2013 just as it is on our outer earth.\u00a0 The earth turns towards the east, and because, as Olaf Jansen described it, the Inner Sun is divided between it\u2019s day and night sides.\nOlaf wrote, \"In the meantime, we had lost sight of the sun's rays, but we found a radiance 'within' emanating from the dull-red sun which had already attracted our attention, now giving out a white light seemingly from a cloudbank far away in front of us. It dispensed a greater light, I should say, than two full moons on the clearest night.\"\n\"In twelve hours this cloud of whiteness would pass out of sight as if eclipsed, and the twelve hours following corresponded with our night. We early learned that these strange people were worshipers of this great cloud of light. It was 'The Smoky God' of the 'Inner World.'\" (THE SMOKY GOD, pp. 102, 103)\nHe further writes, \"The great luminous cloud or ball of dull-red fire--fiery-red in the mornings and evenings, and during the day giving off a beautiful white light, 'The Smoky God,'--is seemingly suspended in the center of the great vacuum 'within' the earth, and held to its place by the immutable law of gravitation...\"\n\"The base of this electrical cloud or central luminary, the seat of the gods, is dark and non-transparent, save for innumerable small openings, seemingly in the bottom of the great support or altar of the Deity, upon which 'The Smoky God' rests; and, the lights shining through these many openings twinkle at night in all their splendor, and seem to be stars, as natural as the stars we saw shining when in our home at Stockholm, excepting that they appear larger. 'The Smoky God,' therefore, with each daily revolution of the earth, appears to come up in the east and go down in the west, the same as does our sun on the external surface. In reality, the people 'within' believe that 'The Smoky God' is the throne of their Jehovah, and is stationary. The effect of night and day is, therefore, produced by the earth's daily rotation.\" (THE SMOKY GOD, pp. 108-110)\nThe apparent size of our sun is \u00bd degree. The moon is only slightly larger in apparent size and thus can eclipse the sun. On the other hand, if the interior sun is 600 miles in diameter and is 3,000 miles from the inner surface of the planet, it's apparent size would be 11.5 degrees viewing it from the interior surface -- 23 times bigger than the apparent size of our outer sun or moon. If you took a 5 inch disk you would need to move it 25 inches from your eyes to give you the apparent size of the inner sun. So the inner sun would appear to fill more of the sky than does our outer sun. As such, the bright side of the inner sun would appear to come out in the morning on the east side of the inner sun's disk, move across the face of the disk and disappear on the west side of the disk of the inner sun in the evening.\u00a0 Thus, the effect of night and day is given in Our Hollow Earth \u2013 just as it is on our outer world except the Inner Sun still gives off heat at night although less heat, and much less light.\nOlaf reported that the inner earth inhabitants \u201cworshiped\u201d this Inner Sun, and said that it was the throne of Jehovah.\u00a0 In my study, I have concluded that this Inner Sun is the location of the Heaven of this earth.\nIn the Genesis account of creation, the Lord spoke to Moses saying,\n\"In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.\"\nNotice that \"heaven\" here is singular. So Our Hollow Earth does have a heaven.\u00a0 It is the central sun inside the hollow of the earth.\u00a0 It is also the physical location of Paradise in the spirit world of this earth.\u00a0 It is the \u201clight\u201d that lit up on the first day of creation.\u00a0 The Bible calls it the \u201cfirmament\u201d or \u201cheaven\u201d and was located in the midst of the waters above it and below it on the inner surface of the planet.\n\"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven.\u201d\nAccording to the Bible, God lives in \"everlasting burnings\" (Isaiah 33:14), which reads,\n\"The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall DWELL WITH THE DEVOURING FIRE? WHO AMONG US SHALL DWELL WITH EVERLASTING BURNING?: He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that stayeth his hand from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil: He shall dwell on high...\"\nJoseph Smith, the American prophet taught,\n\"The angels do not reside on a planet like this earth; But they reside in the presence of God, on a globe like a SEA OF GLASS AND FIRE, where all things for their glory are manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the Lord.\"\n\"The place where God resides is a great Urim and Thummim.\"\n\"This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be Christ's.\" (D&C 130:6-9)\nI have thus concluded that our Inner Sun is a crystal ball, and is probably hollow also.\nIndications that our outer sun is also a crystal ball, is the fact that it has a very strong magnetic field.\u00a0 Astronomers believe stars are gaseous and planets have liquid interiors so they cannot explain the observed magnetic fields in suns or planets.\u00a0 From the Scientific American comes this significant confession: \"In 1934, Thomas G. Cowling of the University of Leeds in England proved that single, symmetrical fluid flows cannot generate magnetic fields...Astronomers cannot explain the galaxies or solar magnetic fields.\" (Mystery of the Missing Dynamo, Scientific American, p. 24, January 1995)\nIn order for the sun to have a strong magnetic field, it would have to be hollow with a solid shell and an inner sun inside of it that is also a solid crystal \u2013 the shell rotating at a different rate than the inner body.\u00a0 So I did a calculation of the mass of the sun to see if it could have a solid shell.\u00a0 Indeed, the calculation showed that if the sun has a shell that is 10% of the diameter of the sun in thickness \u2013 it would have a density of 2.86 gm/cc \u2013 which is about the density of glass with a few impurities.\u00a0 So the sun has a solid surface.\u00a0 In fact, it has been recognized that the sun has a cooler surface than it's upper atmosphere.\u00a0 The sun has also been discovered to have coronal holes at its poles.\nIn a book written by Phoebe Marie Holmes in 1933, she tells of her visit to the Celestial City of God within our outer hollow Sun.\nPhoebe describes how she was taken in the Spirit by angels to the \"heart of the Sun\" where the New Jerusalem is being built.\u00a0 It will be brought to earth after the earth's resurrection when the earth becomes celestialized and becomes the abode of the righteous.\u00a0 Since it is so big, 1,500 miles long, wide and high, it will probably take the place of the earth's inner sun.\u00a0 Christ, on his Sermon on the Mount said the \"meek\" shall inherit the earth, and indeed they will.\u00a0 A mansion is being built there right now for each of us, in the New Jerusalem, by our good and noble actions here on earth.\u00a0 Phoebe was taken to visit her unfinished mansion by the angels of God, where she found her husband, who had already passed on.\u00a0 She then was brought back to earth to finish her life's work.\nInterestingly enough, Phoebe reported the city in the Sun is the New Jerusalem, as described by the Apostle John in the Book of Revelations Chapter 21, and as I had concluded, is a giant terraced \"mountain\" with a square bottom -- having a pyramid shape.\u00a0 Perhaps the ancient Meso-Americans, Chinese and Egyptians knew the New Jerusalem would be like a pyramid, and so built their temples with that shape.\nAlso, as I had concluded in Chapter 8 of my book, the angels told Phoebe that the Sun is a giant crystal.\u00a0 Scientists, on the other hand, claim the Sun is entirely gaseous.\u00a0 But if it is hollow and has a shell thickness 10% of its planetary diameter, that would give the Sun's shell a density of 2.86 gm/cc, and so would have a solid surface.\u00a0 Glass has a density of 2.6 gm/cc.\u00a0 And it's not hot inside as scientists claim either, but a nice warmth is provided for the celestial city suspended within the Sun's hollow interior.\u00a0 You can get Phoebe Marie Holmes book, \"My Visit To The Sun\"\u00a0 at Amazon.com .\nIn my research, I have concluded that the Inner Sun inside Our Hollow Earth is the Heaven of this earth \u2013 the \u201cparadise\u201d where the spirits of the righteous go at death to await the resurrection.\u00a0 Christ told the thief on the cross, \"Today shalt thou be with me in paradise,\" (Luke 23:43), and earlier He had told the Pharisees, \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH.\" (Mathew 12:40), and the Apostle Paul wrote of Christ saying, \"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high (referring to the ascension into heaven after his resurrection)...Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also DESCENDED FIRST INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH?...\" (Ephesians 4:8,9)\nOur earth is a living body. And just as our physical human bodies have spirit bodies in the same form and likeness of our physical bodies, so does the earth have a spirit body in the same shape and form as the physical world. The earth's spirit body is the spirit world \u2013 the habitation of the spirits of all who die.\u00a0 The scriptures indicate that at death, the spirits of the wicked are \u201ccast down to hell.\u201d So somewhere inside the earth Paradise and Hell must be separated by a space \u2013 the hollow in the earth.\u00a0 Indeed, Luke calls this separation \u201ca great gulf.\u201d\nAbraham told the rich man in hell that between him and Lazarus (who was in Paradise) there was a great gulf fixed so that none could go from Paradise to Hell or from Hell to Paradise. Abraham said, \"And beside all this, between us and you there is a GREAT GULF FIXED: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\" (Luke 16:26)\nSo the scriptures in describing the spirit world of this earth describe a hollow earth .\u00a0 We can thus conclude that since the spirit bodies of living beings have the same shape and form as their physical bodies, this earth being a living entity, also has it's physical body in the same shape and form as it\u2019s spirit body \u2013 which the scriptures describe as being hollow \u2013 the location of Paradise being in the \u201cheart of the earth\u201d separated from Hell in the shell by a \u201cgreat gulf\u201d \u2013 the hollow of the earth.\nWhen we reach Inner Earth on our upcoming expedition Voyage to Our Hollow Earth, we will have the opportunity to ask the inner earth inhabitants concerning their beliefs that will confirm this conclusion that the Heaven of this earth is the Inner Sun, and that the lost Garden of Eden is located on the inner surface of our planet within Our Hollow Earth.\nAnother item of interest we will be able to investigate with our friends of Inner Earth is that of the age of the earth.\u00a0 Scientists claim the earth is millions of years old.\u00a0 However, if we are to believe the Bible, and other scripture, scientists must be mistaken in their estimates -- which they have conjured up to support their false and evil theory of Organic Evolution -- which has been used by the Illuminati to replace belief in God in our educational institutions.\u00a0 This is important because it is from God that we obtain all our rights and freedoms.\u00a0 Organic Evolution has changed this to a belief in No God and that all our rights come from the State so that the Illuminati can then subject us to their godless governments -- because if our rights come from God, no-one can take them away from us.\u00a0 But if our rights come from the State, then whoever is in power can take those rights away from us and we are their slaves.\u00a0 Our Founding documents state clearly that our rights come from God and cannot be taken away from us -- because we, the people, are the sovereigns, and our servants in the government must follow our constitution and do what we tell them to do, not the other way around.\nWe, the people, have paid good money to our servants in the government, to tell us the truth about Our Hollow Earth -- and they have not.\u00a0 Therefore, it remains\u00a0to us to prove it exists -- by going there.\nAs to the scriptural age of the earth, the earth was created by Jesus Christ in His premortal existence state as \u201cJehovah,\u201d in 6 days of the Lord \u2013 which are defined as being 1,000 earth years long (2 Peter 3:8, Abraham, 3:4).\u00a0 The planet where God resides, Kolob, according to the ancient text found in Egypt called the Book of Abraham, and translated by the American Prophet, Joseph Smith -- is located in the center of our galaxy, and is the largest star in the Milky Way Galaxy.\u00a0 It is actually a double star system -- both stars being of equal size.\u00a0 These controlling stars rotate at a rate of once every 1,000 earth years -- which is a \"Day\" of the Lord.\u00a0 Our earth\u00a0was created in six Days of the Lord -- which comes to 6,000 original earth years.\nAnd God is still operating on the 1,000 earth years = one Day of the Lord.\u00a0 In the Book of Revelation it talks about 7 seals representing 7,000 years of earth\u2019s temporal existence that occurred after the fall of Adam when the earth and all that is on and in it became mortal -- subject to death ( D&C 77 ).\u00a0 According to Biblical chronology, Adam fell and was expelled from the Garden of Eden with his wife Eve for having disobeyed God in partaking of the forbidden fruit \u2013 about 4,000 years before Christ.\u00a0 There have been just over 2,000 years since Christ, so that now we are in the beginning of the 7th millennium since the fall.\nEven as Jehovah rested from His labors of creation in the first 7 thousand years \u2013 the 7th day of the Lord\u2019s creation period -- on the first Sabbath, we are now in the 2nd Sabbath of the Lord.\u00a0 The scriptures say that the Lord Jesus Christ will come to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords in the beginning of this 7th millennium \u2013 at his Second Coming in glory, which I estimate to be in October of the year 2020 \u2013 the half hour (Lord's time) of silence before the face of the Lord is revealed to all mankind at His Coming ( D&C 88:95 ).\u00a0 Then in the 8th millennium \u2013 on the Lord\u2019s Day \u2013 the earth will die and be resurrected to immoral glory for the righteous \u201cmeek\u201d to inherit with Christ \u2013 just as Christ himself was resurrected on Sunday \u2013 the eighth day.\u00a0 The earth's destiny is to become\u00a0a Celestial Kingdom of God to be inhabited by the righteous followers of Christ.\u00a0 Although the earth will die, it will be resurrected together with all the righteous Saints of God -- and will shine like the Sun with immortal glory.\nDianne Robbins, in her book, Messages from the Hollow Earth , in which she has received telepathic messages from Our Hollow Earth, interestingly enough, concurs with my estimate of the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in glory.\u00a0 The basic message we are receiving from Inner Earth is that we must prepare for the soon to happen reuniting of Planet Earth -- Inner Earth with Outer Earth.\u00a0 Our planet must be One with the Lord to be accepted by Him at his Coming.\nI have received an interesting email from a Hollow Earth contactee in South America, regarding our expedition to Our Hollow Earth.\u00a0 We have been assured that we have done good research and will be welcomed by the people of Inner Earth and met at the North Polar Opening and escorted in by one of their space craft.\u00a0 All those voyagers that want to stay in Our Hollow Earth may, and those that want to return to outer earth will be permitted to do so.\u00a0 You can read the email on my website, on my New Items page, Interesting Hollow Earth Emails .\nIn 2005, Steve Currey was contacted by James Haarp of www.natradio.com out of Toronto, Canada and asked me to be on their radio show, August 17, 2005.\nA couple of recent items of interest to the hollow earth / hollow planet theory, comes from NASA satellites.\u00a0 The first one we'll mention is the Cassini voyage to Saturn. Several images beamed back to earth from the Cassini space probe to Saturn show interesting anomalies that could be indications of hollow planets.\u00a0 For instance, look at what NASA calls a \"sharply defined circular feature\" at Saturn's south pole .\nTitan, one of Saturn's largest moon's, one of the few moon's in the solar system to have a significant atmosphere, has an interesting upwelling of bright clouds at its south pole.\u00a0 NASA scientists speculate that it may be associated with a feature on the ground which causes wind with moisture raising up into the atmosphere and then condensing out into clouds.\u00a0 One image of Titan's south pole seems to indicate these bright bubbling clouds are lighted from beneath .\nIn a mosaic of 35 individual exposures made at the WM Keck I Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, on 4 Feb 2004, NASA scientists have detected a hot spot at Saturn's south pole .\u00a0 A sudden jump in temperature towards Saturn's south pole is a surprise for scientists because they are not taking into account the hollow nature of planets, and that the planets contain Inner Suns that produce auroras and warm air emanating from their interiors through polar openings.\nThe second item of interest comes from the discovery by a California scientist, Michael Mozina, who after examining images of the Sun from several solar satellites, has concluded that the Sun has a solid surface.\u00a0 On his website at http://www.TheSurfaceOfTheSun.com ,\u00a0you can watch solar movies showing the Sun has a solid surface.\u00a0 In one movie-short, a sun quake occurred on the Sun, and a tsunami went out in all directions from the epicenter -- like when you drop a rock into a lake.\u00a0 As the waves travel out from the epicenter, you can see them pass over stationary features on the solid surface of the Sun beneath the waves.\nIn another movie-short of satellite images, surface features from pole to pole can been seen all rotating at the same rate around the sun as it rotates.\u00a0 This is in contrast to Sun spots which have been seen since the days of Galileo to rotate faster at the equator than towards the poles -- because they are an atmospheric phenomenon.\u00a0 Even on earth, the atmosphere rotates faster at the equator than towards the poles.\u00a0 But surface features do not.\u00a0 Surface features from pole to pole all rotate at the same rate.\nThis discovery that the Sun has a solid surface has got to be the greatest landmark in hollow planets research in decades.\u00a0 Because if the Sun has a solid surface as these solar satellite photos show, then this can only mean one thing -- that the Sun is hollow!\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because the Sun does not have enough mass to be solid all the way through.\u00a0 If the Sun has a solid surface, the Sun would have to be hollow!\u00a0 This confirms the conclusion I had arrived at in my book years ago, in which I calculated the density of the Sun's shell if it were hollow with a shell thickness 10% of its diameter -- and came up with the figure of 2.86 gm/cc, which indicated to me that the Sun has a solid surface.\u00a0 A PhD college professor asked me for my calculations, and I sent him a spreadsheet with those calculations.\u00a0 Of course, the calculations are all in my eBook, available on my website http://www.ourhollowearth.com/ , but if any of you are interested, I can send you the spreadsheet also.\nGlass has a density of 2.6, so if the Sun's shell has a density of 2.86,\u00a0then this could indicate that it is a giant crystal ball with some metal impurities -- just as the spectroscopic images show.\u00a0 On Michael's home page\u00a0is a still image in gold color of the solid surface of the Sun showing some mountain peaks, which in another movie short on his website you can watch lightning flashing from those peaks.\nSurely, with this fantastic discovery, scientists will soon have to admit that the Sun is hollow with a solid shell, and an interior sun that rotates at a different rate than it's shell giving rise to it's powerful dynamo-like electromagnetic field.\u00a0 Jules Verne, in his 1864 book, Journey to The Center of the Earth, reported that his explorers saw an Inner Sun that was lighted electrically.\u00a0 Surprisingly, we are now discovering that our Sun is very electrical, with gigantic lightning bolts and arcing plasma shooting up into its atmosphere from a solid surface.\nOn our journey to Our Hollow Earth, we will have the opportunity to see\u00a0our electrical Inner Sun at a close-up range.\u00a0 But not to\u00a0worry.\u00a0 The Inner Sun's size and temperature have been gauged perfectly by the Creator to give ideal climate, and temperature to\u00a0make Inner Earth a paradise for all that live there.\u00a0 YOU may want to stay once you get there!\nLet me explain what we are facing to finalize this expedition.\u00a0 Due to the price that the Yamal is charging us to charter our expedition, which is substantial, we need a certain number of expedition members or money from sponsors to\u00a0pay for this trip.\u00a0 There are still some entrepreneurial sponsors considering supporting the expedition, including scientific groups.\u00a0 The Yamal nuclear icebreaker is\u00a0NOT a cheap ship to charter.\u00a0 Steve has diligently tried to find a\u00a0more affordable\u00a0ship -- but so far has been unable to find one.\u00a0 He has considered chartering a diesel icebreaker, but\u00a0diesel icebreakers\u00a0don't measure up to our\u00a0expedition requirements.\nFor one,\u00a0diesel icebreakers don't have enough power to get through the ice to the pole.\u00a0 At http://www.calflora.net/northpole/ , you can read about how a diesel icebreaker following the Yamal to the north pole in July, 1994,\u00a0frequently\u00a0became trapped\u00a0in the ice and the Yamal would have to turn around and free up the diesel icebreaker so it could make it to the pole behind the Yamal.\u00a0 Then also, diesel icebreakers do not have the\u00a0range necessary in fuel to make it to our destination and back.\u00a0\u00a0Steve has\u00a0tried to find a smaller nuclear icebreaker that would charge us less, but so far has been unable to\u00a0locate one.\u00a0 Steve has also sought the backing of sponsors for our expedition, but\u00a0none have come forth as yet.\u00a0\u00a0This expedition continues to be a we, the people,\u00a0expedition, financed by each of us paying\u00a0our own ticket on the cruise.\nAnother requirement of the Murmansk company for us to charter the Yamal, is that they want our deposit one year in advance of our departure date.\nWe have been recently contacted by Dr. Brooks Agnew, a world-renowned\u00a0scientist that has committed to\u00a0joining our expedition, and will be putting together a scientific team and equipment to help us document our discoveries.\nNow, regarding the hollow earth theory, recently the idea surfaced again questioning the location of the north polar opening that we will be attempting to locate on this expedition.\u00a0 An expedition member brought up the question:\nIs the North Polar Opening located in the Beaufort Sea north of Canada, or on the Russian side of the pole?\nThe argument in favor of the polar opening\u00a0on the Canadian side of the pole proposes\u00a0that\u00a0the largest basin in the Arctic sea is located north of Canada -- in the Beaufort Sea.\u00a0 The ocean currents there rotate clockwise in a giant whirlpool.\u00a0 It is\u00a0suggested that maybe the ocean water is\u00a0draining down the polar opening in that area.\u00a0 In fact, in the center of the Beaufort Gyre is the location of the lowest ocean tides in the Arctic Ocean.\u00a0\u00a0Jan Lamprecht of South\u00a0Africa\u00a0brought this up\u00a0when he was studying this area for his book, Hollow Planets.\u00a0 You can view the tidal map on his website at http://www.hollowplanets.com/journal/J0007Tides.jpg .\nMy answer to this is that the Beaufort Gyre is caused by the Transpolar Drift.\u00a0 See http://seis.natsci.csulb.edu/rmorris/seaice/Drift.jpg .\nThe Transpolar Drift has been known since at least the days of Fridtjof Nansen, who in 1893 sailed\u00a0his ship, the Fram, north of the New Siberian Islands looking for Sannikov land, which the Russians had seen a mirage of in that direction.\u00a0 Nansen embedded his ship\u00a0in the ice\u00a0and drifted across the Arctic in the ice flows to the east side of Greenland.\u00a0 This arctic current called the Transpolar Drift acts like a swift running stream of water in a ditch.\u00a0 In fact, the underwater canyons in this area follow the same direction as\u00a0the Transpolar Drift.\u00a0\u00a0On this map, http://go.hrw.com/atlas/norm_map/arcticoc.gif , you can see\u00a0three ocean bottom ridges\u00a0crossing the Arctic ocean in the same direction as the Transpolar Drift.\nAs you look at the above mentioned map of the\u00a0Transpolar Drift, you will notice that a\u00a0powerful\u00a0ocean current comes out of the area where I\u00a0estimate the north polar opening is located north of the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 This current\u00a0carries ice out of the polar opening across the Arctic Ocean\u00a0to the Greenland side of the pole causing eddy currents on either side of the Transpolar Drift.\u00a0 The eddy current on the Canadian side\u00a0of the Transpolar Drift produces the Beaufort Gyre north of Canada and rotates clockwise.\u00a0\u00a0This eddy current causes the ice to pile up onto the shores of northern Canada to the greatest depths of anywhere in the Arctic ocean. The thinnest ice is located where the ice comes from -- in an\u00a0area north of the New Siberian Islands where I estimate the polar opening is located.\u00a0 Then on the Russian/European side of the Transpolar Drift in the Barents Sea, the eddy current\u00a0rotates counter-clockwise.\nWhen reviewing this phenomenon of the Transpolar Drift, I realized a most significant evidence for the location of the polar opening.\u00a0 It is a jet stream of air that follows the same path of the Transpolar Drift across the north pole.\u00a0 Studying this, I then realized that this\u00a0jet stream of moist air is coming\u00a0up out of the polar opening north of the New Siberian Islands, flows\u00a0across the arctic and drops it's moist air onto the Greenland ice cap.\u00a0 Over the years, this has resulted in an\u00a0accumulation of ice on the Greenland continent\u00a0to the awesome depth of nearly two miles!\nConsider this for a moment. What if this moist jet stream of air, over the years,\u00a0had instead flowed over Alaska,\u00a0or Siberia, or the Norway-Sweden-Finland peninsula -- which are all at the same latitude as Greenland?\u00a0 If it had, those places\u00a0would\u00a0today be covered by an ice cap 2 miles thick just like Greenland is today!\u00a0 If we follow that\u00a0jet stream of moist air from Greenland back across the Arctic, we find that it points to the location of the polar opening -- on the Russian side of the pole!\u00a0 The same thing is happening in Antarctica.\u00a0 Warm, moist air coming up out of the polar opening,\u00a0which I estimate is located at 37.8 W Lon, 87.7 S Lat, has covered the east Antarctic ice cap to a depth of over 2 miles!\nMy conclusion from this evidence is that the Arctic Transpolar ice pack and current drift across the pole from the area north of the New Siberian islands to Greenland\u00a0with a\u00a0jet stream of moist warm\u00a0air dumping snow and ice onto Greenland ice cap to the phenomenal depth of two miles in thickness.\u00a0 This\u00a0indicates to me that the polar opening is located on the Russian side of the pole near\u00a087.7 N Lat, 142.2 E Lon, where I have estimated it to be located.\nIt cannot be denied that there is a strong current flowing out of that area north of the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 It\u00a0is the location where most of the freshwater ice in the Arctic\u00a0is coming\u00a0from.\u00a0 Eddy currents on each side of the Transpolar Drift flowing out of that area cause the Beaufort Gyre to rotate clockwise and the gyre in the Barents Sea to rotate counter clockwise on either side of this swift current of water coming up out of the polar opening.\u00a0 Perhaps\u00a0the Transpolar jet stream and ice flows originate from the valley of the River Hiddekel that empties into the Arctic Ocean within the polar opening from the Inner Continent.\nIn his book, Olaf\u00a0explained where\u00a0the ice comes from\u00a0that fills the Transpolar Drift current,\u00a0when he wrote, \"...about three-fourths of the 'inner' surface of the earth is land and about one-fourth water. There are numerous rivers of tremendous size, some flowing in a northerly direction and others southerly. Some of these rivers are thirty miles in width, and it is out of these vast waterways, at the extreme northern and southern parts of the 'inside' surface of the earth, in regions where low temperatures are experienced that fresh water icebergs are formed. They are then pushed out to sea like huge tongues of ice, by the abnormal freshets of turbulent waters that twice every year, sweep everything before them.\" (THE SMOKY GOD, pp. 122, 123)\nDoes water drain down the polar opening?\nIt was pointed out to me that perhaps the low tide in the center of the Beaufort Gyre is an indication that water is draining down the polar opening.\u00a0 It is not.\u00a0 The low tide in that area is caused by the whirlpool of water in an\u00a0eddy of the Transpolar Drift --\u00a0 just like the eye of a hurricane.\u00a0 It does not mean that water is draining down a polar opening into the hollow interior.\nThe idea that water must drain down the polar hole, if it exists,\u00a0is based on the flawed idea\u00a0scientists have that the center of gravity is located in the center of the earth.\u00a0 Granted, there is a small center of gravity located\u00a0in the Central Sun, but since 99.9% of the earth's mass is\u00a0located in it's 800-mile thick shell,\u00a0the center of gravity for us on the surface of the planet, within the polar opening, and on the inner surface of the shell\u00a0is\u00a0located\u00a0in the SHELL of the earth -- NOT the center of the earth.\u00a0 The center of gravity in the shell is actually a sphere -- located about 450 - 700 miles down in the shell from the outer surface.\u00a0\u00a0Gravity accelerates towards this central sphere of gravity in the shell from within and without, and within the polar opening -- keeping our feet firmly planted on the surface of the planet.\u00a0 Even on the sides of the polar opening, gravity holds the water to the sides of the opening.\nWhat about Jan Lamprecht's conclusion that the polar opening is\u00a0located in\u00a0the Beaufort Sea north of Canada?\nIn his book, Hollow Planets, Jan Lamprecht did seem to come to the conclusion that the polar opening must be located between northern Canada and the pole -- somewhere out in the Beaufort Sea.\u00a0 My conclusion is different because Jan Lamprecht did not take into account\u00a0the missing Soviet Flyers, Olaf Jansen, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Ronald Amundsen, and Fridtjof Nansen.\u00a0 Taking into consideration these accounts, together with the sightings of the mirages of land sighted out over the Arctic Ocean from Canada, Alaska and Russia, as Jan Lamprecht covered so\u00a0well in his book -- when all the evidence is considered -- then the location of the polar opening weighs in greater on the Russian side of the pole -- the way I see it.\nJan Lamprecht publishes on his website an article written by Lt. Green in 1923\u00a0in the Popular Science Monthly magazine titled, Will the ZR-1 Discover a Polar Paradise? In his article, Lt. Fitzhugh Green, who was Admiral Peary's physicist and co-explorer with MacMillan, actually believed that a mirage Admiral Peary sighted\u00a0northwest of Ellesmere Island, northern Canada, was an undiscovered island\u00a0in the Arctic Ocean.\u00a0 Admiral Peary\u00a0even named that undiscovered land, Crockerland.\u00a0 In his article, Lt. Green depicted this island to be located mostly on the Russian side of the pole.\u00a0 See map http://www.ourhollowearth.com/map.gif .\u00a0 The Navy dirigible, the ZR-1 was scheduled to look for it on a flight from Point Barrow to Spitzbergen that very next summer of 1924, but it crashed and didn't make that flight.\nTwo\u00a0years later, however, in 1926, both Admiral Richard E. Byrd and Roald Amundsen took flights into the Arctic to look for that missing island that Lt. Green wanted to find with the ZR-1.\u00a0 Amundsen flew his dirigible from Spitzbergen to Alaska but did not see any land where Lt. Green\u00a0proposed it would be located.\u00a0 However, they did find higher temperatures and anomalous fog in the vicinity of the pole, and were surprised that when they arrived in Alaska, they were 100 miles too far west of Point Barrow that they didn't even see it.\u00a0 This indicates to me\u00a0that this skewing of their direct line of flight from Spitzbergen to Point Barrow over the pole, towards the west, may have been caused by dipping down somewhat into the polar opening located on the Russian side of the pole.\u00a0 If the polar opening is located on the Canadian side of the pole, their line of flight would have been skewed towards the Canadian side of the pole caused by the curvature of the earth into the polar opening.\nIn one chapter of his book, Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic, Vilhjalmur Stefannson covers the mystery of the Missing Soviet Flyers, who in August 1937 were flying north of the Kara Sea from Russia to Alaska, and were lost somewhere in the Arctic Ocean.\u00a0 Radio transmissions from the ill-fated flight were received, but grew fainter and fainter until they were received no more.\u00a0 Subsequent rescue flights flew all over that area north of Canada and were unable to locate them.\u00a0 Moscow called off the search after 7 months.\u00a0 The flight paths of the rescue\u00a0effort was also given in his book on a map showing their flights all over that area north of Canada and\u00a0Alaska --\u00a0which\u00a0indicates to me that the polar opening is not located in that area.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if you draw a line from the Kara Sea to Alaska, it passes directly over the area I estimate the polar opening is located -- on the Russian side of the pole near 87.7 N Lat, 142.2 E Lon .\nIn 1829, Olaf and Jens Jansen sailed in their small fishing boat through a lead in the ice from the northern shores of Franz Josef land\u00a0in a North East direction when they accidentally found the north polar opening and sailed through it into Inner Earth.\u00a0 This direction would put the polar opening on the Russian side of the pole.\nOn page 66 of The Smoky God, Olaf Jansen mentioned that as he and his father left Franz Josef Land on their expedition to the Hollow Earth, \"we seemed to be in a strong current running north by northeast.\"\u00a0 On their third day's sailing northeast of Franz Josef Land, they discovered an island\u00a0with a large accumulation of drift-wood on the northern shore, trunks of coniferous trees two feet in diameter and forty feet long.\u00a0 This encouraged them to continue north in hopes of finding the legendary land where the \"Chosen\" people lived -- cousins of their ancestors who had migrated there centuries ago.\u00a0 Again, several days further on, on page 84, Olaf reported, \"...we discovered...that we were sailing slightly north by northeast.\"\nJan Lamprecht rejected Olaf's testimony as being a book of fiction, as some claim.\u00a0 However, my\u00a0research indicates that it\u00a0is\u00a0not a book of fiction, but the real life story of Olaf Jansen, published after his death by his friend, George Emerson.\u00a0 Emerson wrote several books in his lifetime, but none like The Smoky God.\u00a0 He claimed Olaf's story was the story given to him by his dying friend, an immigrant to America from Sweden.\u00a0 People usually do not lie between their teeth\u00a0on their death bed.\u00a0 Several things in Olaf's story indicates to me it is a truthful story of his life.\nFor example, Olaf and his father were believers in their ancestor gods, Odin and Thor --\u00a0to their dying days.\u00a0 Yet Olaf reported that the Inner Earth people believe in Jehovah\u00a0-- the god of the ancient Israelites.\u00a0 If this was a book of fiction, the writer would have had them find a people related to them that also believed in Odin and Thor, and would have reported that their gods had guided them to that land of paradise inside the earth.\u00a0 Also, if it was a book of fiction, why then didn't the author have them find the capital city of Inner Earth to be Asgard of Norwegian legend, instead of the Garden of Eden?\nOn the scientific side, consider that Olaf didn't know what the \"star\" was that he was seeing directly over their heads as they passed through the polar opening.\u00a0 If you think about it, it obviously was the reflection of\u00a0our outer sun's light reflecting off the surface of the ocean on the opposite side of the polar opening above their heads.\u00a0 If this was a book of fiction, the author would most likely have explained what was the cause of that prominent \"star\" that Olaf saw in broad daylight.\nSeveral\u00a0critics of Olaf's story said\u00a0they could not understand why Olaf would say that his compass always pointed towards the north pointer on his compass even after they were going south on the inside of the earth.\u00a0 This is easily explained by comparing the earth to a magnet or electric coil , the magnetic field of which has field lines coming out one end, going\u00a0over the outside of the magnet or coil to the other end and going inside and\u00a0continuing the same loop inside and out.\nScientists today\u00a0describe the earth as a giant magnet.\u00a0 The flux of the earth's magnetism is what causes the compass needle to point north.\u00a0 That magnetic flux exits the earth from the magnetic south pole, flows over the surface of the\u00a0planet and enters the earth at the magnetic north pole -- just like a magnet.\u00a0 That flux continues on the inside to the south pole\u00a0where\u00a0it exits again to the outside on a never ending flow in and out of the earth.\u00a0 When comparing the earth to a magnet or\u00a0the flux of an electric coil, you find that the magnetic flux of both act the same\u00a0-- so that the inside of our hollow earth's north pole is our south pole, and their south pole is our north magnetic pole.\u00a0 Knowing this,\u00a0then you realize why\u00a0a magnetic compass will\u00a0point to the north pole bearing on the compass as you pass through and into the hollow earth through the north polar opening -- just as Olaf Jansen reported.\u00a0 This is most probably why Our Hollow Earth in scripture is called the \"North Countries.\"\u00a0 The compass needle is\u00a0following the earth's magnetic flux inside the earth and always points to the north marking on the compass as you go through the polar opening and into the interior.\u00a0 Once you get on the interior of the earth, the compass needle\u00a0continues to point to the north marking on the compass because their north pole is our south pole.\nAlong this same line of thought, the critics could not understand why Olaf could say that the interior sun appears to come up in the east in the morning and go down in the west.\u00a0 The reason Olaf could say this is because the interior sun is 23 times larger in apparent size than our outer sun and so covers a larger portion of the inner sky.\u00a0 Additionally, this inner sun is divided between it's day and night sides -- the night side having a reddish-brown darker luminiscence, the day's side covered by a bright white-like cloud.\u00a0 Understanding that the interior world's directions are the exact opposite of ours with their north pole at our south pole, then their east and west are also opposite ours -- so that since the earth rotates from west to east on the outside, even so on the inside the earth also rotates from west to east and so the inner sun's bright white cloud emerges in the morning on the east side of the inner sun\u00a0just like our sun emerges in the morning also in the east.\u00a0 So now you see Olaf's critics in this regard did not think this through very clearly.\nJan Lamprecht also rejected the testimony of Admiral Richard E. Byrd as fictional stories -- perhaps because of a study done by hollow earth researcher Dennis Crenshaw of a fictional account of Byrd's February flight of 1947 through the north polar opening into our hollow earth.\u00a0 That account may be fiction, but I know from different sources that what was reported in that account actually did happen and that the Admiral tried several times to tell the world about his discovery that our earth is hollow\u00a0in his world-wide radio broadcasts, but he was prevented from doing so by the government and his military superiors.\nMy friend, John Gagne, that I met in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1981, was told by Admiral Byrd's close friend, Sylvia Darvell, that the Admiral had confided in her after his Arctic flight of February 1947, beyond the North Pole, while the New York Times was saying that he was in Antarctica, that he actually was in the Arctic and flew past the ice BEYOND the north geographic pole, and flew through the polar opening into Inner Earth where he was sided by flying saucer-type craft of Inner Earth and landed near an Inner Earth city.\u00a0 He was taken in and interviewed by one of their government officials who asked him to deliver a message to Washington\u00a0that they oppose our use of nuclear weapons.\nF. Amadeo Giannini wrote in his 1959 book, Worlds Beyond the Poles,\u00a0 \"This United States Navy's polar exploratory force was preparing to embark upon one of the most memorable adventures in world history. Under the command of Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, U.S.N., it was to penetrate into land extending beyond the North Pole supposed end of the Earth...As the hour approached for air journey into the land beyond, Admiral Byrd transmitted from the Arctic base a radio announcement of his purpose, but the announcement was so astonishing that its import was lost to millions who avidly read it in press headlines throughout the world...The words of the message were momentous: 'I'd like to see that LAND BEYOND the Pole.\"...\"That area BEYOND the Pole is THE CENTER OF THE GREAT UNKNOWN!'\nNow,\u00a0when Admiral Byrd\u00a0flew BEYOND the pole when he flew through the north polar opening in February 1947,\u00a0he did that from the American side of the pole, not the Russian side.\u00a0 If he had flown\u00a0from the Russian side of the pole, then beyond the pole would be on the American/Canadian side of the pole.\u00a0\u00a0But Admiral Byrd was not flying for the Russians, but\u00a0for the U.S. Navy\u00a0-- from America.\u00a0 The fact that he said he flew \"beyond\" the pole\u00a0indicates to me that he discovered the north polar opening on the Russian side of the north geographic pole.\nConsider also the testimony of\u00a0Ray Palmer, editor of SEARCH and FLYING SAUCERS magazines, in which he testified of Byrd's discovery of Our Hollow Earth. Palmer lived in Amherst, Wisconsin. He wrote in his magazine, that about three miles away was the hometown of the late Lloyd K. Grenlie who was a friend of his. Grenlie \"...was the radio-man on Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole in 1926 and to both poles in 1929.\"\n\"It was emphatically denied that he made flights to BOTH poles in 1929.\" However, Palmer continued, \"That year a newsreel could be seen in America's theaters which described BOTH flights, and also showed newsreel photographs of the 'land beyond the pole\u00a0with its mountains, trees, rivers, and a large animal identified as a mammoth.'\"\n\"Today this newsreel apparently does not exist, although hundreds of my readers remember as I do, this movie short. Thus, I have it on my own personal viewing of this movie short, and from the radio-man who went with Byrd to that land beyond the pole and SAW the things recorded on that film, that this unknown, uncharted, and presently denied land exists!\" (FLYING SAUCERS, Sept. 1970)\nJack West, a leader of the LDS church in California, who also\u00a0was an amateur archeologist, said in a seminar (the\u00a0tape recording of which I have in my possession), \"You see, I heard that broadcast as many of you did, by Admiral Byrd. For he testified, 'We've flown hundreds of miles north of the north pole, every inch of the way, over beautiful forest land and green hills and lovely blue waters, and we've seen giant animals down there in the woods.' And then they had to return because they were almost out of gas. He went to the south pole. Got more gas this time; went still farther south of the SOUTH pole, every inch of the way he testified, over blue waters and beautiful wooded areas and green hills.\"\n\"Now, I don't know the answer. All I know is that the greatest number of sightings of UFO's have been near the north and south poles. Wouldn't that be fascinating if some of them are coming from down inside? Yes, they are way ahead of us they all testify. Get this book called, THE HOLLOW EARTH. It's a scientific book this time; gives evidence all over the place that the government purposely quieted down and hushed up that story of Admiral Byrd that I heard both of his international broadcasts as many of you did on international radio hookup when he told about these stories. Believe me, HE WAS NOT OFF HIS ROCKER! I believe with all my heart that they literally did exactly what he said they did!\"\nThe Norwegian arctic explorer, Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, in his book, Farthest North, relates his observations of several anomalous\u00a0phenomena on his Arctic expedition of 1893-94 in\u00a0the ship, the Fram.\u00a0 Nansen's observations are signficant -- because of all Arctic explorers we have record of, Nansen was the one that got closest to the North Polar Opening without entering and discovering it.\nFirst, Nansen discovered a substantial stretch of open ocean north of the New Siberian Islands that continues to this very day, see http://www.ourhollowearth.com/EarthImage.jpg from the Earth Imaging website at http://livingearth.com/ .\u00a0 In contrast, in his passage north of Norway and Russia to the New Siberian Islands, he had to stay close to the coast to get past the ice.\u00a0 And yet, on their way north of the New Siberian Islands, in September of 1893, they didn't find ice until 79 degrees N. Latitude.\u00a0 Only after 7 days sailing north over rolling open ocean did they reach the pack ice north of the New Siberian Islands.\nThen to their surprise out on the ice pack, they found a remarkable number of birds of various kinds including snipe and seagulls, also foxes, walrus and polar bears that indicated they were in the proximity of land towards the north.\u00a0 They passed the winter with their ship frozen in the ice pack and while waiting out the winter, they took scientific measurements and observations.\u00a0 They found rock and large quantities of mud and driftwood on some of the icebergs that indicated to Nansen that much of the Arctic ice originates in some river, perhaps further to the north than they were then located -- in some uncharted land.\nIn mid winter, on January 17th, 1894, at 79 deg N Latitude, 135 deg 29' E Longitude, observations by Nansen found that a north wind raised the temperature while a south wind lowered it, indicating that warm air was coming out of the north in winter -- perhaps from a land further north warmed by an inner sun.\u00a0\u00a0Nansen also discovered that ocean water temperatures were\u00a0warmer the further down he measured it beneath the ice, as also the air temperature above the ice when measured from the ship's crows nest was discovered to be warmer than next to the ice.\nThen at 80 deg 1' N Latitude, when Nansen was located 303 miles from the center of my estimated location of the North Polar Opening, on February 16-19 Nansen caught sight of a mirage of the inner sun.\u00a0\u00a0They were then located on the lip of the polar opening.\u00a0 Nansen had no knowledge of our hollow earth, nor of the polar openings.\u00a0 He thought it must be a mirage of our outer sun, but it was\u00a0mid-winter, in the Arctic polar night that lasts 6 months of the year.\u00a0 Most likely it was a sighting of a mirage of the Inner Sun.\nOlaf Jansen and his fisherman father, who attained the land of Our Hollow Earth in a voyage in their small fishing boat through the North Polar Opening, tells of their first sighting of the interior sun. It was the first part of August 1829. At first, Olaf's father thought it was a mirage.\u00a0 They had been sailing about 15 days northeast from Franz Josef Land when Olaf records: \"One day about this time, my father startled me by calling my attention to a novel sight far in front of us, almost at the horizon. 'It is a mock sun,' exclaimed my father. 'I have read of them; it is called a reflection or mirage. It will soon pass away.'\"\n\"But this dull-red, false sun, as we supposed it to be, did not pass away for several hours; and while we were unconscious of its emitting any rays of light, still there was no time thereafter when we could not sweep the horizon in front and locate the illumination of the so-called false sun, during a period of at least twelve hours out of every twenty-four.\"\n\"Clouds and mists would at times almost, but never entirely, hid its location. Gradually it seemed to climb higher in the horizon of the uncertain purply sky as we advanced.\"\n\"It could hardly be said to resemble the sun, except in its circular shape, and when not obscured by clouds or the ocean mists, it had a hazy-red, bronzed appearance, which would change to a white light like a luminous cloud, as if reflecting some greater light beyond.\"\n\"We finally agreed in our discussion of this smoky furnace-colored sun, that, whatever the cause of the phenomenon, it was not a reflection of our sun, but a planet of some sort--a reality.\" (THE SMOKY GOD, pp. 85-7)\nOn page 162, Nansen recorded, \"Monday, February 19th... Both today and yesterday we have seen the mirage of the Sun again; today it was high above the horizon, and almost seemed to assume a round, disk-like form.\"\u00a0 He remarked that it had a hazy, smoky-red color -- similar to the description of the inner sun given by Olaf Jansen, whose father also at first thought it was a mirage.\nCome summer, Nansen went out on the ice pack and investigated a pollen-like substance that seemed to cover the ice everywhere with a brownish color.\nInner Earth explorer Olaf Jansen explains that the northern shores of the inner world are covered with large fields that grow flowers, whose pollen is blown out over the Arctic ice fields through the North Polar Opening.\nThen volcanic dust fell on the Fram and settled everywhere causing discomfort and irritation.\u00a0 Nansen wrote in his ship's journal, \"Let us go home.\u00a0 What have we to stay for?\u00a0 Nothing but dust, dust, dust.\"\u00a0 There must have been volcanic eruption on the inner continent near the Polar Opening.\u00a0 The dust may have blown out of the Polar Opening onto the ice and upon Nansen's ship, the Fram.\nPrior to his Arctic expedition, Nansen had visited Russia and consulted with their experts about their sighting of a mirage of land they termed Sannikov land north of the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 The New Siberian islands even today are covered with bones and remains of mammoths and other inner earth animals that Olaf Jansen claims fell into ice crevasses of inner earth rivers that empty into the Arctic Polar Opening where they froze and later were carried out to sea and eventually ended up deposited onto northern Arctic shores.\u00a0 Remains of woolly rhino, steppe lions, giant deer, mammoth, foxes and a hardy breed horse that scientists claim are prehistoric are preserved in the Arctic ice.\u00a0 Recently,\u00a0some scientists have been attempting to find some of these exotic animal remains that are frozen and preserved in Arctic ice. They want to take samples of the frozen flesh and use it to clone these exotic animals to start a sort of Jurassic Park.\u00a0 Little do they know that a Jurassic Park of sorts already exists located inside Our Hollow Earth, and can be reached through the North Polar Opening, north of the New Siberian Islands, from whence all the frozen exotic carcasses come from.\nIt is important to note that the frozen mammoth remains and other animal remains increase in number the farther north one goes in Siberia, being most numerous in the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 You can read this report at http://www.creationevidence.org/scientific_evid/mammoths/mammoths.html .\u00a0 This indicates to me that these mammoth and exotic animal remains were perhaps spewed out of our hollow earth through the polar opening north of the New Siberian Islands onto the Siberian coasts by the water of Noah's flood or\u00a0some subsequent\u00a0world-wide catastrophe such as at the time of the Israelite exodus from Egypt in\u00a01495 B.C.\u00a0 Scientists have\u00a0belabored over the origin of these frozen mammoth remains in Siberia for decades, but Olaf Jansen gave the answer to how these animals are found\u00a0mangled with\u00a0large tree trunk remains and undigested vegetation in their stomachs.\u00a0 He reported that they originate from inside our Hollow Earth.\nSeveral have suggested that because the north magnetic pole is today located in the Beaufort Sea, that perhaps this indicates that the polar opening is located there.\u00a0\u00a0This ignores the fact that the magnetic poles move.\u00a0 Four hundred years ago, the north magnetic pole was located in northern Europe, so does that mean the polar opening has moved also?\nAssuming\u00a0that the earth in the creation period,\u00a0was most probably formed in rotation, the polar openings would have formed at the polar axis of the earth where centrifugal force would\u00a0have thrown\u00a0matter away from the axis of rotation.\u00a0 Yet when the polar opening was formed and the earth solidified to its present solid state, those openings would then\u00a0be fixed in the solid shell of the earth -- and not moving around with the movement of the magnetic poles.\nSubsequent passages of planet sized comets may have tipped the earth on its axis somewhat so that now the polar openings are now not\u00a0centered over the geographic poles of the earth, but\u00a0located approximately 5 degrees from the pole.\nMirages of the Inner Continent within the polar opening have been sighted all around the Arctic.\u00a0 The Russians have sighted it north of the New Siberian Islands.\u00a0 Admiral Peary, MacMillan, Lt. Green and some Eskimos sighted it northwest of Ellesmere Island.\u00a0 Dr. Cook took a picture of it on his way to the pole in 1907 at about 84 N Lat, 95.3 W Lon, and named it Bradley land .\u00a0 He said it appeared to the west of his trek to the pole.\u00a0 He was located at that time at 84 N Latitude -- close to the same latitude the polar opening is mostly likely located -- at 87.7 N Lat, 142.2 E Lon, where I have estimated the polar opening is located.\nIf the polar opening is located in the Beaufort Sea, Dr. Cook\u00a0would have sighted it towards the southwest of his position at the time.\u00a0 The Beaufort Sea location is also southwest of\u00a0Axel Heiberg Island near Ellesmere Island where Admiral Peary, MacMillian and Lt. Green sighted Crocker land.\u00a0 Yet they clearly stated that they sighted Crocker land towards the northwest of their position, not southwest.\u00a0\u00a0 Captain Keenan reportedly sighted a mirage of land north of Harrison Bay, Alaska, as well as others.\u00a0 I think what is happening is that warm, moist air coming up out of the polar opening on the Russian side of the pole spreads the mirage of land over the landscape curvature of the opening as it curves out towards the pole allowing the Russians to see it north of the New Siberian Islands, the Canadians to see it northwest of Ellesmere Island, and the Americans to see it north of Alaska.\nCertainly, in our search for the polar opening in\u00a0Our Hollow Earth Expedition, we will come within 400 miles of it so that we can detect it's exact location with our gyroscopes.\nSteve Currey, our expedition organizer, discovered May 1 he had brain cancer with 6 tumors, and on May 22 was advised it was incurable.\u00a0 He passed away July 26 and his funeral was August 1, 2006 in Provo, Utah.\u00a0 The family announced that they were canceling their involvement in the expedition and have returned to expedition members all monies.

It is in the skies over the relatively balmy central Pacific Ocean that the worst snow storms gather their moisture and intensity before slamming the U.S. mainland a few days later. From 45,000 feet above the Pacific, east and west of Hawaii \u2014 and sometimes as far north as Alaska \u2014 data on wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature and humidity are fed from the plane\u2019s sensors to meteorologists onboard, much the same way they survey hurricanes.

Our fellow techno-geeks over at Gizmodo have the (remarkable) story: \u201cThis is really bad. NASA has published an image of the pollution haze taking all over the North China Plain. Yes, it\u2019s so bad that you can see it taking over thousands of square miles from space. Things were so bad that visibility dropped to 200 meters. The Chinese capital\u2019s airport had to cancel 43 flights and delayed 80 more. The first image\u2014taken by NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite\u2014shows the situation on January 10. The entire North China Plain was covered with a gray pollution haze. You can also see white patches: that\u2019s normal fog hanging below the haze. On the second image, you can see the skies on the next day: the heaviest pollution is mostly gone, moved by the wind.\u201d\nObserving The Earth: A Southern Summer Bloom. I\u00a0thought this was pretty amazing, courtesy of ESA , the European Space Agency: \u201cIn this Envisat image, a phytoplankton bloom swirls a figure-of-8 in the South Atlantic Ocean about 600 km east of the Falkland Islands. During this period in the southern hemisphere, the ocean becomes rich in minerals from the mixing of surface waters with deeper waters. Phytoplankton depend on these minerals, making blooms like this common in the spring and summer. These microscopic organisms are the base of the marine food chain, and play a huge role in the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the production of oxygen in the oceans. By helping to regulate the carbon cycle, phytoplankton are important to the global climate system. \u201c\nCan U.S. Deter Cyberwar? The Diplomat examines a vaguely terrifying threat \u2013 the next war may involve shutting down the Internet (and countless companies, services, utilities, etc): \u201cThere has been a great deal of thinking and writing about why deterrence is difficult in cyberspace. Attacks can be masked, or routed through another country\u2019s networks. And even if you know for sure the attack came from a computer in country X, you can\u2019t be sure the government was behind it. All of this creates the attribution problem: It\u2019s hard to deter if you can\u2019t punish, and you can\u2019t punish without knowing who is behind an attack. Moreover, much of the cyber activity is espionage, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a government threatening military action for the theft of data.\u201d\nThe 10 Best Gadgets And Tech At CES 2012. Techradar.com has a story that may appeal to techno-geeks: \u201cAt one end of the scale, CES is about big, high-end product announcements \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest TV, the smallest pico projector, hi-fi speakers that cost more than your car. Or are bigger than your car . At the other end it\u2019s about companies you\u2019ve never (or barely) heard of trying to catch the tired eye of a wandering blogger with head-mounted displays, portable scanners and USB penknives. Filter out the noise with our pick of the best gadgets and tech of CES 2012.\n1. Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook\nYou know that it\u2019s a low-key CES when laptops are the stars of the show. Of course, the Dell XPS 13 isn\u2019t just any old laptop. It\u2019s part of the first wave of Intel Ultrabooks, super skinny portables that hope to outdo the MacBook Air (for power, if not skinny styling).\u201d\nFor The First Time In Years Your Next PC Will Be Amazing. O.K. I navigate both worlds: Windows and Mac. Certain weather programs only run on Windows PC\u2019s (I\u2019ve tried emulation \u2013 doesn\u2019t work for these applications). I use Windows for the office, everything at home, editing, photos, music, streaming, is via Apple. So I appreciate innovation in both camps. Gizmodo has some encouraging news: \u201cBy now you\u2019re maybe sick of hearing about ultrabooks, the best chance Windows rigs have to catch up to Apple laptops in design, usability, build quality, and general good-and-wantable-product-ness. Don\u2019t be. What\u2019s coming from PC manufacturers in 2012 isn\u2019t the inevitable, dreary sameness that\u2019s made laptops so boring for the last decade. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. If what we\u2019ve seen so far this year is any indication, the notebooks of the near-future look good and thoughtful and true. The design elements are inspiring. The features are useful. And most importantly: They don\u2019t just imitate, they improve.

How much time do you have? There is no neat, elegant, TV soundbite answer, sadly. We can explain WHAT is happening but WHY is problematic.\nFor much of winter the jet stream has been stuck in a Marchlike rut, record winds blowing unusually far north, preventing bitter air from surging south. La Nina is a factor, along with blocking patterns; the AO and NAO patterns that have reached record levels in recent winter. Solar activity is on the rise; melting arctic ice may be a factor too.\nYou can no longer separate out weather from climate. They are flip-sides of the same coin. Something is injecting more energy into the weather machine. Extremes are becoming more extreme; this trend toward drier, milder winters was predicted by climate models 30 years ago.\nA coating of snow today marks the leading edge of milder air; freezing will feel good on Sunday.\nNext week may be the coldest week of winter. If our first subzero reading comes Wednesday we\u2019ll tie a record (2002) for the latest subzero on record.\n* graphic above courtesy of WISN-TV in Madison.\nClimate Stories\u2026.\nMassive Ecological Change Predicted For Canada: NASA. The story from lfpress.com : \u201cMany parts of Canada are predicted to see massive ecological changes over the next century, according to NASA. Researchers from the space agency\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology investigated how Earth\u2019s plant life is likely to react over the next three centuries to changes in climate brought about by rising levels of human-produced greenhouse gases. \u201cWhile warnings of melting glaciers, rising sea levels and other environmental changes are illustrative and important, ultimately, it\u2019s the ecological consequences that matter most,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead scientist, Jon Bergengren, in a news release. One of the consequences, their computer model predicts, is that most of the land not covered by ice or desert will undergo at least a 30% change in plant cover \u2014 changes that will require humans and animals to adapt and often relocate.\u201d\nCan Better Communication Of Climate Science Cut Climate Risks? Andrew Revkin at the New York Time\u2019s Dot Earth has a good post, where he interviews a Danish scientist who is still incredulous that basic scientific truths aren\u2019t being adequately communicated. In short, there are natural, cyclical variations in climate, there is random noise and natural variability, and then there is a secular, human-induced signal, from the roughly 95 million tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere daily. And that last component continues to grow with time. An excerpt from the interview with Revkin and Physics Nobelist Murray Gell-Man:\nGell-Mann: \u201cIs it really, really so extremely difficult to persuade people that climate, which is average weather, can have three contributions that add to one another? That is, some cyclical effects, some random noise and a secular steadily rising trend from human activity?\u201d\nRevkin: \u201cI spent 20 years focused on the basic physics and geoscience of this\u2026 But I\u2019ve spent the last five or six years focused on the social science. How we perceive problems, how we respond, or don\u2019t. And global warming is the world\u2019s worst problem in that sense. It has all the elements that make it the kind of thing we don\u2019t, as a public or individuals, really engage on.\u201d\nHow Will Global Warming Affect Our Water Supplies? The Mercury has the story: \u201cClimate change promises to have a very big impact on water supplies in the United States as well as around the world. A recent study commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a leading environmental group, and carried out by the consulting firm Tetra Tech found that one out of three counties across the contiguous United States should brace for water shortages by mid-century as a result of human induced climate change. The group found that 400 of these 1,100 or so counties will face \u201cextremely high risks of water shortages.\u201d\n12 Simple(ish) Ways To Reduce Global Warming Two Thirds By 2050. Treehugger.com has the story:\nSwitch to cleaner burning cookstoves \u2014 In addition to being a major health hazard when used indoors, disproportionally affecting women, inefficient cookstoves are a major source of black carbon soot. Currently they cause an estimated 1.6 million premature deaths annually. There are a number of much more efficient versions of these type of cookstoves available right now. In other words, it won\u2019t require a wholesale shift in the way people cook or major lifestyle changes. That is, except for the premature death part.\nLimit leaks from the fossil fuel industry \u2014 Though in up to 90% of methane byproduct of fossil fuel production is captured and reused in many industrialized nations, in many developing countries that drops to 20%. Raising that figure will reduce methane emissions and slow warming.\nMIT Scientist\u2019s Wife Threatened In A \u201cFrenzy Of Hate\u201d. It\u2019s come to this \u2013 death threats against climate scientist\u2019s families? Mother Jones has the story: \u201cProminent MIT researcher Kerry Emanuel has been receiving an unprecedented \u201cfrenzy of hate\u201d after a video featuring an interview with him was published last week by Climate Desk. Emails contained \u201cveiled threats against my wife,\u201d and other \u201ctangible threats,\u201d Emanuel, a highly regarded atmospheric scientist and director of MIT\u2019s Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate program, said in an interview. \u201cThey were vile, these emails. They were the kind of emails nobody would like to receive. \u201cWhat was a little bit new about it was dragging family members into it and feeling that my family might be under threat, so naturally I didn\u2019t feel very good about that at all,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cI thought it was low to drag somebody\u2019s spouse into arguments like this.\u201d\nGlobal Warming Fires Up A $300,000 Complaint. Courthouse News Service has more: \u201cLOS ANGELES (CN) \u2013 Actor-economist-political pundit Ben Stein claims he was wrongfully fired from a $300,000 job on a TV commercial because of his view of global warming: that \u201cGod, and not man\u201d controls the weather. Stein, a former New York Times columnist who does commercials in his signature bow tie, glasses and a sports jacket, claims a Kyocera Corp. affiliate breached his contract and wrongfully fired him after it learned of his opinion about climate change. Then, Stein says, Kyocera and its ad agency \u201cin an astonishingly brazen misappropriation of Ben Stein\u2019s persona,\u201d dressed up a college professor \u201cas Stein often appeared in commercials (bow tie, glasses, sports jacket)\u201d and had the professor do the commercial as a Ben Stein imitator.\u201d\nTo Slow Climate Change, Cut Down On Soot, Ozone. NPR has the story: \u201cPolitically, climate change is off this year\u2019s campaign agenda. Jobs, the economy and social issues are front and center. But scientists are working as hard as ever to figure out how much the Earth is warming and what to do about it. Some now say it\u2019s time for a new strategy, one that gets faster results. Talk to Durwood Zaelke, for example. Zaelke is a grizzled veteran of the climate wars: He was in Kyoto in 1997 when the world\u2019s nations drafted a treaty promising to curb warming, and he has watched that promise fizzle while the planet\u2019s temperature continues to rise.\u201d Photo credit here .\nInvestors Say Private Sector Must Tackle Climate Change. Amen. Let\u2019s not leave this to government to muck up. Let the markets. I\u2019m investing my own money into green energy (designing software to make energy from wind turbines more predictable and profitable via a company called Smart Energy). Climate change is a threat, and the mother of all opportunities for start-ups \u2013 to design carbon-free forms of energy to power future growth and expansion. Reuters has the story: \u201cInstitutional investors with a collective $26 trillion under management opened a new front on Thursday in the fight against climate change, urging the private sector to mobilize, follow the money and find new technologies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Putting a price on climate-warming carbon emissions, which has been instituted in parts of Europe and elsewhere with limited success, would be \u201cnice to have\u201d but not essential, said Kevin Parker, global head of Deutsche Asset Management.\u201d Photo above courtesy of inhabitant.com .\nThis entry was posted in Weather .

Hoffman on Sun, 01/24/2010 - 14:05\nWith all the predictions of short term climate catastrophes proffered by global warming alarmists it is hard to look forward to a future time on Earth. What does the future hold a thousand, ten thousand, a million years from now? Science has some predictions about that as well, though the news media have not picked up on them. What environmental changes await us on the long road ahead?\nThe Northern Hemisphere has been hammered by the coldest winter in decades. Chinese provinces prepared to introduce power rationing as electricity supplies lagged behind demand amid harsh winter weather. In the UK things have been so bad that Keith Mitchell, the leader of the Oxfordshire County Council, accused county residents of lacking the \u201cBritish spirit that defeated Hitler\u201d in the wake of the freezing weather. Just to confuse things, a new report in report in Science says NASA's GISS proclaimed \u201c2009 Hottest Year on Record in Southern Hemisphere.\u201d\nIn the US, AccuWeather meteorologist Joe Bastardi reports: \u201cThe coldest start to an El Ni\u00f1o winter since the '70s, in the wake of the thaw, may have a top 10-15 cold February nationwide.\u201d Outlook India's headline proclaimed \u201cNorth India Reels Under Cold Wave, 154 Dead.\u201d There were reports of frozen sheep in Scotland, and snow fell Down Under during the Australian summer.\nIn Europe, the protesters at the Copenhagen Climate Conference were treated to snow and record cold temperatures that some blamed on the Gore Effect. The term \u201cGore Effect\u201d comes from the observation that unseasonable weather seems to accompany former US Vice President and Nobel Laureate Al Gore whenever he appears at a global warming event or public hearing. Since 2004 these coincidences have occurred with increasing frequency.\nPresident Obama left Copenhagen early in an attempt to avoid the weather, only to arrive back in Washington for a major winter storm that engulfed the entire east coast. Florida experienced the its longest stretch of cold weather in 100 years. In southern Florida frozen iguanas were falling out of the trees. So-called \u201ckamikaze\u201d iguanas are an urban legend among Floridians but became a common sight as temperatures dropped almost to freezing.\nAll of this wicked weather comes with the often repeated warning that weather is not climate. So what is going on with the climate? It looks like a combination of El Ni\u00f1o and the multi-decadal oscillations in the Pacific and Atlantic are conspiring to cause a temperature downturn world wide. In the near term we are in for the usual multi-decadal variations in hot and cold. Prof Anastasios Tsonis, head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group, has recently shown that these MDOs move together in a synchronized way across the globe, abruptly flipping the world\u2019s climate from a \u2018warm mode\u2019 to a \u2018cold mode\u2019 and back again in 20 to 30-year cycles.\n\u201cThey amount to massive rearrangements in the dominant patterns of the weather,\u201d Tsonis explained, \u2018and their shifts explain all the major changes in world temperatures during the 20\nth\nand 21\nst\nCenturies. We have such a change now and can therefore expect 20 or 30 years of cooler temperatures.\u201d The bigger question is, does the current cooling trend indicate the start of the next transition from interglacial back to glacial conditions\u2014are we headed back into an ice age?\nThe Northern Hemisphere has suffered its coldest winter in decades.\nSo many scientists are predicting continued cooling for 20, 30 even 50 years, though the IPCC insists that global warming will be back with a vengeance. No consensus there. But what about 1,000, 10,000, even 1,000,000 years from now? What follows is speculation, based on science but speculation none the less. These are my projections of what science knows about climate change into the future\u2014just some possible scenarios. Besides, it's not like I'll be around to take the credit or the blame if they do or don't come true.\nEarth 3010 AD\nThe general term \u201cice age\u201d or, more precisely, \u201cglacial age\u201d denotes a geological period of long-term reduction in Earth's surface and atmospheric temperature, resulting in an expansion of continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers. For the past several million years, Earth has been locked in an ice age called the Pleistocene. Glacial periods come and go with remarkable regularity, lasting 100,000 years or so and then transitioning to a much warmer interglacial period for 10,000 to 15,000 years. The last such glacial period finally ended about 11,000 years ago (see \u201c Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages \u201d).\nIf the current interglacial, optimistically designated the Holocene epoch, follows the previous cycles there could be several thousand years of temperate climate left. But that is just working with average behavior. There have been shorter interglacials and much longer ones as well. Subtle shifts in Earth's orbit around the Sun moderates the amount of energy entering the Earth's climate system. These variations in Earth's orbital and rotational configuration are known to trigger or end glacial periods, but other factors come into play as well.\nVariations in solar output occur on much shorter, decadal time-scales than glacial-interglacial climate oscillations. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations also correlate nearly perfectly with Ice Age cycles\u2014but CO\n2\nis thought to be a positive feedback, not the trigger. Other feedback mechanisms\u2014the amount of airborne dust, changes in albedo, shifting ocean currents, etc.\u2014complicate the interplay of environment and solar radiation. When the combination of influences are right Earth's climate undergoes dramatic changes.\nThere are also longer cycles seen within warm interglacial periods. Perhaps caused by longer term variation in solar output, these cycles can span for centuries. Since people have been around to directly observe them these alternating periods of warm and cold have been given names: The Little Ice Age , the Medieval Warm Period and so on. While Earth has indisputably been in a warming trend for the past 150 years or so, our planet may well enter a new cooling phase that could last for centuries.\nSeas rise as the current interglacial continues, 3010 AD.\nMost likely, a thousand years from now the climate will have resumed warming. This means that glaciers and the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica will continue to melt, raising sea-levels around the world by several more meters. Many coastal areas will be flooded and humanity will be called on to do what it does best, adapt. My forecast for 3010 AD is for slightly warmer temperatures, moderately higher sea-levels an a slightly more active hydrological cycle (more rain). You may have to move your beachfront cottage, but other than that things will be quite comfortable.\nContrary to the dire warnings that rising sea-levels constitute a climate crisis, rising sea-levels during an interglacial are perfectly natural\u2014an interglacial is one long stretch of glacial melting (see \u201c Ice Core Evidence for Extensive Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet in the Last Interglacial \u201d). The Eemian interglacial period, the second-to-latest interglacial period of the Pleistocene Ice Age Ice, reached its height around 125,000 years ago. Sea-level at that peak was probably 4-6\u00a0m (12-20\u00a0ft) higher than today (see \u201c Paleoclimatic Evidence for Future Ice-Sheet Instability and Rapid Sea-Level Rise \u201d). Much of this extra water came from Greenland but some also came from Antarctica. When the glaciers and ice caps stop melting and ice begins to accumulate again it is a sign that Earth is beginning another slow descent into ice age conditions.\nEarth 10,010 AD\nDuring each glacial period, the mile-thick ice sheets that cover much of the top of the world also go through cycles lasting a few thousand years: sometimes thickening and extending, other times thinning and receding. In counterpoint to the varying ice the world's oceans rise and fall by as much as 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft), and in doing so make their own contribution to climate change (see \u201c Influence of Bering Strait flow and North Atlantic circulation on glacial sea-level changes \u201d). Cycles within cycles.\nBased on geological records available in 1972, the last two interglacials were believed to have lasted about 10,000 years\u2014about the length of the Holocene to date. Assuming that all interglacials were of similar duration, the scientists concluded that \u201cit is likely that the present-day warm epoch will terminate relatively soon if man does not intervene.\u201d Early attempts to predict future climate, based on the cooling trend that started at the peak of the Holocene some 6000 years ago, predicted a cold interval in about 25,000 years and a full glaciation in about 55,000 years.\nA new glacial period begins, 10,010 AD.\nThis implies that, in 10,000 years, Earth could be starting a new glacial period. From paleoclimate records we know that, while the transition from glacial to interglacial takes place quite rapidly, only a matter of a few thousand years, the transition from interglacial to glacial is much slower. By 10,010, the planet may once again be cooling, with glaciers beginning to advance as the climate grows ever colder. Recently, however, some scientists have come to doubt this prediction.\nEarth 100,010 AD\nThat doubt is based on the observation that, over the next 100,000 years, the amplitude of insolation variations will be small, in fact much smaller than during the Eemian. This means that insolation, the energy Earth receives from the Sun, will also vary only slightly. If this proves correct then the Eemian should not be used as a model for the the current interglacial (see \u201c An Exceptionally Long Interglacial Ahead? \u201d).\nThe small amplitude of future insolation variations is exceptional. In fact, the last time such conditions occurred was more than 400,000 years ago, during the interglacial known as Marine Isotope Stage 11 (see \u201c Oceanic forcing of the Marine Isotope Stage 11 \u201d). Then and now, very low eccentricity values coincided with the minima of the 400,000-year eccentricity cycle. Eccentricity will reach almost zero within the next 25,000 years, leading to speculation that the Holocene will last for as long as 28,000 years. Recent results by Peltier and Vettoretti, using the Canadian climate general circulation model, showed that given present-day insolation levels and using preindustrial CO\n2\nlevels, no glacial inception is likely.\nSome would go even farther, suggesting that human activity will cause an \u201cirreversible greenhouse effect,\u201d short-circuiting the natural cycle of glacials and interglacials. If anthropogenic global warming is taking place at the rate predicted by the IPCC, and if the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets disappear completely, then today's Holocene may become the transition between the Pleistocene Ice Age and the next geological period.\nIn 1972, J. Murray Mitchell Jr. already predicted in that \u201cthe net impact of human activities on the climate of the future decades and centuries is quite likely to be one of warming and therefore favorable to the perpetuation of the present interglacial.\u201d Would that really be so bad, considering the likely alternative?\nNew York City buried by resurgent glacial ice, 100,010 AD.\nThat alternative is a return to full glacial conditions. The 100,000-year cycle only appeared about 800,000 years ago. Prior to that, going back to the very beginning of the Pleistocene Ice Age about 3 million years ago, smaller ice sheets varied at an almost clock-like 41,000-year rhythm. This is the period of changes in orbital tilt. After several million years of shorter cycles, Earth shifted to its current glacial-interglacial timing cycle, the so called \u201c100,000-year world\u201d (see \u201c Glacial Puzzles \u201d).\nThe defining characteristics of the \u201c100,000-year world\u201d are terminations: rapid and abrupt shifts from extreme glacial to extreme interglacial conditions that are not observed earlier in the Pleistocene. These terminations, which conclude a glacial period, require the buildup of unusually large, presumably unstable ice sheets. The inherent instability of these ice sheets in part explains the extraordinary rapidity of the deglaciation. Some scientists believe that an increase in global temperature, as we are now experiencing, could be a sign of an impending ice age. The warmth causes more precipitation and actually increases the amount of ice on Earth's surface.\nWhat causes the 100,000-year cycle? According to M. E. Raymo, from the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences:\nI would answer that it is a pseudoperiodic cycle varying in length from about 80,000 to 120,000 years. It is caused by the periodic buildup of large ice sheets during times of unusually low summer insolation at high latitudes that occur roughly every 100,000 years as dictated by the interaction of precession with eccentricity and, to a lesser degree, obliquity. A cycle ends abruptly, with a termination, when insolation increases above a threshold value that causes the ice sheet to become unstable and melt rapidly.\nWhat this all means is that the glaciers will probably return, once again burying the Northern Hemisphere under a thick blanket of ice. In North America during glacials past, the ice reached the present day location of the Ohio and Missouri Rivers, although the last advance (called the Wisconsin) did not reach as far south as some of the previous advances. Still, expect New York City and a host of other modern metropolises to vanish under miles of frozen H\n2\nO, while land that has not been above the surface of the ocean in millennia reappears. The forecast for 100,010 is cold and snowy with cool summers and falling sea-levels. If people still exist on this planet they might think a little global warming would be a good idea.\nEarth 1,000,010 AD\nToday, only 11,000 years have passed since the last glacial and scientists can not be certain that we are living in a post-glacial Holocene epoch instead of just another in the long sequence of Pleistocene interglacials. Geologic history shows that ice ages eventually come to a complete end and do not occur again for many millions of years. We know that the Milankovitch Cycles control the timing of glacials and interglacials, but what controls the longer term climate pattern?\nThere are a number of theories that link cosmic rays and the solar system's position within the Milky Way Galaxy to long term climate trends. These include Cosmoclimatology , espoused by Svensmark and Shaviv, et al., and the Galactic Geologic Interval Theory , proposed by MOShaver and others. Given the time scales these theories work on, and our only approximate knowledge of the distant past, it is not surprising that they have not been widely accepted. They do, however, propose a mechanism for the beginning and ending of earthly icehouse conditions.\nMost simply put, our galaxy's spiral arms are filled with dust and young, hot, short-lived stars that frequently explode. When the solar system is in one of the arms Earth receives high levels of galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere to increase cloud cover and create conditions favorable to climate cooling. Conversely, during the long transits of the inter-arm gaps the climate warms and ice ages do not occur. Arm transits have also been blamed for mass extinction events , but that is outside the purpose of this article.\nThe solar system's place in the galaxy. NASA.\nThe solar system, including our Earth, is orbiting around the center Milky Way Galaxy every 225 million years, in an orbit that is 52,000 light years long. At our radial distance from the Galaxy core\u2014about 26,000 light years\u2014six spiral arms intersect with our orbit. Our current position is close to the inner rim of the Orion Arm, a spur of one of the arms. The orbital speed of the Solar System is approximately 220 km/s. At this speed, it takes around 1,400 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 8 days to travel 1 AU (astronomical unit, the mean distance between Earth and the Sun, approximately 150 million km or 93 million miles). In a million years one might guess that the solar system would be 700 light-years farther across the Orion Arm and headed for the open space separating it from the next arm out, but things are not so simple.\nThe spiral arms, which are thought to be compression waves, not moving bands of stars, are themselves moving (for a detailed discussion of cosmic rays and spiral arms see The Resilient Earth , Chapter 11 ). The Relative velocity of our solar system to the Orion Arm is 26 km/s into the Solar Apex point, the star Vega in the constellation Sagittarius. Assuming the next Major Geological Galactic Period is within maximum deviation limits recorded, statistically, it is certain to occur within the next 8 million years.\nThe Pleistocene Ice Age ends, 1,000,010 AD.\nGiven the information above, my forecast for 1,000,010 AD is more like a long range weather forecast\u2014the Ice Age could be clearing as early as 1,000,000 years from now, but it could take millions of years longer. Eventually the solar system will pass out of the Orion Arm and the Pleistocene Ice Age will truly come to an end. Estimates of how long it takes to cross an average inter-arm gap of 4,500 light-years range from 50\u00b15 to 70\u00b114 million years. The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 6,500 light-years. This means that, if the cosmoclimatology theory is correct, once we pass into the inter-arm gap we should be done with ice ages for quite a while.\nEarth 1,000,000,010 AD\nIn the far future, a billion years from now, the climate is going to change in ways never before seen on Earth. Our star has been slowly growing brighter over the ages, a trend that will continue right up until the Sun becomes a red giant. Estimates vary, but it is thought that Earth will become too hot to support life a billion years from now. The nurturing Sun, the source of all life energy on Earth will eventually bake us to a crisp.\nIn 1982, Lovelock and Whitfield suggested that, as the luminosity of the Sun increases over its lifespan, biologically enhanced silicate weathering may be able to reduce the concentration of atmospheric CO\n2\nso that Earth's surface temperature is maintained within an inhabitable range. Unfortunately, in about 900,000,000 years all of Earth's atmospheric CO\n2\nwill have been absorbed and that will have some rather drastic consequences for all living things (see \u201c Too Little CO\nTo End Life On Earth \u201d).\nThe Sun that nurtures us will eventually incinerate the Earth.\nAccording to an article in PNAS, Earth's entire biota are threatened by the eventual loss of atmospheric carbon dioxide. You see CO\n2\nis plant food and without it there are no plants. Without plants there are no animals, and that includes human beings (assuming we manage to survive until then). The eventual death of the planetary biosphere due to lack of carbon dioxide tells us some things about the current CO\n2\ninduced global warming hysteria. As S. Franck, C. Bounama, and W. von Bloh put it in \u201c Causes and timing of future biosphere extinction \u201d in Biogeosciences Discussions:\nProcaryotes, eucaryotes, and complex multicellular life forms will extinct in reverse sequence of their appearance. This is a quantitative manifestation of the qualitative predictions of Ward and Brownlee (2002). We have shown that nonlinear interactions in the biosphere-geosphere system cause bistability during the Neo- and Mesoproterozoic era. For realistic values of the biotic enhancement of weathering there is no bistability in the future solutions for complex life. Therefore, complex organisms will not extinct by an implosion (in comparison to the Cambrian explosion). Eucaryotes and complex life extinct because of too high surface temperatures in the future. The ultimate life span of the biosphere is defined by the extinction of procaryotes in about 1.6 Gyr because of CO\n2\nstarvation. Only in a small fraction (1.3 Gyr) of its habitability time (6.2 Gyr) our home planet can harbour advanced life forms.\nThough carbon dioxide levels have varied widely over the 4.5 billion years of Earth's existence the trend is irrefutably downward. When taken as part of the grand sweep of Earth's history the current rise of atmospheric CO\n2\nlevels is not even noteworthy. The PNAS article cited above states \u201cAs this process continues, however, between 100 and 900 million years (Ma) from now the CO\n2\nconcentration will reach levels too low for C3 and C4 photosynthesis, signaling the end of the solar-powered biosphere.\u201d Life will die and the ever hotter Sun will provide a suitable funeral pyre. The forecast for 1,000,000,010 is hellishly hot with 100% chance of total extinction.\nEarth 10,000,000,010 AD\nOur Sun, like all stars, will die. The fate of a star when it leaves the main-sequence, after exhausting its supply of hydrogen fuel, depends partly on its mass. Once a star's hydrogen is spent, it will start burning helium in a nuclear reaction that forms carbon and oxygen. A side effect of this change in nuclear fuel is swelling and cooling of a star's outer layers. When this happens, the star becomes a red giant.\nAt the end of their lives, stars rapidly burn through helium and progressively heaver elements, but it is a loosing proposition. When a star the size of the Sun runs totally out of fuel it collapses, and the sudden contraction causes one or more explosions. These explosions blow off the outer layers of the star, forming a planetary nebula. Over time, the matter in the nebula will disperse, leaving behind a white dwarf\u2014the cooling remains of the burned-out star.\nThis is where we came from and where our atoms will return to some day.\nIn the long run we are all going to end up scattered atoms that may well become part of a new planet circling a new star. A few of your atoms or mine might even end up is some sentient creature, perhaps a creature that is worried about its species and the future of its planet's environment. In the future Earth's climate is going to change with or without mankind's puny contributions to global warming. We try to predict the future, but the road ahead will undoubtedly contain twists and turns we can not even imagine.\nSo here is my long term 10 billion year forecast: Continued warm with occasional periods of glaciation, eventually followed by a permanent thaw and slowly rising temperatures, finished off by the Sun shedding its out layers and scattering our ashes into space. But don't be depressed: this bleak end lies further in the future than twice the Earth's total lifespan to date. No form of complex multicellular life, no species alive today has survived even a tenth that long.

Please note that all graphs can be seen full size by clicking on the image.\nAn analysis of Australian temperature data recorded at fixed times, and the implications for the 'global average land surface temperature' derived from minimum and maximum temperatures\nJonathan Lowe, an Australian statistician, has performed extensive analysis of weather data recorded at fixed times by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). This analysis is available at his blog, A Gust of Hot Air. The data comes from 21 weather stations manned by professional meteorologists.\nThis work needs to be brought to a wider audience because it paints a very different climate picture to the global land datasets based on minimum and maximum temperatures \u2013 GISS, HadCRUT and the recent BEST analysis.\nI'll present his discoveries in three parts, as there appear to be three significant elements in his work.\nUsing a minimum and maximum temperature dataset exaggerates the increase in the global average land surface temperature over the last 60 years by approximately 45%\nAlmost all the warming over the last 60 years occurred between 6am and 12 noon\nWarming is strongly correlated with decreasing cloud cover during the daytime and is therefore caused by increased solar insolation\nI'll then add a part 4 covering some additional analysis of mine\nReduced anthropogenic aerosols (and clouds seeded by anthropogenic aerosols) are the cause of most the observed warming over the last 60 years\nPart 1 - Using a minimum and maximum temperature dataset exaggerates the increase in the global average land surface temperature over the last 60 years by approximately 45%\nThe BoM records temperature, and other values such at cloud cover, at three-hourly intervals for its main surface weather stations. This dataset goes back 60 years covering the same time period as the recent highly publicized BEST project.\nJonathan's analyses of the fixed time temperature data show that days have become significantly warmer. However, nights have warmed substantially less (only about a third of the day time warming).\nContrast this with the analyses based on minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin, Tmax) which show warmer days and even warmer nights, based on the assumption Tmin represents nighttime temperatures.\nIn fact, Tmin usually occurs after dawn at the point when incoming solar insolation exceeds outgoing longwave radiation.\nGISS, HadCRUT and BEST wrongly assume the mean of Tmin+Tmax represents average daily (24 hour) temperatures.\nAt best, the mean of Tmin+Tmax represents average daytime temperatures, and Jonathan's work confirms this.\nNote at this point, that any day time warming that does not persist through the following night time is irrelevant to climate warming, as it is not heat that is retained in the climate system for more than 24 hours. So even a correctly derived average temperature is a poor indicator of the amount of warming.\nIn summary, calculating average temperature from the 3 hourly data instead of the Tmin+Tmax/2 method results in ~45% less warming since 1950.\nThe graph below illustrates this.\nGISS, HadCRUT and Best all refer to their results based on Tmin+Tmax/2 as 'global average temperature'. Clearly, daily temperatures are a range and picking the mid-point of a range (which is what the mean of Tmin and Tmax is) is a poor way to estimate an average. Averaging measurements taken at fixed intervals will provided a more accurate estimate of the daily average.\nThe ~ 45% warming bias introduced into the 'global average temperature' by using Tmin+Tmax/2 is in itself is a very significant discovery, but there is considerably more to Jonathan's discoveries.\nPart 2 \u2013 Almost all of the warming over the last 60 years occurred between 6am and 12 noon\nJonathan uses the simple but elegant method of subtracting the temperature at one three-hour interval from the temperature at the next three-hour interval to determine at what times of day the warming over the last 60 years has occurred. This breaks down the total warming over the last 60 years into three-hour slices of the day.\nYou can see his graphs here - http://gustofhotair.blogspot.com/2009/04/analysis-of-australian-temperature-part_16.html\nHe finds that warming has occurred in only three of these time slices; 6am to 9am, 9am to 12 noon and 6pm to 9pm. The other five three-hour time slices show either a cooling trend or no significant trend.\nIn parts 3 and 4, I discuss physical mechanisms that would cause temperature rises to be restricted to these time periods.\nJonathan's analysis shows that there has been no warming occurring at nighttime at all since 1950. Although nighttime temperatures have risen due to residual heat from warmer days.\nThere are numerous published papers that uncritically state that nighttime temperatures are warming based on the fact daily minimum temperature is increasing.\nIn 1990, Kukla and Karl published a paper in Environmental Science and Technology that contained the following,\nAlmost all of the observed increase in mean daily temperature over land over the past 40 years appear to be a result of the increase in early morning minimum (temperature). One is tempted to reason that the efficient blanket of the CO2 rich atmosphere keeps the nighttime temperatures high.\nI find it surprising to say the least, that Tom Karl, Director Of The National Climate Data Center hasn't in the last 20 years investigated whether minimum temperatures (which he correctly states occurs in the early morning) do indeed measure nighttime temperatures, as this is perhaps the most important assumption underlying the evidence for AGW.\nI could find only one published paper that investigates the relationship between minimum temperatures and measured nighttime temperatures and that was based on hourly temperature measurements taken at one location, the Manua Loa Observatory, and apparently made by the same team that measures CO2 levels. They found that hourly nighttime temperatures did indeed closely correspond with minimum temperatures. Interestingly, they found a slight decrease in daytime temperatures measured at 12 noon, The authors attribute their results to GHG warming. Although they concede other effects could be at work, including clouds.\nhttp://www.clim-past.net/7/975/2011/cp-7-975-2011.pdf\nA study using Anthony Watts' Surface Stations data reaches a couple of interesting, albeit tentative conclusions. Firstly, it found that for the best sited stations, diurnal temperature range (DTR) has not decreased and perhaps even increased over the last century. Secondly, it found that the PDO has a cyclical influence on DTR.\nhttp://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/05/19/according-to-the-best-sited-stations-the-diurnal-temperature-range-in-the-lower-48-states-has-no-century-scale-trend/\nJonathan's work indicates a marked increase in the range of nighttime to daytime temperatures using the three-hourly data, even though this data doesn't directly measure DTR. Decreasing DTR is considered the signature of GHG warming (more nighttime warming than daytime warming), and this study concludes decreasing DTR at the poorer sited stations may well result from data quality issues.\nThe Manua Loa study used data from 1977 to 2006, which closely corresponds with the warm phase of the PDO, and this may account for the findings.\nFixed time temperature data is available in the USA. The American Meteorological Society states at its website.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) and its predecessor, the U.S. Weather Bureau, have operated a network of weather observation stations and offices in or near many of the large cities in every state, commonwealth, and territory under its jurisdiction. At many of these nearly 300 \"first-order stations,\" systematic measurements of numerous weather elements are made by professional observers. Some of these weather data are recorded hourly,\nI assume temperature measurements at fixed times is available in other countries.\nClimate science collectively having wrongly assumed minimum temperatures measure nighttime temperatures then goes on to misinterpret the role of clouds, which is the next part of Jonathan's analysis.\nPart 3 -Warming is strongly correlated with decreasing cloud cover during the daytime and is therefore caused by increased solar insolation\nThe BoM includes cloud cover in its three-hourly dataset.\nNote that the BoM's website says that cloud cover is still measured by the traditional method of an observer estimating how many eighths of the sky is cloud covered. While I find this surprising, without evidence to the contrary I'll assume this information is correct.\nThe BoM's three-hourly cloud cover data shows that there has been a marked decrease in cloud cover in the daytime, with a marked increase in cloud cover in the early part of the nighttime (measured at 9pm).\nJonathan then correlates the cloud cover trend with the temperature trend for each three-hourly set of data. Shown in the graphic below.\nUnsurprisingly, he finds decreased daytime cloud cover strongly correlated with increased daytime temperatures. There is a weaker correlation between cloud cover and overnight temperatures.\nSurprisingly, he finds that the increased cloud cover at 9pm and midnight doesn't correlate with increased warming, which is directly contrary to what is generally accepted as the effect of clouds on nightime temperatures. In part 4, I propose that these clouds are condensation from nighttime radiative cooling, and therefore thin limiting their capacity to reflect longwave radiation. However, clouds and LWR is a complex subject.\nThe significance of the cloud cover temperature correlation is that it occurs in the daytime and accounts for both increased minimum and maximum temperatures, as decreased clouds result in increased solar insolation and warmer days.\nThe effect of clouds on minimum and maximum temperature seems to be widely misunderstood in the climate science community. For example,\nFrom 1950 to at least the mid-1990s, minimum temperatures on land have increased about twice as fast as maximum temperatures [Easterling et al., 1997]. This may be attributable in part to increasing cloudiness, which reduces daytime warming by reflection of sunlight while retarding the nighttime loss of heat [Karl et al., 1997].\nKarl has got things exactly the wrong way round.\nPart 4 - Reduced anthropogenic aerosols (and clouds seeded by anthropogenic aerosols) are the cause of most the observed warming in the land surface over the last 60 years\nWhile Jonathan correctly concludes that increased solar insolation is the primary cause of both increased minimum and increased maximum land surface temperatures, I'd like to extend that conclusion with some analysis of my own.\nI mentioned earlier that the daily minimum temperature usually occurs in the early morning at the point when (incoming) solar insolation exceeds net outgoing longwave radiation. In the tropics this is a few minutes after dawn. At higher latitudes in winter it could be an hour or more after dawn.\nWhen the sun rises, solar irradiance initially travels at a low angle through the atmosphere and as a result traverses far more of the atmosphere than it will for most of the day.\nAny atmospheric effect that blocks or scatters solar irradiance and hence reduces solar insolation will have its maximum effect just after dawn around the time the minimum temperature occurs. Making the minimum temperature particularly sensitive to atmospheric effects that reduce insolation.\nThere are two effects at work reducing (especially early morning) solar insolation. One is clouds, particularly low level clouds. The other is aerosol pollution (smoke and haze), particularly low level aerosol pollution\nBear in mind that aerosols act as cloud seeding nuclei. So clouds and aerosols don't vary independently.\nA great deal of work has been done on the effect of aerosols on the climate and atmospheric temperatures. However, I am concerned with one specific effect that of aerosols on daily minimum temperature.\nWhich makes me focus on the effect of black carbon aerosols (smoke to most people).\nThe Daily University Science News reported,\nBlack Carbon Aerosol Pollution Cools, Heats, Confuses\nNew research based on NASA satellite data and a multinational field experiment shows that black carbon aerosol pollution produced by humans can impact global climate as well as seasonal cycles of rainfall.\nBecause aerosols that contain black carbon both absorb and reflect incoming sunlight, these particles can exert a regional cooling influence on Earth's surface that is about 3 times greater than the warming effect of greenhouse gases.\nBut even as these aerosols reduce by as much as 10 percent the amount of sunlight reaching the surface, they increase the solar energy absorbed in the atmosphere by 50 percent -- thus making it possible to both cool the surface and warm the atmosphere.\nScientists are concerned that this heating may perturb atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns.\n\"When we combined the satellite measurements with surface measurements, we found that the reduction of sunlight reaching the surface was three times larger than the amount of sunlight reflected to space,\" says V. Ramanathan, director of the Center for Clouds, Chemistry, and Climate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. \"Averaged over the entire northern Indian Ocean, the man-made pollutants reflected more solar radiation back to space (than pristine skies), but they absorbed up to twice as much radiation in the atmosphere.\"\nThe key phrase here is ' both cool the surface and warm the atmosphere' and recall that the daily minimum temperature occurs at the time when solar radiation is traversing the atmosphere at a low angle and any blocking or scattering by aerosols will have its maximum effect.\nI discussed this with Jonathan and he confirmed that domestic burning of coal and wood in open fires, agricultural burning and the burning of garden waste was widespread in Australia 50 to 60 years but has since been almost completely eliminated. I grew up in the UK and can confirm the same thing occurred there.\nAnyone under the age of 50 will have difficulty appreciating how much smoke an open hearth coal fire produces. I remember in the 1950s and 60s the winter morning ritual of lighting a coal fire. It produced a solid column of smoke up the chimney for 10 to 20 minutes before the coal got properly alight. Multiply that by tens of millions of homes and there was a lot of smoke within a few hundred feet of the ground when the sun rose.\nThen there was burning of agricultural and garden waste in the summer and autumn. Burning a pile of wet leaves produces a terrific amount of smoke.\nThe smoke from a fire is generally pictured as going more or less straight up. It doesn't. Initially it goes upwards but as the smoke cools to the ambient air temperature, it drifts with the wind almost horizontally, forming a layer typically a few hundred feet above the ground.\nStarting as early as the 1950s, clean air legislation in the developed world progressively reduced black carbon emissions until almost all routine emissions were eliminated. Which fits with the timing of increasing minimum and maximum temperatures in the global datasets\nBut what happened in the developing world, particularly rapidly industrializing China and India?\nSome studies of temperature trends in China show a larger warming trend than the global average (derived from Tmin+Tmax/2), especially minimum temperature.\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/3230.1\nOn investigation, I found that domestic coal burning which was the ubiquitous form of home heating 50 years is now banned in urban areas. So black carbon emissions will have substantially reduced in and around urban areas in China despite continuing high levels of other aerosol pollutants.\nOther studies show substantially less surface warming in China than the global average in recent decades.\nhttp://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~jean/monsoon/Menonmonsoon.pdf\nThe situation in India is complicated by the monsoon, which 'washes' aerosol pollution out the atmosphere. There is no doubt that domestic burning of coal, wood, agricultural waste and dung has substantially increased black carbon aerosol levels outside the monsoon season in recent decades. A study from Pune concludes.\nThe analysis reveals signi\ufb01cant decrease in mean annual and mean maximum temperature (since 1900). This decrease in temperature is more pronounced during the winter season, which can be ascribed to a signi\ufb01cant increase in the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the ambient air during the last decade. On the contrary, monsoon season shows warming. This warming can be attributed to a signi\ufb01cant increase in the low cloud amount.\nThe other area of the world that's of relevance is the old Soviet Block, where pollution controls were minimal. When the collapse occurred, almost all of the highly polluting Soviet era industry was shut down within a few years, and former Eastern Bloc countries rapidly implemented the kinds of clean air initiatives already in place in the West, rapidly reducing aerosol levels toward those in the West.\nOverall, the global picture is of substantially reduced aerosols, particularly black carbon, over most of the world since 1950. Although with substantial regional and national variations.\nIt is generally accepted that black carbon aerosols block sunlight, resulting in less solar insolation but at the same time warming the atmosphere. Decreasing black carbon will increase solar insolation, increasing minimum temperatures, while at the same time cooling the troposphere.\nIf changes in black carbon aerosol levels are as large as I believe, using land surface minimum temperature to measure global temperatures is giving an entirely false picture of the actual atmospheric warming over land. Increasing minimum temperatures is in fact evidence the atmosphere is cooling (and visa versa).\nOne final point before I wrap things up.\nIt is well accepted that aerosols, including black carbon, seed cloud formation. Decrease aerosols and you will decrease clouds. Therefore, I argue that the primary driver of changes in clouds found by Jonathan, and which I infer are primarily low level clouds, is changes in aerosol levels, particularly black carbon. Other studies support this conclusion, including the Pune study referred to above.\nThe reduced anthropogenic black carbon aerosols hypothesis neatly explains Jonathan's discovery of a sharp increase in cloud cover at 9pm.\nIf reduced anthropogenic aerosols are reducing cloud seeding and leading to less daytime clouds, more water vapour will remain in the atmosphere. This increased daytime water vapour will be more likely to condensate out as clouds when nightime radiative cooling occurs.\nSummary\nIn overall summary, it is clear that increased solar insolation, caused by a combination of decreased clouds and decreased anthropogenic aerosols (and I argue particularly black carbon), is the primary cause of increasing minimum and increasing maximum temperatures, and hence the increase in the land surface 'global average temperature' calculated from these values.\nJonathan's analysis shows deriving 'average temperature' from Tmin+Tmax/2 over-estimates the landsurface average temperature by ~45%. He further shows that most of the remaining warming in the 'average temperature' since 1950 is due to increased solar insolation.\nIncreased solar insolation from decreased aerosol and aerosol seeded clouds also explains why warming measured by Tmin+Tmax/2 has levelled off in recent years, because in the developed world, parts of the developing world and the ex-Soviet Bloc there is limited remaining black carbon (and other forms of) aerosol pollution left to clean up.\nWhile Jonathan's used Australia-only data, there appears to be no comparable study in any other part of the world and we should assume similar effects exist in the rest of the world.\nIn conclusion, it is troubling that climate science, including the recent BEST analysis, persists with the minimum and maximum temperature derivation of global land surface average temperature, when the methodology is flawed and the results misleading.\nNote that Jonathan also analyses seasonal and tropical versus temperate zone differences. Space considerations made me omit them as they would require considerable discussion, but overall they are supportive of the conclusions above.\nPhilip Bradley is a humble BSc, now retired, with a longstanding interest in scientific puzzles and controversies.\n"}, {"score": 889.5899, "uuid": "ff59f44e-8d57-583e-9a28-2d5ead1978c0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0812wb-07-06948", "target_hostname": "wingod.newsvine.com", "target_uri": "http://wingod.newsvine.com/_news/2008/04/03/1409614-global-temperatures-to-decrease", "page_rank": 1.1709484e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Newsvine - Global <em>temperatures</em> &#x27;to decrease&#x27;", "snippet": "Which to me <em>is</em> laughable as <em>the</em> resources of just our inner solar system are a billion trillion times greater than <em>what</em> we have <em>on</em> <em>the</em> <em>Earth</em>.

I responded by linking to a summary of RealClimate's AGW argument, and asked space guy to point out where specifically their explanation goes wrong. The RealClimate post can be condensed into 3 steps:\n1) small increases in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere lead directly to smaller increase in the atmosphere's ability to absorb heat\n2) the small increase is amplified by the action of water vapor\n3) the increased absorption leads to increased surface temperatures for the planet\nspace guy takes issue with the first point, essentially arguing that the atmosphere is functionally saturated from top to bottom with CO2, and that adding more will not change the absorption capacity. If that's true, then Step 2 is irrelevant. (Feel free to correct me if I'm misstating the argument.)\nFirst, according to the USAF data, more than just the single band is saturated. This graph, is representative of only one measurement of CO2 vs H2O as H2O concentration varies widely, depending on humidity. In other graphs, H2O completely overlaps CO2 in that band.\nThis is true, but it's well known that as one goes higher in the atmosphere, humidity decreases . CO2 becomes more and more responsible for the absorption capacity as the CO2/water vapor ratio increases. So it is at these high altitudes that CO2 concentration is most critical.\nBy definition pressure broadening is collision broadening which is temperature dependent, meaning that that the definition on realclimate ignores the temperature component and the pressure broadening is based upon an unrealistic increase in CO2 concentration in order to get the pretty graph that they wanted...\nYou're misreading the intent of the example you cite; the point of the article is that the atmosphere is not saturated, and even if you quadruple the concentration of CO2, it still won't be.

However, it is not clear from the article what terms are included in their pressure broadening estimate. They say it's roughly a factor of 2---what do you maintain is a more correct estimate? I assume that you've already done this calculation, because there is no other way you could conclude the article was wrong---as I've noted, the pressure broadening is only presented as an estimate, they do not explicitly calculate it.\n[T]he IPCC models do not agree with the actual data on the temperature at the altitudes where CO2 desaturates.\nIs there a reference I should see to support this assertion?\nI echo your thoughts about learning something here---I've learned a tremendous amount during this discussion. I am more than willing to change my mind, but I will not do it because someone doesn't like Al Gore, or because there is some sort of AGW conspiracy. I will change my mind when someone can show me specifically where the AGW hypothesis is wrong.\n3 votes\nspace guy\nThis is true, but it's well known that as one goes higher in the atmosphere, humidity decreases. CO2 becomes more and more responsible for the absorption capacity as the CO2/water vapor ratio increases. So it is at these high altitudes that CO2 concentration is most critical.\nYou missed the part where absorption of ANY gas decreases with pressure, so the individual absorption lines for CO2 become narrower as altitude increases as a function of both pressure and temperature. That does not change the saturation level (theoretically the increase in CO2 moves the desaturation altitude higher)\nYou're misreading the intent of the example you cite; the point of the article is that the atmosphere is not saturated, and even if you quadruple the concentration of CO2, it still won't be. It does not imply that a 4X increase in CO2 is either predicted or necessary for their AGW hypothesis to be true.\nActually go to any textbook on infrared spectroscopy of the atmosphere and you will see that multiple wavebands are saturated, that is not what Realclimate even argues anymore. What they are arguing is that as concentration increases the \"wings\" of the absorption bands broaden, meaning that more wavelengths are absorbed, leading to increased reflections and absorptions of energy by other atmospheric elements due to collisions. However, it is this explanation that is at best very incomplete in that it does not take into account the temperature dependency and pressure dependency (in relation to the entire atmosphere, not just other CO2 molecules) of the broadening process.\nActually if this is the case that they don't need a 4x concentration increase to have an observable increase in the \"wings\", then why do they show it? If you look at your graph, in the part where this discussion about the 4x increase you will see that CO2 is saturated (transmissivity of 0 or absorption of 1). The core of their argument is that with increasing CO2 concentration that the number of wavelengths that are saturated increases. This is correct but a much smaller effect than what they are indicating, and as stated before, since this is a pressure and temperature dependent phenomenon the effect decreases rapidly with altitude such as it is.\nThis is true, but it's well known that as one goes higher in the atmosphere, humidity decreases. CO2 becomes more and more responsible for the absorption capacity as the CO2/water vapor ratio increases. So it is at these high altitudes that CO2 concentration is most critical.\nWhile this is true it is also meaningless.\n1. Infrared absorption across the IR Bands (1-20 microns)\nYou are correct that humidity and H2O absorption decreases with altitude. At the ground only about 35% of all IR radiation in these bands is directly radiated to space. As the altitude increases to where humidity is no longer a factor (35,000 ft is where the USAF did most of their early studies as they used a B-29 and spectral radiometers to gather the data [now you know what that B-29 was doing when it crashed into lake Mead doing \"upper atmospheric research). Even at that altitude there was still significant H2O absorption and saturated CO2 lines. (This research was done in order to design the early heat seeking air to air missiles and is still the foundation for all air to air weapon design as they needed to know what wavelengths were not absorbed by the atmosphere or clouds).\nHowever, while at the ground only 35% is radiated to space, at 35,000 feet that rises to over 80% (going from memory here) and at 45,000 feet this increases to about 95% as the CO2 lines become desaturated. The rest is from O3 which does not desaturate until well over 75,000 feet.\nWhat this is is a counter argument in that many of the H2O lines overlap the CO2 lines at lower altitudes and as the H2O content decreases in the lines that are not coincident (the 1.2 micron line is a biggy as is the 14-20 micron line) the radiation goes straight to space. So the realcimate argument about humidity decreasing actually means the exact opposite to what they claim.\nAlso, again as the pressure and temperature decreases with altitude, the CO2 lines get narrower and even more radiation escapes to space.\nFor the temperature argument from satellites you are going to have to google Dr. John Christy, Dr. Roy Spencer and the UAH center for global hydrology as I don't have time to spend more time on this right now.\n4 votes\nspace guy\nRegarding temperature, it seems rather unlikely that dozens, even hundreds, of climatologists all over the world would have simply overlooked a term in an equation fundamental to their field. However, it is not clear from the article what terms are included in their pressure broadening estimate. They say it's roughly a factor of 2---what do you maintain is a more correct estimate? I assume that you've already done this calculation, because there is no other way you could conclude the article was wrong---as I've noted, the pressure broadening is only presented as an estimate, they do not explicitly calculate it.\nI ran the calculation through Mathematica a couple of years ago but it is not easy to do. To get a good answer you have to individually calculate CO2 against each constituent of the atmosphere (oxygen, nitrogen, Argon, Neon, Krypton, and Xenon at a minimum as well as against H2O) and then add all of the above and then graph the result. I don't get paid to do this so I just did a quick and dirty calculation based on the gaussian function and then the lorentz transformation at 300k for the existing concentration vs 280 ppm. The increase was only a few percent but should be conservative.\nIt is a very hard calculation to do in detail and would take months to set up correctly. Heck just doing the modeling for this would be a good PhD, which I have from time to time toyed with doing but am not thrilled at the prospect of being a student again. You would have to do it at several different altitudes and then compare the results with the original USAF data from the 1940's-60's (which is the control on the experiment). Then you would have to add today's CO2 concentrations, then rerun everything. Not going to do that in my spare time.\nIt is enough right now to understand that there is a temperature and pressure dependency. Steve McIntyre over at Climate Audit has challenged the community for years to do the calculations and publish the results but no one has ever done it!! Most people start from Arrhenious (who knew nothing about the quantum mechanical properties of gasses) and then proceed to several simplifications that are in most texbooks and then go from there.\nThe closest that I have seen is Figure 5.5 in Loudon (page 89) where the broadening of a line in Megahertz is calculated. Interestingly the pressure is is high in the calculation, far higher than normal CO2 concentrations and they extrapolate the graph to zero torr which is a dangerous thing to do. The reference is from a paper from Bridges, Haus, and Hoff, Applied Physics Letters 13, page 316, 1968. Would be interesting to dig up that paper.\nNo one that I have ever heard of has done the calculation, although the real climate graph seems to imply that it was done but I can't get any questions answered over there as they don't like being challenged and delete posts that do in a random fashion.\n4 votes\n"}, {"score": 888.9011, "uuid": "10589717-9a97-5e4a-bd34-3517c3abb789", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1312wb-17-04671", "target_hostname": "www.irishcentral.com", "target_uri": "http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Its-official-coldest-winter-in-130-years-in-Ireland--112421244.html", "page_rank": 1.1835508e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "It\u2019s official, <em>coldest</em> winter in 130 years in Ireland - SEE PHOTOS | Irish", "snippet": "According to Met Eireann, Ireland\u2019s meteorological service, December has officially been <em>the</em> <em>coldest</em> month <em>ever</em> <em>on</em> record.

Closely working together since 1954 to solve problems of critical importance, their ranks include high government officials, the royalty, media representatives, bankers and CEOs of corporate giants. Rather than 'leading citizens', they are better described as prominent members of the global elite. In congruence with this fact, their meetings are kept strictly private.\nThe manner in which this clique of the ruling class makes decisions affecting the rest of us is largely a mystery and as such has been target of speculation among alternative thinkers and writers. While it is unclear how high on the planet's hierarchy the group is, it is safe to say that their influence is considerable and they have access to raw data not necessarily shared with the population. For these reasons, it is significant that their last meeting was announced as follows:\n\"The 58th Bilderberg Meeting will be held in Sitges, Spain 3 - 6 June 2010. The Conference will deal mainly with Financial Reform, Security, Cyber Technology, Energy, Pakistan, Afghanistan, World Food Problem, Global Cooling, Social Networking, Medical Science, EU-US relations. Approximately 130 participants will attend of whom about two-thirds come from Europe and the balance from North America. About one-third is from government and politics, and two-thirds are from finance, industry, labor, education, and communications. The meeting is private in order to encourage frank and open discussion.\"\nSpecifically, the reference to Global Cooling - unlikely to be a simple mistake - appears to be an astonishing admission that the decades-long official discourse on climate is propaganda. (Indeed, at the time of writing, Polish and Russian forecasters are predicting the coldest European winter in 1,000 years.) Furthermore, it speaks of the contempt with which our leaders regard the masses, and reminds us of the level of corruption that has prevailed in the production of what now appears to have been a 'Global Warming' scam.\nThe first public revelation that climate data has been cooked took place last year, not long before the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen from the 7th to the 15th of December. Thousands of files and email exchanges were stolen from a server of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (Hadley CRU) - a stronghold of scientists who support the anthropogenic (man-made) global warming theory - and published on the Internet, sparking the scandal now referred to as 'Climategate'. Hadley CRU's record is one of the four official sources of global temperature data used by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The authors of the emails compose a small group of key scientists who have been most influential in driving the global warming agenda for years.\nThe emails suggested manipulation of data to support their thesis. There were also private admissions that the globe is not warming as expected; as well as indications of peer pressure to exclude global warming skeptics from the debate. A great deal of animosity against their opponents was also evident - all of which suggested a significantly less than scientific approach to the issue.\nPerhaps the most damning email was the one written by the now former CRU director Phil Jones, which read:\n\"I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline. Mike's series got the annual land and marine values while the other two got April-Sept for NH land N of 20N. The latter two are real for 1999, while the estimate for 1999 for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90. The Global estimate for 1999 with data through Oct is +0.35C cf. 0.57 for 1998.\"\nPhil Jones claimed that the word 'trick' was used \"colloquially\", as in \"a clever thing to do\" and that it \"is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward.\" Bob Ward, director of policy and communications at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, defended Jones by arguing that \"scientists say 'trick' not just to mean deception. They mean it as a clever way of doing something - a short cut can be a trick.\" While this may be technically correct, it does not explain why a scientist would make use of a 'clever short cut' to hide the decline of temperatures.\nAnother interesting email read:\n\"...Phil [Jones] and I have recently submitted a paper using about a dozen NH [Northern Hemisphere] records that fit this category, and many of which are available nearly 2K back - I think that trying to adopt a timeframe of 2K, rather than the usual 1K, addresses a good earlier point that Peck made w/ regard to the memo, that it would be nice to try to \"contain\" the putative \"MWP\" [Medieval Warming Period], even if we don't yet have a hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back...\"\nA rare event - the UK blanketed in snow, Dec 2010 (left) and Jan 2010 (right)\nWhat is being discussed here is extending the record back another 1,000 years in order to 'contain' the Medieval Warming Period. By emphasising that the MWP was limited to a certain period of time and that it was preceded by a cool period, it could be portrayed as a minor anomaly in the overall trend, allowing them to buttress their case that recent warming is unique and man-made. However, they had to face the problem that the Northern Hemisphere records from beyond 1,000 years ago up to 2,000 years ago was sparse and therefore not as robust as the last 1,000 years. They were not trying to 'hide' the MWP as such, but to downplay its significance by relying on the 'dozen' records which represented global temperatures that just happened to be cooler than the MWP in the preceding 1,000 years - the only data available to these scientists. In short, they were cherrypicking data and fixing it around their pre-established 'fact' that the planet has experienced an overall increase in temperatures and that this increase can be linked to human activity.\nThe following, by Kevin Trenberth (from the US National Center for Atmospheric Research) was particularly revealing of the way in which the flow of information gets corrupted:\n\"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.\"\nAlthough at first glance this appears to be evidence of another 'trick', Trenberth - who has in the past written articles wondering why the planet is not warming as the models predicted - might have simply been expressing an honest concern. He is writing that the data coming from the satellite CERES (the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System), points to more warming, but that this is not being measured by thermometers on the ground. CERES is part of the EOS program (Earth Observation System) and it is used to \"study the energy exchanged between the Sun; the Earth's atmosphere, surface and clouds; and outer space.\" Trenberth claims that the data measured by the satellite shows a global energy budget that should be warming the planet when in fact it is not. He then adds \"the data are surely wrong\" because they do not correlate with the fact that the Earth is cooling, therefore the observing system - of the satellites - is \"inadequate\".\nWhat makes his observation interesting is that it shows how a small group of scientists responsible for key data - such as satellite data - have the power to influence the scientific community at large that and there is little or no oversight to guarantee that their data is correct. Given the inconsistencies in the Global Warming discourse, we are tempted to ask if such key pieces of information are not subject to intentional manipulation from parties with agendas other than strictly scientific. The scientific establishment is similar in structure to any corporate or military establishment: it's bureaucratic, hierarchical and each field of study is compartmentalized, rendering honest and open communication between scientists across fields difficult.\nThere were a few other emails of interest as they showed how the extreme lack of professionalism that appears to dominate in scientific circles and the little respect these scientists have for their colleagues. One climatologist expressed his desire to \"beat the crap out of\" skeptics, another gloated over the death of one of the first climate change skeptics, commenting: \" In an odd way this is cheering news.\" In another example we find a scientist emailing the journal Climate Research to tell them \"I'm having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor\" who had published articles that were skeptical of Global Warming.\nThe leaked emails were followed by further inconvenient truths at the beginning of 2010, when the scientists behind the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which alarmingly claimed that the Himalayan glaciers could vanish by 2035, admitted that the claim was taken from a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) document, which in turn was based on an article in the New Scientist magazine published eight years before the IPCC's 2007 report. The 1999 New Scientist article was itself based on a short telephone interview with Syed Hasnain, a little-known Indian scientist then stationed at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. Hasnain has since admitted that his claim about the Himalayan glaciers was \"speculation\"; not supported by any formal research. Furthermore, he had only been referring to a portion of the glaciers. Here we see the process by which suspect science can make its way up through various channels to the point of being cited as 'hard evidence'.\nFalse data on Himalayan glaciers has been used to back up the 'Global Warming' scam\nThe 2007 IPCC Himalyan glacier report is one of the documents that CRU 'Climategate' scientists in England and the United States had discussed when they proposed destroying their communications as a way to preempt freedom of information requests to turn over files that would have exposed how they manipulated the facts around the theory. Despite this, today Dr. Hasnain leads the glacier research team at an Indian environmental think-tank run by Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the IPCC.\nWhy do these scientists seem to care so little about scientific truth? F. William Engdahl has observed that the glacier scare was a major selling point for the IPCC agenda, given that meltdown of the Himalayas implies massive flooding in India, China, and the entire region surrounding the Tibetan Plateau. The company at which Dr. Pachauri is director-general and Dr. Hasnain is a senior member of staff, the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), has won a substantial share of a $500,000 grant from a US charity, the Carnegie Corporation, along with a share in a \u20ac3 million study funded by the European Union. These were awarded largely thanks to Dr. Hasnain's glacial speculation.\nThe 2007 IPCC report contains serious math and factual errors. It claimed that the Himalayan glaciers shrank from 500,000 to 100,000 square kilometers, when they in fact only cover 33,000 square kilometers in total. It specifically states that the Pindari Glacier shrank by 2,840 meters in 120 years at a rate of 135.2 meters per year, when the real rate is only 23.5 meters per year.\nFurthermore, Dr. Murari Lal, the coordinating lead author of the report's chapter on Asia, has admitted that the glacier claim was only included in the report to heap political pressure on world leaders. In his words:\n\"It related to several countries in this region and their water sources. We thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy-makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action. It had importance for the region, so we thought we should put it in.\"\nThe IPCC report goes on to incorrecty state that 55% of the Netherlands lies below sea level, when the correct figure is only 26%. In another inaccuracy, the report cited the WWF as claiming that climate change could endanger \"up to 40 per cent\" of the Amazon rainforest. The author's of the cited WWF report claimed their findings were based on an article in Nature. However, the focus of the paper was not global warming but the effects of logging.\nComputer programmer E. Michael Smith and meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo have investigated the manipulations of data at the NASA Goddard Science and Space Institute at Columbia University in New York and the NOAA National Climate Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina. What they found is that data pertaining to the rural and high altitude temperatures taken from the ground-based stations around the world had been ignored and only the data from stations located in urban and coastal areas were used; in this way, scientists edited out 75% of the data from stations used before the 1990s. Since cities and coastal areas are naturally warmer, the resulting numbers give the incorrect impression that the globe has been warming in the last decades as compared to previous decades. Notice that the East Anglia Institute which was at the center of 'Climategate' is fed data from those two US agencies, NASA and NOAA.\nMore recently, the global warming campaign has suffered yet another embarrassment after an anonymous member of the public spotted satellite data that showed a handful of temperature records for the US Great Lakes had been hiked up by hundreds of degrees to substantially inflate the average temperature range for the northeastern US. As a result, the average temperatures for the whole country are shown to be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above what they really are. It was on the basis of these readings that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported a succession of \"record warm summers\" in recent years. The story of the incorrect data has now been confirmed by NOAA's Program Coordinator, Chuck Pistis, and the original heat map removed from their website.\nAl Gore is chief among the Global Warming scam artists\nSince it is unlikely that all of the above are a simple series of honest mistakes, we must ask if there is an agenda other than a strictly scientific one driving the discourse of Global Warming as a whole. In searching for possible motives the $2.7 billion carbon emissions market overseen by the UN appears as a plausible candidate. This scheme effectively permits polluters to continue with their less than optimal practices as long as they pay money for it. The hype over reducing the 'carbon foot print' of industry is also set to make certain individuals very rich. Al Gore for example is a founder of Generation Investment Management a UK based company that has substantial interests in 'green technology'. Gore is also heavily financially invested in Silver Spring Networks, a US company that has contracts with utilities that in October 2009 received a combined subsidy of $560m from the US energy department.\n'Global warming' is also a najor money-making opportunity for the financial establishment. JP Morgan Chase, Bank America Merrill Lynch, Barclay's, Citi Bank, Nomura, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are actively involved in carbon trading. According to a Guardian report of late 2009 \"the carbon market could become double the size of the vast oil market if the new breed of City players who trade greenhouse gas emissions through the EU's emissions trading scheme have their way\". The speed of the growth of the market depended on the success of the Copenhagen summit. The fact that 'Climategate' eclipsed it demonstrates the monumental importance of a well informed public.\nThe agenda of the 'Global Warming' scam artists notwithstanding, the facts are indisputable: our planet is cooling, and cooling at a far greater rate than expected. Within the past few years, China has had its coldest winter in a century, Baghdad and Dubai saw their first snow in recorded history, South Africans woke up to their first white mantle, North America has seen the most snow-cover in 50 years, with places like Wisconsin experiencing the highest levels since record-keeping began and Texas receiving an unprecedented 2 inches. Added to this, record levels of Antarctic sea ice have been recorded, with extreme cold in Minnesota, Florida, Mexico, Australia, Iran, Greece, Spain, Argentina, Chile, Peru...the list goes on and on.\nLast year, William Patterson of the University of Saskatchewan in Canada analyzed mud deposits form Lough Monreagh in Country Clare, Ireland and discovered something remarkable. Until now, scientists had believed that the last mini-ice age (about 12,800 years ago) took about 10 years to settle over Europe. Patterson's findings however have shown that it took as little as three months: It would have been sudden for those alive at the time. It's the equivalent of taking Ireland and moving it to the Arctic over the space of a few months, or a year at most\", he said.\nAs never before in our modern history, we are being lied to on a persistent and massive scale about everything of any importance to humanity and our future. My advice is to take with a very large grain of salt somewhere in the region of 100% of that which issues from the mouths and keyboards of big-government-sanctioned scientists, media pundits and former Presidential candidates, to name but a few.

In a statement, the ministry ordered regional departments to be on high alert and to contact local administration officials to prepare for the extreme chill expected to last until today. Average temperatures in large Siberia n cities in January usually range between minus 15 degrees Celsius and minus 39 degrees Celsius. Two people have already died in the region of Irkutsk in central Siberia and more than 30 others have been hospitalised in Irkutsk with frost-bite. The freezing temperatures have also caused overloading of electricity grids because of heaters being switched on. That caused cut-offs to thousands of homes in the regions of Irkutsk and Tomsk. Schools have been closed down in at least four regions because of the cold.\nCHINA - Heavy snow continued to fall over large parts of China on the weekend, causing traffic chaos and damaging crops. In Hubei, more than 1,000 km of highway, about half of the central province's roads, were closed since Saturday. More then 8,800 of the scheduled 9,500 long-distance coaches originating from Wuhan, Hubei's capital, were cancelled, forcing about 300,000 passengers to change travel plans. The heavy snow started on Friday and was recognized as THE MOST SERIOUS SNOWFALL SINCE 1991. The low temperature burst water pipelines and froze hydrometers, causing a drinking water shortage for 100,000 people. The snow also cut off all highways in the northern province of Shanxi. Yuexi County in the capital Hefei saw its BIGGEST EVER SNOWFALL with the maximum depth exceeding 50 cm. Traffic was blocked, while power supply and telephone lines were cut off temporarily in some towns and villages.

Fortunately, the residents of the countries affected by this week's heat wave are more adapted to extreme high temperatures, and we are not seeing the kind of death tolls experienced during the 2003 European heat wave (30,000 killed.)

Yesterday at 1:56 pm Eastern, NASA employee Gavin Schmidt and climate modeler, purely in his \u201cprivate\u201d capacity, posted an article arguing that the results were consistent with climate models \u2013 an activity that lesser minds might think relates to his employment.\nLucia commented here , perhaps redundantly, that Schmidt\u2019s comment was \u201ctendentious twaddle\u201d.\nAs a result of Ross McKitrick\u2019s \u201cT3\u2033 concept (discussed at CA here ), I\u2019ve been following tropical [tropospheric] temperatures from time to time, as these are supposed to be \u201cfingerprints\u201d of AGW and decided that it would be timely to update tropical (20S-20N) estimates, using reported satellite data and collating tropical averages from gridded CRU, GISS and NOAA versions as these are not reported separately. I calculated results over the satellite period (1979-2008) for consistency (as I\u2019ve been doing in the past.) In each case, I zero-ed the data over the 1979-1997 period \u2013 the choice doesn\u2019t matter much \u2013 but I didn\u2019t want to include the most recent period in the normalization period and I wanted a relatively long period. I also divided the satellite temperatures by 1.2 according to a factor sent to me by John Christy. This yielded the following:\nFigure 1: Annual Tropical Temperatures. (Centered on 1979-1997)\nWe now have a 30-year period of satellite records. Within that period, 2008 ranked 26th out of 30 (5th coldest), 23rd for RSS, 16th for CRU and 15th for NOAA and GISS. Tropical temperatures in 2008 were lower in 4 of 5 indices than in 1988, the year of Hansen\u2019s famous testimony.\nAlthough climate scientists downplayed individual cold months early in the year, Schmidt seized on recent Oct and Nov data from GISS:\nIn GISTEMP both October and November came in quite warm (0.58\u00baC), the former edging up slightly on last month\u2019s estimate as more data came in.\nFigure 2: Monthly Tropical Temperatures. (Centered on 1979-1997)\nIn the tropics, temperatures in October and November have rebounded from lows early in the year, but GISS is running a bit warmer than the others (about 0.2 deg C relative to the 1979-1997 average).\nWhen I squint at the tropical data, it has two quite different aspects depending on your perspective. On the one hand, you can look at it and conclude that the average level of the cycles is moving up, with the 2008 low being higher than prior lows, with the overall package moving up in an disorderly way. On the other hand, you can look at the data and surmise that it has consistent with 1/f noise or 1/f noise with a very minor trend. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is the sort of result that Gavin Schmidt \u201cwants\u201d.\nFor people that look at data, it is obvious that the data (in each incarnation) is highly autocorrelated; the degrees of freedom in autocorrelated data can be much lower than people think and, accordingly, the confidence intervals can be surprisingly wide (a point made in Santer et al 2008, though there are some defects in their analysis that we discussed before).\nWide confidence intervals are a two-edged sword. For people who attempt to argue that this data shows no trend, the wide confidence intervals permit a trend much higher than observations (and perhaps high enough to be consistent with the less aggressive models). For modelers who argue (a la Santer) that the confidence intervals are wide (and wide enough so that observations are not \u201cinconsistent\u201d in some sense with models), the problem is that such wide confidence intervals will probably include the null hypothesis of no trend or a minimal trend. It\u2019s interesting to watch, but I don\u2019t think that you can conclude very much either way purely on the statistics of the data, as people so often try to do.\nSchmidt observed:\nThe bottom line: In the GISTEMP, HadCRU and NCDC analyses D-N 2008 were at 0.43, 0.42 and 0.47\u00baC above the 1951-1980 baseline (respectively). In GISTEMP both October and November came in quite warm (0.58\u00baC), the former edging up slightly on last month\u2019s estimate as more data came in. This puts 2008 at #9 (or #8) in the yearly rankings, but given the uncertainty in the estimates, the real ranking could be anywhere between #6 or #15\nLike this:\nLike\nBe the first to like this post.\n"}, {"score": 839.3354, "uuid": "45db1d95-5ed6-54e8-af72-cbae814dbbc3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-42-22834", "target_hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "target_uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth", "page_rank": 2.5138434e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Snowball <em>Earth</em> - Wikipedia, <em>the</em> free encyclopedia", "snippet": "<em>the</em> difficulty in determining whether <em>the</em> magnetic signal <em>recorded</em> <em>is</em> original, or whether it has been reset by later activity.", "explanation": null, "document": "[ edit ] History\nDouglas Mawson (1882\u20131958), an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer, spent much of his career studying the Neoproterozoic stratigraphy of South Australia where he identified thick and extensive glacial sediments and late in his career speculated about the possibility of global glaciation.

Brian Harland published a paper in which he presented palaeomagnetic data showing that glacial tillites in Svalbard and Greenland were deposited at tropical latitudes. [5] From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued for an ice age that was so extreme that it resulted in the deposition of marine glacial rocks in the tropics.\nIn the 1960s, Mikhail Budyko , a Russian climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global climate . Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ( albedo ) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium. [6] While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had never happened, because his model offered no way to escape from such a scenario.\nThe term \"Snowball Earth\" was coined by Joseph Kirschvink , a professor of geobiology at the California Institute of Technology , in a short paper published in 1992 within a lengthy volume concerning the biology of the Proterozoic eon. [7] The major contributions from this work were: (1) the recognition that the presence of banded iron formations is consistent with such a glacial episode and (2) the introduction of a mechanism with which to escape from an ice-covered Earth\u2014the accumulation of CO2 from volcanic outgassing leading to an ultra-greenhouse effect.\nFranklyn Van Houten 's discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the \"Van Houten cycle.\" His studies of phosphorus deposits and banded iron formations in sediments made him an early adherent of the \"Snowball Earth\" hypothesis postulating that the planet's surface froze more than 650 million years ago. [8]\nInterest in the Snowball Earth increased dramatically after Paul F. Hoffman , professor of geology at Harvard University , and coauthors applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sediments in Namibia , elaborated upon the hypothesis by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of cap carbonates , and published their results in the journal Science in 1998. [9]\nCurrently, aspects of the hypothesis remain controversial and it is being debated under the auspices of the International Geoscience Programme (IGCP) Project 512: Neoproterozoic Ice Ages. [10]\nIn March 2010, the journal Science published an article \"Calibrating the Cryogenian \" which concluded that \"Ice was therefore grounded below sea level at very low paleolatitudes, which implies that the Sturtian glaciation was global in extent\". [11] A popular account of this conclusion was published in Science Daily . [12]\n[ edit ] Evidence\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis was originally devised to explain the apparent presence of glaciers at tropical latitudes. [13] Modeling suggested that once glaciers spread to within 30\u00b0 of the equator, an ice-albedo feedback would result in the ice rapidly advancing to the equator [14] (further modelling shows that ice can in fact get as close as 25\u00b0 or closer to the equator without initiating total glaciation [15] ). Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits seemingly within the tropics appeared to point to global ice cover.\nCritical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:\nthat a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;\nthat the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.\nDuring a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.\nThis last point is very difficult to prove. Before the Ediacaran , the biostratigraphic markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so. [16]\nThe first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis. Many glacial features can also be created by non-glacial means, and estimating the latitude of landmasses even as little as 200 million years ago can be riddled with difficulties. [17]\n[ edit ] Palaeomagnetism\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis was first posited in order to explain what were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move in time, ascertaining their position at a given point in history is not easy. In addition to considerations of how the recognisable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.\nWhen sedimentary rocks form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field. Through the precise measurement of this palaeomagnetism , it is possible to estimate the latitude (but not the longitude ) where the rock matrix was deposited. Paleomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the Neoproterozoic rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator, [18] although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question. [16] This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as dropstones ) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended to sea-level in the tropical latitudes. It is not clear whether this can be taken to imply a global glaciation, or the existence of localised, possibly land-locked, glacial regimes. [19] Others have even suggested that most data do not constrain any glacial deposits to within 25\u00b0 of the equator. [20]\nSkeptics suggest that the palaeomagnetic data could be corrupted if the Earth's magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of the Earth's core, it is possible that during the Proterozoic, its magnetic field did not approximate a dipolar distribution, with a North and South pole roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Paleomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted as particles could align pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, the Earth's dipolar field could have oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation. [21]\nAnother weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building orogeny releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations. [15] Moreover, further evidence is accumulating that large-scale remagnetization events have taken place, that may require revision of the position of the paleomagnetic poles. [22] [23]\nThere is currently only one deposit, the Elatina deposit of Australia, that was indubitably deposited at low latitudes; its depositional date is well constrained, and the signal is demonstrably original. [24] .\n[ edit ] Low latitude glacial deposits\nDiamictite of the Neoproterozoic Pocatello Formation, a 'Snowball Earth'\u2014type deposit\nSedimentary rocks that are deposited by glaciers have distinctive features that enable their identification. Long before the advent of the Snowball Earth hypothesis many Neoproterozoic sediments had been interpreted as having a glacial origin, including some apparently at tropical latitudes at the time of their deposition. However, it is worth remembering that many sedimentary features traditionally associated with glaciers can also be formed by other means. [25] Thus the glacial origin of many of the key occurrences for Snowball Earth has been contested. [16] As of 2007, there was only one \"very reliable\" \u2013 still challenged [16] \u2013 datum point identifying tropical tillites , [18] which makes statements of equatorial ice cover somewhat presumptuous. However evidence of sea-level glaciation in the tropics during the Sturtian is accumulating. [26] Evidence of possible glacial origin of sediment includes:\nDropstones (stones dropped into marine sediments), which can be deposited by glaciers or other phenomena. [27]\nVarves (annual sediment layers in periglacial lakes), which can form at higher temperatures. [28]\nGlacial striations (formed by embedded rocks scraped against bedrock): similar striations are from time to time formed by mudflows or tectonic movements. [29]\nDiamictites (poorly sorted conglomerates). Originally described as glacial till , most were in fact formed by debris flows . [16]\n[ edit ] Open-water deposits\nIt appears that some deposits formed during the Snowball period could only have been formed in the presence of an active hydrological cycle. Bands of glacial deposits up to hundreds of meters thick, separated by small (meters) bands of non-glacial sediments, demonstrate that glaciers were melting and re-forming repeatedly; solid oceans would not permit this scale of deposition. [30] It is considered possible that ice streams such as seen in Antarctica today could be responsible for these sequences. Further, sedimentary features that could only form in open water, for example wave-formed ripples , far-traveled ice-rafted debris and indicators of photosynthetic activity, can be found throughout sediments dating from the Snowball Earth periods. While these may represent 'oases' of meltwater on a completely frozen Earth, [31] computer modelling suggests that large areas of the ocean must have remained ice free arguing that a \"hard\" snowball is not plausible in terms of energy balance and general circulation models. [32]\n[ edit ] Carbon isotope ratios\nThere are two stable isotopes of carbon in sea water : carbon-12 (12C) and the rare carbon-13 (13C), which makes up about 1.109 percent of carbon atoms.\nBiochemical processes, of which photosynthesis is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter 12C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both protists and algae , tend to be very slightly depleted in 13C, relative to the abundance found in the primary volcanic sources of the Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a higher 12C/13C ratio within organic remains, and a lower ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will forever remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in 13C.\nDuring the proposed episode of Snowball Earth, there are rapid and extreme negative excursions in the ratio of 13C to 12C. [33] This is consistent with a deep freeze that killed off most or nearly all photosynthetic life \u2013 although other mechanisms, such as clathrate release , can also cause such perturbations. Close analysis of the timing of 13C 'spikes' in deposits across the globe allows the recognition of four, possibly five, glacial events in the late Neoproterozoic. [34]\n[ edit ] Banded iron formations\n2.1 billion year old rock with black-band ironstone\nBanded iron formations (BIF) are sedimentary rocks of layered iron oxide and iron-poor chert . In the presence of oxygen, iron naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.\nThe bands were produced at the tipping point between an anoxic and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is oxygen rich (nearly 21 percent by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Paleoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with Cryogenian glacial deposits.\nFor such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide ) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea ice, [7] while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.\nBeing isolated from the oceans, such lakes may have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's Black Sea ; a sufficient input of iron could provide the necessary conditions for BIF formation. [16] A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs marked the end of the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments. [19] BIFs are also strikingly absent during the Marinoan glaciation.[ citation needed ]\n[ edit ] Cap carbonate rocks\nA present day glacier\nVolcanoes may have had a role in replenishing CO 2, possibly ending the global ice age that was the Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period.\nAround the top of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits there is commonly a sharp transition into a chemically precipitated sedimentary limestone or dolostone metres to tens of metres thick. [35] These cap carbonates sometimes occur in sedimentary successions that have no other carbonate rocks, suggesting that their deposition is result of a profound aberration in ocean chemistry. [36]\nThese cap carbonates have unusual chemical composition, as well as strange sedimentary structures that are often interpreted as large ripples. [37] The formation of such sedimentary rocks could be caused by a large influx of positively charged ions , as would be produced by rapid weathering during the extreme greenhouse following a Snowball Earth event. The \u03b413C isotopic signature of the cap carbonates is near \u22125\u00a0\u2030, consistent with the value of the mantle \u2014 such a low value is usually/could be taken to signify an absence of life, since photosynthesis usually acts to raise the value; alternatively the release of methane deposits could have lowered it from a higher value, and counterbalance the effects of photosynthesis.\nThe precise mechanism involved in the formation of cap carbonates is not clear, but the most cited explanation suggests that at the melting of a Snowball Earth, water would dissolve the abundant CO2 from the atmosphere to form carbonic acid , which would fall as acid rain . This would weather exposed silicate and carbonate rock (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of calcium , which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an abiotic \" cap carbonate \" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the Snowball Earth hypothesis.\nHowever, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within \u2014 starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin. [16] An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the Doushantuo cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane. This accounts for incredibly low \u2014 as low as \u221248\u00a0\u2030 \u2014 \u03b413C values \u2014 as well as unusual sedimentary features which appear to have been formed by the flow of gas through the sediments. [38]\n[ edit ] Changing acidity\nIsotopes of the element boron suggest that the pH of the oceans dropped dramatically before and after the Marinoan glaciation. [39] This may indicate a build up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form carbonic acid . Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme climate change, they need not imply a global glaciation.\n[ edit ] Space dust\nThe Earth's surface is very depleted in the element iridium , which primarily resides in the Earth's core . The only significant source of the element at the surface is cosmic particles that reach Earth. During a Snowball Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An iridium anomaly has been discovered at the base of the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years, [40] but this does not necessarily imply a global extent to the glaciation; indeed, a similar anomaly could be explained by the impact of a large meteorite . [41]\n[ edit ] Cyclic climate fluctuations\nUsing the ratio of mobile cations to those that remain in soils during chemical weathering (the chemical index of alteration), it has been shown that chemical weathering varied in a cyclic fashion within a glacial succession, increasing during interglacial periods and decreasing during cold and arid glacial periods. [42] This pattern, if a true reflection of events, suggests that the \"Snowball Earths\" bore a stronger resemblance to Pleistocene ice age cycles than to a completely frozen Earth.\nWhat's more, glacial sediments of the Portaskaig formation in Scotland clearly show interbedded cycles of glacial and shallow marine sediments. [43] The significance of these deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8\u00a0km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600\u00a0Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a Snowball Earth.\nThis unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability .\nOne computer simulation of conditions during a Snowball Earth period. [44]\nThe initiation of a Snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which would result in an increase in the Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase the Earth's albedo , which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, runaway cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a Snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano , a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide , changes in solar energy output , or perturbations of the Earth's orbit . Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of the Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more solar energy back to space, further cooling the Earth and further increasing the area of the Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator as cold as modern-day Antarctica .\nGlobal warming associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a Snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of the Earth's surface would require as few as 1,000\u00a0years.\n[ edit ] Modeling disputes\nWhile the presence of glaciers is not disputed, the idea that the entire planet was covered in ice is more contentious, leading some scientists to posit a \"slushball Earth\", in which a band of ice-free, or ice-thin, waters remains around the equator , allowing for a continued hydrologic cycle .\nThis hypothesis appeals to scientists who observe certain features of the sedimentary record that can only be formed under open water, or rapidly moving ice (which would require somewhere ice-free to move to). Recent research observed geochemical cyclicity in clastic rocks , showing that the \"Snowball\" periods were punctuated by warm spells, similar to ice age cycles in recent Earth history. Attempts to construct computer models of a Snowball Earth have also struggled to accommodate global ice cover without fundamental changes in the laws and constants which govern the planet.\nA less extreme snowball earth hypothesis involves continually evolving continental configurations and changes in ocean circulation. [45] Synthesised evidence has produced models indicating a \u201cslushball Earth\u201d, [46] where the stratigraphic record does not permit postulating complete global glaciations. [45] Kirschivink's original hypothesis [7] had recognised that warm tropical puddles would be expected to exist in a snowball earth.\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis does not explain the alternation of glacial and interglacial events, nor the oscillation of glacial sheet margins; [47] hence the slushball Earth model appears to be a better fit than the Snowball Earth model.\n[ edit ] Initiating \"Snowball Earth\"\nA tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a Snowball Earth. [48] Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the sun's heat: most absorption of solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans. [49]\nFurther, tropical continents are subject to more rainfall, which leads to increased river discharge \u2014 and erosion. When exposed to air, silicate rocks undergo weathering reactions which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO2 + H2O \u2192 cations + bicarbonate + SiO2. An example of such a reaction is the weathering of wollastonite :\nCaSiO 3 + 2CO 2 + H 2O \u2192 Ca 2+ + SiO 2 + 2HCO 3 \u2212\nThe released calcium cations react with the dissolved bicarbonate in the ocean to form calcium carbonate as a chemically precipitated sedimentary rock . This transfers carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas, from the air into the geosphere , and, in steady-state on geologic time scales, offsets the carbon dioxide emitted from volcanoes into the atmosphere.\nA paucity of suitable sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish. [50] Some reconstructions point towards polar continents \u2014 which have been a feature of all other major glaciations, providing a point upon which ice can nucleate. Changes in ocean circulation patterns may then have provided the trigger of Snowball Earth. [51]\nAdditional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic Snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with methane in the atmosphere, oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas, [52] and a younger \u2014 thus fainter \u2014 sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic. [16]\nNormally, as the Earth gets colder due to natural climatic fluctuations and changes in incoming solar radiation, the cooling slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and the Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates \u2014 this ' negative feedback ' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the Cryogenian period, however, the Earth's continents were all at tropical latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as the Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30\u00b0 of the equator, [53] a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness ( albedo ) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice covered.\nPolar continents, due to low rates of evaporation , are too dry to allow substantial carbon deposition \u2014 restricting the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that can be removed from the Carbon cycle . A gradual rise of the proportion of the isotope carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 in sediments pre-dating \"global\" glaciation indicates that CO2 draw-down before Snowball Earths was a slow and continuous process. [54]\nThe start of Snowball Earths are always marked by a sharp downturn in the \u03b413C value of sediments, [55] a hallmark that may be attributed to a crash in biological productivity as a result of the cold temperatures and ice-covered oceans.\n[ edit ] During the frozen period\nGlobal ice sheets may have delayed or prevented the establishment of multicellular life. [ citation needed ]\nGlobal temperature fell so low that the equator was as cold as modern-day Antarctica . [56] This low temperature was maintained by the reflective ice, its high albedo resulting in most incoming solar energy being reflected into space. A lack of heat-retaining clouds, caused by water vapor freezing out of the atmosphere, amplified this effect.\n[ edit ] Breaking out of global glaciation\nThe carbon dioxide levels necessary to unfreeze the Earth have been estimated as being 350 times what they are today, about 13% of the atmosphere. [57] Since the Earth was almost completely covered with ice, carbon dioxide could not be withdrawn from the atmosphere by release of alkaline metal ions weathering out of siliceous rocks . Over 4 to 30 million years, enough CO2 and methane , mainly emitted by volcanoes , would accumulate to finally cause enough greenhouse effect to make surface ice melt in the tropics until a band of permanently ice-free land and water developed; [58] this would be darker than the ice, and thus absorb more energy from the sun \u2014 initiating a \" positive feedback \".\nOn the continents, the melting of glaciers would release massive amounts of glacial deposit, which would erode and weather. The resulting sediments supplied to the ocean would be high in nutrients such as phosphorus , which combined with the abundance of CO2 would trigger a cyanobacteria population explosion, which would cause a relatively rapid reoxygenation of the atmosphere, which may have contributed to the rise of the Ediacaran biota and the subsequent Cambrian explosion \u2014 a higher oxygen concentration allowing large multicellular lifeforms to develop. This positive feedback loop would melt the ice in geological short order, perhaps less than 1,000 years; replenishment of atmospheric oxygen and depletion of the CO2 levels would take further millennia .\nDestabilization of substantial deposits of methane hydrates locked up in low-latitude permafrost may also have acted as a trigger and/or strong positive feedback for deglaciation and warming. [59]\nIt is possible that carbon dioxide levels fell enough for Earth to freeze again; this cycle may have repeated until the continents had drifted to more polar latitudes. [60]\nMore recent evidence suggests that with colder oceanic temperatures, the resulting higher ability of the oceans to dissolve gases led to the carbon content of sea water being more quickly oxidized to carbon dioxide. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of the surface of the Earth, and the prevention of a total snowball state. [61]\n[ edit ] Scientific dispute\nThe argument against the hypothesis is evidence of fluctuation in ice cover and melting during \"Snowball Earth\" deposits. Evidence for such melting comes from evidence of glacial dropstones, [30] geochemical evidence of climate cyclicity, [42] and interbedded glacial and shallow marine sediments. [43] A longer record from Oman, constrained to 13\u00b0N, covers the period from 712 to 545 million years ago \u2014 a time span containing the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations \u2014 and shows both glacial and ice-free deposition. [62]\nThere have been difficulties in recreating a Snowball Earth with global climate models . Simple GCMs with mixed-layer oceans can be made to freeze to the equator; a more sophisticated model with a full dynamic ocean (though only a primitive sea ice model) failed to form sea ice to the equator. [63] In addition, the levels of CO2 necessary to melt a global ice cover have been calculated to be 130,000 ppm, [57] which is considered by some[ who? ] to be unreasonably large.\nStrontium isotopic data have been found to be at odds with proposed Snowball Earth models of silicate weathering shutdown during glaciation and rapid rates immediately post-glaciation. Therefore, methane release from permafrost during marine transgression was proposed to be the source of the large measured carbon excursion in the time immediately after glaciation. [64]\n[ edit ] \"Zipper rift\" hypothesis\nNick Eyles suggest that the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth was in fact no different from any other glaciation in Earth's history, and that efforts to find a single cause are likely to end in failure. [16] The \"Zipper rift\" hypothesis proposes two pulses of continental \"unzipping\" \u2014 first, the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia , forming the proto-Pacific ocean; then the splitting of the continent Baltica from Laurentia , forming the proto-Atlantic \u2014 coincided with the glaciated periods. The associated tectonic uplift would form high plateaus, just as the East African Rift is responsible for high topography; this high ground could then host glaciers.\nBanded iron formations have been taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means that they may not have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.\nContinental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.\n[ edit ] High-obliquity hypothesis\nA competing theory to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that the Earth's axial tilt was quite high, in the vicinity of 60\u00b0, which would place the Earth's land in high \"latitudes\", although supporting evidence is scarce. [65] A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely the Earth's magnetic pole that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depends on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar. In either of these two situations, the freeze would be limited to relatively small areas, as is the case today; severe changes to the Earth's climate are not necessary.\n[ edit ] Inertial interchange true polar wander\nThe evidence for low latitude glacial deposits during the supposed Snowball Earth episodes has been reinterpreted via the concept of inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW). [66] [67] This theory, created to explain palaeomagnetic data, suggests that the Earth's axis of rotation shifted one or more times during the general timeframe attributed to Snowball Earth. This could feasibly produce the same distribution of glacial deposits without requiring any of them to have been deposited at equatorial latitude. [68] While the physics behind the proposition is sound, the removal of one flawed data point from the original study rendered the application of the concept in these circumstances unwarranted. [69]\nSeveral alternative explanations for the evidence have been proposed.\n[ edit ] Survival of life through frozen periods\nA black smoker , a type of hydrothermal vent\nA tremendous glaciation would curtail plant life on Earth, thus letting the atmospheric oxygen be drastically depleted and perhaps even disappear, and thus allow non-oxidized iron-rich rocks to form.\nDetractors argue that this kind of glaciation would have made life extinct entirely. However, microfossils such as stromatolites and oncolites prove that in shallow marine environments at least life did not suffer any perturbation. Instead life developed a trophic complexity and survived the cold period unscathed. [70] Proponents counter that it may have been possible for life to survive in these ways:\nIn reservoirs of anaerobic and low-oxygen life powered by chemicals in deep oceanic hydrothermal vents surviving in Earth's deep oceans and crust ; but photosynthesis would not have been possible there.\nAs eggs and dormant cells and spores deep-frozen into ice right through the most severe phases of the frozen period.\nUnder the ice layer, in chemolithotrophic (mineral-metabolizing) ecosystems theoretically resembling those in existence in modern glacier beds, high-alpine and Arctic talus permafrost, and basal glacial ice. This is especially plausible in areas of volcanism or geothermal activity. [71]\nIn deep ocean regions far from the supercontinent Rodinia or its remnants as it broke apart and drifted on the tectonic plates , which may have allowed for some small regions of open water preserving small quantities of life with access to light and CO2 for photosynthesizers (not multicellular plants, which did not yet exist) to generate traces of oxygen that were enough to sustain some oxygen-dependent organisms. This would happen even if the sea froze over completely, if small parts of the ice were thin enough to admit light.\nIn nunatak areas in the tropics , where daytime tropical sun or volcanic heat heated bare rock sheltered from cold wind and made small temporary melt pools, which would freeze at sunset.\nIn pockets of liquid water within and under the ice caps, similar to Lake Vostok in Antarctica. In theory, this system may resemble microbial communities living in the perennially frozen lakes of the Antarctic dry valleys. Photosynthesis can occur under ice up to 100 m thick, and at the temperatures predicted by models equatorial sublimation would prevent equatorial ice thickness from exceeding 10 m. [72]\nIn small oases of liquid water, as would be found near geothermal hotspots resembling Iceland today. [73]\nHowever, organisms and ecosystems, as far as it can be determined by the fossil record, do not appear to have undergone the significant change that would be expected by a mass extinction . With the advent of more precise dating, a phytoplankton extinction event which had been associated with Snowball Earth was shown to precede glaciations by 16\u00a0million years. [74] Even if life were to cling on in all the ecological refuges listed above, a whole-Earth glaciation would result in a biota with a noticeably different diversity and composition. This change in diversity and composition has not yet been observed [75] \u2013 in fact, the organisms which should be most susceptible to climatic variation emerge unscathed from the Snowball Earth. [41]\n[ edit ] Implications\nA Snowball Earth has profound implications in the history of life on Earth. While many refugia have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged ecosystems dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the Cryogenian period.\n[ edit ] Effect on early evolution\nDickinsonia costata, an Ediacaran organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance.\nThe Neoproterozoic was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the Snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple icehouse-hothouse cycles; in this sense, Snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Interestingly, another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the Cambrian explosion .\nMechanistically, the impact of Snowball Earth (in particular the later glaciations) on complex life is likely to have occurred through the process of kin selection . Organ-scale differentiation, in particular the terminal (irreversible) differentiation present in animals, requires the individual cell (and the genes contained within it) to \"sacrifice\" their ability to reproduce, so that the colony is not disrupted. From the short-term perspective of the gene, more offspring will be gained by causing the cell in which it is contained to ignore any signals received from the colony, and to reproduce at the maximum rate, regardless of the implications for the wider group. Today, this incentive explains the formation of tumours in animals and plants.\nSuch costly, \"altruistic\" differentiation can be adaptive (maximise the number of surviving offspring) to individual genes if the consequence of altruism (terminal cellular differentiation) benefits other copies of such genes. (Note that \"altruism\" refers only to the reproductive cost of the trait, and implies no sentience or foresight.) Because relatives share genes, genes causing altruism (such as organ scale differentiation) can spread if it occurs between relatives, see kin selection .\nIt has been argued [76] that because Snowball Earth would undoubtedly have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see founder effect ), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces as a result of the differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule ). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.\nThere is also a rival hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early Snowball Earths did not so much affect the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's carbon-based life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the Huronian glaciation 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's Cryogenian between 580 \u2013 850 MYA and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and then the rise of more advanced multicellular life and life's colonization of the land. [77] [78]\n[ edit ] Occurrence and timing of Snowball Earths\n[ edit ] Neoproterozoic\nThere are three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic. Of these, the Marinoan was the most significant, and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread. [79] Even the leading Snowball proponent Hoffman agrees that the ~million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation, [48] although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation . The status of the Kaigas \"glaciation\" or \"cooling event\" is currently unclear; some workers do not recognise it as a glacial, others suspect that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association, and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age. [80] It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations, and probably not global in extent. Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic, which would stand strongly at odds with the Snowball hypothesis. [81]\nMain article: Huronian glaciation\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian Supergroup of Canada, though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested. [82] [83] The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly younger than the Huronian glacial deposits (~2.25 billion years old) and were deposited at tropical latitudes. [84] It has been proposed that rise of free oxygen that occurred during the Great Oxygenation Event removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation. As the Sun was notably weaker at the time, the Earth's climate may have relied on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to maintain surface temperatures above freezing.\nIn the absence of this methane greenhouse, temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred. [83]\n[ edit ] Karoo Ice Age\nBefore the theory of continental drift, glacial deposits in Carboniferous strata in tropical continents areas such as India and South America led to speculation that the Karoo Ice Age glaciation reached into the tropics. However, a continental reconstruction shows that ice was in fact constrained to the polar parts of the supercontinent Gondwana .\n[ edit ] Current field work\n[ edit ] Antarctica\nStephen Warren, a professor from the University of Washington in Seattle , will lead a small team of U.S. researchers to Antarctica for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 summer field seasons to add more data in support of the Snowball Earth hypothesis. A project funded by the National Science Foundation , the project will study different ice types found in Antarctica that may have existed during the previous Snowball Earth events, specifically to learn more about their albedo , or reflectivity, information important in understanding the processes involved in extreme glaciation. The team will spend time on the sea ice in McMurdo Sound and in Garwood Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys the first season. The second season will be spent in the Transantarctic Mountains .

[4]\nMawson's ideas of global glaciation, however, were based on the mistaken assumption that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. With the advancement of the continental drift hypothesis, and eventually plate tectonic theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments\u2014they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.\nIn 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when W. Brian Harland published a paper in which he presented palaeomagnetic data showing that glacial tillites in Svalbard and Greenland were deposited at tropical latitudes. [5] From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued for an ice age that was so extreme that it resulted in the deposition of marine glacial rocks in the tropics.\nIn the 1960s, Mikhail Budyko , a Russian climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global climate . Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ( albedo ) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium. [6] While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had never happened, because his model offered no way to escape from such a scenario.\nThe term \"Snowball Earth\" was coined by Joseph Kirschvink , a professor of geobiology at the California Institute of Technology , in a short paper published in 1992 within a lengthy volume concerning the biology of the Proterozoic eon. [7] The major contributions from this work were: (1) the recognition that the presence of banded iron formations is consistent with such a glacial episode and (2) the introduction of a mechanism with which to escape from an ice-covered Earth\u2014the accumulation of CO2 from volcanic outgassing leading to an ultra-greenhouse effect.\nFranklyn Van Houten 's discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the \"Van Houten cycle.\" His studies of phosphorus deposits and banded iron formations in sediments made him an early adherent of the \"Snowball Earth\" hypothesis postulating that the planet's surface froze more than 650 million years ago. [8]\nInterest in the Snowball Earth increased dramatically after Paul F. Hoffman , professor of geology at Harvard University , and coauthors applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sediments in Namibia , elaborated upon the hypothesis by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of cap carbonates , and published their results in the journal Science in 1998. [9]\nCurrently, aspects of the hypothesis remain controversial and it is being debated under the auspices of the International Geoscience Programme (IGCP) Project 512: Neoproterozoic Ice Ages. [10]\nIn March 2010, the journal Science published an article \"Calibrating the Cryogenian \" which concluded that \"Ice was therefore grounded below sea level at very low paleolatitudes, which implies that the Sturtian glaciation was global in extent\". [11] A popular account of this conclusion was published in Science Daily . [12]\n[ edit ] Evidence\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis was originally devised to explain the apparent presence of glaciers at tropical latitudes. [13] Modeling suggested that once glaciers spread to within 30\u00b0 of the equator, an ice-albedo feedback would result in the ice rapidly advancing to the equator [14] (further modelling shows that ice can in fact get as close as 25\u00b0 or closer to the equator without initiating total glaciation [15] ). Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits seemingly within the tropics appeared to point to global ice cover.\nCritical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:\nthat a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;\nthat the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.\nDuring a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.\nThis last point is very difficult to prove. Before the Ediacaran , the biostratigraphic markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so. [16]\nThe first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis. Many glacial features can also be created by non-glacial means, and estimating the latitude of landmasses even as little as 200 million years ago can be riddled with difficulties. [17]\n[ edit ] Palaeomagnetism\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis was first posited in order to explain what were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move in time, ascertaining their position at a given point in history is not easy. In addition to considerations of how the recognisable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.\nWhen sedimentary rocks form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field. Through the precise measurement of this palaeomagnetism , it is possible to estimate the latitude (but not the longitude ) where the rock matrix was deposited. Paleomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the Neoproterozoic rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator, [18] although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question. [16] This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as dropstones ) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended to sea-level in the tropical latitudes. It is not clear whether this can be taken to imply a global glaciation, or the existence of localised, possibly land-locked, glacial regimes. [19] Others have even suggested that most data do not constrain any glacial deposits to within 25\u00b0 of the equator. [20]\nSkeptics suggest that the palaeomagnetic data could be corrupted if the Earth's magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of the Earth's core, it is possible that during the Proterozoic, its magnetic field did not approximate a dipolar distribution, with a North and South pole roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Paleomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted as particles could align pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, the Earth's dipolar field could have oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation. [21]\nAnother weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building orogeny releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations. [15] Moreover, further evidence is accumulating that large-scale remagnetization events have taken place, that may require revision of the position of the paleomagnetic poles. [22] [23]\nThere is currently only one deposit, the Elatina deposit of Australia, that was indubitably deposited at low latitudes; its depositional date is well constrained, and the signal is demonstrably original. [24] .\n[ edit ] Low latitude glacial deposits\nDiamictite of the Neoproterozoic Pocatello Formation, a 'Snowball Earth'\u2014type deposit\nSedimentary rocks that are deposited by glaciers have distinctive features that enable their identification. Long before the advent of the Snowball Earth hypothesis many Neoproterozoic sediments had been interpreted as having a glacial origin, including some apparently at tropical latitudes at the time of their deposition. However, it is worth remembering that many sedimentary features traditionally associated with glaciers can also be formed by other means. [25] Thus the glacial origin of many of the key occurrences for Snowball Earth has been contested. [16] As of 2007, there was only one \"very reliable\" \u2013 still challenged [16] \u2013 datum point identifying tropical tillites , [18] which makes statements of equatorial ice cover somewhat presumptuous. However evidence of sea-level glaciation in the tropics during the Sturtian is accumulating. [26] Evidence of possible glacial origin of sediment includes:\nDropstones (stones dropped into marine sediments), which can be deposited by glaciers or other phenomena. [27]\nVarves (annual sediment layers in periglacial lakes), which can form at higher temperatures. [28]\nGlacial striations (formed by embedded rocks scraped against bedrock): similar striations are from time to time formed by mudflows or tectonic movements. [29]\nDiamictites (poorly sorted conglomerates). Originally described as glacial till , most were in fact formed by debris flows . [16]\n[ edit ] Open-water deposits\nIt appears that some deposits formed during the Snowball period could only have been formed in the presence of an active hydrological cycle. Bands of glacial deposits up to hundreds of meters thick, separated by small (meters) bands of non-glacial sediments, demonstrate that glaciers were melting and re-forming repeatedly; solid oceans would not permit this scale of deposition. [30] It is considered possible that ice streams such as seen in Antarctica today could be responsible for these sequences. Further, sedimentary features that could only form in open water, for example wave-formed ripples , far-traveled ice-rafted debris and indicators of photosynthetic activity, can be found throughout sediments dating from the Snowball Earth periods. While these may represent 'oases' of meltwater on a completely frozen Earth, [31] computer modelling suggests that large areas of the ocean must have remained ice free arguing that a \"hard\" snowball is not plausible in terms of energy balance and general circulation models. [32]\n[ edit ] Carbon isotope ratios\nThere are two stable isotopes of carbon in sea water : carbon-12 (12C) and the rare carbon-13 (13C), which makes up about 1.109 percent of carbon atoms.\nBiochemical processes, of which photosynthesis is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter 12C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both protists and algae , tend to be very slightly depleted in 13C, relative to the abundance found in the primary volcanic sources of the Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a higher 12C/13C ratio within organic remains, and a lower ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will forever remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in 13C.\nDuring the proposed episode of Snowball Earth, there are rapid and extreme negative excursions in the ratio of 13C to 12C. [33] This is consistent with a deep freeze that killed off most or nearly all photosynthetic life \u2013 although other mechanisms, such as clathrate release , can also cause such perturbations. Close analysis of the timing of 13C 'spikes' in deposits across the globe allows the recognition of four, possibly five, glacial events in the late Neoproterozoic. [34]\n[ edit ] Banded iron formations\n2.1 billion year old rock with black-band ironstone\nBanded iron formations (BIF) are sedimentary rocks of layered iron oxide and iron-poor chert . In the presence of oxygen, iron naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.\nThe bands were produced at the tipping point between an anoxic and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is oxygen rich (nearly 21 percent by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Paleoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with Cryogenian glacial deposits.\nFor such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide ) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea ice, [7] while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.\nBeing isolated from the oceans, such lakes may have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's Black Sea ; a sufficient input of iron could provide the necessary conditions for BIF formation. [16] A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs marked the end of the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments. [19] BIFs are also strikingly absent during the Marinoan glaciation.[ citation needed ]\n[ edit ] Cap carbonate rocks\nA present day glacier\nVolcanoes may have had a role in replenishing CO 2, possibly ending the global ice age that was the Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period.\nAround the top of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits there is commonly a sharp transition into a chemically precipitated sedimentary limestone or dolostone metres to tens of metres thick. [35] These cap carbonates sometimes occur in sedimentary successions that have no other carbonate rocks, suggesting that their deposition is result of a profound aberration in ocean chemistry. [36]\nThese cap carbonates have unusual chemical composition, as well as strange sedimentary structures that are often interpreted as large ripples. [37] The formation of such sedimentary rocks could be caused by a large influx of positively charged ions , as would be produced by rapid weathering during the extreme greenhouse following a Snowball Earth event. The \u03b413C isotopic signature of the cap carbonates is near \u22125\u00a0\u2030, consistent with the value of the mantle \u2014 such a low value is usually/could be taken to signify an absence of life, since photosynthesis usually acts to raise the value; alternatively the release of methane deposits could have lowered it from a higher value, and counterbalance the effects of photosynthesis.\nThe precise mechanism involved in the formation of cap carbonates is not clear, but the most cited explanation suggests that at the melting of a Snowball Earth, water would dissolve the abundant CO2 from the atmosphere to form carbonic acid , which would fall as acid rain . This would weather exposed silicate and carbonate rock (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of calcium , which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an abiotic \" cap carbonate \" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the Snowball Earth hypothesis.\nHowever, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within \u2014 starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin. [16] An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the Doushantuo cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane. This accounts for incredibly low \u2014 as low as \u221248\u00a0\u2030 \u2014 \u03b413C values \u2014 as well as unusual sedimentary features which appear to have been formed by the flow of gas through the sediments. [38]\n[ edit ] Changing acidity\nIsotopes of the element boron suggest that the pH of the oceans dropped dramatically before and after the Marinoan glaciation. [39] This may indicate a build up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form carbonic acid . Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme climate change, they need not imply a global glaciation.\n[ edit ] Space dust\nThe Earth's surface is very depleted in the element iridium , which primarily resides in the Earth's core . The only significant source of the element at the surface is cosmic particles that reach Earth. During a Snowball Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An iridium anomaly has been discovered at the base of the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years, [40] but this does not necessarily imply a global extent to the glaciation; indeed, a similar anomaly could be explained by the impact of a large meteorite . [41]\n[ edit ] Cyclic climate fluctuations\nUsing the ratio of mobile cations to those that remain in soils during chemical weathering (the chemical index of alteration), it has been shown that chemical weathering varied in a cyclic fashion within a glacial succession, increasing during interglacial periods and decreasing during cold and arid glacial periods. [42] This pattern, if a true reflection of events, suggests that the \"Snowball Earths\" bore a stronger resemblance to Pleistocene ice age cycles than to a completely frozen Earth.\nWhat's more, glacial sediments of the Portaskaig formation in Scotland clearly show interbedded cycles of glacial and shallow marine sediments. [43] The significance of these deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8\u00a0km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600\u00a0Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a Snowball Earth.\nThis unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability .\nOne computer simulation of conditions during a Snowball Earth period. [44]\nThe initiation of a Snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which would result in an increase in the Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase the Earth's albedo , which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, runaway cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a Snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano , a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide , changes in solar energy output , or perturbations of the Earth's orbit . Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of the Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more solar energy back to space, further cooling the Earth and further increasing the area of the Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator as cold as modern-day Antarctica .\nGlobal warming associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a Snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of the Earth's surface would require as few as 1,000\u00a0years.\n[ edit ] Modeling disputes\nWhile the presence of glaciers is not disputed, the idea that the entire planet was covered in ice is more contentious, leading some scientists to posit a \"slushball Earth\", in which a band of ice-free, or ice-thin, waters remains around the equator , allowing for a continued hydrologic cycle .\nThis hypothesis appeals to scientists who observe certain features of the sedimentary record that can only be formed under open water, or rapidly moving ice (which would require somewhere ice-free to move to). Recent research observed geochemical cyclicity in clastic rocks , showing that the \"Snowball\" periods were punctuated by warm spells, similar to ice age cycles in recent Earth history. Attempts to construct computer models of a Snowball Earth have also struggled to accommodate global ice cover without fundamental changes in the laws and constants which govern the planet.\nA less extreme snowball earth hypothesis involves continually evolving continental configurations and changes in ocean circulation. [45] Synthesised evidence has produced models indicating a \u201cslushball Earth\u201d, [46] where the stratigraphic record does not permit postulating complete global glaciations. [45] Kirschivink's original hypothesis [7] had recognised that warm tropical puddles would be expected to exist in a snowball earth.\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis does not explain the alternation of glacial and interglacial events, nor the oscillation of glacial sheet margins; [47] hence the slushball Earth model appears to be a better fit than the Snowball Earth model.\n[ edit ] Initiating \"Snowball Earth\"\nA tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a Snowball Earth. [48] Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the sun's heat: most absorption of solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans. [49]\nFurther, tropical continents are subject to more rainfall, which leads to increased river discharge \u2014 and erosion. When exposed to air, silicate rocks undergo weathering reactions which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO2 + H2O \u2192 cations + bicarbonate + SiO2. An example of such a reaction is the weathering of wollastonite :\nCaSiO 3 + 2CO 2 + H 2O \u2192 Ca 2+ + SiO 2 + 2HCO 3 \u2212\nThe released calcium cations react with the dissolved bicarbonate in the ocean to form calcium carbonate as a chemically precipitated sedimentary rock . This transfers carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas, from the air into the geosphere , and, in steady-state on geologic time scales, offsets the carbon dioxide emitted from volcanoes into the atmosphere.\nA paucity of suitable sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish. [50] Some reconstructions point towards polar continents \u2014 which have been a feature of all other major glaciations, providing a point upon which ice can nucleate. Changes in ocean circulation patterns may then have provided the trigger of Snowball Earth. [51]\nAdditional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic Snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with methane in the atmosphere, oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas, [52] and a younger \u2014 thus fainter \u2014 sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic. [16]\nNormally, as the Earth gets colder due to natural climatic fluctuations and changes in incoming solar radiation, the cooling slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and the Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates \u2014 this ' negative feedback ' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the Cryogenian period, however, the Earth's continents were all at tropical latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as the Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30\u00b0 of the equator, [53] a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness ( albedo ) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice covered.\nPolar continents, due to low rates of evaporation , are too dry to allow substantial carbon deposition \u2014 restricting the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that can be removed from the Carbon cycle . A gradual rise of the proportion of the isotope carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 in sediments pre-dating \"global\" glaciation indicates that CO2 draw-down before Snowball Earths was a slow and continuous process. [54]\nThe start of Snowball Earths are always marked by a sharp downturn in the \u03b413C value of sediments, [55] a hallmark that may be attributed to a crash in biological productivity as a result of the cold temperatures and ice-covered oceans.\n[ edit ] During the frozen period\nGlobal ice sheets may have delayed or prevented the establishment of multicellular life. [ citation needed ]\nGlobal temperature fell so low that the equator was as cold as modern-day Antarctica . [56] This low temperature was maintained by the reflective ice, its high albedo resulting in most incoming solar energy being reflected into space. A lack of heat-retaining clouds, caused by water vapor freezing out of the atmosphere, amplified this effect.\n[ edit ] Breaking out of global glaciation\nThe carbon dioxide levels necessary to unfreeze the Earth have been estimated as being 350 times what they are today, about 13% of the atmosphere. [57] Since the Earth was almost completely covered with ice, carbon dioxide could not be withdrawn from the atmosphere by release of alkaline metal ions weathering out of siliceous rocks . Over 4 to 30 million years, enough CO2 and methane , mainly emitted by volcanoes , would accumulate to finally cause enough greenhouse effect to make surface ice melt in the tropics until a band of permanently ice-free land and water developed; [58] this would be darker than the ice, and thus absorb more energy from the sun \u2014 initiating a \" positive feedback \".\nOn the continents, the melting of glaciers would release massive amounts of glacial deposit, which would erode and weather. The resulting sediments supplied to the ocean would be high in nutrients such as phosphorus , which combined with the abundance of CO2 would trigger a cyanobacteria population explosion, which would cause a relatively rapid reoxygenation of the atmosphere, which may have contributed to the rise of the Ediacaran biota and the subsequent Cambrian explosion \u2014 a higher oxygen concentration allowing large multicellular lifeforms to develop. This positive feedback loop would melt the ice in geological short order, perhaps less than 1,000 years; replenishment of atmospheric oxygen and depletion of the CO2 levels would take further millennia .\nDestabilization of substantial deposits of methane hydrates locked up in low-latitude permafrost may also have acted as a trigger and/or strong positive feedback for deglaciation and warming. [59]\nIt is possible that carbon dioxide levels fell enough for Earth to freeze again; this cycle may have repeated until the continents had drifted to more polar latitudes. [60]\nMore recent evidence suggests that with colder oceanic temperatures, the resulting higher ability of the oceans to dissolve gases led to the carbon content of sea water being more quickly oxidized to carbon dioxide. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of the surface of the Earth, and the prevention of a total snowball state. [61]\n[ edit ] Scientific dispute\nThe argument against the hypothesis is evidence of fluctuation in ice cover and melting during \"Snowball Earth\" deposits. Evidence for such melting comes from evidence of glacial dropstones, [30] geochemical evidence of climate cyclicity, [42] and interbedded glacial and shallow marine sediments. [43] A longer record from Oman, constrained to 13\u00b0N, covers the period from 712 to 545 million years ago \u2014 a time span containing the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations \u2014 and shows both glacial and ice-free deposition. [62]\nThere have been difficulties in recreating a Snowball Earth with global climate models . Simple GCMs with mixed-layer oceans can be made to freeze to the equator; a more sophisticated model with a full dynamic ocean (though only a primitive sea ice model) failed to form sea ice to the equator. [63] In addition, the levels of CO2 necessary to melt a global ice cover have been calculated to be 130,000 ppm, [57] which is considered by some[ who? ] to be unreasonably large.\nStrontium isotopic data have been found to be at odds with proposed Snowball Earth models of silicate weathering shutdown during glaciation and rapid rates immediately post-glaciation. Therefore, methane release from permafrost during marine transgression was proposed to be the source of the large measured carbon excursion in the time immediately after glaciation. [64]\n[ edit ] \"Zipper rift\" hypothesis\nNick Eyles suggest that the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth was in fact no different from any other glaciation in Earth's history, and that efforts to find a single cause are likely to end in failure. [16] The \"Zipper rift\" hypothesis proposes two pulses of continental \"unzipping\" \u2014 first, the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia , forming the proto-Pacific ocean; then the splitting of the continent Baltica from Laurentia , forming the proto-Atlantic \u2014 coincided with the glaciated periods. The associated tectonic uplift would form high plateaus, just as the East African Rift is responsible for high topography; this high ground could then host glaciers.\nBanded iron formations have been taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means that they may not have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.\nContinental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.\n[ edit ] High-obliquity hypothesis\nA competing theory to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that the Earth's axial tilt was quite high, in the vicinity of 60\u00b0, which would place the Earth's land in high \"latitudes\", although supporting evidence is scarce. [65] A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely the Earth's magnetic pole that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depends on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar. In either of these two situations, the freeze would be limited to relatively small areas, as is the case today; severe changes to the Earth's climate are not necessary.\n[ edit ] Inertial interchange true polar wander\nThe evidence for low latitude glacial deposits during the supposed Snowball Earth episodes has been reinterpreted via the concept of inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW). [66] [67] This theory, created to explain palaeomagnetic data, suggests that the Earth's axis of rotation shifted one or more times during the general timeframe attributed to Snowball Earth. This could feasibly produce the same distribution of glacial deposits without requiring any of them to have been deposited at equatorial latitude. [68] While the physics behind the proposition is sound, the removal of one flawed data point from the original study rendered the application of the concept in these circumstances unwarranted. [69]\nSeveral alternative explanations for the evidence have been proposed.\n[ edit ] Survival of life through frozen periods\nA black smoker , a type of hydrothermal vent\nA tremendous glaciation would curtail plant life on Earth, thus letting the atmospheric oxygen be drastically depleted and perhaps even disappear, and thus allow non-oxidized iron-rich rocks to form.\nDetractors argue that this kind of glaciation would have made life extinct entirely. However, microfossils such as stromatolites and oncolites prove that in shallow marine environments at least life did not suffer any perturbation. Instead life developed a trophic complexity and survived the cold period unscathed. [70] Proponents counter that it may have been possible for life to survive in these ways:\nIn reservoirs of anaerobic and low-oxygen life powered by chemicals in deep oceanic hydrothermal vents surviving in Earth's deep oceans and crust ; but photosynthesis would not have been possible there.\nAs eggs and dormant cells and spores deep-frozen into ice right through the most severe phases of the frozen period.\nUnder the ice layer, in chemolithotrophic (mineral-metabolizing) ecosystems theoretically resembling those in existence in modern glacier beds, high-alpine and Arctic talus permafrost, and basal glacial ice. This is especially plausible in areas of volcanism or geothermal activity. [71]\nIn deep ocean regions far from the supercontinent Rodinia or its remnants as it broke apart and drifted on the tectonic plates , which may have allowed for some small regions of open water preserving small quantities of life with access to light and CO2 for photosynthesizers (not multicellular plants, which did not yet exist) to generate traces of oxygen that were enough to sustain some oxygen-dependent organisms. This would happen even if the sea froze over completely, if small parts of the ice were thin enough to admit light.\nIn nunatak areas in the tropics , where daytime tropical sun or volcanic heat heated bare rock sheltered from cold wind and made small temporary melt pools, which would freeze at sunset.\nIn pockets of liquid water within and under the ice caps, similar to Lake Vostok in Antarctica. In theory, this system may resemble microbial communities living in the perennially frozen lakes of the Antarctic dry valleys. Photosynthesis can occur under ice up to 100 m thick, and at the temperatures predicted by models equatorial sublimation would prevent equatorial ice thickness from exceeding 10 m. [72]\nIn small oases of liquid water, as would be found near geothermal hotspots resembling Iceland today. [73]\nHowever, organisms and ecosystems, as far as it can be determined by the fossil record, do not appear to have undergone the significant change that would be expected by a mass extinction . With the advent of more precise dating, a phytoplankton extinction event which had been associated with Snowball Earth was shown to precede glaciations by 16\u00a0million years. [74] Even if life were to cling on in all the ecological refuges listed above, a whole-Earth glaciation would result in a biota with a noticeably different diversity and composition. This change in diversity and composition has not yet been observed [75] \u2013 in fact, the organisms which should be most susceptible to climatic variation emerge unscathed from the Snowball Earth. [41]\n[ edit ] Implications\nA Snowball Earth has profound implications in the history of life on Earth. While many refugia have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged ecosystems dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the Cryogenian period.\n[ edit ] Effect on early evolution\nDickinsonia costata, an Ediacaran organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance.\nThe Neoproterozoic was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the Snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple icehouse-hothouse cycles; in this sense, Snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Interestingly, another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the Cambrian explosion .\nMechanistically, the impact of Snowball Earth (in particular the later glaciations) on complex life is likely to have occurred through the process of kin selection . Organ-scale differentiation, in particular the terminal (irreversible) differentiation present in animals, requires the individual cell (and the genes contained within it) to \"sacrifice\" their ability to reproduce, so that the colony is not disrupted. From the short-term perspective of the gene, more offspring will be gained by causing the cell in which it is contained to ignore any signals received from the colony, and to reproduce at the maximum rate, regardless of the implications for the wider group. Today, this incentive explains the formation of tumours in animals and plants.\nSuch costly, \"altruistic\" differentiation can be adaptive (maximise the number of surviving offspring) to individual genes if the consequence of altruism (terminal cellular differentiation) benefits other copies of such genes. (Note that \"altruism\" refers only to the reproductive cost of the trait, and implies no sentience or foresight.) Because relatives share genes, genes causing altruism (such as organ scale differentiation) can spread if it occurs between relatives, see kin selection .\nIt has been argued [76] that because Snowball Earth would undoubtedly have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see founder effect ), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces as a result of the differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule ). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.\nThere is also a rival hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early Snowball Earths did not so much affect the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's carbon-based life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the Huronian glaciation 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's Cryogenian between 580 \u2013 850 MYA and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and then the rise of more advanced multicellular life and life's colonization of the land. [77] [78]\n[ edit ] Occurrence and timing of Snowball Earths\n[ edit ] Neoproterozoic\nThere are three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic. Of these, the Marinoan was the most significant, and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread. [79] Even the leading Snowball proponent Hoffman agrees that the ~million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation, [48] although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation . The status of the Kaigas \"glaciation\" or \"cooling event\" is currently unclear; some workers do not recognise it as a glacial, others suspect that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association, and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age. [80] It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations, and probably not global in extent. Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic, which would stand strongly at odds with the Snowball hypothesis. [81]\nMain article: Huronian glaciation\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian Supergroup of Canada, though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested. [82] [83] The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly younger than the Huronian glacial deposits (~2.25 billion years old) and were deposited at tropical latitudes. [84] It has been proposed that rise of free oxygen that occurred during this part of the Paleoproterozoic removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation. As the Sun was notably weaker at the time, the Earth's climate may have relied on methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to maintain surface temperatures above freezing.\nIn the absence of this methane greenhouse, temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred. [83]\n[ edit ] Karoo Ice Age\nBefore the theory of continental drift, glacial deposits in Carboniferous strata in tropical continents areas such as India and South America led to speculation that the Karoo Ice Age glaciation reached into the tropics. However, a continental reconstruction shows that ice was in fact constrained to the polar parts of the supercontinent Gondwana .\n[ edit ] Current field work\n[ edit ] Antarctica\nStephen Warren, a professor from the University of Washington in Seattle , will lead a small team of U.S. researchers to Antarctica for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 summer field seasons to add more data in support of the Snowball Earth hypothesis. A project funded by the National Science Foundation , the project will study different ice types found in Antarctica that may have existed during the previous Snowball Earth events, specifically to learn more about their albedo , or reflectivity, information important in understanding the processes involved in extreme glaciation. The team will spend time on the sea ice in McMurdo Sound and in Garwood Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys the first season. The second season will be spent in the Transantarctic Mountains .

Sigh. It\u2019s hard to blog coherently with a stuffy nose, scratchy throat, and woozy brain. Fortunately, my pal Jim Kakalios, a physics professor at the University of Minnesota and all-around mensch, has come through with a guest blog post, inspired by recent comments on the campaign trail by would-be presidential candidate Rick Perry.\nIt\u2019s especially timely in light of the just-concluded GOP candidates debate, in which the anti-science theme was particularly pronounced. I think anyone with a genuine love and respect for science and all the benefits to society it brings \u2014 regardless of political ideology \u2014 should be concerned by this ever-more-pronounced streak in the Grand Old Party. But here \u2014 I\u2019ll let Jim explain how we know what we know when it comes to science, and why it\u2019s so important for a civilized society to value fact-based, curiosity-driven scientific inquiry. Take it away, Jim!\nTexas Governor Rick Perry, a candidate for the Republican nomination for President, was recently asked on the campaign trail how old he thought the Earth was.\u00a0 He responded \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone knows really completely know how old it is.\u201d\u00a0 While technically true \u2013 scientific measurements are continually being refined, allowing for more accurate determinations of the Earth\u2019s age \u2013 it was an evasive response.\nI suppose one cannot fault Gov. Perry for trying to weasel out of a direct answer \u2013 he is a politician after all.\u00a0 As a scientist, in order to get a more productive response, I would have phrased the question slightly differently.\nI would have asked Gov. Perry: \u201cWhich do you think is closer to the true age of the Earth \u2013 4.5 billion years or six thousand years?\u201d\u00a0 And I have a follow up.\nIf he responded that the Earth\u2019s age is closer to 4.5 billion years, I would then ask \u2013 why do you think so?\nIf he cites the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community on this age, then I wonder why he does not find equally convincing similar agreement among scientists on climate change or the theory of evolution.\u00a0 A paper last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that over 97 percent of climate scientists surveyed agree that global warming is a real phenomenon and that man made causes contribute to this warming.\u00a0 This is not a sign of collusion \u2013 trust me, there is nothing scientists love more than showing that their colleagues are wrong.\u00a0 If all but a small handful of scientists agree with a particular conclusion, it is because that is what the evidence indicates. Why agree with a scientifically derived age of the Earth, and ignore the scientific evidence for climate change?\nIf he replied that six thousand years is closer to the true age of the Earth, I would then ask \u2013 what about cell phones?\nThe scientifically determined age of the Earth is not just pulled out of a hat.\u00a0 It is based upon measurements of the concentration of unstable uranium and thorium nuclei in rocks and meteors, employing a technique similar to Carbon-14 dating.\u00a0 Extracting a time since the rock\u2019s formation from these measurements requires an understanding of quantum mechanics, the field of physics that describes the behavior of atoms and nuclei.\u00a0 There has been continual improvement, since the development of the first atomic bomb in 1945, in our understanding of the mechanics of radioactive decay of nuclei, with a corresponding decrease in the uncertainty of the age of the Earth, derived from such measurements.\nAdditionally, quantum mechanics, when combined with statistical mechanics, provides the foundation for solid-state and semiconductor physics. Modern quantum mechanics was developed in the mid-1920\u2019s, and the transistor and laser followed approximately a generation later.\u00a0 There would be no computer hard drives, magnetic resonance imaging, light emitting diodes, cell phones, laptop computers or iPods without quantum mechanics.\nIt is of course every American\u2019s right to dismiss the conclusions of any body of science they wish.\u00a0 But intellectual consistency would then suggest that one would mis-trust any electronic device that makes use of this science.\u00a0 At least the Amish walk the walk, and don\u2019t just talk the talk.\nWhy does it matter whether Gov. Perry, or any candidate for elected office, from either party, thinks the Earth is billions or thousands of years old?\u00a0 Because science is not a collection of facts, but rather a process for how we can obtain reliable information about the natural world.\u00a0 I would bet cash money that most scientists whose field does not directly involve radioactive dating of meteors are not familiar with the isotope decay curves from which the age of the Earth is determined.\u00a0 But the process, by which evidence is obtained and then tested, challenged and ultimately accepted as correct, gives one confidence that when those who devote their research to such topics conclude that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, the result can be trusted.\nThe scientific process has extended our lifespans, eradicated diseases, fed billions and as pointed out on an episode of the CBS comedy The Big Bang Theory last year, only sixty years after the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, enabled men to walk on the moon.\u00a0 As citizens and voters we should discover whether our candidates believe that science is just another opinion, and then on Election Day, we can share our opinion of them.\nJames Kakalios is the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota, and the author of The Physics of Superheroes and The Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics (Gotham, 2010).\nAbout the Author: Jennifer Ouellette is a recovering English major turned science writer who loves to indulge her inner geek by finding quirky connections between physics, popular culture, and the world at large.

We next see that ESA is not giving up, but the work may not be done in time based on all of the above information:\nWorkshop on Antarctic sea-ice highlights need for CryoSat-2 mission\n9 August 2006\nSea-ice thickness is an important parameter in modelling global climate, and moreover, long-term changes are considered to be a reliable indicator of climate change. However, estimates of sea-ice thickness trends around Antarctica are currently very limited. An international workshop held recently made it clear that these essential data can only be obtained from satellite missions such as CryoSat-2. [...]\nOver the three-day event, which was held on 5 - 7 July 2006, talks highlighted the fact that ice-thickness trends around Antarctica are still largely unknown and that information on seasonal, inter-annual and decadal thickness variations is very scarce. [...]\nESA's ice mission CryoSat-2\n07-Jan-2007\nThe question of whether global climate change is causing the polar ice caps to shrink is one of the most hotly debated environmental issues we currently face. By monitoring precise changes in the thickness of the polar ice sheets and floating sea ice, CryoSat-2 aims to answer this question.\nThe go-ahead to build and launch the CryoSat-2 mission came in February 2006 after the loss of the first CryoSat last October due to a launch failure. The mission's objectives remain the same as before - to measure ice thickness on both land and sea very precisely to provide conclusive proof as to whether there is a trend towards diminishing polar ice cover, furthering our understanding of the relationship between ice and global climate. CryoSat-2 is due for launch in 2009.\nIt is now generally agreed that the Earth's atmosphere is getting warmer, and although the impact of climate change is expected to be amplified at the poles, it is extremely difficult to predict what effect this is having on the polar ice cover. On one hand, recent years have already seen record summer reductions, in extent and concentrations, of sea ice in the Arctic. In Antarctica, giant icebergs have calved and part of the Larsen ice shelf has disintegrated. However, on the other hand, ships have recently been trapped for weeks in unusually heavy Antarctic pack ice conditions. [...]\nRyan, the Australian forum member found a couple more interesting pieces of this puzzle:\nConsiderations Over the Loss of CryoSat ESA Satellite\nOn 8th October 2005, following a successful preparation of the satellite by the joint ESA and industrial teams, the launch of CryoSat satellite on board a Rockot launch vehicle ended in failure. Due to an anomaly towards the end of the planned 2nd stage operations and approximately five minutes after lift-off, at a height of 230 km, the launch vehicle automatically interrupted its mission and began to fall. The combination of the re-entry heat and the explosion of the fuel tanks completely destroyed CryoSat. Debris of the launch vehicle (2nd, 3rd stage) and of the satellite impacted into the Arctic Ocean.\nFormed in 1995, the launch services provider Eurockot Launch Services GmbH, is a joint venture between EADS Space Transportation (DE) and Krunichev (Russia) that provides commercial launch services with the Rockot launch system to operators of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and operates from launch facilities in Plesetsk Cosmodrome, northern Russia. [...]\nThe root cause of the CryoSat failure has been unambiguously identified and corrective measures for Rockot's return-to-flight are now under way. A Russian State Commission was convened immediately after the accident. The conclusions of its investigation work have been issued in a report including subsequent recommendations, and its main conclusion is that human error and not an inherent design flaw of the launch vehicle caused the failure. [...]\nThis remark becomes even more interesting when we read the ESA Chairman's introduction to the bulletin:\n\"A Word from the Chairman\"\nSpace Law Games\nSome of you may well have seen the American film in which a supercomputer takes control and directs the fighting between the two superpowers, resulting in the annihilation of the armed forces of the two opposing camps.

(Laura) What is this thing called 'The Harvest'?\nA: What do you think?\nQ: (Laura) Well, is that harvest in a negative event, or harvest in a positive one? I mean, as in the harvesting of the wheats and the tares...\nA: Either/or.\nQ: (Laura) Ok, now you say the plans are falling into place. What specific events of the past, say, several weeks, or months, whatever period of time set aside, are these plans that are falling into place? I mean, what's the key in the lock?\nA: Have you been paying attention, as we have always suggested you should?\nQ: (Laura) Of course! I just asked you because I wanted you to enumerate! Of course I'm paying attention!\nA: Lately, there has been diversion for you.\nQ: (Laura) Well, it doesn't mean I'm asleep!\nA: V*** mentioned the weather. Was that a bit \"nippy\" for you in central Europe in December and January, Arkadiusz?\nHere, I wonder if the \"nippy\" wasn't a clue?\nQ: (Terry) V*** mentioned the weather, and the changes in it. What was the name of that movie we watched up in Tallahassee, I forgot the name of it...\n[Terry then spoke about a science fiction. Aliens were here among us, and were plotting to affect the weather in such a way as to make the planet uninhabitable for us, but perfect for them. Naturally, there was secrecy and coverups. Then the subject moved to the cell phone towers that were noted in rural areas of North Florida. This then lead to a question about the cell phone towers. First part of question lost.]\nQ: (Terry)...transmit to us and back... what can be transmitted? Can the negative energy be focused through these microwave towers?\n(V***) And what was the correlation between the strange weather and the harvesting?\n(Laura) Because we were told that the weather changes were due to the energy buildup of the wave. That was two years ago. And it had nothing to do with the 'harvest.'\n(Terry) But it could also be that HAARP adds to it.\n(Jan) Ok, well, let's ask...\n(Laura) Well, they would love for us to think that HAARP has something to do with weather. 'Yes, we're having bizzare weather. Let's blame it on HAARP!' because we're going to think about HAARP... What a perfect...\n(Terry) Well, HAARP has a lot more to do than just the weather. They can put all the energy-based stuff that they've been experimenting on in one place, because they can do whatever they want, just by changing the frequencies...\n(Jan) Or, even just continue to mess the weather up, to continue to create negative vibrations, worry and uncertainty...\n(V***) I guess the point I'm trying to get at is, are these weather changes promoting some changes in the physical body, that's making the physical body more 'harvestable?'\n(Terry) Could very well be.\n(Laura) Well, it's all interconnected, but I wouldn't say that one is the cause of the other, just to say that they occur...\n(Terry) But why, as we were talking about earlier, is all this weird stuff going on all through the media?\nA: We told you that \"HAARP\" was being designated for capturing and modulating electromagnetic fields for the purpose of total control of brainwave patterns in order to establish a system of complete\"order on the surface of the planet\" in either 3rd or 4th density.\nQ: (Laura) Is HAARP in operation at the present time?\nA: Yes, in its early stages.\nQ: (Terry) Is the spreading of all these communication towers out across the country the equivalent of a HAARP program on a continental scale?\nA: Back up system.\nQ: (Laura) So, they don't need the towers to operate the HAARP system, but they are there as the backup?\nA: Towers serve dual and lateral purposes.\nQ: (Terry) Local and regional authorities can use the towers to track people, amongst other things. (Laura) Is the weather being controlled or changed or in any way affected by HAARP?\nA: Climate is being influenced by three factors, and soon a fourth.\nQ: (Laura) All right, I'll take the bait; give me the three factors, and also the fourth!\nA: 1) Wave approach. 2) Chloroflorocarbon increase in atmosphere, thus affecting ozone layer. 3) Change in the planet's axis rotation orientation. 4) Artificial tampering by 3rd and 4th density STS forces in a number of different ways. ...\nQ: (Laura) All right, were those given in the order in which they are occurring? The fourth being the one that's coming later?\nA: Maybe, but remember this: a change in the speed of the rotation may not be reported while it is imperceptible except by instrumentation. Equator is slightly \"wider\" than the polar zones. But, this discrepancy is decreasing slowly currently. One change to occur in 21st Century is sudden glacial rebound, over Eurasia first, then North America. Ice ages develop much, much, much faster than thought.\n[Discussion of new scientific theory recently presented that the earth is expanding.]\nQ: (Terry) Is the Earth expanding? That's just putting it bluntly, but, is the Earth expanding, how did you put that? (Ark) Yes, that's the theory: the idea is that the continents move away because the Earth is expanding, and this is much faster than you know, than geologists were thinking.\nA: Continental \"drift\" is caused by the continual though variable, propelling of gases from the interior to the surface, mainly at points of magnetic significance.\nQ: (Jan) What causes the change in the axis?\nA: By slow down of rotation. Earth alternately heats up and cools down in interior.\nQ: (Laura) Why does it do that? What's the cause of this?\nA: Part of cycle related to energy exerted upon surface by the frequency resonance vibrational profile of humans and others. [...]\nQ: (Terry) Ok, let's go back to the beginning of the session, when we were talking about the acceleration/expansion on underground bases in preparation for the harvest. Is that world-wide, we're talking here?\nA: Yes, but United States is focus, due to particularly cooperative power structure profile.\nQ: (Terry) Do we want to ask about the power structure profile?\n(Laura) No, we know what that is; they agreed to work with them. But, what I would like to know is what particular steps are being taken, what particular activities are being stepped up?\nA: Acquisition, staging, testing of planned activity.\nQ: (Laura) And what is the planned activity?\nA: Control of absolutely everything.\nLike I said earlier, when the C's were talking about this sort of thing we simply could not even imagine how such a scenario might be initiated and play out. It was all just theoretical fun and games for us. We listened, took notes, and said, basically, \"yeah, right!\" That 9/11 could be planned and carried out, and all that has followed it was simply out of the range of our limited imaginations!\nQ: (Laura) Well, swell! (Terry) That's the one world government! That's what they want! (Laura) OK, is there anything in particular that we can do to...\nA: Knowledge protects, ignorance endangers. Awareness makes you less vulnerable, both directly and indirectly. Heard anything about synthetic blood, and blood and plasma alteration lately?\nQ:(Laura) There's a can of worms for you! All right, I'll bite! Go ahead, tell us about the synthetic blood and the blood plasma.\nA: Less \"mutes\" needed.\nQ: (Laura) Cattle Mutilations. They don't need as many cattle mutilations.\n[...]\nA: Bio and cyber/genetic humanoid types now increasing exponentially in general population. You may have already encountered one or two during the past 10 days.\nQ: (Laura) You, who? You, as in me, you as in F***, who?\nA: Reflect upon activities, and power and influence centers for answer.\nIt took us another 5 years to figure that one out: psychopaths, and then later, ponerology. This next exchange gives some additional clues and insight:\n9 May 1998\nQ: ... I would like to know what the geographic coordinates, according to our current grid system, that would frame Atlantis. I don't need the exact shape, just a general box shape... the perimeter...\nA: Like asking: \"What are the geographic coordinates of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization?\"\nQ: Okay, let me get more specific: the Atlantean land that was supposed to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean... what was the farthest north of any any part of Atlantis that was in the ocean, that no longer exists?\nA: It is \"time for you\" to know that Atlantis was not a nation, land, Island, or continent, but rather, a civilization!\nQ: All I wanted was to have an idea of a land mass in the Atlantic ocean that people talk about - where did it sit?\nA: Where do you think?\nQ: Well, I sort of think that the Azores and the Canary Islands are sort of...\nA: Yes, but many other places too. Remember, the sea level was several hundred feet lower then...\nQ: Why was the sea level several hundred feet lower? Because there was ice somewhere or because there was not as much water on the earth at that time?\nA: Ice.\nQ: Was the ice piled up at the poles? The ice sheet of the ice age?\nA: Yes.\nQ: So, Atlantis existed during the ice age?\nA: Largely, yes. And the world's climate was scarcely any colder away from the ice sheets than it is today.\n\u00a9 unknown\nThe World during the Ice Age\nQ: Well, how could that be? What caused these glaciers?\nA: Global warming.\nQ: How does global warming cause glaciers?\nA: Increases precipitation dramatically. Then moves the belt of great precipitation much farther north. This causes rapid buildup of ice sheets, followed by increasingly rapid and intense glacial rebound.\nSo, let's put those two things together: How does global warming cause glaciers and lead to an Ice age?\nIncreases precipitation dramatically. Then moves the belt of great precipitation much farther north. This causes rapid buildup of ice sheets, followed by increasingly rapid and intense glacial rebound. ... One change to occur in 21st Century is sudden glacial rebound, over Eurasia first, then North America. Ice ages develop much, much, much faster than thought.\nThere is, of course, those two worrying questions to consider: how fast and how bad can it be?\nJust the other day we published a news item on SOTT that read, in part:\nOver 4.5 Billion people could die from Global Warming-related causes by 2012\nA recent scientific theory called the \"hydrate hypothesis\" says that historical global warming cycles have been caused by a feedback loop, where melting permafrost methane clathrates (also known as \"hydrates\") spur local global warming, leading to further melting of clathrates and bacterial growth.\nIn other words, like western Siberia, the 400 billion tons of methane in permafrost hydrate will gradually melt, and the released methane will speed the melting. The effect of even a couple of billion tons of methane being emitted into the atmosphere each year would be catastrophic.\nBy the way, the \"hydrate hypothesis\" is a weeks old scientific theory, and is only now being discussed by global warming scientists. I suggest you Google the term.\nThere are enormous quantities of methane trapped in permafrost and under the oceans in ice-like structures called clathrates. The methane in Arctic permafrost clathrates is estimated at 400 billion tons.\nMethane is more than 20 times as strong a greenhouse gas as CO2, and the atmosphere currently contains about 3.5 billion tons of the gas. [...]\nReleases of methane from melting oceanic clathrates have caused severe environmental impacts in the past. The methane in oceanic clathrates has been estimated at 10,000 billion tons.\n55 million years ago a global warming chain reaction (probably started by volcanic activity) melted oceanic clathrates. It was one of the most rapid and extreme global warming events in geologic history.\nMeanwhile, a strong natural gas odor was reported a few days ago in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Jersey City, Weehawken, and Newark. As Wayne Madsen pointed out, last August, a similar unexplained gas odor sent people to the hospital in Staten Island and Queens. Although methane is odorless, natural methane venting is often accompanied by the venting of acrid hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of bacterial decomposition. One does, of course, wonder about outgassings in relation to flocks of dead birds falling to the ground as also happened at the same time as the horrible smells in the Northeast, though the bird kills were in other locations. Then there are also fish kills that have no other explanation that could be a result of underwater outgassing..\nMethane can be deadly in other ways, too since it is highly flammable. The following is about a different type of gas, but one must consider the consequences if the gas in question had been methane.\nTHE LAKE NYOS GAS EXPLOSION, CAMEROON 1986\nLake Nyos is one of only three lakes in the world known to be saturated with carbon dioxide -- the others are Lake Monoun, also in Cameroon about 100 km away, and Lake Kivu in Rwanda. A magma chamber beneath the region is an abundant source of carbon dioxide, which seeps up through the lake bed, charging the waters of Lake Nyos with an estimated 90 million tonnes of CO2\nLake Nyos is thermally stratified, with layers of warm, less dense water near the surface floating on the colder, denser water layers near the lake's bottom. Over long periods, carbon dioxide gas seeping into the cold water at the lake's bottom is dissolved in great amounts.\nMost of the time, the lake is stable and the CO2 remains in solution in the lower layers. However, over time the water becomes supersaturated, and if an event such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurs, large amounts of CO2 may suddenly come out of solution.\nAlthough a sudden outgassing of CO2 had occurred at Lake Monoun in 1984, killing 37 local residents, a similar threat from Lake Nyos was not anticipated. However, on August 21, 1986, a limnic eruption occurred at Lake Nyos which triggered the sudden release of about 1.6 million tonnes of CO2. The gas rushed down two nearby valleys, displacing all the air and suffocating up to 1,800 people within 20 km of the lake, mostly rural villagers, as well as 3,500 livestock. About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area, and many of these developed respiratory problems, burns, and paralysis as a result of the gases.\nIt is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing. Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake. A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Whatever the cause, the event resulted in the rapid mixing of the supersaturated deep water with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO2 to effervesce out of solution.\nIt is believed that up to a cubic kilometre of gas was released. Because CO2 is denser than air, the gas flowed off the mountainous flank in which Lake Nyos rests and down two adjoining valleys in a layer tens of metres deep, displacing the air and suffocating all the people and animals before it could dissipate. The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to iron-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a metre, representing the volume of gas released. The outgassing probably also caused an overflow of the waters of the lake. Trees near the lake were knocked down.\nAs it happens, the claim in the above article \"By the way, the \"hydrate hypothesis\" is a weeks old scientific theory, and is only now being discussed by global warming scientists. I suggest you Google the term.\" is not entirely correct. John Barnes, in his fiction novel, \"Mother of Storms,\" described the release of vast quantities of methane as the trigger for a global superstorm that nearly destroys the earth.\nMother of Storms takes place about thirty years from now. The UN has become dominant and at the start of the book the US President is maneuvering desperately to avoid losing any more sovereignty to the UN. The UN undertakes a nuclear strike against the Siberian Republic's secret--and illegal--nuclear weapons caches buried in the Arctic seabed. The explosions result in the release of a huge amount of methane from the methane clathrates buried there. The methane causes a near-runaway greenhouse effect with global temperatures going up by 10 degrees F in a matter of months.\nThe hot, wet oceans are perfect breeding grounds for hurricanes which rapidly develop into storms of unprecedented strength, duration and number.\nObviously, if such a scenario were to play out at present, the roles would be reversed to what Barnes imagined: it would be the U.S. undertaking a nuclear strike that unleashes the methane that triggers the Global Superstorm. It would probably only be in such a manner that enough methane would be released fast enough to make such an impact.\nMethane hydrates and global warming\nThere is an enormous amount of methane (CH4) on earth frozen into a type of ice called methane hydrate. Hydrates can form with almost any gas and consist of a 'cage' of water molecules surrounding the gas. (The term 'clathrate' more generally describes solids consisting of gases which are trapped within any kind of cage while hydrate is the specific term for when the cage is made of water molecules). There are CO2 hydrates on Mars, while on Earth most of the hydrates are filled with methane. Most of these are in sediments of the ocean, but some are associated with permafrost soils.\nMethane hydrates would seem intuitively to be the most precarious of things. Methane hydrate melts if it gets too warm, and it floats in water. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas , and it degrades to CO2, another greenhouse gas which accumulates in the atmosphere just as fossil fuel CO2 does. And there is a lot of it, possibly more than the traditional fossil fuel deposits. Conceivably, climate changes could affect these deposits. So what do we know of the disaster-movie potential of the methane hydrates? [...]\nThe Future.\nThe juiciest disaster-movie scenario would be a release of enough methane to significantly change the atmospheric concentration, on a time scale that is fast compared with the lifetime of methane. This would generate a spike in methane concentration. For a scale of how much would be a large methane release, the amount of methane that would be required to equal the radiative forcing of doubled CO2 would be about ten times the present methane concentration. That would be disaster movie. Or, the difference between the worst case IPCC scenario and the best conceivable 'alternative scenario' by 2050 is only about 1 W/m2 mean radiative energy imbalance. A radiative forcing on that order from methane would probably make it impossible to remain below a 'dangerous' level of 2 deg above pre-industrial. I calculate here that it would take about 6 ppm of methane to get 1 W/m2 over present-day. A methane concentration of 6 ppm would be a disaster in the real world. [...]\nThe methane is oxidized to CO2, another greenhouse gas that accumulates for hundreds of thousands of years, same as fossil fuel CO2 does. Models of chronic methane release often show that the accumulating CO2 contributes as much to warming as does the transient methane concentration. [...]\nSo, in the end, not an obvious disaster-movie plot, but a potential positive feedback that could turn out to be the difference between success and failure in avoiding 'dangerous' anthropogenic climate change. That's scary enough.\nIn other words, if there is a Global Superstorm, it probably won't be an ocean sized hurricane that leaps the Isthmus of Panama and reduces Florida to a limerock reef in a matter of hours!\nBut then, there IS the problem of the flash frozen mammoths and other creatures that died at the end of Pleistocene Epoch.\nOne of the major facts that paleontologists and geologists and archaeologists have had to face is the stupendous number of frozen carcasses in Canada and Alaska in the western areas, and in Northern Russia and Siberia in the eastern areas - all dated to about 12000 years ago. This suggests, of course, that something dreadful happened on the planet, and its effect on the Northern hemisphere was more severe than on the Southern hemisphere.\nBack in the 1940s Dr. Frank C. Hibben, Prof. of Archeology at the University of New Mexico led an expedition to Alaska to look for human remains. He didn't find human remains; he found miles and miles of icy muck just packed with mammoths, mastodons, and several kinds of bison, horses, wolves, bears and lions. Just north of Fairbanks, Alaska, the members of the expedition watched in horror as bulldozers pushed the half-melted muck into sluice boxes for the extraction of gold. Animal tusks and bones rolled up in front of the blades \"like shavings before a giant plane\". The carcasses were found in all attitudes of death, most of them \"pulled apart by some unexplainable prehistoric catastrophic disturbance.\"1\nThe evident violence of the deaths of these masses of animals, combined with the stench of rotting flesh, was almost unendurable both in seeing it, and in considering what might have caused it. The killing fields stretched for literally hundreds of miles in every direction.2 There were trees and animals, layers of peat and moss, twisted and tangled and mangled together as though some Cosmic mixmaster sucked them all in 12000 years ago, and then froze them instantly into a solid mass.3\nJust north of Siberia entire islands are formed of the bones of Pleistocene animals swept northward from the continent into the freezing Arctic Ocean. One estimate suggests that some ten million animals may be buried along the rivers of northern Siberia. Thousands upon thousands of tusks created a massive ivory trade for the master carvers of China, all from the frozen mammoths and mastodons of Siberia. The famous Beresovka mammoth first drew attention to the preserving properties of being quick-frozen when buttercups were found in its mouth.\nWhat kind of terrible event overtook these millions of creatures in a single day? Well, the evidence suggests an enormous tsunami raging across the land, tumbling animals and vegetation together, to be finally quick-frozen for the next 12000 years.\nThese creatures didn't die because of the \"gradual onset\" of an ice age.\nWe come now to the movie \"The Day After Tomorrow\" . The movie was inspired by The Coming Global Superstorm, a book written by Art Bell & Whitley Strieber which is synopsized as follows:\nGlobal warming causes large areas of the Arctic ice shelf to break off and melt, meaning that the Atlantic ocean is diluted by large amounts of fresh water. This then disrupts the Gulf Stream causing an unnatural cooling of the northern hemisphere. This then triggers a series of anomalies, eventually leading up to a massive \"global superstorm\" system consisting of three gigantic hurricane-like superstorms, which result in an ice age for the northern hemisphere within days. One hurricane is over Canada, one over Scotland, and a third over Siberia. The movie follows Jack, a paleoclimatologist for NOAA; his son Sam, a high school student; and his wife Lucy, a doctor.\nThe film portrays the \"eye\" of the superstorms as having such a low pressure that extremely cold air (-150\u00b0F or -101\u00b0C) from the troposphere is sucked downward, instantly freezing to death all who are caught in the eye. A woman in NOAA argues that the freezing air would warm up and rise, such as in regular storms, but Jack simply states that the air is dropping too fast. The storm is headed to New York, where Sam is trapped, and which Jack is trying to reach in the hostile frozen environment with Arctic gear and his survival skills.\nThroughout the movie, a subplot involves the refusal of the Vice President of the United States to accept the threat of global cooling - despite increasingly extreme weather conditions occurring throughout the world - insisting that measures to prevent it will do too much damage to the economy.\nShortly before and during the release of the movie, members of environmental groups and former Vice President Al Gore distributed pamphlets to movie-goers describing what they believe to be the possible effects of global warming, which generally did not agree with the film; some believe Gore looked too much into the film as what he may have thought to have been \"a scientifically accurate movie\". During the season when the film was in theaters, much criticism arose towards politicians concerning the Kyoto Protocol and climate change, and in the end the movie created quite the political stir.\nInteresting, eh? It follows the science that seems to be based on valid observations and theories. And it does provide an explanation for how wooly mammoths could be flash frozen in mid-meal.\n\u00a9 unknown\nA screenshot from the film \"The Day After Tomorrow\" showing massive cyclonic storms preceding the sudden onset of an ice age.\nFinally, let's have a look at some remarks the C's made about Weird Weather and Global Superstorms:\n4 July 1998\nQ: (A) I am trying to write down some things about a cosmology, and I have some questions mainly about the coming events. First there was the story of the sun's companion brown star which is apparently approaching the solar system, and I would like to know, if possible, details of its orbit; that is, how far it is, what is its speed, and when it will be first seen. Can we know it? Orbit: how close will it come?\nA: Flat eliptical.\nQ: (A) But how close will it come?\nA: Distance depends upon other factors, such as intersecting orbit of locator of witness.\nQ: (L) What is the closest it could come to earth... (A) Solar system... (L) Yes, but which part of the solar system? We have nine planets... which one? (A) I understand that this brown star will enter the Oort cloud... (L) I think they said it just brushes against it and the gravity disturbs it...\nA: Passes through Oort cloud on orbital journey. Already has done this on its way \"in.\"\nQ: (A) You mean it has already entered the Oort cloud?\nA: Has passed through.\nQ: (A) So, it will not approach...\nA: Oort cloud is located on outer perimeter orbital plane at distance of approximately averaged distance of 510,000,000,000 miles.\nQ: (L) Well, 510 billion miles gives us some time! (A) Yes, but what I want to know... this Oort cloud is around the solar system, so this brown star, once it has passed through... (L) It must already be in the solar system? (A) No, it could have passed through and may not come closer. Is it coming closer or not? Is it coming closer all the time?\nA: Solar system, in concert with \"mother star,\" is revolving around companion star, a \"brown\" star.\nQ: (A) So, that means that the mass of the companion star is much...\nA: Less.\nQ: (A) Less?\nA: They are moving in tandem with one another along a flat, eliptical orbital plane. Outer reaches of solar system are breached by passage of brown companion, thus explaining anomalies recently discovered regarding outer planets and their moons.\nQ: (A) But I understand that the distance between the sun and this brown star is changing with time. Eliptical orbit means there is perihelion and aphelion. I want to know what will be, or what was, or what is the closest distance between this brown star and the sun? What is perihelion? Can we know this, even approximately. Is it about one light year, or less or more?\nA: Less, much less. Distance of closest passage roughly corresponds to the distance of the orbit of Pluto from Sun.\nQ: (A) Okay. Now, this closest pass, is this something that is going to happen?\nA: Yes.\nQ: (A) And it is going to happen within the next 6 to 18 years?\nA: 0 to 14.\nQ: (A) Okay, that's it. I have some idea about this. Now, I understand that, either by chance or by accident, two things are going to happen at essentially the same time. That is the passing of this brown star, and this comet cluster. These are two different things?\nA: Yes. Different, but related.\nQ: (L) Is there a comet cluster that was knocked into some kind of orbit of its own, that continues to orbit...\nA: Yes.\nQ: (L) And in addition to that comet cluster, there are also additional comets that are going to get whacked into the solar system by the passing of this brown star?\nA: Yes.\nQ: (A) I understand that the main disaster is going to come from this comet cluster...\nA: Disasters involve cycles in the human experiential cycle which corresponds to the passage of comet cluster.\nQ: (A) I understant that this comet cluster is cyclic and comes every 3600 years. I want to know something about the shape of this comet cluster. I can hardly imagine...\nA: Shape is variable. Effect depends on closeness of passage.\nQ: (L) So, it could be spread out... (A) We were asking at some point where it will be coming from. The answer was that we were supposed to look at a spirograph.\nA: Yes.\nQ: (A) Now, spirograph suggests that these comets will not come from one direction, but from many directions at once. Is this correct?\nA: Very good!!!\nQ: (A) Okay, they will come from many directions...\nA: But, initial visibility presents as single, solid body.\nQ: (A) Do we know what is the distance to this body at present?\nA: Suggest you keep your eyes open!\nQ: (A) I am keeping my eyes open.\nA: Did you catch the significance of the answer regarding time table of cluster and brown star? Human cycle mirrors cycle of catastrophe. Earth benefits in form of periodic cleansing. Time to start paying attention to the signs. They are escalating. They can even be \"felt\" by you and others, if you pay attention.\nQ: (L) We have certainly been paying attention to the signs!\nA: How so?\nQ: (L) Well, the weather is completely bizarre. The fires, the heat...\nA: Yes.\nQ: (L) I notice that the tides are awfully high all the time with no ostensible explanation...\nA: And low, too.\nQ: (L) Yes. I have noticed that particularly. (F) I have too. Not too long ago I noticed that the tides were so incredibly low for this time of year. (L)\nAnd also the signs in people - these kids killing their parents, all these people going berserk - you know...\nA: Spike.\nQ: (L) What do you mean spike?\nA: On a graph...\nQ: (L) Just spikes, not the biggie...\nA: Spikes are big.\nQ: (L) Well, from what you are saying about this - I mean how are we supposed to do all these things you say we are supposed to do? I mean, we won't have time!\nA: Who says?\nQ: (L) That is kind of what it is sounding like. Unless our lives and experiences escalate in concert with all these other events... (A) I have a last question which I have prepared. So, we have these two physical disasters or events, the coming brown star and the comet cluster, but we have been told that this time it is going to be different because this time it is accompanied by a plane convergence.\nA: Yes. Magnetic field alteration.\nQ: (A) This plane convergence, or this magnetic field alteration, it's supposed to be related to realms crossing or passing. A realm border.\nA: Realm. What is root of \"realm?\"\nQ: (L) Reality.\nA: Yes. How does the magnetic field \"plug in?\" We want to stay on this general subject matter through this session, for your sake.\nQ: (L) Okay, in terms of these signs, these things going on on the planet, these fires and so forth - you never said anything about all these fires in Florida. You said Arizona was going to burn, but you never said Florida was going to burn...\nA: We did not say it would not.\nQ: (L) I know. But, it is really oppressive. I have read a couple of signs in the last day or so that we are going to have a change in the weather, a break, is my little method of predicting...\nA: Reverse extreme?!?\nQ: (L) Oh! Floods again! Well, I guess floods are better than fires... but, maybe not!\nA: Italy and Greece are burning too.\nQ: (L) Yes, we noticed that in the paper today. Is there a relationship between Italy and Greece and where we are on the planet? Some kind of psychic link?\nA: Just same current malady.\nQ: (L) Okay, back to the comet cluster and realm border...\nA: Not yet.\nQ: (L) Well, which direction should we take right now?\nA: Step by step.\nQ: (L) Okay, you just said we are going to have a reversal in our weather. Are there any other conditions that we should be aware of at the present time?\nA: Point is to watch, look, listen.\nQ: (L) When we are watching, looking and listening, is there some particular thing we are supposed to be watching for that is to give us a clue about something?\nA: All.\nQ: (L) Is there something we are supposed to do at some point when we perceive a particular clue or event at some point?\nA: What would you suggest?\nQ: (L) I don't know that I would suggest anything except to keep a low profile and keep on working until we figure out the answer. It is like a race against time. We have to figure out the answer because, obviously, you are not going to tell us...\nA: No. No race needed.\nQ: (L) Well, I sometimes feel completely inadequate for all of this.\nA: Stop thinking 3rd density!\nQ: (L) Well, I don't want to just live in LaLa land and say, 'oh yes, I'm watching. I see the signs! I'm looking! I'm listening! And then count them off on my fingers and say: but I'm not gonna think about it because that's 3rd density!' See what I am saying here?\nA: No, because you are still thinking 3rd density. Better to have a \"front row seat,\" and enjoy!\nQ: (L) But I feel like I am not supposed to be enjoying myself so much! I feel guilty!\nA: Why not?\nQ: (L) Well! I'm supposed to be DOING something!\nA: You are.\nQ: (A) When you watch, look and listen, you are getting some signals, and these signals cause a certain pattern of thinking which were not yet able to emerge, but now, after you receive certain signals, you start to think in a different way. So, you cannot now think in a different way, but when you learn this and this has happened, then you start to think in a different pattern. So, you cannot now do things, but you always have to be ready to change your thinking at any moment when you understand more, when you see more, when you notice more, when you put things together which are not yet together. Then, there may be a big change of perspective, a total change. And this we have to keep our minds and thinking patterns open and ready to change, and work and put the puzzle and mosaic together. And, this is all that counts. It is this work that we are now doing that counts, not some future big thing: oh! Now we go on a ship! No, it is only doing our best, and what is it? Our best? It will change. I believe so. That is the idea. So, everything depends on this.\nA: Yes. You see, my dear, you cannot anticipate that which is not anticipatable.\nQ: (L) Well, swell. Okay, you want to stay on this subject, so let us move another step.\nA: We are glad you noticed this birth of the spike.\nQ: (L) Is that a clue? Is this one of those obscure remarks? Yes, I noticed, the kids killing their parents, all the shooting going on, the weather... is this connected in some way to some other event?\nA: 27 days of record heat out of 30, oh my oh my! Suggest you awaken your internet pals, as they are too busy chasing \"goblins\" to notice.\nQ: (L) So, I should have something to say about this?\nA: In Florida now, where to next? How about a shattering subduction quake in Pacific Northwest of U.S.? We estimate 10.4 on the Richter scale. We have warned of Ranier. Imagine a 150 meter high tsunami in Puget Sound...\nQ: (L) Does this subduction quake have anything to do with that UFO that buried itself in the Pacific?\nA: All are interconnected.\nQ: (L) The information I got on that was that it was about 600 mile north and east of Hawaii. A couple of submersibles were sent down and disappeared or were destroyed or didn't come back... it is supposedly giving off a lot of energy. Any comment?\nA: No.\nQ: (L) Should I follow that direction?\nA: All directions lead to lessons.\nQ: (L) Now, you have mentioned this earthquake. I know that you don't usually give predictions, why have you done so now?\nA: We do not give time tables.\nQ: (L) Anything else other than a tsunami in Puget Sound and a big subduction quake... 10.4 on the Richter scale is almost inconceivable.\nA: Ranier... caldera.\nQ: (L) What about the caldera?\nA: Expect one.\nQ: (L) Other than floods, anything else for Florida upcoming?\nA: All areas experience accelerating \"freak weather patterns.\"\nQ: (L) Okay, all of these freaky weather patterns and bizarre things going on on the planet, how does it relate to the comet cluster and the brown star? Is it related?\nA: Human experiential cycle intersects.\nQ: (L) Any specifice physical manifestation of either this brown star or this comet cluster or this realm border, that is related to these events on the planet?\nA: Approach of wave stimulates precursor activity which in turn causes effects which in turn stimulates further \"heating up\" of activity...\nQ: (L) I thought it was curious that you used the term 'birth of the spike.' Is there something or someone that was born at that particular time?\nA: No. Spike is as on a graph...\nQ: (L) Okay, is there anyway we could graph this ourselves, and if so, what types of events would we include to create the background data?\nA: \"El Nino, La Nina,\" etc...\nQ: (L) Is this El Nino thing connected to sunspot cycles?\nA: No.\nQ: (L) It has its own cycle. I don't think it has been tracked for long enough to get...\nA: Global warming, a part of the human experiential cycle.\nQ: (L) I read where Edgar Cayce said that a slight increase in global temperature would make hurricanes something like 5 times stronger... given a baseline temperature. Does this mean we are going to have stronger and more frequent hurricanes?\nA: Yes.\nQ: (L) Will they hit land more frequently, or just spin out in the ocean?\nA: Either, or.\n18 March 2000\nQ: You made a remark once that ice ages occur much, much faster than people ever thought...\nA: Yes.\nQ: Do we need to invest in some mukluks and snowshoes?\nA: ??\nQ: Well, what I am trying to get at is: should we start stockpiling firewood?\nA: Maybe.\nQ: So, it could be that fast?\nA: Oh yes, and faster when in response to global \"warming.\"\nQ: When you put \"warming\" in quotes, you obviously mean warming in more than just an ordinary sense? Is that correct?\nA: And/or not really \"warm.\"\nQ: Whitley Strieber and Art Bell have published a book about a \"global superstorm.\" Is any of the information they have given in this book fairly accurate?\nA: Derived from non-human sources known for stark accuracy, when convenient.\nQ: What makes it convenient at the present time for them to be \"starkly accurate?\"\nA: Fits into plans.\nA: Do we not know already?\nQ: In other words: world conquest and the takeover of humanity?\nA: Not as simple.\nQ: What would make my statement more accurate?\nA: Call it amalgamation.\nRemember what Bill Gray said in the article from June, 2006, quoted near the beginning? \"In just three, five, maybe eight years, he says, the world will begin to cool again.\" I hope everyone has a pair of mukluks for the Day After Tomorrow...\n\u00a9 unknown\nMukluks and Snowshoes required Day After Tomorrow.\nNotes:\n- Hibben, Frank, The Lost Americans (New York: Thomas & Crowell Co. 1946).\n- Sanderson, Ivan T., \"Riddle of the Frozen Giants\", Saturday Evening Post, No. 39, January 16, 1960.\n- Simpson, George G., Horses, New York: Oxford University Press) 1961.\n"}], [{"score": 801.4551, "uuid": "15de798c-bc14-5305-bc82-c17c7c82f8cc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1109wb-33-09220", "target_hostname": "www.fr.sott.net", "target_uri": "http://www.fr.sott.net/articles/show/155764-Majesterium-and-the-Tipping-Point", "page_rank": 1.1713926e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Majesterium <em>and</em> <em>the</em> Tipping Point -- <em>Earth</em> Changes -- Sott.net", "snippet": "Now we discover that not only are <em>the</em> oceans <em>and</em> <em>the</em> atmosphere conspiring against us, bringing baking <em>temperatures</em>, more powerful storms, floods <em>and</em> <em>ever</em>-climbing sea levels, but <em>the</em> crust beneath our feet seems likely to join in too.", "explanation": null, "document": "Sott.net\nThu, 08 May 2008 14:53 CDT\n\"Time passes, but they're always five to seven years from the bomb.\" -- Shlomo Brom, Israel's deputy national security adviser under former Prime Minister Ehud Barak\nAngel by William Blake\nAs Israeli politicians continue to beat the war-drums over what they (now alone) claim to be an imminent threat from a nuclear-capable Iran, very similar hysterical rhetoric is being used in the attempt to convince us of a very different if equally catastrophic threat to life on earth - \"climate change\". The doomsayers tell us we have ten years , at most, to reverse the inevitable destruction or face the dire consequences of cities under water, earthquakes, tsunamis and the dreaded, if not racist, tropical diseases moving north. While researching this article I came across a blog that made a very salient point:\nQuite apart from the science, one thing I find suspicious about climate catastrophism is how there's supposed to be this massive and terribly deleterious change ahead of us, and yet (by what strikes me as an amazing coincidence) we are always said to still be capable of stopping it but only -- and here the speaker invariably assumes the urgent air of an infomercial voice-over -- if we act right this very minute. This is strange, given that we're dealing with what (on the catastrophist account) seems to be a slippery-slope doomsday scenario that has been building up since the Industrial Revolution. Given the long time-frame and massive uncertainties involved, you'd think that predictions of the exact timing of the \"point of no return\" must involve a fairly significant margin of error. In light of that, it's odd that there doesn't seem to be even one climate-change affirmer out there who's saying \"Rats! I hate to tell you this guys, but it's one or two (or ten or fifty) years too late and there's basically nothing we can do now.\" Perhaps adding: \"So we might as well just go out in style -- let's everyone head out to the SUV dealership!\" Or \"Let's get 10,000 of our best friends together and jet over to Bali for a big wingding!\"\nOn the other hand, there are thousands of them who seem to think we're just a few years away from this point of no return...\nAnd that's it: We're always a few years away from the point of no return, whether it's Iran, climate, or some other \"catastrophic\" event we must act now before it is too late. What if Iran already has the bomb? What if we're already past the point of no return? What will you do, what will They do then?\nWhich brings me to this curious article:\nOne thing Microsoft founder Bill Gates can't be accused of is sloth. He was already programming at 14, founded Microsoft at age 20 while still a student at Harvard. By 1995 he had been listed by Forbes as the world's richest man from being the largest shareholder in Microsoft, a company which his relentless drive built into a de facto monopoly in software systems for personal computers.\nIn 2006 when most people in such a situation might think of retiring to a quiet Pacific island, Bill Gates decided to devote his energies to his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest 'transparent' private foundation as it says, with a whopping $34.6 billion endowment and a legal necessity to spend $1.5 billion a year on charitable projects around the world to maintain its tax free charitable status. A gift from friend and business associate, mega-investor Warren Buffett in 2006, of some $30 billion worth of shares in Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway put the Gates' foundation into the league where it spends almost the amount of the entire annual budget of the United Nations' World Health Organization.\nSo when Bill Gates decides through the Gates Foundation to invest some $30 million of their hard earned money in a project, it is worth looking at.\nNo project is more interesting at the moment than a curious project in one of the world's most remote spots, Svalbard. Bill Gates is investing millions in a seed bank on the Barents Sea near the Arctic Ocean, some 1,100 kilometers from the North Pole. Svalbard is a barren piece of rock claimed by Norway and ceded in 1925 by international treaty (see map).\nOn this God-forsaken island Bill Gates is investing tens of his millions along with the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto Corporation, Syngenta Foundation and the Government of Norway, among others, in what is called the 'doomsday seed bank.' Officially the project is named the Svalbard Global Seed Vault on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, part of the Svalbard island group.\n...\nNow is it simply philosophical sloppiness? What leads the Gates and Rockefeller foundations to at one and the same time back proliferation of patented and soon-to-be Terminator patented seeds across Africa, a process which, as it has in every other place on earth, destroys the plant seed varieties as monoculture industrialized agribusiness is introduced, and at the same time invest tens of millions of dollars to preserve every seed variety known in a bomb-proof doomsday vault near the remote Arctic Circle 'so that crop diversity can be conserved for the future' to restate their official release?\nThe subheading of the above article summarizes: \"Bill Gates, Rockefeller and the GMO giants know something we don't.\" Indeed.\nAs the Bali Climate talks face imminent collapse and the EU threatens to boycott U.S.-led climate talks next month unless Washington accepts negotiating deep reductions of global-warming emissions, we're reminded again that we're just 10 years away from the \"tipping point\" . If one actually takes the time to look at the various scenarios that the IPCC report studied you'll see that even under the most drastic cuts all models still predict accelerated warming . Even if emissions were to halt by 2100 the warming would be here to stay and if cuts were agreed to it would only delay the warming until some future time beyond 2100. Just who are they trying to save the earth for? Just their grand kids? Let's face it, it's all or nothing. Either we cut emissions to zero now or we kiss our collective asses good-bye, because why bother going through all the hoopla if, in the end, it's not going to make one bit of difference. Besides, according to a new study, 'Global Warming is naturally caused and shows no human influence':\nClimate scientists at the University of Rochester, the University of Alabama, and the University of Virginia report that observed patterns of temperature changes ('fingerprints') over the last thirty years are not in accord with what greenhouse models predict and can better be explained by natural factors, such as solar variability. Therefore, climate change is 'unstoppable' and cannot be affected or modified by controlling the emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, as is proposed in current legislation.\nThese results are in conflict with the conclusions of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and also with some recent research publications based on essentially the same data. However, they are supported by the results of the US-sponsored Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).\nThe report is published in the December 2007 issue of the International Journal of Climatology of the Royal Meteorological Society [DOI: 10.1002/joc.1651]. The authors are Prof. David H. Douglass (Univ. of Rochester), Prof. John R. Christy (Univ. of Alabama), Benjamin D. Pearson (graduate student), and Prof. S. Fred Singer (Univ. of Virginia).\n...\nCo-author S. Fred Singer said: \"The current warming trend is simply part of a natural cycle of climate warming and cooling that has been seen in ice cores, deep-sea sediments, stalagmites, etc., and published in hundreds of papers in peer-reviewed journals. The mechanism for producing such cyclical climate changes is still under discussion; but they are most likely caused by variations in the solar wind and associated magnetic fields that affect the flux of cosmic rays incident on the earth's atmosphere. In turn, such cosmic rays are believed to influence cloudiness and thereby control the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface - and thus the climate.\" Our research demonstrates that the ongoing rise of atmospheric CO2 has only a minor influence on climate change. We must conclude, therefore, that attempts to control CO2 emissions are ineffective and pointless. - but very costly.\nOr maybe there's an ulterior motive :\nThe fate of the Earth hangs in the balance in Bali, but the issue is not whether humanity will succumb to a \"climate crisis,\" or how the international community might craft a successor to the tattered Kyoto Accord (Let's call it KyoTwo). The real theme of this United Nations gabfest -- like that of its 12 predecessors, and of the hundreds, if not thousands, of related meetings --is whether globalization and trade liberalization will be allowed to continue, with a corresponding increase in wealth, health and welfare, or whether the authoritarian enemies of freedom (who rarely if ever recognize themselves as such) will succeed in using environmental hysteria to undermine capitalism and increase their Majesterium. Any successor to Kyoto will be rooted in hobbling rich economies, increasing the poor world's resentment, unleashing environmental trade warfare, and blanketing the globe with rules and regulations that benefit only rulers and regulators. Bali is not about climate; it symbolizes the continued assault on freedom by those who seek -- or pander to -- political power under the guise of concern for humanity.\nWell, one can argue over whether trade \"liberalization\" brings wealth, health and welfare. Enslaving those who were once subsistence farmers into sweatshops doesn't bring wealth, health and welfare any more than cows redeem the benefits of factory farming. But the writer has a point: \"Bali is not about climate; it symbolizes the continued assault on freedom by those who seek -- or pander to -- political power under the guise of concern for humanity.\" And just like the invasion of Iraq was at first billed as saving us from Weapons of Mass Destruction and then morphed into saving Iraqis from a brutal tyrant to now saving Iraqis from themselves, so wii a climate \"saving\" scenario morph into ever shifting reasons for saving ourselves from some \"catastrophe\" :\nUnlike most apparently intractable problems, which have a tendency to go away when examined closely and analytically, the climate change predicament just seems to get bigger and scarier the more we learn about it.\nNow we discover that not only are the oceans and the atmosphere conspiring against us, bringing baking temperatures, more powerful storms, floods and ever-climbing sea levels, but the crust beneath our feet seems likely to join in too.\nLooking back to other periods in our planet's history when the climate was swinging about wildly, most notably during the last ice age, it appears that far more than the weather was affected. The solid earth also became restless, with an increase in volcanic activity, earthquakes, giant submarine landslides and tsunamis. At the rate climate change is accelerating, there is every prospect that we will see a similar response from the planet, heralding not just a warmer future but also a fiery one.\nSeveral times in the past couple of million years the ice left its polar fastnesses and headed towards the equator, covering much of the world's continents in ice sheets over a kilometre thick, and sucking water from the oceans in order to do so. As a consequence, at times when the ice was most dominant, global sea levels were as much as 130m lower than they are today; sufficient to expose land bridges between the UK and the continent and Alaska and Russia.\nEach time the ice retreated, sea levels shot up again, sometimes at rates as high as several metres a century. In the mid 1990s, as part of a study funded by the European Union, we discovered that in the Mediterranean region there was a close correlation between how quickly sea levels went up and down during the last ice age and the level of explosive activity at volcanoes in Italy and Greece.\nNow here's the kicker. How does global warming trigger volcanic eruptions?\nThe answer lies in the enormous mass of the water pouring into the ocean basins from the retreating ice sheets. The addition of over a hundred metres depth of water to the continental margins and marine island chains, where over 60% of the world's active volcanoes reside, seems to be sufficient to load and bend the underlying crust.\nThis in turn squeezes out any magma that happens to be hanging around waiting for an excuse to erupt. It may well be that a much smaller rise can trigger an eruption if a volcano is critically poised and ready to blow.\n...\nAs sea levels climb higher so a response from the world's volcanoes becomes ever more likely, and perhaps not just from volcanoes. Loading of the continental margins could activate faults, triggering increased numbers of earthquakes, which in turn could spawn giant submarine landslides. Such a scenario is believed to account for the gigantic Storegga Slide, which sloughed off the Norwegian coast around 8,000 years ago, sending a tsunami more than 20 metres (66ft) high in places across the Shetland Isles and onto the east coast of Scotland. Should Greenland be released from its icy carapace, the underlying crust will start to bob back up, causing earthquakes well capable of shaking off the huge piles of glacial sediment that have accumulated around its margins and sending tsunamis across the North Atlantic.\n...\nMaybe the Earth is trying to tell us something. It really would be worth listening before it is too late.\nWell, you can read the rest of the article which pretty much spells out our doom - unless we act now! All this sounds pretty scary in comparison to the previous evils of coal fired power plants and cow farts .\nBut don't worry! Catastrophe can be avoided:\nEpic Flood Triggered Ancient \"Big Chill,\" Study Says\nAn epic gush of fresh water into the North Atlantic slowed a deep ocean current and triggered a century-long chill in Europe and North America some 8,200 years ago, according to a new study.\nThe finding confirms scenarios suggested by previous models of the ancient climate and should raise confidence in predictions made about how the oceans will respond to Greenland's rapidly melting glaciers, an outside expert said.\n...\nThe researchers identified a section of the core that corresponds to a hundred-year period around 8,200 years ago. The chemistry of the sediment there is unlike that from any other time over the past 10,000 years, Kleiven said.\n...\nThe new findings suggest that the changes in the ocean circulation pattern and cooling of the ocean surface happened over the course of a few decades at most, Kleiven noted.\n\"The response we see in these deep-ocean changes [is that] they occur on timescales which are rapid enough [that] they could impact human societies,\" she said.\nWhile no immediate freshwater supply the size of lake Agassiz exists today, Greenland's rapidly melting ice sheets could potentially slow the deepwater current and affect global weather patterns.\nA slowing could thrust large portions of Europe and North America into a mini ice age and weaken the monsoon rains in Africa and Asia.\n\"That's the rain that a couple billion people rely on for crops,\" Alley said.\n...\nTo study the possibility of future freshwater-induced disasters, scientists build computer models based on their understanding of past events like the cooling 8,200 years ago.\nThe new sediment core findings, Alley noted, suggest that these climate models are accurate.\nAnd this, he added, is good news. When scientists plug the melting rates of Greenland's ice sheets into these models, they indicate catastrophe will most likely be avoided.\nAnd of course all you have to do is cut back on emissions. Our rulers and regulators will decide what's best for us.\nNow, I refer back to the previous catastrophe article in which it's mentioned that the Storegga Slide occurred about 8,000 years ago. Compare this to the above 8,200 year event and one immediately concludes they refer to the same time period. So did the draining of Lake Agassiz cause a monumental slide in the deep ocean off of Norway? Perhaps. But is it likely? From Wikipedia: !\nThe three Storegga Slides count among the largest recorded landslides in history. They occurred under water, at the edge of Norway's continental shelf (Storegga is Norwegian for \"the Great Edge\"), in the Norwegian Sea, 100 km (62 mi) north-west of the M\u00f8re coast. An area the size of Iceland slid, causing a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean. This collapse involved a 290 km (180 mi) stretch of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3,500 km\u00b3 (840 mi\u00b3) of deposited debris. Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunami, the latest incident occurred around 6100 BC.\nThis brings me to the story of the Blind Men and the Elephant .\nA Jain version of the story says that six blind men were asked to determine what an elephant looked like by feeling different parts of the elephant's body.\nThe blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.\nA wise man explains to them\nAll of you are right. The reason every one of you is telling it differently is because each one of you touched the different part of the elephant. So, actually the elephant has all the features you mentioned.\nIs there a wise man in the room? Referring back to Engdahl's article, do Bill Gates, Rockefeller and the GMO giants know something we don't? Let's assume they do. If they knew something was going to happen that was so catastrophic that they'd need to keep a seed vault, why wouldn't they tell the rest of humanity? Perhaps, just perhaps they don't have our best interests in mind :\n\"Asteroids which pass close to the Earth have been fully recognized by mankind for only about 20 years. Previously, the idea that substantial unobserved objects might be close enough to be a potential hazard to the Earth was treated with as much derision as the unobserved aether. Scientists of course are in the business to establish broad principles (eg relativity) and the Earth's supposedly uneventful, uniformitarian environment was already very much in place. The result was that scientists who paid more than lip service to objects close enough to encounter the Earth did so in an atmosphere of barely disguised contempt. Even now, it is difficult for laymen to appreciate the enormity of the intellectual blow with which most of the Body Scientific has recently been struck and from which it is now seeking to recover.\n\"Confronted on many occasions in the past by the prospect of world-end, national elites have often found themselves having to suppress public panic -- only to discover, too late, that usual means of control commonly fail. Thus an institutionalized science is expected to withhold knowledge of the threat; a self-regulated press is expected to make light of any disaster; while an institutionalized religion is expected to oppose predestination and to secure such general belief in a fundamentally benevolent deity as can be mustered.\"\nLetter written by Dr. S V M Clube dated June 4, 1996 from the office of Dr. P. A. Charles, former Head of Astrophysics of the University of Oxford, to Ms. Victoria Cox, then Chief, Physics and BMD Coordinator of the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development.\nNow, if the elite wanted to both prepare for a worldwide catastrophe while at the same time prevent the public from panicking, how do you think they would go about the task? They wouldn't want to keep everything secret because secrets have a nasty habit of leaking out and breeding 'dangerous' (that is 'realistic') conspiracy theories. They would probably choose to be up front about what they were doing while making sure to obscure and distort their reason for doing it. They would, for example, spread disinformation by promoting 'crazy' (that is 'unrealistic') conspiracy theories. They would also be most desirous of ensuring that the public believe that something can be done to prevent disaster, thereby suppressing panic and even benefiting from public accolades at their unsurpassed leadership abilities in securing our future. All the while they would be preparing for a very different catastrophe, one in which the mass of humanity will likely be destroyed, but which will spare the elites with their seed vaults and underground bases ? Far fetched? Maybe. But then just what happened to those missing Pentagon trillions ? And the billions disappearing yearly into the black budget?\nBut getting back to 8,200 years ago. What really happened to cause the climate to shift, mega-tsunamis to wash over the continents, and the gigantic Storegga slide?\nIf cosmogenically generated tsunami are so rare, certainly within the timespan of human civilisation, then a paradox exists because evidence for such events certainly appears often in the geological record and in human legends. Traditionally, the difficulty in discriminating between fact and fiction, between echoes of the real past and dreams, has discouraged historians and scientists from making inferences about catastrophic events from myths or deciphered records. Yet, common threads appear in many ancient tales. Stories told by the Washo Indians of California and by the Aborigines of South Australia portray falling stars, fire from the sky, and cataclysmic floods unlike any modern event. Similar portrayals appear in the Gilgamesh myth from the Middle East, in Peruvian legends, and in the Revelations of Saint John and the Noachian flood story in the Bible. Victor Clube of Oxford University and William Napier of the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh have pieced together consistent patterns in ancient writings, which they interpret as representing meteoritic showers 3,000-6,000 years ago.\nOne of the more disturbing accounts has been compiled from these legends by Edith and Alexander Tollmann of the University of Vienna, who believe that a comet circling the sun fragmented into seven large bodies that crashed into the world's oceans 8,200 \u00b1 200 years ago. This age is based on radiocarbon dates from Vietnam, Australia and Europe. The impacts generated an atmospheric fireball that globally affected society. This was followed by a nuclear winter characterised by global cooling. More significantly, enormous tsunami swept across coastal plains and, if the legends are to be believed, overwashed the centre of continents. The latter phenomenon, if true, most likely was associated with the splash from the impacts rather than with conventional tsunami run-up. Massive floods then occurred across continents.\nThe event may well have an element of truth. Figure 8.9 plots the location of the seven impact sites derived from geological evidence and legends. Two of these sites, in the Tasman and North Seas, have been identified as having mega-tsunami events around this time. The North Sea impact centre corresponds with the location of the Storegga slides described in Chapter 6. Here, the main tsunami took place 7,950 \u00b1190 years ago. One of the better dates comes from wood lying above tektites in a sand dune along the South Coast of Victoria, Australia.\nThe tektites are associated with the Tasman Sea impact and date at 8,200 \u00b1250 years before present. These dates place the Deluge Comet impact event--a term used by the Tollmanns--around 6200 BC.\nThis event does not stand alone during the Holocene. It has been repeated in recent times--a fact supported by Maori and Aborigine legends from New Zealand and Australia.\n--Edward A. Byrant, from \"More Recent Evidence from Legends and Myths\", a review of Deluge Comet Impact Event 8,200 \u00b1 200 years ago (Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann, 1992)\n\u00a9Kristan-Tollmann\nThese scientists aren't the only ones to suggest such catastrophes.\nThey're called catastrophists, a group of British scientists who question many of the aspects of Darwinian evolution and argue that life on Earth and the geology of the planet have been constantly reshaped by asteroid strikes and other external shocks.\n...\n[A] leading catastrophist is Mike Baillie, an expert in early climate change, at Queen's University in Belfast. Mr. Baillie starts from scientific grounds, such as the measurement of tree rings and the examination of ice core samples, and then delves into mythology to find out if legends can throw light on the extraordinary, perhaps catastrophic climatic events revealed by the records. In a book, \"Exodus to Arthur,\" Mr. Baillie asks whether the simultaneous emergence of legends about dragons in China and angels in Western mythology were common reactions to the appearance of a comet.\nMr. Baillie points out that contemporary accounts at the time of the Black Death, which killed one third of Europe's population in the 14th century, mentioned droughts, floods, masses of dead fish, earthquakes, sheets of fire, stinking smoke, huge hailstones and blasts of hot wind - all possible descriptions, he said, of a close encounter with an asteroid or comet.\nOne record spoke of a large bright star over Paris, and another said that the sky looked yellow and the air red because of burning vapors. Tree ring studies reveal evidence of massive climate disturbance at the same time, Mr. Baillie added.\nRecently Nature featured an article on Mammoth tusks:\nBullet-like pieces of what is thought to be an ancient meteorite shower have been found embedded in mammoth tusks and bison bone.\nThe discovery of the 2 - 5 millimetre holes left by meteorites opens a window into a impact event thought to have happened over Alaska and Russia tens of thousands of years ago. And it could provide a whole new way to chart impacts from space.\nThe fragments, found in seven mammoth tusks and the skull and horns of a Siberian bison, match the geochemical composition of iron meteorites. \"We think that the micrometeorites came from an air-burst of a meteor 30,000 to 34,000 years ago,\" says Richard Firestone, co-author of the study and a chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. \"We think a wave of meteoric material sprayed the region.\"\nAnd there's also the Holocene Impact Working Group :\nMost astronomers doubt that any large comets or asteroids have crashed into the Earth in the past 10,000 years. But the self-described \"band of misfits\" that make up the two-year-old Holocene Impact Working Group say astronomers simply have not known how or where to look for evidence.\nScientists in the working group say the evidence for such impacts during the past 10,000 years, known as the Holocene epoch, is strong enough to overturn current estimates of how often the Earth suffers a violent impact on the order of a 10-megaton explosion. Instead of once in 500,000 to 1 million years, as astronomers now calculate, catastrophic impacts could happen every few thousand years.\nAt the southern end of Madagascar lie four enormous wedge-shaped sediment deposits, called chevrons, that are composed of material from the ocean floor. Each covers more than 100 square kilometers with sediment hundreds of meters deep.\nOn close inspection, the chevron deposits contain deep-ocean microfossils that are fused with a medley of metals typically formed by cosmic impacts. And all of them point in the same direction - toward the middle of the Indian Ocean where a newly discovered crater, 29 kilometers, or 18 miles, in diameter, lies 3,800 meters, or 12,500 feet, below the surface.\nThe explanation is obvious to some scientists. A large asteroid or comet, the kind that could kill a quarter of the world's population, smashed into the Indian Ocean 4,800 years ago, producing a tsunami at least 183 meters thigh, about 13 times as big as the one that inundated Indonesia nearly two years ago. The wave carried the huge deposits of sediment to land.\nBut notice the dates: 30,000 to 34,000 years ago. And we also have 8,200 years ago. Is there a connection? Yes, all three numbers 30,000, 34,000, 8,200, and even 4,800 fit into an approximate 4,200 year cycle (within error) coinciding with time periods going back from the present.\nSo, do Bill Gates, Rockefeller and the GMO giants know something we don't? All of the evidence, cross-referenced with a psychological analysis of political and corporate leaders, argues very strongly that they do. So the difficult question with which we are faced is not: 'When are we going to do something about climate change?' but rather: 'When are we going to wake up to the fact that our political and corporate leaders have never acted in our best interests, and to trust them on \"climate change\" not only risks our own future but that of countless generations to come.\n"}, {"score": 787.0816, "uuid": "478aec11-525b-58b0-bbd0-f1db13ef69bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-62-10810", "target_hostname": "www.topplebush.com", "target_uri": "http://www.topplebush.com/oped5751.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Sound off: <em>Where</em> <em>the</em> views <em>and</em> opinions of our staff <em>and</em> others are expressed", "snippet": "Lost in <em>the</em> celebration was <em>the</em> news that <em>the</em> Arctic Ice Cap, approaching its winter maximum late this month, <em>is</em> <em>on</em> course for <em>the</em> smallest maximum <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em>, despite <em>the</em> Alaskan cold snap.", "explanation": null, "document": "Antarctica unimpressed with GOP declarations that global warming is a myth\nby Bryan Zepp Jamieson\nFebruary 4, 2012\nBack in the summer of 2002, February and the first week of March, the Larsen B ice shelf on the east coast of the Antarctic peninsula suddenly and shockingly disintegrated. For people who had complacently assumed that Antarctic was too cold for global warming to have an effect, it was a wake up call.\nThe ice shelf didn't just calve off the way the sheets of ice pushed into the ocean by the glaciers that formed them always do. If that were the case, it would have made for a big iceberg, about the size of Rhode Island, but nothing too extraordinary. Calving is the inevitable fate of ice pushed into the ocean by the glaciers. And the Larsen B, like the Larsen A before it, was expected to break off. Larsen A broke off in 1995, but since it was only 4,000 years old and was showing signs of calving, it came as no surprise to anyone. But Larsen B, older than the Holocene, was believed to be more stable, and would take much longer to calve off. However, it was the disintegration that was shocking.\nScientists had realized that warming ocean currents were eroding the ice shelf from underneath. The warming was only a degree or so, but that was twice as far above freezing as it had been, and had a much faster effect on the ice. Further, the millions of ice lakes and puddles that formed on the surface of the ice shelf each summer melted into the ice, acting like a million little wedges. A million little ice bergs have a far higher surface to volume ratio than does one big iceberg, and in just three years what had been the Larsen B ice shelf had completely melted away. Had it remained a giant iceberg, it may have lasted dozens, even hundreds of years.\nIt didn't have any effect on sea levels, of course, since it was already in the water. But its disappearance meant that the warm ocean currents now had an open route under the Larsen C, an ice shelf nearly four times as large as Larsen B. Previously regarded as stable, that ice shelf is expected to vanish within ten years.\nFor years, glaciologists had debated what role the ice shelves had in bottling up the glaciers. The collapse of the Larsen B answered that. The shelves are a very effective cork, and if you remove that cork, the glaciers pour into the ocean.\nWorrisome as all this might be, major alarm focused on the portion of the Antarctic that lies on the other side of the Peninsula, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Most of Antarctica's ice sheet lies above sea level, and much of it is cordoned off by mountains. In the WAIS, however, are several huge glaciers\u0097any of which would be the largest in the world if outside of Antarctica, and much of the land under the glaciers is under sea level, so water \u0096 warm water \u0096 is seeping in and lubricating the glaciers.\nConcern about the WAIS predated worries about global warming. Clear back in 1973, T. Hughes of the Institute of Polar Studies, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, wrote a paper, \u0093Is The West Antarctic Ice Sheet Disintegrating?\u0094. He wrote, \u0093Data pertaining to the dynamics and history of the west antarctic ice cover are reviewed and interpreted in terms of a possible inherent instability of the ice cover. A study of published data concerning the past and present ice cover of West Antarctica indicates that during the last few million years the ice sheet has been retreating in stages, each retreat stage being preceded by an advance of comparable duration. Thus disintegration of the west antarctic ice sheet seems to follow the disintegration pattern of other continental ice sheets and may be the last phase of the worldwide Late Cenozoic ice age. At least some of the retreat stages seem to have been rapid enough to be called surges. Stages of advance seem to have temporarily introduced equilibrium conditions, since equilibrium ice sheet surface profiles can be reconstructed from the moraines, etc., and thus mark the stable limits of each advance. Present ice sheet surface profiles along flowlines entering both the Ronne and the Ross ice shelves from Marie Byrd Land are not equilibrium profiles, suggesting that the west antarctic ice sheet is unstable. An analysis of the grounded portion of the west antarctic ice cover indicates that data relating to the surface profile, ice velocity, and the mass balance are all incompatible with an equilibrium ice sheet. Instability seems to be centered in the major ice streams that drain Marie Byrd Land. An analysis of the floating portion of the west antarctic ice cover indicates that basal melting is most pronounced along the Siple Coast of the Ross ice shelf and causes retreat of the grounding line into Marie Byrd Land. Instability seems to be related to sudden retreats of the grounding line.\u0094\nNineteen seventy three was just about when Al Gore was first learning about the hazards of CO2 emissions. Within a few years, scientists were beginning to focus on the idea of global warming, and debating the effect they would have on glaciers. However, WAIS, being as it is, a vast unstable ice sheet, 800 miles from the nearest base, is one of the most inaccessible areas on earth. By 2006, more humans had visited the moon than had stood on any of the WAIS glaciers.\nIn 2006, the British Antarctic Survey began careful measuring, and the results were deeply disturbing. The three biggest glaciers, the Pine Island , Thwaites and Smith Glaciers , gain about .1% of their total mass each year, mostly from snow and ice crystals blown off the main part of the Antarctic ice cap. However, they lose about .16% per year, and that rate of loss is increasing at the rate of roughly 6.5% per year. It doesn't sound like much, does it? It means the ice shelf is doomed, and probably within the lifetimes of most people reading this.\nThe rate of melt was one hundred times what scientists had expected.\nIn 2011, satellite imagery caught a spectacular picture of an immense crack in the Pine Island Glacier, nineteen miles long, 260 feet wide and 195 feet deep. Disturbingly, the crack appeared in October, which is very early spring in that part of the world. Obviously things were changing ever more rapidly in the WAIS.\nThis year, the Brits returned to Pine Island Glacier, and sent a remote operated vehicle (another David Cameron idea) under the ice shelf to measure water temps and find out how fast the ice was being eroded from underneath.\nThe results were horrifying. It was believed that the vast Pine Island Glacier was anchored on a ridge of land at the edge of Antarctica, keeping it more-or-less moored. The operators of the ROV found themselves 30 miles \u0093inland\u0094, and for as far as they could see, the glacier was resting, not on land, but on a vast pool of warming water.\nAnd it was moving at ten times the rate the 1973 figures suggested it would be moving at. That's with the ice shelf in place still, so the supposition is that the ice behind the glacier is putting more pressure on to flow to the sea.\nThe Thwaites Glacier is another huge glacier, and is moving unusually fast. However, the 2011 survey revealed that there is a 700 foot ridge that has the glacier anchored, slowing it, although nobody knows for how long.\nNobody knows what will happen next, because we simply have no experience at all dealing with these conditions. Either of those glaciers are bigger than all the glaciers in North America combined, and of course, only a few, relatively tiny glaciers in Greenland have an ice cap pushing on them. It's certainly nothing to compare with the WAIS.\nThe WAIS itself is on the move. Chris_Rapley , head of the BAS in 2006, warned then that there were early signs that the WAIS itself was beginning to disintegrate. Nobody knows what will happen. If you happen to be the type who likes to conjure up nightmare scenarios of blocks of ice, a thousand feet tall and the size of Ohio, rushing to the sea at forty miles an hour creating horrific 2,000 foot tsunamis, feel free. It's even hypothetically possible. If you believe that, and you live anywhere along the west coast of the Americas, you might consider moving to Colorado. Or maybe Mars.\nIf you're a bit more level-headed, you will feel concern over the fact that a body of ice capable of raising ocean levels by ten feet appears to be getting ready to disintegrate and fall into the ocean, and if it happens in the next twenty years, then we lose most of our coastal cities and 10% of our arable land. Not to mention vast changes in the climate and ocean currents.\nThe BAS is now conducting a vast electronic sweep of the glaciers and the ice cap, compiling the most detailed look at the topography of the region in hopes of getting some idea of where the ice is going, how fast it's going there, and how fast the land it rests on will rise once relieved of the burden of billions of tons of ice.\nMeanwhile, right wingers in America howled with joy and derision at the news that temperatures plunged to minus -62F in Alaska last week. It was just more proof, in their eyes, that global warming was nothing more than a communist conspiracy theory that exists only to annoy honest businessmen like BP or Exxon. Of course, while it was the coldest Alaska had seen in a decade, forty years ago a day where it hit -62 might be referred to by the locals as \u0093Wednesday.\u0094\nLost in the celebration was the news that the Arctic Ice Cap, approaching its winter maximum late this month, is on course for the smallest maximum ever recorded, despite the Alaskan cold snap.\nPosted: February 11, 2012\n"}, {"score": 779.54535, "uuid": "0901b2ab-9868-5e94-b719-8435af6be13a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0411wb-82-04458", "target_hostname": "www.john-daly.com", "target_uri": "http://www.john-daly.com//stations/stations.htm", "page_rank": 1.4085663e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>the</em> Stations Say", "snippet": "Data to 2000 This <em>is</em> a Russian base deep in <em>the</em> Antarctic continent at <em>the</em> top of <em>the</em> ice plateau, 3,420 metres above sea level.

Does anyone anywhere have a list of all <em>the</em> years of <em>recorded</em> climate data in <em>temperature</em> order either hottest to <em>coldest</em> or vice versa to share here? Please?", "explanation": null, "document": "Revision to temperature measurements doesn\u2019t change global warming\nThere\u2019s a bit of climate news I want to clarify before the usual suspects start misleading people about it.\nThere are three big global temperature records used by climatologists. One is called HadCRUT (Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit Temperatures), and was recently revised by scientists at Hadley. This newly-revised database, called HadCRUT4 , uses better measurements of land air temperatures and sea-surface temperatures than before. In the former case, more measuring stations have been added (giving better coverage) and have been standardized better. In the latter case, the revised database accounts better for measurement uncertainties from things like the method used to collect water (including, of all things, how the buckets used to scoop up water alter the temperature of the water collected).\nThe two most important things that have come out of this new database: 1) the Earth is still warming up, and at the same rate as has been determined before, and 2) ( according to a BBC report ) 1998 is no longer the warmest year on record. 2010 is.\nHere\u2019s the key plot (from the journal paper describing the database revision):\nThe new HadCRUT4 data is black. I know, it\u2019s a bit hard to read, but the major points to note are that all the measurements follow each other \u2014 indicating consistency and accuracy in the measurements \u2014 and all show a sharp rise in northern hemisphere temperatures (the middle plot) from about 1970 to today.\nJust to make sure there\u2019s no misunderstanding, this is not a plot of temperature directly. The scientists took the temperatures from 1961 to 1990 and got the average. They then subtract that from the actual measurements to get a deviation from average (this is called the \"temperature anomaly\"). So, for example, if the line were flat and had a value of 0 to the right of 1990, that would mean the temperatures have not changed since 1990. If it were flat at 0.2, that would mean the temperature has increased to 0.2\u00b0 above average and stayed there.\nBut what we really see is a line with a positive slope, which means that temperatures have increased and have continued to increase.\nThat\u2019s bad. That\u2019s global warming. It is this very simple graph that so many people are loudly and desperately trying to deny. The thing is, all they can make is noise. The data are pretty clear.\nNow about that \"hottest year\" thing, where 2010 is now the hottest year and 1998 places third\u2026 I\u2019ve covered this before . Nine of the ten hottest years have been since the year 2000 . But as I\u2019ve also pointed out before, these record-breakers are not much use on their own. It\u2019s the overall trend that counts. The difference in temperatures between individual years is pretty small, so a minor change might swap two years in the standings (like how 1934 became hotter than 1998, but only by a couple of hundredths of a degree, a tiny amount). But that\u2019s not the point: the point is that of all the hottest years on the record, most of them were in the past decade or so!\nIn other words, the planet is warming up. Now.\nBut we knew that. In every way we can measure it , the planet on which we live is changing, and changing more rapidly now in the past few years.\nRelated Posts:\n"}, {"score": 776.329, "uuid": "fb6d5168-7b8e-5c81-94b0-9b25599292bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-74-17669", "target_hostname": "www.spacetoday.org", "target_uri": "http://www.spacetoday.org/SolSys/Earth/AntarcticOzoneHole.html", "page_rank": 1.2256891e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>is</em> larger than", "snippet": "An ozone &quot;hole&quot; <em>is</em> <em>what</em> scientists call an &quot;ozone depletion area&quot; of in that region of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The mammoth Antarctic ozone hole in September 2000 reached across about 11.4 million square miles. It was the largest ever recorded. That area would be roughly three times the size of the United States. Later, the 2003 ozone hole covering 11.1 million square miles would be second largest.\n2001. In September 2001, the Antarctic ozone hole covered about 10 million square miles. That was smaller than 2000, yet larger in area than the United States, Canada and Mexico combined.\n2002. The ozone hole receded and in September 2002 was the smallest since 1988. Not only was the 2002 hole over Antarctica much smaller than in 2000 and 2001, but it had split into two separate holes. The small size may have been due to unusually warm conditions and the split may have been due to peculiar stratospheric weather patterns.\n2003. The 2003 ozone hole covered 11.1 million square miles, making it the second largest ever recorded. The year 2000 was largest. Its growth was helped by calm winds and very cold weather.\n2004. In September 2004, the ozone hole was 9.4 million square miles. That was smaller than 2003, possibly due to a relatively warm Antarctic winter.\n2005. The winter hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica appears to have grown from last year but is still smaller than in 2003, when it was at its largest, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The 2005 hole will cover about 10 million square miles. WMO weather data showed that winter 2005 was warmer than 2003, but colder than 2004.\nThe size of the hole in 2005 was near the average across the years 1995-2004. It was bigger than 2004, but smaller than 2003\nDanger zone. The layer of ozone in our planet's stratosphere shields Earth from the Sun's ultraviolet-B radiation that promotes skin cancer and cataracts, and can harm plants and animals including marine life.\nHistorically, the continuously spinning ozone hole over Antarctica was discovered only recently, in 1985. Since then, researchers have noticed that its expansion peaks each year in the second week of September.\nAfter the hole was discovered, many industries stopped releasing ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere. An international agreement known as the Montreal Treaty intends to reduce the emission of ozone depleting chemicals. The annual output of such chemicals is down six percent since 1994. Scientists hope that the reduction of chemicals spewing into the upper atmosphere will stop the expansion of the ozone hole.\nWhat causes it? Industrial chemicals floating up in the atmosphere \u2013 including chlorine and bromine \u2013 are thought to cause the thinning of the ozone layer by breaking down ozone molecules so their components fall apart. Many chemicals have been banned to protect the ozone layer.\nWhile the ozone hole may appear for as much as 40 more years, it is expected to improve. It probably will take decades for the depleting chemicals to disappear completely from the atmosphere, according to the WMO.\nWatchers. The ozone over Antarctica is watched by numerous Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) stations in Antarctica. They include Australia's Davis and Mawson bases and the Marambio and Vernadsky stations along the Antarctic Peninsula and the DuMont D\u00bcUrville and Syowa stations around the Antarctic perimeter.\nAmong their techniques is the release of balloons carrying instruments up where the ozone is depleted around 9 to 16 miles altitude. Satellites in space looking down on the ozone layer also record data that reveals the condition of the atmosphere. In 2003, more than 50 million tons of ozone were found to be missing from the atmosphere over Antarctica.\nThe ozone hole is influenced by changes in weather, which causes the size, depth and persistence of the ozone hole to vary substantially from year to year. Scientists point out that data from any one year can't be used to conclude there is a general trend in the ozone hole.\nCFCs in the clouds. Clouds usually don't form in the dry stratosphere. However, sometimes winters temperatures are low enough to allow clouds to form.\nInert man-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons \u2013 CFCs \u2013 are used by human beings as propellants in spray cans. High up in the stratospheric clouds, chemical reactions convert CFCs to ozone. The earlier in the year the clouds form, the larger will be the ozone hole later in that year.\nAugust and September are the coldest months for the South Pole. As temperatures warm in October, the ozone layer starts to rebuild.\nWater and ozone. Scientists wonder if a wetter upper atmosphere might delay global ozone recovery.\nNASA researchers have found that an increase in water vapor in the stratosphere, stemming partially from greenhouse gases, may delay ozone recovery and increase the rate of climate change.\nTo check on the long-term stratospheric cooling and ozone depletion, NASA put data from satellites and other remote sensors into its GISS global climate model. It was the first study to link greenhouse gases to increased ozone depletion over populated areas.\nClimate models show cooler stratospheric temperatures happen when there is more water vapor present. Water vapor also leads to the breakdown of ozone molecules.\nThe stratosphere is the dry layer of the atmosphere above the troposphere, where temperatures increase with height.\nAccording to satellite data, upper atmospheric temperatures around the world - at altitudes of 20 to 35 miles high -- have cooled between 5.4 and 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit over recent decades.\nDriving forces. NASA found two driving forces behind the change in stratospheric moisture:\nIncreased emissions of the greenhouse gas methane are transformed into water in the stratosphere, accounting for about a third of the observed increase in moisture there.\nMore water is transported from the lower atmosphere. Warmer air holds more water vapor than colder air, so the amount of water vapor in the lower atmosphere increases as it is warmed by the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, may enhance the transport of water into the stratosphere.\nThe increased transport of water vapor to the stratosphere seems likely to have been induced by human activities.\nOzone destruction. Rising greenhouse gas emissions account for all or part of the water vapor increase, which causes stratospheric ozone destruction.\nWhen more water vapor works its way into the stratosphere, the water molecules can be broken down, releasing reactive molecules that can destroy ozone. If the trend of increasing stratospheric water vapor continues, it could increase future global warming and impede ozone stratospheric recovery.\nThe impact on global warming comes about because both water vapor and ozone are greenhouse gases, which trap heat leaving the Earth. When they change, the Earth's energy balance changes too, altering the surface climate.\nWarmer ground. Increased water vapor in the stratosphere makes it warmer on the ground by trapping heat, while the ozone loss makes it colder on the ground.\nWater vapor has a much larger effect, so that overall the changes increase global warming.\nAlthough ozone depletion cools the Earth's surface, repairing stratospheric ozone is important to block harmful ultraviolet radiation. Other greenhouse gas emissions also need to be reduced.\nUARS satellite. NASA combined seven years of data from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) with data collected on the ground to paint a complete picture of the upper atmosphere.\nNASA's HALOE was aboard the UARS spacecraft when it was launched September 12, 1991 as part of the Earth Science Enterprise Program. The spacecraft's mission at launch was to improve understanding of stratospheric ozone depletion by analyzing vertical profiles of ozone, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, methane, water vapor, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and aerosols.\nFourteen years of lower stratospheric measurements have revealed large increases in water vapor. Though some older studies conflict with lower stratospheric observations of water vapor trends, new studies agree with the increases, showing they have been taking place for more than four decades.\nWhat Is An Ozone Hole?\nOzone molecules are made up of three atoms of oxygen. They comprise a thin layer of the atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\nMost atmospheric ozone is found between approximately six miles and 18 miles above the Earth's surface.\nAn ozone \"hole\" is what scientists call an \"ozone depletion area\" of in that region of Earth's atmosphere.\nReally big hole. The largest ozone hole ever detected was spotted on September 6, 2000, by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aboard a NASA satellite known as Earth Probe (TOMS-EP).\nThe Antarctic ozone hole was three times larger than the entire land mass of the United States, making it the largest such area ever observed.\nThe hole expanded to a record size of 11.4 million square miles. The previous record had been 10.5 million square miles in September 1998.\nScientists were surprised by its enormous size. The lowest readings in the Antarctic ozone hole usually are observed in late September or early October each year.\nFrail layer. The year 2000 observations reinforced concerns about the frailty of Earth's ozone layer. Although production of ozone-destroying gases had been curtailed under international agreements, concentrations of the gases in the stratosphere have been reaching their peak.\nDue to their long persistence in the atmosphere, it will be decades before the ozone hole is no longer an annual occurrence.\nAntarctic vortex. The year 2000 saw an extremely intense Antarctic vortex -- an upper-altitude stratospheric air current that sweeps around the Antarctic continent, confining the Antarctic ozone hole.\nVariations in the size of the ozone hole and of ozone depletion accompanying it from one year to the next are not unexpected.\nNASA instruments have been measuring Antarctic ozone levels since the 1970s. Since the discovery of the ozone hole in 1985, TOMS has been a key tool for monitoring ozone levels above Earth.\nTOMS-EP and other ozone-measurement programs are important parts of a global environmental effort of NASA's Earth Science enterprise, a long-term research program designed to study Earth's land, oceans, atmosphere, ice and life as a total integrated system.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has 181 member nations and is headquartered at Geneva, Switzerland. It analyzes data collected by satellites, balloons launched into the atmosphere, and ground observations.\nLearn more:\n"}, {"score": 775.46484, "uuid": "59d95725-fab4-58bc-9f6b-af4a8c00d9d7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-40-31351", "target_hostname": "www.buildart.com", "target_uri": "http://www.buildart.com/ice_free_earth_now.htm", "page_rank": 1.1716563e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Ice Free <em>Earth</em> Now", "snippet": "<em>The</em> oceans <em>where</em> warm QUIZ: During Greenhouse <em>Earth</em> periods <em>the</em> entire <em>Earth</em> heats up about <em>the</em> same amount, true or false? <em>The</em> poles heat up much more <em>and</em> <em>the</em> <em>temperature</em> gradient between <em>the</em> equator <em>and</em> <em>the</em> poles <em>is</em> half <em>what</em> it <em>is</em> today.

We thought the current climate was optimal and it would go on forever.\nThis graph shows the temperature history of the Earth. Today is on the far right side. During the last 2 billion years the Earth's climate has alternated between an \"Icehouse\", like today's world, and \"Greenhouse\", like the world of the dinosaurs and the early mammals.\nEven had our ancestors known the truth, they had no means of changing the course of the ice age. There is now a scientific consensus that mankind has recently caused the globe to warm if only a little. If this is true, and let us hope it is, then we can melt the ice sheets and stop this massively destructive freeze/partial thaw cycle we find ourselves in. Unfortunately, recent revelations cast serious doubt on AGW.\nOther mechanisms will likely need to be employed. We've had the technology and the idea for nearly fifty years.\nIt is conceivable\u00a0 we may choose not to break out of the ice age at all. What then?\nWe have adapted well to the moderate natural warming since the last glacial period. It is now ten or fifteen degrees warmer than the last glacial maximum eighteen thousand years ago. If it drops ten or fifteen degrees we will not be able to adapt well. We and the Earth can easily handle more warming and more CO2. The atmosphere is said to have less than 400 ppm currently. What happens if that triples?\nWatch this informative BBC special, Men of Rock: The Big Freeze. The existence of the ice age is now common knowledge in the science community. It was unknown prior to October 7, 1840 when it hit the papers in Scotland and not accepted for a long time. Even today it is not common knowledge amongst the public that the earth is at this moment in an ice age. Some think it is possible we might go into another ice age. Most would be surprised to learn the truth.\nIs CO2 a pollutant and a 'bad' gas?\nPrevious interglacials were actually warmer than now. If we do nothing, sooner or later, the warmth will go. The ice will come again. That process may even now have started. How does one adapt to a mile of ice overhead? Expect a mass extinction event.\u00a0 Civilization as we know it will be in danger of disappearing for at least 100,000 years. Science and technology will be very difficult to maintain. Homo Sapiens will be in extreme survival mode.\nQUIZ: Is it Greenhouse Earth or Icehouse Earth conditions now?\nDid you guess Greenhouse Earth? Please make another choice. We are in a warm Icehouse situation, an ice age, quite far from a Greenhouse Earth period.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nIf your only climate information comes from the mass media you are getting an extremely limited, incomplete and misleading view.

From 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago.\n2.\u00a0 The next was from 850 to 630 million years ago and is\ncalled the Cryogenian period. Also known as Snowball Earth, glaciers may have extended to the equator.\n3.\u00a0 The Andean-Saharan was a minor ice age from 460 to 420 million years ago.\n4.\u00a0 The Karoo Ice Age spanned 360 million to 260 million\nyears ago.\n5.\u00a0 The current ice age began about 2.58 million year ago\nwhen continental drift caused Central America to form\nand cut off circulation between the oceans. Called the Pleistocene, it is defined as having ended about 10,000 years ago. Don't confuse this with the end of the ice age itself. The ice age continues in full force as you will see.\nQUIZ: When did modern man live in other than an ice age?\nTrick question.

Kotzebue experienced its HOTTEST JULY SINCE THE 1940s when the city began keeping records. The average temperature for the month was 66 degrees \u2014 that\u2019s 5.3 degrees warmer than normal \u2014 and UNUSUALLY DRY as well. August looks to be a record-breaking month as well, with a high so far of 67 degrees on Aug. 5. \u201cNormally in August the first week or two is cool, then we warm up and then in the end there is a cooling trend into September. But we were almost 20 degrees warmer the first week of August than we were last year.\u201d\nIf it wasn\u2019t enough that the city is getting baked, it\u2019s also been smelling smoke from forest fires in the interior drift north and northwest. It\u2019s been so bad, the state\u2019s Department of Air Quality advised that young children, the elderly and the sick stay inside, and healthy people avoid prolonged outdoor activity. Barrow had its sixth warmest July, but it\u2019s also been the FIRST TIME THAT THE TEMPERATURE DIDN'T DIP TO FREEZING AT ANY POINT DURING THE MONTH. There were also a few stand-out days \u2014 Barrow had its warmest July 12, at 73 degrees, and July 30, at 72 degrees. July 28 tied the previous record of 70 degrees. Barrow\u2019s highest temperature ever was 79 degrees, recorded on July 13, 1993. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing that has happened, especially in July. There is usually maybe one day a year when we have high temperatures in the 70s.\"\nWith the summer heat came another UNUSUAL kind of weather \u2014 thunderstorms along the coast of the Northwest Arctic. When a hot day erupted into a stormy evening in Kotzebue on June 22 \"people were shocked. No one could remember back to when there was a real honest thunder and lightening storm in Kotzebue. I had people calling me up asking \u2018is this really happening?\u2019 \u201d While storms are common in the Selawik Valley, it is RARE that they make it to the coast, where cool weather blows off the ocean. Kivalina got hit with stormy weather as well, which is UNUSUAL. The Northwest is being influenced by a ridge of high pressure that\u2019s locked in eastern Alaska. That ridge makes the atmosphere in the east too stable for storms, but has warmed up the west just enough.\nThe hot summer came on the heels of a winter that pounded Arctic communities with huge snowfalls. Barrow got 77.9 inches of snow over the course of the year, which is almost triple the 28 inches it usually gets. But that was hardly anything compared to what Kotzebue got. A whopping 47.4 inches got dumped on Kotzebue in February alone, more than nine times the historical average. At least one inch of snow fell during 13 different days in February, 10.7 inches on the last two days. Kotzebue usually gets 49.4 inches in an entire winter. \u201cSo, Kotzebue essentially received nearly A YEAR'S WORTH OF SNOW IN 28 DAYS\". The drifts only got deeper in the beginning of March, when 21.6 inches fell in just the first 10 days, four times the monthly average. Snowy winters and hot summers might seem like an unlikely pairing, but last winter was fairly warm, and warmer winters are more favorable to snowfall because the atmosphere can hold more water.\n"}, {"score": 765.35297, "uuid": "3145146d-5881-5323-bebf-69ec0c5884ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0805wb-59-19684", "target_hostname": "www.climatecentral.org", "target_uri": "http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/record-warm-nighttime-temperatures-a-closer-look/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Record Warm Nighttime <em>Temperatures</em>: A Closer Look | Climate Central", "snippet": "However, <em>what</em> I\u2019ve noticed in Indiana <em>and</em> elsewhere seems to be an absense of <em>the</em> winter severe lows setting records or even matching them. <em>The</em> <em>coldest</em> nights in winter occur when <em>the</em> sky <em>is</em> clear <em>and</em> infrared radiation escapes into space.", "explanation": null, "document": "RSS\nBy David Kroodsma\nJuly was hot: Washington, D.C. , Oklahoma City , Philadelphia , and Austin set records for not just their warmest July in history, but their warmest month on record.

I know, it\u2019s a bit hard to read, but the major points to note are that all the measurements follow each other \u2014 indicating consistency and accuracy in the measurements \u2014 and all show a sharp rise in northern hemisphere temperatures (the middle plot) from about 1970 to today.\nJust to make sure there\u2019s no misunderstanding, this is not a plot of temperature directly.

That is a fact of this world, and has happened before, and will happen again.\nIsn\u2019t the controversy that humans have anything to do with or have participated in the current acceleration of global warming, rather than that it may be occurring?\n4.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 11:08 am\nNow what are people doing to address this in their daily lives? Here is my list: Installed low flow water fixtures starting in the late \u201980\u2032s and upgraded them as needed, added insulation to house, am sharing one car with my wife and buying a Toyota Prius C to replace our eleven year old Toyota Echo, put a small solar grid tied system on our roof in 2003, replaced roof when due with very light colored shingles, used desert landscaping, have mostly CFL\u2019s that will only be replaced with LED\u2019s when CFL\u2019s burn out, use a clothesline in our garage to do most clothes drying, wash in cold water with appropriate laundry soap for such, make sure all personal hygiene products are fully used and stretched to get every last bit out containers, feedback to stores our desire to see more sustainable products and operations, always replace electronics with more efficient ones when appropriate, decided against having children, vote for informed politicians who will push uninformed companies forward, and the list goes on.\n5.\nAlso, I pay for carbon offsets.\n6.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 11:13 am\n#3 , yes, the controversy is over the human influence. But that is why the politics comes in. I remember a nice senate hearing on GW, was going well, until the sen. from Oklahoma showed up, and the meeting turned confrontational. Well, of course, it is simple to see where he is coming from , the oil and gas industry. Typical.\n7.\nThat\u2019s not what Rick Santorum said last night at his victory speech, er second place victory speech, in his PA HQ.\nThe gall of that man calling climate change \u201cpolitical science\u201d.\n8.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 11:21 am\nOldebabe, There isn\u2019t any valid controversy over whether humans are causing the current accelerated warming if you ignore the uninformed press reports with their insistence on equal time for both sides. The science is clear and it is time for people to act in their own best interest.\n9.\nAfter 26 years of failed warnings, the fact that it\u2019s cooling now does NOT prove global warming was a tragic exaggeration\u2026\u2026\u2026\nBoycott the fear mongering climate crisis media!\n10.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 11:50 am\nIt seems to me that there is little or no disagreement that climate change is occurring. That is a fact of this world, and has happened before, and will happen again.\nThere certainly isn\u2019t any disagreement in the science field, but there are armies of bloggers and think-tanks not only saying climate change isn\u2019t occurring, but even denying the laws of physics by claiming CO2 isn\u2019t a greenhouse gas.\nAnd yes, climate has changed before, but now it is happening a million times faster than it has in the past. Also, human civilization wasn\u2019t around during the past changes\u2013this time we are.\nAnd Mark @8 is correct. Our emissions are causing the warming. Every other possible cause has been examined very carefully and over the years have been ruled out. There\u2019s no scientific controversy there either. Some of the debate was how much of the current warming is caused by our emissions. A few years ago estimates went from 25 to 70 percent.\nHowever, at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting some were bandying around the idea that more than \u201c100% \u201d of the warming was attributable to humans. What they\u2019re saying is that based on all the factors at play (e.g. solar activity was in a minimum till recently) the earth should have been cooling slightly. So not only have our emissions negated the cooling, but actually produced warming on top of that.\n11.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 12:11 pm\nPhil,\nIt has been argued that while the 9 of the 10 hottest years have been since 2000 that there has not been statistically significant heating since 1998.

Period.\nHowever, the deniers have switched their attack target from warming itself to the cause behind warming (and even further, in some cases: \u201cok, there\u2019s warming and we\u2019re causing it, but we can\u2019t do anything about it\u201d).\n14.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 12:59 pm\none thing i always find troubling about these global temperature anomaly graphs is that they depict global anomalies. that\u2019s fine, if the goal is to show net warming over the globe. but this smears out the much higher local anomalies, which can be dramatic (and can swing in both directions).\nnot too long ago i saw Phil post an image of the global distribution of the force of gravity at the surface, projected onto a globe. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve seen anywhere a global depiction of local anomalies. i think it\u2019d be much more useful than just the hockey sticks in terms of demonstrating just how serious AGW is.\n15.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 1:29 pm\nThanks that you help us against the misleading people!

Thankfully you don\u2019t fall for that!\nAnd if you want to read about water buckets, don\u2019t go to Steve McIntyre\u2019s blog, that\u2019s for sure!\n16.\nRecently it was stated that the extra CO2 would only account for a 1c change overall, yet we have more than a 1c increase.\nAirborne pollution restricts sunlight to the ground, there are more clouds and man-made from jets.\nWhat\u2019s causing the temp increase?\n18.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 1:51 pm\n@17, Mark Derail, it\u2019s not only CO2 that is a greenhouse gas. Methane is as well. Humans release several greenhouse gases in massive volumes into the atmosphere.\nOf course, I remember growing up and seeing smog and hearing news reports about how bad it was, whilst politicians claimed smog was harmless and a normal thing with industry\u2026\nToday, it\u2019s global climate change, with the same BS claims.\nBut, one would think that by now, people would be able to ascertain when a politician lies. It\u2019s remarkably easy: Their lips move.\nNow, if only our meteorologists could figure out this past winter!\nThey\u2019re talking about 80 degrees on Friday in Philadelphia!\n19.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 2:01 pm\nAnd those of you who are very concerned about AGW, or whatever it\u2019s called this week have DRASTICALLY changed your lives how to address this issue? You have gotten rid of your fossil-fueled automobiles, right? You have moved into caves, right? You have stopped using any source of energy that comes from the use of fossil fuel, right? \u2026\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll begin to give a rat\u2019s behind about AGW when you alarmists start putting YOUR money where your mouths are and stop running around crying about the climate.\n20.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 2:16 pm\n@11 Blair\nIt has been argued that while the 9 of the 10 hottest years have been since 2000 that there has not been statistically significant heating since 1998. I can\u2019t tell from the drawing but it looks like this is no longer the case. Can you clarify?\n1998 was an El Nino year, which typically has warmer than average temps. Importantly 1998 was a blockbuster El Nino which heated everything up. What\u2019s amazing is that now we are in La Nino, which is usually cool, and the temps are approaching those same levels. The weather moves up and down and we can\u2019t make valid statistical judgements over small time periods. If you cherry pick which time you look at you\u2019ll always find the trend you are looking for.\nAn interesting way to look at this is the analogy of baseball. A player might only hit a home run every so often. Now imagine that player starts hitting home runs twice as often or more and his hits go further on average. You\u2019d think he was on steroids. That\u2019s what going on with the climate. Normally we\u2019d expect a record year every so often, but the frequency and intensity of hot years is definitely predicted to increase as the globe warms.\nRight now it\u2019s 81, average is 42. As I told my students \u201cWelcome to your future!\u201d\n21.\nThanks, Phil \u2013 always nice to have proactive measures for those who deny HIRGO. :/\n22.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 3:02 pm\n@4 Mark\nI don\u2019t have a car. All my transportation is done by bicycle or public transportation. Easy to do. Besides the environmental impact, also the savings from not having to pay for gas, auto insurance, a car, and maintenance. I recently got a flat tire. A new inner tube and a patch kit cost $10. Try fixing a car flat for that price! Also there is a $20/month tax credit for bicycle commuters. Check into it.\n23.\nI love the evolution of the denier\u2019s arguments:\na) There is no Global Warming. It is a conspiracy to wipe out capitalist society.\nb) There is no global warming. It is a conspiracy among scientists to get funding.\nc) OK, there may be some global warming, but it\u2019s a natural occurrence.\nd) OK, there may be some global warming, and it may be man-made, but it is actually good for us.\ne) OK, there may be global warming, it may be man-made and it may be bad for us. But the Chinese are worse than we are.\nf) (See Ed Bala\u2019s comment above): OK, it\u2019s all real, but the liberals aren\u2019t doing enough to stop it, so we don\u2019t have to do anything at all.\n24.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 3:54 pm\nEd Bala (#19):\nEverything we can do to mitigate our personal contribution to the rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentration certainly helps, but it is a drop in the bucket to what is contributed by global energy generation and ground transportation. What we really need to do is change the way we generate electricity to primarily use renewables, and then use that clean electricity to power our ground transportation.\nNice bit of uninformed fear mongering there. We noticed.\n25.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 4:01 pm\nEd Bala said:\nI\u2019ll begin to give a rat\u2019s behind about AGW when you alarmists start putting YOUR money where your mouths are and stop running around crying about the climate.\nUnderstood\u2026.also understood is that this is the use of a classic tu quoque fallacy.\nThe truth or falsity of AGW does not reside in the behaviors of the various sides of the issue.\n26.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 4:23 pm\nThe fundemental reason why many do not buy into the AGW notion is that the data does not and has not followed the computer models for doubling of Co2 and tropospheric temperature increase.\nClimate history did not start in 1979 (satellite era)and the warmers that have rewrote history to minimize the past warm periods aren\u2019t helping their cause.\nIt should be on the front of everyone\u2019s mind, that climatology is an infant science category and the knowledge gained is minimal, especially when we cannot see the phsical & magnetic interactions between the troposphere and the sphereas above (Mesosphere, stratosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere etc..)\nIf past, present and future observations followed the computer models and general theory of a doubling of Co2, the scientists would not need a way or special voice to promote AGW. Because the planetary climate has not and will not follow the theory, man needs to look much closer at the other 326 I/P\u2019s to the modelling (which they don\u2019t & won\u2019t use), which have been avoided in favor of Co2.\nWhen you jump to one theoretical conclusion right off the bat, you\u2019ll most certainly have issues explaining why the models aren\u2019t following the real conditions.\nWe have more ice in our cryosphere than the mid 1970\u2032s, yet no one reports it?\nThe prospective sea level rise isn\u2019t ocurring because the tropospheric currents are depositing the moisture on land and as several scientists speculated in the late 70\u2032s; the planet will most likely warm to a tippiing point that is the beginning of the next glacial period, just like the planet has seen before when temperatures rose, followed by the increase in Co2.\n27.\n@Ed Bala:\nWhat Steve Metzler and tmac57 said.\nThere is also this: Even those who, for whatever reason, don\u2019t cut back their own carbon footprint can help lower global CO2 emissions by supporting politicians who understand the problem and will enact sensible policies. (Politicians of the type we in the U.S. don\u2019t have too many of right now.)\nAnd as for your implication that doing anything about global warming would require drastic changes in lifestyle, to the point of giving up modern technology and living in caves \u2014 you\u2019re wrong.\nThat\u2019s what really galls me about this whole business: the fact that you and your ilk (like \u201cMeme Mine\u201d above) continually call us fearmongers, when they are the ones raising the truly fearful prospects \u2014 saying that we want to \u201cdestroy the economy\u201d or \u201ccurtail personal liberty\u201d. Those arguments are nothing but straw men, intended to scare people into doing nothing to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n28.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 4:49 pm\n@14 ctj\nThere are plots of global maps of temperature change around since the averages come from global data compilations. For example for the new HadCRUT4 reconstruction see the RealClimate.org post http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/03/updating-the-cru-and-hadcrut-temperature-data/#more-10784\nThey show a comparison figure for HadCRUT3 & HadCRUT4 (taken from the Jones et al JGR paper), where you can see where there is data (better coverage in 4 but still gaps in South America and Africa) and what the regional variation is like (e.g. more warming in arctic Canada than continental US).\n29.\n@26, Chris -\nYou make a good point about the hypocrisy intrinsic to the fearmongering claims.\nGet over it, people.

What are the other two?\n42.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 9:55 pm\nThe two most important things that have come out of this new database: 1) the Earth is still warming up, and at the same rate as has been determined before, and 2) (according to a BBC report) 1998 is no longer the warmest year on record. 2010 is. (Emphasis added.)\nActually, I thought that according to NASA\u2019s data 2010 had been known as the hottest year ever \u2013 equal with 2005 \u2013 for, well, years? (Or one and a bit year anyhow.)\nSee the NASA press release linked to my name here \u2013 posted by them on the 12th of January 2011.\nLast year was the hottest La Nina year on record, the year before was the hottest year ever on record, almost all of the top ten hottest years occurred in the past decade, yeah not much sign of Human Induced Rapid Global Overheating (HIRGO) there \u2013 NOT!\nBTW. I\u2019m very curious to know when the last \u201ctop ten\u201d *coldest* years on record was and what / when are /were they? Does anyone anywhere have a list of all the years of recorded climate data in temperature order either hottest to coldest or vice versa to share here? Please?\n43.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 10:23 pm\nI object to the stretching of the definition of denialist to cover people who don\u2019t deny AGW, but seriously feel that stopping it is not possible for societal reasons.\nI think AGW is real and awful, but, with human psychology and world politics being what they are, there is very little we can do about it\u2026I mean seriously, do you really, in your most sober moments, watching the news, think that our current world political system can negotiate and compromise enough to make the changes needed?\nSeems to me that the only real way to STOP AGW is truly omnipotent world government that simply orders people do do what is needed with no regard for freedom or choice. Which I feel wouldn\u2019t last long even if it were put in place\u2026shortsighted humanity would overthrow it so they could have their SUVs and hamburgers.\nI do not deny AGW is happening, but I think we should be making plans for whatever amelioration we can do to blunt the effects instead of wasting time passing multiple agreements that go nowhere because they can\u2019t be enforced. Only after the effects start killing or displacing large numbers of people will efforts to slow it or stop it have any backing among the majority of the population of the planet. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality, but I think we have to face it.\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying we do nothing, I\u2019m saying we start making plans for dealing with the disaster that seems to be way past the tipping point. And who knows, when people start seeing the lifeboats being readied, maybe they\u2019ll start paying attention to the state of the ship.\n44.\nMarch 21st, 2012 at 10:26 pm\nWhat are the other two?\nGISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) which can be found at NASA\u2019s website, and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) which is run by NOAA.

Can you clarify?\nSee :\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-stopped-in-1998.htm\nPlus click on my name for another good youtube clip on the \u201cno warming since 1998\u2033 canard.\nIn essence, no.

Unfortunately there are still some climate contrarians who insist Global Overheating is NOT occurring even today although its also true that many of them have moved on to deny its our fault (which science shows it clearly is) or that its bad (although its consequences are already proving negative in a lot of ways for a lot of people and the negatives will wa-aay outweigh the positives) or that its going to be more costly to fix than allow to happen. (Economists and scientists argue that\u2019s not the case.) There are many \u201cstrains\u201d of Climate Contrarian thinking but one major one still prevalent still insists the whole issue is a scientific hoax.\nThat is a fact of this world, and has happened before, and will happen again.\nNot quite. Earth has been through some extremes and hothouse and snowball eras before but never anything quite like this caused in quite this way. See this :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5hs4KVeiAU\nExcellent youtube clip from Potholer54 that deals with that notion. This is NOT natural climate change. Part of an excellent series on this topic all of which are well worth watching in my view.\nIsn\u2019t the controversy that humans have anything to do with or have participated in the current acceleration of global warming, rather than that it may be occurring?\nNot entirely as has been pointed out above \u2013 see also :\nas a good primer on what we do know.\nPlus I\u2019d very strongly recommend watching this concise and clear and accurate clip here :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ob9WdbXx0\nBy the legendary broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough.\nPlus click on my name here for a link showing how the Arctic sea ice in particular is melting much faster than predicted \u2013 so if anything we are probably under-estimating the problem.\nHope this helps.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 1:14 am\nsomeone once told me that it would require everyone making greener living choices and a decent portion of the worlds population to, uhh for lack of a better word, cease to exist for anything to actually improve and that it would only really benefit the future generations.\nSooo i\u2019ve always wanted to ask if that was totally off base or kinda right?!?\n50.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 3:32 am\njem @28:\nthanks! perhaps not as pretty as i\u2019d hoped, but i attribute that to the discrete sampling locations, and i was somewhat surprised at how few cooling spots there were (and not surprised at how the greatest warming seems to be in higher latitudes).\n51.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 3:47 am\nLet\u2019s get past the \u201cis it happening or isn\u2019t it happening\u201d nonsense. A few people lowering their standard of living by driving crappy underpowered cars or pedaling around an urban village isn\u2019t going to have a meaningful impact on CO2 emissions. Fact is we are going to have more people every year. Those people will continue to get richer and consume more material goods, food, and energy.\nWhat is the most cost effective way of dealing with AGW? Cap and Trade is just a wealth redistribution tax. It doesn\u2019t really do anything to help and is incredibly damaging to the world economy. What technology will it take to create a giant thermostat for the planet? Might it be as simple as a few nuclear power plants shooting ocean steam into the upper atmosphere? Reflect a lot of the sunlight away. Cool down the earth.\nHow about investing more in Artificial Intelligence so that we can move manufacturing and food production off of the earth? Let our new cars, ipods, McNuggets parachute into our back yards.\nA big part of the reason that small government supporters don\u2019t trust the AGW claims is because of the proposed solutions. Increasing taxes and decreasing freedom hasn\u2019t proven very effective at fixing problems. And the people who have always supported big government are now obviously hiding behind the green agenda. So how about a REAL solution to the AGW problem, not a political/social coup attempt.\nHairy\n\u201cCap and Trade is just a wealth redistribution tax. It doesn\u2019t really do anything to help and is incredibly damaging to the world economy.\u201d\nCare to justify that casually regurgitated meme?\n53.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 8:11 am\nBut can\u2019t you see the public image problem you keep presenting? \u201cOh, you are having problems with our old data, well look, now we\u2019ve changed it to match what we are trying to tell you.\u201d Not that I disagree with you, but that is a perception. Another problem is people watch TV and see that the Sahara Desert goes from complete desert to lush tropical paradise every 20,000 years (and changes very rapidly over the course of 100-200 years), so there are obviously cycles and yet all the public hears is that \u201crising temperature spells complete doom for our planet.\u201d It is not a science issue, it is a public perception that the scientists need to change if you want people to care. You can\u2019t just keep shouting louder \u201cwe\u2019re right, we\u2019re right\u201d and expect people to listen.

Denialists like to just use the average, conveniently failing to point out that the models were intended from the very beginning to produce a range.\nTo be fair, there are some cases where the measured is outside the range predicted. However, in all of those cases it exceeds the predictions, which means we are underestimating the effects of AGW.\nAnd scientists have looked at all the other known forcings, all of the other forcings combined do not come close to accounting for the warming we see, while human greenhouse gas emissions accounts for almost all of it.\nIt is absurd in its face to claim that scientists are not looking at any other inputs or outputs besides CO2. The models would produce a temperature of absolute zero if sunlight was not included. Heck, the Hansen model that denialists love to attack so much includes a single volcanic eruption (based on the average rate of volcanic eruptions).\nAnd climate science is not new, it dates back to the 1800\u2032s.\n56.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 9:52 am\nTwo points: 1) the planet has been \u201cwarming up\u201d for a couple of hundred years, 2) the HADCRUT4 homogenization does not improve \u201caccuracy in the measurements\u201d as you claim. The historical measurements still have documented inaccuracies and imprecision. Furthermore, the four data sources are \u201cconsistent\u201d because they get the majority of their data from the same sources. Phil, you\u2019re overreaching here trying to make your AGW case. I notice you didn\u2019t mention the flat trend for the last 14 years. How come you accuse others of not telling a complete story when you don\u2019t do so yourself?\n57.\n@ Gary: Are you claiming there has been a statistically significant flat trend in the temperature data over the last 14 years?\n58.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 10:49 am\nWhat it *doesn\u2019t* show (despite the bold and emphatic qualifiers at the end of the article) is acceleration. Any chartist will tell you, stare at a chart long enough and you\u2019ll start to see whatever you *want* to see. The last ~12yr avg actually looks flat. What about the avg *decline* from 42-78? Despite the strong industrial expansion of that time?\nNo, there is no clear corollary between increase and human activity. That is *assumption*.\nCycle with this level of detail back at least 5000 years, and we *might* be able to filter noise for human influence, but it\u2019s far from inarguable at this point.\n59.\nTo everyone saying that nobody denies the world is warming, I present Gary.\n60.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 3:20 pm\nScott @ 58: The plots do show acceleration. The two right-hand-side panels show the speed of warming (\u2018C/decade) for the whole 1901-2010 data-set, and for 1979-2010 only. The latter has a higher speed of warming than the former \u2013 that means acceleration.\nAnd why do you pick 12 years \u2013 because you have a positive spike there, giving you less net warming in that particular period? But the longer a period you look at, the more statistically significant the derived trend will be. That is basic statistics.\nThe decline between 1942-78 has been found to be caused by aerosols, classic pollution, from burning dirty coal \u2013 the stuff that also caused acid rain. That has largely been cleaned up in the West, but China is now producing more of the stuff. That will provide cooling too, masking the underlying increased greenhouse effect, but I don\u2019t know by how much.\nOn top of the exponentially warming trend we also have a slight 11year oscillation from the solar cycles (visibly, small, accounted for, and has nothing to do with the observed exponential warming that follows our emissions of CO2), and the stronger circa 5yr oscillation of el Nino/La Nina cycles.\nIt is all accounted for and that is what makes anthropogenic climate change such a robust result. And I am sure I am not the only one who wished that wasn\u2019t the case. All the climate scientists I know of, wish they were wrong!\nWith hopes for humanity,\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 4:42 pm\n@ Scott: Even if you are right, which you aren\u2019t (there is a trend over the last ~12 years, for example), you completely ignore that AGW is not a curve-fitting exercise, it is based on fundamental physical principles.\nBeyond the physics, there most certainly is a correlation between the warming and human greenhouse gas emissions (greenhouse gas emissions specifically, not just industrial expansion in general). Not only that, we can tell how much of the warming can be accounted for human greenhouse gas emission.\nYou apparently think \u201cslope\u201d and \u201ccorrolation\u201d are based on guesstimates from a brief glance at a plot. They aren\u2019t, they are specific quantitative results from mathematical analysis. You can\u2019t get them just be eyeballing a single plot.\nYou also apparently have never heard of aerosols. Hint: the reduced warming up to the 1970\u2032s is well understood, there is no mystery there as you would know if you did 30 seconds of research.\n62.\nDaffy @ 23:\nYou beat me to it, but you forgot\ng) OK, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s human-caused, it\u2019s bad, really really bad \u2014 Why the hell didn\u2019t anyone warn us about this before it was too late?\n63.\nMarch 22nd, 2012 at 10:35 pm\n@52.

Chapter 9 titled \u2018\u201dAn Honest, Effective Path\u201d pages 209 -222 and thereabouts in my copy of that book.\nPersonally, it seems clear that the same science and technology that got us into this mess is probably our best chance of getting out of it and that we\u2019llhave to start looking at building many more nucelar reactors \u2013 hopefully safer and better models and perhaps terraforming our own planet aka \u201cgeoengineering\u201d aming other technological mitigation and preventation projects.\nIt is clear that one of the major forces holding us back and preventing us from responding better is the anti-nuclear \u201cgreen\u201d lobby and a lot of the answers that they\u2019ve put forward will not end up working or being implemented in anything like time. International treaties such as Kyoto and summits such as Copenhagen have so far failed miserably to make any significant change.\nThing is, its time we started arguing over and acting creating and working on which solutions \u2013 and we\u2019ll no doubt use more than just one or two \u2013 we adopt rather than bickering over whetehr we even have a problem which the experts and observations show us beyond reasonable doubt we do have.

Fact is we are going to have more people every year. Those people will continue to get richer and consume more material goods, food, and energy.\nOr will they? If something cannot be sustained it cannot be sustained and we may find that the economists refusal to accept ecological reality is pretty disastrous costing us many more things than just money.\nWe may \u2013 if we\u2019re not smart and don\u2019t act strongly now \u2013 be headed for a major crash in both population and standard of living.\nWhat is the most cost effective way of dealing with AGW? Cap and Trade is just a wealth redistribution tax. It doesn\u2019t really do anything to help and is incredibly damaging to the world economy. What technology will it take to create a giant thermostat for the planet? Might it be as simple as a few nuclear power plants shooting ocean steam into the upper atmosphere? Reflect a lot of the sunlight away. Cool down the earth. How about investing more in Artificial Intelligence so that we can move manufacturing and food production off of the earth? Let our new cars, ipods, McNuggets parachute into our back yards.\nSee my comment above #63 (22nd March , 2012 at 10:35 pm) I doubt it will be that easy but yeah, we\u2019re going tohave toapply our intelligence and our technology and the greens plans suchas tokenistic lifestyle changes, internationaltreatie sand cap\u2019n'tradee are unlikely to be anywhere near enough. I think a mixture of approaches is going to be needed.\nA big part of the reason that small government supporters don\u2019t trust the AGW claims is because of the proposed solutions. Increasing taxes and decreasing freedom hasn\u2019t proven very effective at fixing problems. And the people who have always supported big government are now obviously hiding behind the green agenda. So how about a REAL solution to the AGW problem, not a political/social coup attempt.\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a politico-social coup attempt or a secret envirnomentalistconspiracy to return socialism to world power or anyof thatsport of conspiracy theory rubbish.\nThing is, the longer we wait to take effective action, the worse the situation will get and the more extreme and drastic the measures necessary to reduce and mitigate the HIRGO problem will become.\nIf you want to minimise social economic and political upheaval then you need, I think, to push for action now not delaying tactics and ignring the issue because if the sooner we take serious actions and start doing things the better off we\u2019ll be and the less severe the situation and counter-measures against it are going to be in the future.\nBut we\u2019re already committed due to thermal and climate inertia to a lot of Global Overheating to come and the sooner we start applying the metaphorical brakes the better and slower the impact will be.\n65.\nMarch 23rd, 2012 at 12:28 am\n@63.

As its feet fall, science prepares the way by finding flat stones to support its weight \u2013 but sometimes this only happens just in time, and it would only take one unprepared footfall to precipitate a screaming plunge to the bottom, where we would all have to start again.\nClimate change represents a mini-slide that has just begun: we have the science to fight it, but our stone path in this case takes us downward for a while and around to another face of the mountain. In its unthinking lust to ascend, the beast has preferred to continue blindly uphill, has chosen not to set its feet on the stones provided, and is beginning to slide, faster and faster, downhill, all the while thinking it is still climbing, as the scree clatters smoothly past like a river.\nUnfortunately, when that happens, we have to throw a rope around its neck for a while and pull it back on course. At that point my free market ideals take a back seat.\n68.\nInteresting. This thread isn\u2019t as heavily infested with teh stupid as it normally would be.

Or, in other words, the fact that the Pope was Catholic?\nSadly yes.\nI\u2019ve told my personal story of arguing this issue before but since you\u2019ve asked nicely I\u2019ll tell relate it one more time below.\nMy personal experience here is as follows :\nI\u2019ve been interested in this issue for ages \u2013 growing up in the late 1980\u2019s I initially felt concerned and alarmed by the Greenhouse Effect (Global Warming) issue.\nSome years later \u2013 after some of the over-hyped predictions from then hadn\u2019t quite materialised \u2013 I encountered the geologist, skeptic and AGW denier Prof. Ian Plimer. I attended a few of Plimer\u2019s lectures against the reality of AGW \u2013 some through an astronomy group. I spoke with him in person \u2013 and he came across very well as a good, sincere bloke who is genuinely committed to science with a valid if un-orthodox perspective. I read Plimer\u2019s book \u2018Heaven + Earth\u2019 which, I can assure you, seems very scholarly and convincing. Thus, yes, I did become very strongly convinced by Plimer\u2019s case there that AGW is bunk.\nWith the zeal of a convert, I then argued this case to others \u2013 incl. & esp. here on the BA blog. In doing so, I had to argue with a number of people who of course, disagreed vigorously and provided evidence against what is was saying. There were a number of passionate arguments with a number of posters over a long time. Very gradually, painfully, I found that what I was now convinced was true wasn\u2019t so much.\nI was convinced that 1998 being the hottest year alone (which okay is what I then thought \u2013 2005 was almost certainly slightly hotter) just about ruled out the notion of dangerous Global Warming on its own \u2013 that we had, in fact, been cooling down over the past decade. I still think it is a major point against AGW and will be happier when we have a much hotter, much more recent record hot year but I\u2019ve had to accept that, yes, it is possible for 1998 or 2005 to have been record hottest years but yet the trend is still going upwards.\nPlus that the selection of 1998 as a starting point is misleading and doesn\u2019t provide the full picture, that 1998 was an outlier and that a decade by decade comparison shows that the last period has indeed been unnaturally hot. Eventually, I had to accept that and acknowledge that the \u20181998 = hottest year thus no AGW\u2019 argument while initially highly convincingly is misleading and wrong.\nI\u2019ve argued it was a natural process, a natural cycle and not caused by humans \u2013 that it\u2019s our Sun or Milankovitch cycles or lack of volcanic eruptions etc .. NOT us. But when you look at the evidence you find that these have been taken into account by the climatologists. That they don\u2019t add up to the full picture.\nThe Sunspot cycle explains and follows our climate pattern to a large extent but then at a point in recent decades the relationship breaks down. The Sun should be causing the climate to cool but instead it warms. Why? The Milankovitch and other natural cycles say we should be cooling down \u2013 but the upwards trend is still there. Why?\nI still think there may be a natural component or two \u2013 that some factors may explain a small part of Global Warming. But it is now clear that these cannot explain *all* or even most the warming. That some natural factors, (eg. the solar cycle) are out of synch with rising planetary temperatures and cannot be the cause of them. That, when everything is taken into account \u2013 & it has been by the climatologist\u2019s involved \u2013 natural processes and cycles are insufficient to cause the warming we have experienced. So I\u2019ve had to acknowledge, slowly and painfully, that yes, Humanity is behind at least a very large percentage of the Global Warming we\u2019ve undergone.\nI\u2019ve also had to acknowledge that the climatologist conspiracy theory doesn\u2019t work. That all these individuals aren\u2019t frauds or charlatans but genuine scientists who have trained and understood the science aren\u2019t all just working a con to gain grants and drive a political agenda. That the climategate emails can be explained as being taken out of context and misinterpreted. It has been very hard to convince me that things like \u201chide the decline\u201d, \u201cwe can\u2019t find the warming and it\u2019s a travesty we can\u2019t\u201d & \u201cdon\u2019t tell them England has a Freedom of Information request\u201d don\u2019t have the obvious negative readings they seem to have. That these don\u2019t add up to a disproof of the science of AGW & a proof of conspiracy. I\u2019ve had to face the reality eventually that the science is solid despite some nasty leaked emails. The words used by a few have been overblown, cherry-picked and taken to mean things that they just don\u2019t.\nI still wish there was an enquiry or two more \u2013 and more visible independent from the bodies involved with more clearly neutral judges. I still think some of the content of the emails is disturbing and that the CRU scientists are far from above reproach. For instance, I think the \u201cchange the meaning of peer review\u201d attempt \u2013 which I now get was NOT actually successful \u2013 was still a deplorable and disgraceful thing to say that reflects very badly on the individuals involved. That the threat to delete emails and the loss of raw data is very worrying.\nI am a huge believer in science needing to be open to scrutiny and that information should be made public and available for everyone to see. But I now accept that this doesn\u2019t invalidate the whole science itself. That the rising temperatures, the melting glaciers, the biological indicators all point conclusively to undeniable evidence that our planet is indeed warming.\nI\u2019ve also, perhaps most painfully had to accept that Ian Plimer\u2019s book is NOT an entirely valid and comprehensive and conclusive disproof of AGW. A couple of posters here have pointed me to a number of reviews that show instead that it is badly flawed and not what it seems. Plimer isn\u2019t telling the whole story at best. He comes across as very sincere and armed with compelling evidence all well sourced and cited but a lot of things in the book are wrong or misinterpreted. A lot of the studies he cites don\u2019t mean what he claims they mean & the arguments made in his book don\u2019t actually stand up to further scrutiny \u2013 as I\u2019ve noted in the paragraphs above.\nThere\u2019s more I could say, these are just some of the main points.\n(First written circa August 2010.)\nAnd now you believe in HIRGO, which means what?\nHuman Induced Rapid Global Overheating. Because \u201cwarming\u201d is a deceptively mild sounding word for what\u2019s happening and \u201canthropogenic\u201d is a technical weasel word.\nThat we are heading towards a climate doomsday if we don\u2019t repent our sinful carbon-emitting ways?\nRepentence won\u2019t do anything. Taking action may reduce the scope and severity of the problem. Our ways aren\u2019t \u201csinful\u201d \u2013 the concept of \u201csin\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly apply here \u2013 but they do have predictable negative consequences. Because that\u2019s what the science and observable evidence is showing us.\n76.\n"}, {"score": 746.9713, "uuid": "92c0ad32-33d2-52c7-9d8e-c7ceffa5a578", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500tw-06-13462", "target_hostname": "tatoott1009.com", "target_uri": "http://tatoott1009.com/2012/02/28/7265/", "page_rank": 1.328588e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Mind Control HAARP\u2013 <em>What</em> <em>is</em> HAARP <em>IS</em> HAARP Dangerous HAARP <em>and</em> Weather", "snippet": "<em>The</em> radio spectrum from 100 kHz to 1 GHz <em>is</em> being <em>recorded</em> to determine frequency of usage <em>and</em> to monitor HAARP transmissions to ensure adherence to FCC <em>and</em> NTIA requirements.", "explanation": null, "document": "Mind Control HAARP\u2013 What is HAARP IS HAARP Dangerous HAARP and Weather\u00a0Control.\nHAARP Fact Sheet\nWhat Is HAARP?\nThe High frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is a program focused on the study of upper atmospheric and solar-terrestrial physics and Radio Science. The HAARP program operates a major Arctic ionosphere research facility on an Air Force owned site near Gakona, Alaska. Principal instruments installed at the HAARP Research Station include a high power, high-frequency (HF) phased array radio transmitter (known as the Ionosphere Research Instrument (IRI), used to stimulate small, well-defined volumes of ionosphere, and a large and diversified suite of modern geophysical research instruments including an HF ionosonde, ELF and VLF receivers, magnetometers, riometers, a UHF diagnostic radar and optical and infrared spectrometers and cameras which are used to observe the complex natural variations of Alaska\u2019s ionosphere as well as to detect artificial effects produced by the IRI. Future plans include completion of the UHF radar to allow measurement of electron densities, electron and ion temperatures, and Doppler velocities in the stimulated region and in the natural ionosphere using incoherent scatter techniques.\nIs HAARP Unique?\nIonosphere research facilities have been in continuous use since the 1950s to investigate fundamental physical principles which govern the earth\u2019s ionosphere, so that present and future transmission technologies may take into account the complexities of this highly variable medium. In addition to HAARP, the United States has operated two other ionosphere research sites in recent years, one in Puerto Rico, near the Arecibo Observatory, and the other (known as HIPAS) in Alaska near Fairbanks. Both of these facilities were built with both active and passive radio instrumentation similar to those at the HAARP facility. Interest in the ionosphere is not limited to the US: a five-country consortium operates the European Incoherent Scatter Radar site (EISCAT), a premier ionosphere research facility located in northern Norway near Tromso. Facilities also are located at Jicamarca, Peru; near Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod (\u201cSURA\u201d) and Apatity, Russia; near Kharkov, Ukraine and in Dushanbe, Tadzhikistan. All of these installations have as their primary purpose the study of the ionosphere, and most employ the capability of stimulating to a varying degree small, localized regions of the ionosphere in order to study methodically, and in a detailed manner what nature produces randomly and regularly on a much larger scale. HAARP is unique to most existing facilities due to the combination of a research tool which provides electronic beam steering, wide frequency coverage and high effective radiated power collocated with a diverse suite of scientific observational instruments.\nWho is Building HAARP?\nTechnical expertise and procurement services as required for the management, administration and evaluation of the program are being provided cooperatively by the Air Force (Air Force Research Laboratory), the Navy (Office of Naval Research and Naval Research Laboratory), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Since the HAARP facility consists of many individual items of scientific equipment, both large and small, there is a considerable list of commercial, academic and government organizations which are contributing to the building of the facility by developing scientific diagnostic instrumentation and by providing guidance in the specification, design and development of the IRI. BAE Advanced Technologies (BAEAT) is the prime contractor for the design and construction of the IRI. Other organizations which have contributed to the program include the University of Alaska, Stanford University, Cornell University, University of Massachusetts, UCLA, MIT, Dartmouth University, Clemson University, Penn State University, University of Tulsa, University of Maryland, SRI International, Northwest Research Associates, Inc., and Geospace, Inc.\nWhat is the Value of Ionosphere Research?\nThe ionosphere begins approximately 35 miles above the earth\u2019s surface and extends out beyond 500 miles. In contrast to the dense atmosphere close to the earth, which is composed almost entirely, of neutral gas, the thin ionosphere contains both neutral gas and a small number of charged particles known as ions and electrons. This ionized medium can distort, reflect and absorb radio signals, and thus can affect numerous civilian and military communications, navigation, surveillance and remote sensing systems in many varied ways. For example, the performance of a satellite-to-ground communication link is affected by the ionosphere through which the signals pass. AM broadcast programs, which in the daytime can be heard only within a few tens of miles from the station, at night sometimes can be heard hundreds of miles away, due to the change from poor daytime to good nighttime reflection from the ionosphere. A long-range HF communication link which uses multiple hops or reflections from the ionosphere and ground, often experiences amplitude fading caused by interference between signals which have traveled from the transmitter to the receiver by two (or more) different ionosphere paths.\nSince the sun\u2019s radiation creates and maintains the ionosphere, sudden variations in this radiation such as those caused by solar flares can affect the performance of radio systems. Sometimes these natural changes are sufficient to induce large transient currents in electric power transmission grids, causing widespread power outages. Lightning is known to cause substantial heating and ionization density enhancement in the lower ionosphere, and there are indications that ground-based HF transmitters, including radars and strong radio stations, also modify the ionosphere and influence the performance of systems whose radio paths traverse the modified region. Perhaps the most famous example of the latter is the \u201cLuxembourg\u201d effect, first observed in 1933. In this case a weak Swiss radio station appeared to be modulated with signals from the powerful Luxembourg station, which was transmitting at a completely different frequency. Music from the Luxembourg station was picked up at the frequency of the Swiss station.\nThe continual growth in the number of civilian and military satellite systems whose performances can be affected by changes in ionosphere conditions stimulates research on characterizing and understanding those effects, whether they be natural (solar related) or the result of controlled local modification of the ionosphere, using ground HF transmitters. The HAARP facility is capable of supporting research in both these areas of interest, by utilizing its flexible HF transmitting array and its suite of radio and optical diagnostic instruments for active experimental research. Effectively, the diagnostic instruments alone constitute a space-weather observatory (on the ground), which provides real-time data on the state of the dynamic ionosphere over much of Alaska.\nWhy is the DoD Involved?\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) conducts Arctic research to ensure the development of the knowledge, understanding and capability to meet national defense needs in the Arctic. Interest in ionosphere research at HAARP stems both from the large number of communication, surveillance and navigation systems that have radio paths which pass through the ionosphere, and from the unexplored potential of technological innovations which suggest applications such as detecting underground objects, communicating to great depths in the sea or earth, and generating infrared and optical emissions. Expanding our knowledge about the interactions of signals passing through or reflecting from the ionosphere can help to solve future problems in the development of DoD systems, and could as well enhance the utilization of commercial systems which rely on the expedient transfer of real-time communications.\nWhy Gakona, Alaska?\nDuring HAARP\u2019s environmental impact study, Gakona was identified as one of two DoD-owned, Alaskan locations which satisfied the site selection criteria of being within the auroral zone, near a major highway for year-round access, away from densely settled areas and their electrical noise and lights that could interfere with sensitive research measurements, on relatively flat terrain, of realistic and reasonable construction and operation costs, as well as minimal environmental impacts. On October 18, 1993 following the July 15, 1993 issuance of the Air Force\u2019s Environmental Impact Statement which evaluated potential environmental effects of constructing and operating the HAARP facility, a Record of Decision (ROD) signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations selected Gakona as the location for the HAARP facility.\nLocation of the HAARP Facility\nThe access road is located at Milepost 11.3 on the Tok highway. The geographic coordinates of the HF antenna array are approximately 62.39 degrees (North) latitude, 145.15 degrees (West) longitude. The geomagnetic coordinates for the facility are 63.09 degrees (North) latitude and 92.44 degrees (West) longitude.\nWhat is the IRI and what does it transmit?\nBasically, the IRI is what is known as a phased array transmitter. It is designed to transmit a narrow beam of high power radio signals in the 2.8 to 10 MHz frequency range. Its antenna is built on a gravel pad having dimensions of 1000\u2032 x 1200\u2032 (about 33 acres). There are 180 towers, 72\u2032 in height mounted on thermopiles spaced 80\u2032 apart in a 12 x 15 rectangular grid. Each tower supports near its top, two pairs of crossed dipole antennas, one for the low band (2.8 to 8.3 MHz), the other for the high band (7 to 10 MHz). The antenna system is surrounded by an exclusion fence to prevent possible damage to the antenna towers or harm to large animals. An elevated ground screen, attached to the towers at the 15\u2032 level, acts as a reflector for the antenna array while allowing vehicular access underneath to 30 environmentally-controlled transmitter shelters spaced throughout the array. Each shelter contains 6 pairs of 10 kW transmitters, for a total of 6 x 30 x 2 x 10 kW = 3600 kW available for transmission. The transmitters can be switched to drive either the low or high band antennas. Electric prime power is provided from an on-site power plant housing five, 2500 kW generators, each driven by a 3600 hp diesel engine. Four generators are required for operation of the IRI and the fifth is held as a spare. From a control room within the Operations Center, the transmission from each of the 180 crossed-dipole antennas is adjusted in a precise manner under computer control. In this manner, the complete array of antennas forms a narrow antenna pattern pointed upward toward the ionosphere. The transmitted signal diverges (spreads out) as it travels upward and is partially absorbed, at an altitude which depends on the transmitted HF frequency, in a small volume several tens of miles in diameter and a few hundred meters thick directly over the facility. The remainder of the transmitted signal either reflects back toward the earth or passes through the ionosphere into space, continuing to diverge as it does so. By the time it reaches the ionosphere, the intensity of the HF signal is less than 3 microwatts (0.000003 watt) per cm2, thousands of times less than the Sun\u2019s natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less, even, than the variations in intensity of the Sun\u2019s natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere.\nHow safe are these transmissions?\nBecause the antenna pattern of the IRI array has been tailored to transmit its signal upward rather than toward the horizon, radio field strengths at ground level, including areas directly under the antenna array, are calculated to be smaller than Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) standards allow for human exposure. This is possible because the individual transmitters are spaced apart over 33 acres so that the concentration of radio fields never exceeds these nationally recognized safety standards. Electromagnetic field strength measurements have been made throughout the development of the facility, beginning in 1994 and regularly thereafter. Measurements on the ground, directly under and around the array and at multiple points on-site and off-site have verified compliance with RFR standards as well as with all requirements for safety mandated in the EIS Record of Decision. At the point of closest public access on the Tok Highway, for example, the measured fields are ten-thousand times smaller than permitted by the RFR standards and hundreds of times smaller than typically found near AM broadcast station antennas in many urban areas. The strength of these fields continues to decrease in a rapid manner at greater distances from the facility.\nWhat about aircraft?\nWhile the signals along the ground are well-below adopted safety levels, the signals transmitted above the antenna array may have sufficient strength to interfere with electronic equipment in aircraft flying nearby. Therefore, to ensure the safety of all flight operations in the vicinity of HAARP, the facility employs an aircraft alert radar (AAR) to automatically shut off appropriate transmissions when aircraft are detected either within or approaching a defined safety zone around the facility. Flight tests are conducted regularly to demonstrate the capability of the HAARP radar to detect even very small targets. Research operations are not conducted unless the AAR is operating satisfactorily.\nWhat is the potential for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)?\nEvery radio transmitting facility has the potential to interfere with other radio spectrum users. To determine the potential for HAARP\u2019s transmissions to interfere inadvertently with other spectrum users such as Alaskan TV, AM/FM radio, ham radio, or even with HAARP\u2019s own sensitive radio receiving equipment, a comprehensive RFI study was conducted during the environmental impact study phase. Theory predicted that in several worst-case scenarios, interference may be encountered by some nearby users sharing the RF spectrum. On the other hand, the real world experiences of similar ionosphere research instruments and radar diagnostics employed elsewhere in the world have shown that compatible operations are practical. Included in HAARP\u2019s Spectrum Certification from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are commitments to a mitigation program that includes the use of state-of-the-art transmitters with stringent requirements for minimizing out-of-band transmissions; proper orientation of the HF antenna array and adoption of operating procedures, including beam steering, to minimize array side-lobes; employing special techniques such as waveform shaping, filtering and antenna null placement; and working with affected spectrum users, if any, to reach mutually agreeable solutions. A local phone number (907) 822-5497 permits anyone believing they have interference from HAARP to contact the Gakona site operations center. In addition, an automated spectrum monitor is installed to allow the HAARP control operator to monitor nearby spectrum usage to assist in frequency selection for avoiding potential interference.\nWhat is the RFI Resolution Advisory Committee?\nThe Record of Decision stipulated than an RFI Resolution Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) would be formed with local representation, to help mitigate potential RFI issues. The local community-appointed resident would serve as an ombudsman to ensure community satisfaction with the RFI mitigation approaches undertaken by HAARP. The purpose of the Committee is to provide a forum for the thorough review of confirmed RFI reports. This Committee has met at least yearly since December 6, 1994. Committee members are from the following organizations (one from each): Community-appointed resident, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), ALASCOM, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., American Radio Relay League (ARRL), Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Fish & Wildlife (Federal), Fish & Game (State), National Park Service, HAARP Environmental Liaison Officer, HAARP operational staff (site supervisor or delegate), HAARP Program-appointed chairperson, National Park Service, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and the combined Alaska military command (ALCOM) frequency coordinator.\nTo ensure that all concerns, including aircraft safety as well as radio frequency interference issues, are addressed completely, a Developmental Prototype (DP) was completed in 1994. The DP consisted of a 6 x 8 (48 antenna element) array of crossed dipole antennas. A 3 x 6 (18 antenna elements) subset of these antennas was energized by 18 pairs of 10 kW transmitters contained in three separate shelters, thus supplying up to a maximum of 360 kW. Prime power for this initial array was obtained from three portable 350 kW diesel generators.\nDuring 1998, the DP was upgraded to include transmitters for all 48 of the antenna elements that were originally installed. This Filled Developmental Prototype (FDP) was capable of producing 960 kW of total transmitter power. Measurements of the HF fields in the vicinity of the FDP antenna array showed that field intensities everywhere, including within the FDP beam, were below recommended international safety limits for fly-by-wire aircraft. Nonetheless, the FDP was only operated in conjunction with the aircraft alert radar, to insure that no high power transmissions occurred when there was local flight traffic. Operation and test of the FDP verified the system engineering design and helped develop interference mitigation procedures that are now integrated into all research operations involving the IRI.\nHAARP Diagnostics\nHAARP has developed an extensive set of diagnostic instrumentation to support ionosphere research at auroral latitudes, to characterize the processes produced in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere by high power radio waves and to assess the potential of emerging ionosphere/radio technology for DoD applications. While some of these scientific instruments are collocated with the IRI at the research facility, others, due to geometrical considerations, are located off-site at various distances from the facility. One of the primary active on-site instruments is the HF ionosonde, which transmits in the 1-30 MHz band and is used to provide scientists with information about the electron density profile in the ionosphere. Another is the UHF ionosphere radar which transmits radio wave signals in the 430 \u2013 450 MHz band and which will eventually be expanded to provide incoherent scatter capability.\nAmong the passive on-site instruments are two magnetometers for the measurement of the earth\u2019s magnetic field and its variations, and two riometers (relative ionosphere opacity meter) to sense ionosphere absorption of the celestial background electromagnetic radiation. The radio spectrum from 100 kHz to 1 GHz is being recorded to determine frequency of usage and to monitor HAARP transmissions to ensure adherence to FCC and NTIA requirements. Other passive on-site instruments include sensitive optical imagers and photometers, ELF/VLF receivers, and Total Electron Content receivers. Data obtained from these scientific instruments are readily accessible on the internet in near real time, allowing scientists to observe and participate in the investigations directly from their laboratories. In addition to the instruments specifically developed by HAARP, a number of diagnostics potentially are available through other federal agencies and the University of Alaska\u2019s Geophysical Institute.\nUse of Local Resources\nThe Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) has played a major role in the development of diagnostics and coordination of Arctic programs with the US scientific community. UAF led a consortium of universities and industries which provided support in the design and development of the Gakona facility and its associated scientific instruments. BAE Advanced Technologies, the prime contractor for the IRI, utilized Eric Goozen for initial site survey work. Ahtna Construction, Inc., a Glennallen based contractor, has contributed very extensively to the development of the facility. Ahtna currently provides housekeeping and security services. Anchorage-based engineering firms Duane Miller & Associates and USKH prepared the civil and pad design work and conducted the on-site testing and evaluation. Arctic Foundation of Anchorage designed and manufactured, and Kiewit Pacific Company installed thermopiles in the pad, using Amtec, Inc. to survey the thermopile locations and Tester Drilling and EBA Engineering to provide drilling support. Acme Fence Company installed fencing, using the services of Mark Lappi to survey the fence lines and B&B Plumbing to steam thaw the ground for drilling. City Electric, Inc. erected the towers, antennas, and ground screen. Pacific Detroit Diesel and Valley Diesel refurbished and installed the 2.5 MW diesel generators which are used to power the HF transmitters. Service Oil provides fuel oil. Copper Valley Telephone installed the telephone lines, and Copper Valley Electric supplies commercial housekeeping power. Bishop & Sons Enterprises supplies water, while CBS Service provides trash removal and sewage disposal. Harley McMahon flew sorties to test the capabilities of the aircraft alert radar and provide the opportunity for aerial photography.\nCurrent/Future Operations at the HAARP Research Facility\nConstruction of the full IRI was completed in early 2007. In the near term, emphasis is being placed on validating the performance of the complete IRI to include compliance with all specifications for interference mitigation and safety of operations. Initial IRI testing began during March 2007.\nBoth on- and off-site scientific, observational instruments are now providing data on the natural high latitude ionosphere. A complete listing of these scientific instruments is available.\nEnvironmental Process\nIn accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluated the consequences of constructing and operating the HAARP research facility in Alaska. The EIS discusses impacts on such diverse topics as electromagnetic and radio frequency interference, vegetation, wetlands, wildlife, air quality, subsistence, cultural resources, atmosphere and others.\nState and federal environmental regulatory agencies were consulted to identify issues, and additional input was solicited from the public during scoping meetings held in Anchorage and Glennallen, Alaska in August 1992. A draft of the EIS was prepared and distributed to the public and to specific organizations on March 12, 1993. Public hearings were held in Glennallen and Anderson, municipalities close to the sites under consideration. The final EIS was released to the public on July 15, 1993 and the Record of Decision selecting Gakona, Alaska as the site for the HAARP Ionosphere Research Facility was signed on October 18, 1993.\nIn addition to the NEPA process described above, the HAARP facility complies with all applicable state and federal regulations that are appropriate for its construction and operation.\nAdditional Information\nAn updated version of this fact sheet will be issued as often as program changes warrant to keep interested parties appraised of significant developments in regard to HAARP.

It took two attempts to finally reach the cold, windy summit.\nEven though the mountain is only 6,288 feet in elevation, it boasts the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet at 231 mph (in 1934). You start the hike at the base of the mountain, which is around 1,000 feet, so there\u0092s a mile of elevation gain.\nOn Aug. 20, 1982, six of us hikers broke treeline and one gust of wind blew all of us against a big boulder making it hard to even pull a hand away from the cold rock. I glanced at the others with a bit of apprehension. If it was this bad here, what would it be like on the summit of Mount Washington, only a few miles away?\nThe strong gusts suddenly changed to steady winds and the fog made the scene even more eerie. We could actually see the wind blow up one side of the ridge and get sucked right down the other side. We couldn\u0092t take a step without losing our balance. As we continued to climb higher up the ridge, the wind grew steadily worse, and the packs on our backs didn\u0092t help matters any. We were experiencing the severe and unpredictable weather of the New Hampshire\u0092s Presidential Range that all hikers on the Appalachian Trail hear so much about.\nThis was one of the many new and exciting experiences encountered since I stood atop Springer Mountain, Ga., over four months and 1,800 miles earlier. The Appalachian Trail \u0096 a name that had always fascinated me since childhood. A 2,100-mile-long trail from Georgia to Maine passing through 14 states, eight national forests and two national parks. Now, I was only 300 miles away from making my dream come true. But we had to get over this mountain.\nWe wanted so bad to continue. The summit was within reach but we had about 1,000 feet more in elevation to climb. At times we had to hold onto each other as we were really getting blown around. Finally, we all agreed that we\u0092d better bail out. We passed the Sphinx Trail a couple of hundred yards back, so we did a 180 and literally ran for it. We reached the trail in a few minutes and headed down into the Great Gulf Wilderness.\nIn the Presidentials, there are several of these \u0093bail-out\u0094 trails. If hikers are ever out on an exposed ridge and the weather starts looking bad, they can take one of these escape routes. Like the old saying goes, \u0093Better to be safe than sorry.\u0094 The combination of extreme wind, fog, wet and cold have dubbed Mount Washington the \u0093Home of the World\u0092s Worst Weather\u0094 and one of \u0093America\u0092s 10 Most Dangerous Hikes\u0094.\nThe Sphinx Trail is an extremely steep trail, but it does get you off the ridge in a hurry. We heard that the winds on Washington that day were over 70 mph, plus there were suppose to be thunderstorms so it\u0092s a good thing we didn\u0092t continue.\nOn Aug. 22, three of us decided to make another attempt for the summit via Tuckerman Ravine. The morning started with clear blue sky in the valley, but a cloudbank hung over Mount Washington, giving us a foreboding feeling as if the mountain was saying, \u0093Come on up and take your chances.\u0094\nAs we climbed, summer turned into winter. At Hermit Lake Shelter we changed into full winter gear and started up the headwall. There were still big chunks of ice and snow remaining from last winter, and even though it was still August, winter was just around the bend again for this area. Tuckerman Ravine is a famous ski area and can accumulate up to 100 feet of snow and keep people skiing into June.\nAs we reached the top of the headwall, we entered into the fog bank. The temperature dropped quickly as we climbed and the wind picked up. And this was the leeward side of the mountain. Rime ice covered all the rocks and it gave me such a desolate feeling. It resembled a windblown tundra. Actually there is permafrost at the summit along with arctic flora resembling that of northern Labrador.\nLittle white crosses attest to the fact of Mount Washington\u0092s bad weather. Each one marks the area where someone died of exposure on the mountain. In 1982, that number reached 100. Since then the number has grown to almost 140 fatalities on the mountain; most died of exposure in the summer (for comparison, over 220 people have died attempting to climb Mount Everest).\nMost of those who died from severe weather on Washington did so in the summer. For example, Aug. 22 was a nice summer day in the valleys. The temperature down below was probably in the 60s or 70s. However, at the summit it was the coldest day of the summer yet. The weather station recorded a temperature of 27 degrees and -15 degrees with the wind chill. The winds that day hit 74 mph and there were three inches of snow the night before.\nWe started out the day in just a pair of shorts and a polypropylene top but had to put on long johns, wool pants, sweater, pile jacket, wool hat and gloves. If we tried to make it to the summit in a pair of shorts and a shirt, there would probably be three more little white crosses on the mountain.\nWhen we reached the parking lot at the summit, my brother Frank spotted a \u0093No Hitch-hiking\u0094 sign and wanted me to pose in front of it. I about froze my hand off as he fiddled around with his camera and I stood there gloveless. A chain-linked fence at the weather station had ice hanging all over it.

What will the aftershocks be like in the hours and days after the hour? How will it be for the 3 1/2 yr as Nibiru completes its orbit and then heads back? Will the last year of it heading back compare with the last year before it got in - or are the space friends holding us into seasons and that won't happen again? And what about the second pass and years following?\nWe have stated that the return of Planet X is done at a more sedate pace, so that it is not zooming into the inner solar system and then suddenly putting on the brakes. On the first pass, it has come from its essential dither point between the Sun and its second foci, the Sun's binary, so has traveled, suddenly, a longer distance than it does on the return trip. When Planet X is that the dither point , it is some 9.37 Sun-Pluto distances away, but when it is at the turn-around point before its return passage, it is only 3.6 Sun-Pluto distances away. These distances are traveled in a few short years, and high speed is attained on the first pass, rivaling what humans term the speed of light. Of course the speed of light is not the fastest pace physical matter can travel, as there is little friction in space. This speed is not attained on the second pass, the return trip. Why is it that the past few pole shifts, notable in the memory of man as the Flood and the Jewish Exodus, do not include devastation from a second pass? This is because the return trip does not bring Planet X into the orbit of Earth, nor does it create a lingering passage as the first pass does, a slow creep past the Sun. It thus does not lose momentum, and leaves the solar system rapidly. However, its presence during the years following its first pass, during its return pass, and for some years after will not be without impact on the shattered Earth. But the minor tugging that occurs will go unnoticed by the survivors, who will be dealing with aftershocks from the time of the first passage, a magnetic core swirling about and trying to stabilize, and the everyday concerns about simply feeding and caring for survivors. Planet X will not be your concern.\nhttp://www.zetatalk3.com/theword/tword26x.htm\nAs the 12th planet finishes its orbital path around the backside of the Sun, it arrives once again in the inner solar system.

The turmoil and magnetic interference in the core of the Earth caused by the 12th planet are always present, as the wanderer moves around the backside of the Sun. At a minimum the Earth, when the 12th planet is at a maximum distance of 3.56 units away from the Sun, receives the same amount of magnetic cross currents during the time frame of Feb. 2003. On this passage, the second encounter, the crust of the Earth does not realign. The 12th planet passes no closer than 100 million miles, compared to 15 million on the first passage. The second passage of the 12th planet to the surprise of many, will be only a minor disruption in the flow of life.\nSivilan said:\nQFZT: I want to ask about the second passage of Planet X.

Also, this does make sense, as I have learned more about this methane and CO2 emissions from plants. But remember this is just first stage of this research, more is required to get accurate info to support this.\nIn a recent study (Nature, 12 January 2006), scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Utrecht University, Netherlands, and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland, UK, revealed that plants produce the greenhouse gas methane. First estimates indicated that this could account for a significant proportion of methane in the atmosphere. There has been extended media coverage of this work with unfortunately, in many instances, a misinterpretation of the findings. Furthermore, the discovery led to intense speculations on the potential relevance of the findings for reforestation programs in the framework of the Kyoto protocol. These issues need to be put in the right perspective.\nThe most frequent misinterpretation we find in the media is that emissions of methane from plants are responsible for global warming. As those emissions from plants are a natural source, they have existed long before man\u2019s influence started to impact upon the composition of the atmosphere. It is the anthropogenic emissions which are responsible for the well-documented increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane since pre-industrial times. Emissions from plants thus contribute to the natural greenhouse effect and not to the recent temperature increase known as \u2018global warming\u2019. Even if land use practices have altered plant methane emissions, which we did not demonstrate, this would also count as an anthropogenic source, and the plants themselves cannot be deemed responsible.\nFurthermore, our discovery led to intense speculation that methane emissions by plants could diminish or even outweigh the carbon storage effect of reforestation programs with important implications for the Kyoto protocol, where such programs are to be used in national carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction strategies. We first stress that our findings are preliminary with regard to the methane emission strength. Emissions most certainly depend on plant type and environmental conditions and more experiments are certainly necessary to quantify the process under natural conditions. As a first rough estimate of the order of magnitude we have taken the global average methane emissions as representative to provide a rough estimate of its potential effect on climate. These estimates show that methane emissions by plants may slightly diminish the effect of reforestation programs. However, the climatic benefits gained through carbon sequestration by reforestation far exceed the relatively small negative effect, which may reduce the carbon uptake effect by up to 4 per cent. Thus, the potential for reduction of global warming by planting trees is most definitely positive. The fundamental problem still remaining is the global large-scale anthropogenic burning of fossil fuels.\n*snip*\n"}], [{"score": 713.83606, "uuid": "0d3fa21e-e6c2-544a-b449-bc28097b8fab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1912wb-34-05167", "target_hostname": "skywatch-media.com", "target_uri": "http://skywatch-media.com/2006_11_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>The</em> Great Red Comet -<em>Earth</em> Science Chronicles: November 2006", "snippet": "They&#x27;ve now broken <em>the</em> RECORD FOR WETTEST MONTH <em>EVER</em> IN SEATTLE, no matter <em>where</em> <em>the</em> rain was <em>recorded</em>. <em>And</em> as so apropos for November, they broke it with <em>the</em> VERY-RARE-for-Seattle freezing rain.", "explanation": null, "document": "Breaking Tropical Storm News: Philippines\nNov 30, 2006\nWeather bureau PAGASA hoisted public storm signal number 4 over four provinces in Bicol as \"super typhoon\" Reming (international codename Durian) threatened the region and other Luzon areas with rains and wind gusts.

You will hardly have the words to talk about this devastation, but I\u2019m sure you will walk around the rubble to make sense of it all.\nSomething similar has happened in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I currently live. Between 2001 and 2005, aerial surveys were conducted over 6.4 million acres of the state. Some 816,000 affected acres were mapped and it was found that during this short period Ips confusus , a tiny bark beetle, had killed 54.5 million of New Mexico\u2019s state tree, the pi\u00f1on. In many areas of northern New Mexico, including Santa Fe, Los Alamos, Espa\u00f1ola, and Taos, 90 percent of mature pi\u00f1ons are now dead.\nUnder normal climate conditions, bark beetles live in harmony with their environment, laying their eggs in dead or weakened trees. However, when healthy trees become stressed from severe and sustained drought, they become objects of attack: the beetles drill into their bark, laying eggs along the way, and killing their host. Milder winter temperatures have ensured more of them survive the winter, and warmer summer temperatures have reduced\nthe life cycle duration of the beetles from two to one year,\nand subsequently their numbers have exploded in recent\nyears.\nOne Robin and two potential bluebird homes\nClick here for an album of Subhankar\u2019s\nforest death photos from New Mexico\nIn March 2006, my then\u2013future wife Nora and I rented a house in Eldorado, a suburban community about 15 miles southeast of Santa Fe. Each day as I drove from our home to the nearby city, all along the way on both sides of the road I\u2019d see large areas of grey\u2013brown (dead pi\u00f1ons) in the midst of green (live junipers).\nDuring my childhood in India, I was fascinated by the detective stories of Satyajit Ray\u2019s Feluda series. Because of the forest devastation I witnessed daily, I took on the role of a self\u2013assigned visual detective of a geographic region bound by a 5\u2013mile radius around our home. I walked again and again the same three paths, each no more than 2 miles long.\nAs I repeated my walks, I gradually began to realize that the environment around our home in the desert is perhaps as biodiverse as the arctic, where I have been taking photographs for the past decade. In both regions, one far and one near, I am attempting to address two simple things: home and food that land provides to humans as well as to numerous other species with whom we share this earth.\nI\u2019ll share with you a few experiences and a little bit of what I learned from these walks.\nFrom a distance I see a large dead pi\u00f1on with a canopy that spreads more than 20 feet. I can determine from the canopy size that the tree was more than 600 years old when it died. Pi\u00f1ons take nearly 300 years to mature and can live up to 1,000 years.\nAs I get closer to the dead tree, I notice the damaged skin with many protrusions that look like soft yellow globs or lines. Such skin is visual evidence that the tree did not die a normal death, but instead put up a fight against beetles by sending out sap to drown them in resin. In the end the tree lost, as the number of beetles the tree was fighting was far too many. I\u2019ve never seen a bark beetle, whose size is no bigger than a grain of rice, and I doubt you\u2019ll see one either, but if you look closely at the skin of one of these dead pi\u00f1ons you will know that the beetles were here and that the tree fought hard.\nOccasionally I see a beautiful northern flicker pecking away at a dead tree trunk, either building a nest or looking for food \u2013 insects that have come to break down the dead tree. In the process, the flicker will create perfectly circular holes. These cavities will become possible homes for gorgeous western and mountain bluebirds. Even after death these dead pi\u00f1ons provide home and food for many species.\nOn my walks I also come across areas that resemble graveyards, where every pi\u00f1on in immediate sight is dead. But I continue to see birds resting on the branches of these dead trees. And when I wait patiently, sometimes I am rewarded with the sight of a tiny black\u2013chinned hummingbird, which weighs less than 1/2 ounce, on top of a 20\u2013foot\u2013high dead pi\u00f1on as it catches its breath briefly before buzzing off to feed on a cluster of bright\u2013orange Indian paintbrush.\nPi\u00f1on trees produce protein\u2013rich nuts once every four to seven years. Nut eaters like Pi\u00f1on Jays critically depend on pi\u00f1on nuts for sustenance, but they also serve a very important role in the regeneration of pi\u00f1on woods. A typical flock of 50 to 500 birds can cache more than 4 million pi\u00f1on seeds in a good year in New Mexico, and uneaten seeds result in new trees.\nFor Native American communities of the desert southwest, pi\u00f1on tree has been of immense cultural, spiritual, and economic importance for many millenia. The nut is extensively harvested throughout its range. It has been a staple for a long time and continues to be eaten and used in cooking today.\nThis is not the first time that pi\u00f1on forests have been destroyed. It has been suggested that the ancient Pueblo people of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico overharvested the pi\u00f1on\u2013juniper woodlands around their community to support the growing need of timber for fuel and building materials. In the process they deforested woodlands that eventually contributed to their abandoning the magnificent community they had built. Even more extensive devastation occurred during the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, when vast areas of pi\u00f1on woodlands were deforested to support cattle ranching, which indigenous communities and others regard as a major act of ecocultural vandalism.\nAccording to a fascinating book, Ancient Pi\u00f1on-Juniper Woodlands: A Natural History of Mesa Verde Country , biologists have recently begun to define the pi\u00f1on\u2013juniper woodland as an old\u2013growth forest. This ecosystem supports an incredible diversity of wildlife, including 250 bird species (50 percent of all bird species west of Mississippi and more than a quarter of bird species in the U.S. and Canada), 74 species of mammals, 17 species of bats, 10 amphibian species, and 27 species of reptiles. Sadly, junipers are also dying (in lesser numbers so far) from extreme heat and drought. When I started my walks, I did not realize that there existed an old\u2013growth forest in the New Mexican desert.\nEvery time I call my mom in India she complains about how hot this summer has been. This year we had the hottest first six months globally since recording began in 1880. In Santa Fe, we broke the June high temperature record with a 100oF (average high is 83oF), the July record with another 100oF (average high is 86oF), and with 95oF already we\u2019ve tied the August record (average high is 83oF).\nSo it is no surprise that many of our remaining live pi\u00f1ons are again oozing soft yellow pitches. As it happens, these pi\u00f1ons were blooming last year and now they have beautiful green cones that will mature with nuts. These pi\u00f1ons are fighting\u2013and\u2013fruiting right now for their survival but they are infected and will die.\nEven reforestation is taking on a different meaning in the twenty\u2013first century. Young pi\u00f1on trees have little chance of surviving extreme heat and drought. Each time I drive on Cerrillos Road to get to Interstate 25, I see a line of recently planted pi\u00f1ons, but some of the young trees are already dead, and I surmise the others might be infected.\nIf we lose our remaining pi\u00f1ons in the coming decades due to global warming, how would we then talk about the tree that has been ecoculturally most significant for New Mexico and its Native American communities for thousands of years?\nForests Are Dying Across the American West and All Over the World\nIn 2004, Michelle Nijhuis reported in High Country News that several species of bark beetles were ravaging forests all across the American West. The black spruce, white spruce, ponderosa pine, lodglepole pine, whitebark pine, and pi\u00f1on have all been devastated by recent bark beetles epidemic. Scientists now suspect that by killing our forests, these beetles are also altering the local weather patterns and air quality.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. senate had scheduled a hearing on the bark beetle epidemic, but, angered by the passage of the healthcare bill, Senate Republicans canceled the hearing on March 23. The hearing was finally held on April 21. Senator Mark Udall (Democrat-Colorado), co\u2013sponsor of the National Forest Insect and Disease Emergency Act, wrote in his senate blog, \u201cThe infestation is a critical public health and safety issue for the people of Colorado and has been called the worst natural disaster our region has seen.\u201d The bill names twelve states affected by the epidemic: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. This list should also include Alaska, where spruce bark beetles have destroyed very large areas of spruce forests, some of which I saw during my time there.\nThe hearing mainly focused on offering tens of millions of dollars of federal assistance to remove dead trees from affected areas to avoid potential forest fire damage. Ecologist Dominik Kulakowski, who testified, thought it was an unproductive approach and said that if the government focuses on trying \u201cto make a wholesale modification of forest structure over large landscapes,\u201d it could be ecologically damaging.\nWas the hearing a case of destroy and then clean up \u2013 a common practice in our now global consumerist culture?\nIn March, Jim Robbins reported in Yale Environment 360 that global warming is killing forests across the American West as well as in many parts of the world. So I asked my colleagues for local observations.\nIn 2006, I spent time in Old Crow, a Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Arctic community in northern Yukon, Canada. At that time I knew nothing about the forest death that was happening in the southern Yukon. In a recent email to me, Roger Brown, the Forestry and Environmental Manager of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations , wrote, \u201cCanada\u2019s largest ever documented spruce bark beetle outbreak began 18 years ago and is continuing to affect our forests in the southwestern Yukon. Approximately 380,000 hectares of our white spruce dominated forests have been affected, with almost 100 percent mortality of the forest canopy in some areas. Our oral history research has suggested there is no traditional knowledge that speaks about such extensive tree deaths in the past.\u201d\nIn early June, as United Nations climate negotiators were wrapping up their unsuccessful meeting in Bonn, Germany, Anne-Marie Melster, founder and co-director of ARTPORT, wrote from Valencia, \u201cHere in Spain, at the Mediterranean coast, the picudo rojo (red palm weevil) is attacking and killing tens of thousands of palm trees.\u201d\nAbout the same time, Ananda Banerjee, a conservation journalist from New Delhi, emailed me. \u201cThe sal forest in north-central India is home to the endangered tiger,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last few years there has been wide spread destruction and felling of infected sal trees, from the attack of a pest beetle called the sal borer. We have around 1,10,000 sq. km area of sal forest in India, but the green cover is gradually depleting due to this pest and due to illegal harvest of sal as timber.\u201d\nIf you are interested in a broad scientific understanding of forest deaths from global warming, you can read an article published earlier this year in Forest Ecology and Management. It is worth noting the names of countries listed in the article with forest mortality data that have been recorded since 1970.\nAlgeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico,\nMorocco, Namibia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain, South Africa, South Korea,\nSri Lanka, Switzerland, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe\nGlobal warming skeptics would point to the fact that trees have died in the past from insect outbreaks and droughts, and so this is part of a natural climate cycle. But this time around something is very different: Forests are dying simultaneously in many places around the world in all forest types, and the intensity and rapidity with which they are dying in some places is of epic proportions.\nAs I started thinking about our dead forests, I wondered: Do we really need another story of global warming devastation? Haven\u2019t we heard enough about melting glaciers and icebergs, retreating sea ice and disappearing polar bears? Then something tugged on my shoulder: Are we not to mourn the deaths of so many trees? But we mourn that which we knew and cared for. We did not know these trees. My hope has been to introduce to you the trees as ecological beings beyond their usual association as board\u2013feet\u2013for\u2013lumber.\nHundreds of millions of trees have recently died and many more hundreds of millions will soon be dying. Now think of all the other lives, including birds and animals, that depended on those trees. The number of these must be in the tens of billions. What happened to them and how do we talk about that which we can\u2019t see and will never know? This massive loss must be considered a catastrophic global warming event.\nOur \u201cCarbon Sinks\u201d Are Becoming \u201cCarbon Sources\u201d\nConsider for a moment the top two carbon sinks of our planet. Oceans absorb more than 25 percent of the CO2 humans put in the air, and forests absorb almost the same amount. By doing so, our forests and oceans together make living possible on this earth for life as we know it now. All of that is changing rapidly and for the worse.\nDidn\u2019t we learn as kids in school that CO2 in the atmosphere is good for trees because it acts as a fertilizer and helps them grow? Increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere from industrialization indeed may have aided more trees to grow in the past century. But such short\u2013term gain has already faded away and turned into disaster. All three of the largest forests of the world are rapidly losing their carbon sink capacities.\nThe Siberian taiga is the largest continuous stretch of forested land on earth. It extends from the Urals in the west to the Kamchatka peninsula in the Russian Far East. Ernst\u2013Detlef Schulze of the Max\u2013Planck\u2013Institute for Biogeochemistry has studied this taiga for 30 years. He calls it \u201cEurope\u2019s green lungs,\u201d as these trees soak up much of the CO2 emitted by European smokestacks and automobiles farther west. Long stretches of extreme droughts have resulted in unprecedented forest fires that destroyed vast swathes of the taiga. Major deforestation is also happening there to fuel the need of (now) emerged economies such as China. And the fir sawyer beetle, larch bark beetle, and Siberian moth have also damaged large areas of the taiga.\nThis year Russia is experiencing the hottest summer ever, which has resulted in deadly forest fires with smokes over Moscow that made international headlines. Boreal forests of eastern Siberia are also ablaze with intense fires. Scientists have recently detected a poisonous ring around the planet created by an enormous cloud of pollutants that are being released by raging forest fires in central Russia, Siberia, and Canada.\nIn November 2007, I went to the Sakha Republic of Siberia with Inupiat hunter and conservationist Robert Thompson from Arctic Alaska. While camping with the Even reindeer herders in the Verkhoyansk Range, the coldest inhabited place on earth, we experienced temperatures of minus 65oF (without wind\u2013chill) and were told that January temperature dip to minus 90oF. We also spent time with the Yukaghir community at Nelemnoye along the Kolyma River, made infamous by Stalin\u2019s Gulag camps. We learned that even in such a cold place, the Siberian permafrost is melting rapidly during the summer months due to warming.\nIn Siberia, with the destruction of taiga and thawing of permafrost, the ghosts\u2013of\u2013gulags are ready to strike back at us with a deadly carbon bomb that we know little about.\nThe North American boreal forest stretches across U.S. and Canada from Alaska in the west to Newfoundland in the east, making it the second largest continuous forested ecosystem on earth. It is now confirmed that a lodgepole pine forest in British Columbia, Canada, that died from bark beetles outbreak has transformed from being a small net carbon sink to being a large net carbon source. We can probably say the same for all the other bark beetles infecting dying forests across the west.\nThe Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest on earth and stretches across nine countries \u2013 Brazil, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. I\u2019ve never been to the Amazon, but I\u2019m learning that forest fires, droughts, and deforestation have already destroyed very large areas of this forest. The Amazon is in great trouble: Scientists are predicting that a 4oC temperature rise would kill 85 percent of the Amazon. With climate inaction so far, we are heading rapidly toward such a reality.\nThe news is equally bad for our oceans, which are now struggling to keep up with the rising CO2 emissions from human activities. By absorbing all that CO2 the oceans are becoming horrendously acidic , threatening the survival of marine life. To make matters worse, methane that is 20 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas is being released in enormous quantities from some of our oceans, including the East Siberian Arctic Shelf , due to thawing of subsea permafrost there, and the Gulf of Mexico, due to BP\u2019s unforgiveable spill. Two studies have shown methane concentrations in some areas of the gulf reached 100,000 times higher than normal with few hot spots close to a million times higher. And recently we learned that 40 percent of the world\u2019s phytoplankton died in the last 60 years due to global warming, raising the question, \u201cAre Our Oceans Dying?\u201d\nOur natural carbon sinks are losing the battle with global warming, increasing human CO2 emissions, and extreme oil\u2013and\u2013gas drilling . Every citizen of our planet should be asking the question: Who or what will capture the carbon that we continue to emit? And every government ought to address this question as the most urgent priority if we are to ensure life on Earth.\nOur New Climate Movement\nLast month the U.S. Senate finally put an end to the climate bill. Since then several opinion pieces have been published, including articles in Yale Environment 360 , Grist , TomDispatch , The Nation , and The Hill . Some of these point out why the U.S. climate movement failed, while others call for a new movement.\nGlobal warming is a crisis: for all lands, for all oceans, for all rivers, for all forests, for all humans, for all birds, for all mammals, for all little creatures that we don\u2019t see... for all life. We need stories and actions from every part of our earth. So far, global warming communications have primarily focused on scientific information. I strongly believe that to engage the public, we need all fields of the humanities. It is to this end that I founded ClimateStoryTellers .\nAnd there is much action: globally, 350.org and Climate Justice Movement ; nationally, organizations such as Center for Biological Diversity ; and state-based initiatives such as New Energy Economy in New Mexico. These groups give us hope that a bold \u2013 not weak \u2013 climate movement will continue to move forward with renewed energy.\nOur task is to make the collective global voice louder and louder until ignoring such loud cacophony will not be an option by our governments. Global warming is not something we can solve with good behavior and healthy lifestyles. It will require major government action to control pollution\u2013and\u2013polluters and to start a low\u2013carbon\u2013society.\nI\u2019ll end with two simple questions:\nWill the economic\u2013and\u2013comfort\u2013needs of our species always trump the survival\u2013needs of all other species that also\ninhabit this Earth?\nBy not taking serious action on global warming, is humanity committing a colossal crime against all other lives on Earth?\nSubhankar Banerjee is a photographer, writer, activist, and founder of ClimateStoryTellers . His desert photographs will be presented in a solo exhibition, \u201cWhere I Live I Hope To Know,\u201d at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth (May 14\u2013August 28, 2011) and in group exhibitions \u201c(Re\u2013) Cycles of Paradise\u201d at the Centro Cultural de Espa\u00f1a in Mexico City (November 11, 2010\u2013January 16, 2011) and \u201cEarth Now: American Photographers and the Environment\u201d at the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe (April 18\u2013August 28, 2011).

Nonetheless, this Global Warming winter is roaring along quite nicely.\u00a0 Continue to expect a lot of white holidays and several fierce storms.\nGEOPHYSICAL FACTORS: Conditions remain much the same as the last few weeks. Polar Motion in\nChandler\n\u2019s Wobble appears to continue to move normally into a new spiral cycle. Physical stress factors are still low key. Tectonic activity was\u00a0 low in frequency as was quake magnitude and frequency. Only one 6.3 quake, in the Celebes Sea to the south of the Philippines.\u00a0 General seismic activity should begin to pick up again in January/February and reach a new peak in about April of 2007.\u00a0 Volcanic activity is about the same as last week,\u00a0 lava flows were reported in at least two volcanoes but ash emissions were frequent in the most of the Earth's 24 currently active volcanoes.\u00a0 There are at least 71 volcanoes currently cooking along which could erupt during 2007.\nGLOBAL WARMING SYNDROME: The current weather patterns should be considered classic Global Warming Syndrome.\u00a0 Solar influence is low key and the oceanic oscillations (El Nino, etc.) are very weak.\u00a0 El Nino signs are on again but not strongly.\u00a0 This type of Global Warming Winter will become progressively more extreme while progressively shifting the weather activity belts further to the north.\nSPIRITUAL FLUX\u00a0 - AT ALL COSTS, keep focused on the spiritual calm center and the transitions you and your group must make to walk in peace and serenity and mutual upliftment. The Year 2007 will be more amazing than ever, with great transitions for those who attune in love with the GOOD.\u00a0 BUT THE NEGENTHROPY downside will be horrible for those who cannot let go the old perspectives.\u00a0 Chaotic degeneration will continue to escalate in Washington DC, New York, the Mass Media, and all government/political circles - these circles are still dominated, in both parties, by those who busy themselves in career-pushing and the wrong answers of yester-year.\u00a0 There will be a lot of turmoil, more violence, more upsetting sudden changes even as the now old order of \"globalism\", which is just another word for IMPERIALISM, falls into smaller and more isolated pieces.\u00a0 Remove yourself from out of the way.\nGEOPOLITICAL FLUX: All here truly is in flux.\u00a0 It is now obvious the Bush only gets half of the problem in Iraq and around the world, namely that the world really does not conform to the \"decider's\" choices, in fact is quite hostile to the \"decider\",\u00a0 thus a new program for achieving dominance, at least in Iraq, is necessary.\u00a0 From various indications, it now appears that Bush's main question is how many additional tens of thousands of soldiers, and indirectly how many additional hundreds of thousands of human beings, he is going to pull down with him into the degradation of his Iraqi \"spider hole\".\u00a0 Bush's choice, apparently, will be to fix the \"program\" with new people and bigger numbers.\u00a0\u00a0 But Bush may not truly appreciate that the Globalist establishment has isolated him and his Zionazi allies.\u00a0 The man stands virtually alone and Robert Gates is not there now as the Defense Secretary to serve him, but rather to serve the cliques which run with the older generation of Skull And Bones.\u00a0 Since the Globalists are also divided and stalemated politically, it appears likely that gridlock will paralyze American politics on the issue.\u00a0 Half-solutions will be measely-mouthed in Washington D.C. circles, all heavily carped-bombed by Democratic\u00a0 and Republican Senators with a closer ear to the listening post.\u00a0 Confusion likely will reign, and more and more it looks like Iraqi's will sort out the future on their own. During the next 90 days Iraqi factions will sort out the power balances and arrangements in Iraq and precipitate a new state of affairs, generally in alliance with Syrian, Iranian, and Palestinian influences.\u00a0 By March 2007, most parties in the Middle East will be telling the U.S. to go home.\nSpecial Announcements: [as of December 11, 2006)\nWebsite conversion is going very slowly, as you no doubt noticed.\u00a0 I made a major effort to convert to Dreamweaver 9.\u00a0 Finally realized the program is for graphic-oriented designers, not writers.\u00a0 Was very disappointed in the results and abandoned the effort (see sidebar to the right).\u00a0 Made an attempt to explore MS Expressions, which is Microsoft's EXTREMELY GEEKY replacement for Frontage.\u00a0 I did not spend much time there as I quickly realized that the program is so sophisticated and complex, there is NO CONNECTION OF INTERFACE for people who wish to create content.\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it may be useful for certain tools put not for most web page creation.\u00a0 I predict Microsoft will be very disappointed in its acceptance and they will take a couple of years to get it right or they will abandon it like they do so many other things they have bought up.\u00a0 In the meanwhile, I am back to Frontpage 2003 and cannot be budged from here.\nProgress is being made nearly every day on the Prophecies book and the Trilogy. By the end of this week, paid subscribers will be given access to about 70 pages of a briefing (for another book in progress) which proves that Global Warming is an Edgar Cayce Earth Change.\u00a0 About 15 pages of this material, plus a couple of graphs, will be condensed into Book Three of the Trilogy to present a summary but complete logical argument to finish the verification of Edgar Cayce's long range prophecies.\u00a0 The few left outstanding will not be verified until the other side of the Phoenix singularity.\nAll those who subscribed\u00a0 with donations beginning in September 2005 in order to have access to the Phoenix books will have their subscriptions renewed at no charge to run through March 2007.\u00a0 This will give you plenty of time to download the finished Trilogy ebooks, the final set of which will be made available some time in January.\nSpecial Announcements: [as of November 6, 2006)\n1. I can now provide numbers and graphs which demonstrate that the current Global Warming trends CAN ONLY be produced by underwater volcanism.\u00a0 The rising CO2 in the atmosphere is also likely produced by underwater volcanism, which is occurring at a rate underwater which is at least 10,000 times greater than surface volcanism.\u00a0 With these numbers I am finalizing the proofs of Edgar Cayce\u2019s Earth Change prophecies.\u00a0 Global Warming is the \u201cfire\u201d of the Phoenix.\u00a0 See Vortex Tectonics below.\n2. The email format for the next few weeks will be in this abbreviated form.\u00a0 The full content of the Weekly Update will be on the web ( archive ) at\nhttp://michaelmandeville.com/ecbulletin\n3.

THIS DID SAVE THE CARIB AND\nGULF\nCOAST\nLINES THIS YEAR. The timing of the rapid die-off of solar activity is not very predictable but it certainly did result in this Hurricane Season remaining closer to the old averages than the new trends established during 2004/05. In fact, the average will not even occur in the Atlantic Basin.\u00a0 The Pacific Basin was closer to average by far and in fact, has brewed up some very interesting weather, including November's HUGE North Pacific All-But-In-Name-Hurricane which delivered HURRICANE quantities of rain and snow to a huge swath of the Pacific Northwest.\u00a0 Clearly plenty of warm energy was in the Pacific Ocean, offering up loads of vapor, but there was not enough electromagnetic intensity driving the atmosphere to focus the weather into more intense vortices from which hurricanes are drawn.\nSOLAR FORECAST:\n[12-04-06 ECB] We have not entered into Solar Minima.\u00a0 We are still in Solar Cycle 23.\u00a0 It will most likely not occur until sometime in 2007.\u00a0 I have not progressed the planets yet to look for a likely window.\n[12-04-06 ECB] THIS PREVIOUS PREDICTION STANDS WITH AMENDMENTS\n[11-13-06 ECB] Much greater activity will flow from the planetary alignments during December.\u00a0 From about December 16 to December 21, Mercury will align with both Mars and Jupiter in the three-way which will nearly coincide with a Venus | Neptune alignment.\u00a0 We will probably see a complex set of peaks, at least three, beginning possibly as early as December 10th, with a drawn out plateau of sunspot activity above 30 for perhaps a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 All in all this should be a modestly strong season change on all energy fronts, with storms, rain, floods, snow, and all that.\u00a0 For astrological qualities, about which I know very little, I would guess the period will be both mystically inclined on one hand and aggressively expansionary on the other hand.

[ More ]\n\" Mercury is fantastically mysterious. More than half of the planet is unknown to us. When Mariner 10 flew by in the mid-70s, it managed to photograph only 45% of Mercury's cratered surface. What lies on the other side? More craters? Or something totally unexpected? You're free to speculate, because the next spacecraft to visit Mercury, NASA's MESSENGER probe, won't enter orbit until 2011.\nOne of Mercury's greatest secrets is the mystery-material at its poles. Radars on Earth have pinged Mercury and received a strong echo from polar craters. A favorite explanation is ice. While Mercury's daylit surface heats up to 400o C, the temperature in deep, dark polar craters dips below -200o C. If an icy comet landed in one of those craters (or made one of those craters), the comet's ices, vaporized by impact, might re-freeze and stick around. As skeptics like to say, however, \"it's just a theory,\" one of many that MESSENGER will check.\nAnother puzzle is Mercury's wrinkles. Geologists call them \" lobate scarps .\" Like wrinkles on a raisin, the scarps are thought to be a sign of shrinkage. Mercury may actually be collapsing in on itself as its massive iron core cools and contracts. To check this idea, MESSENGER will map Mercury's magnetic field, which springs from the core. If the core is collapsing, the collapse may leave telltale signs in the planet's magnetism. MESSENGER will also look for lobate scarps on the uncharted side of Mercury to see if this is truly a global phenomenon.\nThe answers are years away. Meanwhile, we watch and wonder, and Nov. 8th is a good day for that.\"\nLUNAR SCHEDULE:\nALMANAC | BACKGROUND | EARTHMONITOR LINKS | LATEST\n[12-18-06 ECB] We are entering into a weak New Moon Syzygy on December 20.\u00a0 We passed an Apogee on December 13\u00a0 Expect nothing unusual in the tectonic activity department (quakes and volcanoes).\nPerigee Apogee\nDec 2 0:07 365922 km F-3d 0h Dec 13 18:57 404416 km N-6d19h\nNew Full\n2006 Dec 20 14:01 2007 Jan 3 13:58\n[12-11-06 ECB] The Moon is nearly at Apogee and about 10 days away from NEW.

Expect a lot of white holidays and several fierce storms as Mercury transits the planets during December.\nGEOPHYSICAL FACTORS: Little change from last week. Polar Motion in\nChandler\n\u2019s Wobble appears to continue to move normally into a new spiral cycle. Physical stress factors are still low key. There was NO fall out from the shape-shifting wave in the prior week.\u00a0 Tectonic activity was\u00a0 low in frequency as was quake magnitude and frequency. Only one 6.3 quake, near the northern Japanese islands.\u00a0 General seismic activity should begin to pick up again in January/February and reach a new peak in about April of 2007.\u00a0 Volcanic activity is a little lower than last week, almost no lava reported, but ash emissions are still frequent in the majority of the Earth's current 24 active volcanoes.\u00a0 The new eruption in Nyamuragira in Africa has settled down into daily ash but it could flare suddenly.\u00a0 There are at least 70 volcanoes currently cooking along which could erupt during 2007.\nGLOBAL WARMING SYNDROME: The current weather patterns should be considered classic Global Warming Syndrome.\u00a0 Solar influence is low key and the oceanic oscillations (El Nino, etc.) are very weak - El Nino already appears to be disappearing from the Pacific Equator.\u00a0 Accordingly, we are in the rising Global Warming Syndrome and the patterns which are unfolding this fall and winter will be patterns which will persist and build for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 Pay attention and learn how to see that will happen in succeeding years, with increasing severity. These are Global Warming Winters which will become progressively more extreme even as they progressively shift the weather activity belts further to the north. Those in the Pacific Northwest and northern tier of states and provinces in Greater North America better get used to these Winters.\nSPIRITUAL FLUX\u00a0 - ALL IS IN TRANSITION, EVEN IMPERIAL ATTITUDE: Keep focusing on letting go the past.\u00a0 It works, even Bush is FIIIIIIINNNNAAAAAALLLLLLY getting it. Soar like a Eagle, talk to God, amplify the clarity of the will to the Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET GO THE PAST AND ANY OF YOUR OLD HABITS WHICH YOU NOW SEE TO BE NO MORE THAN MAYA.\u00a0\u00a0 AT ALL COSTS, keep focused on the spiritual calm center and the transitions you and your group must make to walk in peace and serenity and mutual upliftment. The Year 2007 will be more amazing than ever, with great transitions for those who attune in love with the GOOD.\u00a0 BUT THE NEGENTHROPY downside will be horrible for those who cannot let go the old perspectives.\u00a0 Chaotic degeneration will continue to escalate in Washington DC, New York, the Mass Media, and all government/political circles - these circles are still dominated, in both parties, by those who busy themselves in career-pushing and the wrong answers of yester-year.\u00a0 There will be a lot of turmoil, more violence, more upsetting sudden changes even as the now old order of \"globalism\", which is just another word for IMPERIALISM, falls into smaller and more isolated pieces.\u00a0 Remove yourself from out of the way.\nGEOPOLITICAL FLUX: The acute world dilemma is that the U.S. political establishment is deadlocked into endless stalemate.\u00a0 Nothing in the Boomer Bubble is going anywhere good\u00a0 and there is no one of enough stature in the U.S. to release the horrible and tragic entrapment in the Middle East.\u00a0 Carter has the stature, and has finally broken through personally and spiritually to see charade which American Zionazi imperialism has perpetrated in the Middle East for the past 60 years, but he is too old and does not communicate well enough to provide the energetic leadership to outclass the Boomer Jingoes, who infect the Democrats nearly as broadly as they do the Republicans.\u00a0 Carter with his new book about making peace in Palestine, is practically the only senior politician in America who is willing to talk real about the brutal thuggery of the Zionazis and the criminal stranglehold of their lobby on American politics.\u00a0 Already assorted yiddish henchmen of the lobby are mobilizing to denounce Carter's work.\u00a0 Apparently no one else can make it through the Mass Media exclusions to communicate reality with a mass audience.\u00a0 Conditions may very likely deteriorate to the point that the Cabal and the Republicans will allow the Democrats to impeach Bush/Cheney.\u00a0 This will effectively neuter the Democrats, and turn them into the (war) party of responsibility for not solving the problems in Iraq. As they usually do, they will as a group fail to rise to the occasion so that the careerists will not feel threatened by controversy and real decisions about life and death.\u00a0 During the next 90 days Iraqi factions will sort out the power balances and arrangements in Iraq and precipitate a new state of affairs, generally in alliance with Syrian, Iranian, and Palestinian influences.\u00a0 My March 2007, most parties in the Middle East will be telling the U.S. to go home.\nSpecial Announcements: [as of December 11, 2006)\nWebsite conversion is going very slowly, as you no doubt noticed.\u00a0 I made a major effort to convert to Dreamweaver 9.\u00a0 Finally realized the program is for graphic-oriented designers, not writers.\u00a0 Was very disappointed in the results and abandoned the effort (see sidebar to the right).\u00a0 Made an attempt to explore MS Expressions, which is Microsoft's EXTREMELY GEEKY replacement for Frontage.\u00a0 I did not spend much time there as I quickly realized that the program is so sophisticated and complex, there is NO CONNECTION OF INTERFACE for people who wish to create content.\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, it may be useful for certain tools put not for most web page creation.\u00a0 I predict Microsoft will be very disappointed in its acceptance and they will take a couple of years to get it right or they will abandon it like they do so many other things they have bought up.\u00a0 In the meanwhile, I am back to Frontpage 2003 and cannot be budged from here.\nProgress is being made nearly every day on the Prophecies book and the Trilogy. By the end of this week, paid subscribers will be given access to about 70 pages of a briefing (for another book in progress) which proves that Global Warming is an Edgar Cayce Earth Change.\u00a0 About 15 pages of this material, plus a couple of graphs, will be condensed into Book Three of the Trilogy to present a summary but complete logical argument to finish the verification of Edgar Cayce's long range prophecies.\u00a0 The few left outstanding will not be verified until the other side of the Phoenix singularity.\nAll those who subscribed\u00a0 with donations beginning in September 2005 in order to have access to the Phoenix books will have their subscriptions renewed at no charge to run through March 2007.\u00a0 This will give you plenty of time to download the finished Trilogy ebooks, the final set of which will be made available some time in January.\nSpecial Announcements: [as of November 6, 2006)\n1. I can now provide numbers and graphs which demonstrate that the current Global Warming trends CAN ONLY be produced by underwater volcanism.\u00a0 The rising CO2 in the atmosphere is also likely produced by underwater volcanism, which is occurring at a rate underwater which is at least 10,000 times greater than surface volcanism.\u00a0 With these numbers I am finalizing the proofs of Edgar Cayce\u2019s Earth Change prophecies.\u00a0 Global Warming is the \u201cfire\u201d of the Phoenix.\u00a0 See Vortex Tectonics below.\n2.

THIS DID SAVE THE CARIB AND\nGULF\nCOAST\nLINES THIS YEAR. The timing of the rapid die-off of solar activity is not very predictable but it certainly did result in this Hurricane Season remaining closer to the old averages than the new trends established during 2004/05. In fact, the average will not even occur in the Atlantic Basin.\u00a0 The Pacific Basin was closer to average by far and in fact, has brewed up some very interesting weather, including November's HUGE North Pacific All-But-In-Name-Hurricane which delivered HURRICANE quantities of rain and snow to a huge swath of the Pacific Northwest.\u00a0 Clearly plenty of warm energy was in the Pacific Ocean, offering up loads of vapor, but there was not enough electromagnetic intensity driving the atmosphere to focus the weather into more intense vortices from which hurricanes are drawn.\nSOLAR FORECAST:\n[12-04-06 ECB] We have not entered into Solar Minima.\u00a0 We are still in Solar Cycle 23.\u00a0 It will most likely not occur until sometime in 2007.\u00a0 I have not progressed the planets yet to look for a likely window.\n[12-04-06 ECB] THIS PREVIOUS PREDICTION STANDS WITH AMENDMENTS\n[11-13-06 ECB] Much greater activity will flow from the planetary alignments during December.\u00a0 From about December 16 to December 21, Mercury will align with both Mars and Jupiter in the three-way which will nearly coincide with a Venus | Neptune alignment.\u00a0 We will probably see a complex set of peaks, at least three, beginning possibly as early as December 10th, with a drawn out plateau of sunspot activity above 30 for perhaps a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 All in all this should be a modestly strong season change on all energy fronts, with storms, rain, floods, snow, and all that.\u00a0 For astrological qualities, about which I know very little, I would guess the period will be both mystically inclined on one hand and aggressively expansionary on the other hand.

[ More ]\n\" Mercury is fantastically mysterious. More than half of the planet is unknown to us. When Mariner 10 flew by in the mid-70s, it managed to photograph only 45% of Mercury's cratered surface. What lies on the other side? More craters? Or something totally unexpected? You're free to speculate, because the next spacecraft to visit Mercury, NASA's MESSENGER probe, won't enter orbit until 2011.\nOne of Mercury's greatest secrets is the mystery-material at its poles. Radars on Earth have pinged Mercury and received a strong echo from polar craters. A favorite explanation is ice. While Mercury's daylit surface heats up to 400o C, the temperature in deep, dark polar craters dips below -200o C. If an icy comet landed in one of those craters (or made one of those craters), the comet's ices, vaporized by impact, might re-freeze and stick around. As skeptics like to say, however, \"it's just a theory,\" one of many that MESSENGER will check.\nAnother puzzle is Mercury's wrinkles. Geologists call them \" lobate scarps .\" Like wrinkles on a raisin, the scarps are thought to be a sign of shrinkage. Mercury may actually be collapsing in on itself as its massive iron core cools and contracts. To check this idea, MESSENGER will map Mercury's magnetic field, which springs from the core. If the core is collapsing, the collapse may leave telltale signs in the planet's magnetism. MESSENGER will also look for lobate scarps on the uncharted side of Mercury to see if this is truly a global phenomenon.\nThe answers are years away. Meanwhile, we watch and wonder, and Nov. 8th is a good day for that.\"\nLUNAR SCHEDULE:\nALMANAC | BACKGROUND | EARTHMONITOR LINKS | LATEST\nWe are in the Full Moon Syzygy for the Full Moon on Tuesday.\u00a0 We passed a Perigee on December 2, which produced an upsurge of seismic activity.\u00a0 This upsurge will most likely continue though tapering down through December 8 or so.\nPerigee Apogee\nDec 2 0:07 365922 km F-3d 0h Dec 13 18:57 404416 km N-6d19h\nNew Full\n2006 Nov 20 22:18 2006 Dec 5 0:25\n2006 Dec 20 14:01 2007 Jan 3 13:58\n[12-11-06 ECB] The Moon is nearly at Apogee and about 10 days away from NEW.

This new era of climate change could well be <em>the</em> most profound threat <em>ever</em> facing humanity.", "explanation": null, "document": "Three strategies for survival\nMore than an \"environmental\" issue\nIn reporting on the issue of climate change for my book, The Heat Is On, (Perseus Books, 1997), it became clear that climate change is far more than a merely environmental issue. Its dimensions cut to the core of our economic and political lives -- even to the basis of our existence as an organized civilization. The crisis of the global climate clusters around three issues of enormous scope and pervasive impact.\nIts natural dimensions are of truly cosmic proportions. The 11 hottest years in recorded history have occurred since 1980. The period from 1991 to 1995 constitutes the five hottest consecutive years on record. 1997 just replaced 1995 as the hottest year in history. And the planet is heating at a rate faster than at any time in the last 10,000 years. [2]\nIts energy dimension is staggering to contemplate. It requires a total transformation of the central nervous system of our civilization. To restore our inflamed atmosphere to a hospitable state requires nothing less than rewiring the entire globe -- and replace every oil-burning furnace, every gasoline-burning car, every coal-burning generating plant, with renewable, climate-friendly energy sources. The earth's fossil fuel resources have blessed us with a level of prosperity and abundance unimaginable a century ago. Today they are propelling us forward into a century of disintegration.\nFinally, the economic dimension of the climate crisis centers around a widening global fault line which threatens to split humanity irreparably between rich and poor. The impact of that inequality on the global climate rests on one simple fact: if tomorrow the U.S. and the rest of the industrial world were to cut its emissions dramatically, that reduction would be overwhelmed by the coming pulse of carbon from China, India, Mexico, Brazil and all the developing nations who are struggling to keep ahead of the relentless undertow of chronic poverty.\nToday while governments try to ratify emissions reductions of six and seven percent, a larger reality is being ignored. The science tells us clearly that to restore our atmosphere to a hospitable state requires us to cut emissions by 60 to 70 percent. [3]\nIt is a fascinating and deeply engaging set of issues that challenges both our habits and our intellects in ways that no other environmental problem ever has.\nAs one world-class scientist has observed, \"If this unstable climate we are now beginning to see had begun 150 years ago, the planet would probably never have been able to support its current population of nearly six billion people.\"\nThe Central Drama\nThis, then, is the central drama underlying the issue of global warming: the ability of this planet to sustain civilization versus the survival of the largest commercial enterprise in history. The oil and coal industries together generate around two trillion dollars a year in revenues. They support the economies of more than a dozen nations in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and elsewhere. In the battle against their inevitable transformation or demise, their resources are virtually without limit.\nNevertheless, despite a highly pervasive and very successful industry-funded campaign of deception and disinformation, the evidence of climate change is today irrefutable.\nExtreme weather events\nBegin with the most apparent evidence -- the relentless succession of extreme weather events all over the world. By itself, anecdotal evidence is not conclusive. But it is certainly compelling. A few selected examples from my notes:\nIn the spring of 1995, after five years without its normal killing frost, New Orleans was overrun by termites. [4] That summer, more than 500 people in India died from an usual heat wave. [5] Halfway around the world, the Midwest experienced its second 100-year flood in three years. At least 700 people died that summer in Chicago of heat-related effects. [6] That same summer of 1995 in Britain was the hottest since 1659 and the driest since 1721.) In fact, the 24 months from May, 1995, to May, 1997, was the driest two-year period in England since record keeping began.) [7] At the end of 1995, officials had to cancel the World Cup ski tournament in Austria for lack of snow. At the same time, residents of Sapporo, Japan, needed the army to dig them out of record snowfalls. [8]\nIn 1996, while floods plagued the northeastern United States, a prolonged Midwestern drought recreated Dust Bowl conditions and left U.S. grain reserves at their lowest levels in 50 years. [9] That summer, people in the northeast provinces of North Korea were reduced to eating leaves, grass and wild roots following the most extreme floods in memory. [10] At the same time, a succession of uncontrolled fires in Mongolia destroyed more than 700,000 square acres. [11]\nOne element of climate change involves the alteration of precipitation and drought patterns and more intense rain and snowfalls. As the atmosphere warms, it accelerates the evaporation of surface waters. At the same time, the warmer air expands to hold more water. So when the normal atmospheric turbulence comes through, it dumps much more of our rain and snow in severe, intense downpours than it did a few years ago. [12] In July, 1996, Aurora, Ill., received 17 inches of rain in one day. [13] That August, more than 60 people died during a flash flood in the Spanish Pyrenees. [14] In November, the worst floods in more than 50 years paralyzed Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. [15] At the end of the year, Moscow experienced its warmest December in history. [16]\nMoving forward into 1997, we saw a succession of very destructive ice, snow and rainstorms in the Pacific Northwest in January. [17] The worst rains in 30 years in February destroyed half of Bolivia's crops. [18] In March, we witnessed record flooding along the Ohio River. [19] Portugal experienced its worst winter drought in 150 years which destroyed 70 percent of that country's winter cereal crops. [20] In April, the epic flooding of the Red River devastated residents of North Dakota and Manitoba. [21] In May, a torrential rainfall in Manila in left 120,000 people homeless. [22] In July, the worst flooding in a century plagued Poland and the Czech Republic. [23] A November typhoon in Southeast Asia left 2,500 people dead or missing in what Vietnamese officials called the \"calamity of the century.\" [24] That same month, unprecedented flooding left more than 200,000 people homeless in Somalia and Ethiopia. [25] Last December was the coldest in Moscow in 115 years (following the previous year's warmest December in history). [26] And in my home town of Boston we saw a 60-degree Easter Sunday followed two days later by a 30-inch snowstorm, the third largest snowfall in Boston's history. [27]\nAnd 1998, which began with an extraordinary ice storm that immobilized northern New England and Quebec for a month, has brought us the fires in Brazil, Mexico and Florida, killer heat waves in Texas and India, where some 4,000 people died of heat effects, Mexico's worst drought in 70 years, flooding in China which left 14 million people homeless, the worst flooding in the history of Bangladesh which left some 30 million people homeless, and the 11,000 hurricane casualties in Central America.\nI think the point about extreme weather events is clear. My own informal collection includes about 150 such events in the last three years. That's about one a week. And what is remarkable is that each one is record setting.\nBut anecdotal evidence does not constitute proof -- until you add it to four other bodies of evidence: the warming-driven spread of infectious disease; the escalating crisis facing the world's property insurers; the official findings of the 2,500-member Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); and a series of profoundly troubling physical changes taking place on the planet.\nThe spread of infectious disease\nWarming is speeding up the breeding rates of disease-bearing insects. It is also propelling them to altitudes and latitudes which were only a few years ago too cold to support their survival. Dr. Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical School reports that mosquitoes that previously could survive no higher than 1,000 meters are not being found at sites as high as 2,200 and even 3,200 meters. And they are spreading malaria, dengue and Yellow Fever to populations which have never previously been exposed and have no traditional immunity against them. [28] At current rates of warming, scientists estimate that mosquito-borne epidemics will double in the tropical regions and increase 100-fold in the temperate regions (where we live) -- leading to as many as 80 million new cases a year of malaria alone in the next century. [29] Globally, the incidence of malaria has quadrupled in the last five years. [30]\nThe cholera epidemic of the early 1990s that infected 400,000 people just in Peru was triggered in large part by warming. [31] And changes in the climate have promoted the emergence of frequently lethal pulmonary virus in the southwest, the spread of a strain of Encephalitis and a striking increase in the Northeastern U.S. of tick-borne Lyme disease. [32] And when I was in Guatemala in March of 1998, the government declared a nationwide health alert in the face of an epidemic of cholera and other intestinal diseases. According to a full page article in the national newspaper, the drought-driven evaporation of drinking water was concentrating the amount of bacteria, and the warming from the El Nino was accelerating their breeding rates. So the government warned the public not only not to drink the water, but not even to wash vegetables or bathe in it. [33]\nEscalating insurance losses\nThe next body of evidence involves the extraordinary and rapid escalation of damage claims from severe weather events. It is sending shock waves though the insurance industry. Those losses, which averaged $2 billion a year in the 1980s, are averaging $12 billion a year in the 1990s. [34] A direct hit on Miami or New Orleans from a warming-intensified hurricane could create $50 billion in insured losses. Given the projected 2-3 foot rise in sea levels during the next century, insurers are acutely aware that half the population of the U.S. lives within 50 miles of a vulnerable coastline. Franklin Nutter, head of the Reinsurance Association of America, echoed a number of insurance officials when he said that unless something is done to stabilize the climate, it could \"bankrupt the industry.\" [35] As a recent report by the insurance giant, Munich Re, concluded: \"The general trend towards ever-increasing numbers of catastrophes with ever-increasing costs is continuing.\" [36] As if to prove the point, a study released in November, 1998, concluded that damages from extreme weather events simply in the first 10 months of 1998 surpassed the total of all such losses during the entire decade of the 1980s. [37] 5\nThe scientific consensus\nAnd then there is the official evidence of a consensus of more than 2,000 of the world's leading climate researchers.\nWhile the science is complex, the facts underlying the science are simple. Carbon dioxide traps in heat. For 10,000 years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has remained the same -- 280 ppm -- until roughly the turn of the century when we began burning more coal and oil. That 280 will double in the next century. A concentration of 450 ppm which most experts regard as inevitable correlates with an increase in the global temperature of 3* to 7* F. By contrast, the last Ice Age was only 5* to 9* F colder than our current climate. Each year, we are pumping six billion tons of heat-trapping carbon into our atmosphere whose outer extent is only about 12 miles overhead.\nIn 1995, the IPCC reported to the United Nations that it had discovered the scientific \"fingerprint\" of coal and oil emissions which are contributing to the warming of the planet. That \"fingerprint\" is graphically and distinctively different from the natural variability of the climate. [38]\nThat same year, a team at the National Climatic Data Center verified an increase in extreme precipitation events, altered rainfall and drought patterns and temperature extremes during the past several decades. The events they identified are precisely what the current generation of climate computer models project as the early manifestations of global warming. [39]\nResearch results published last summer indicate that in more of the world, the nighttime low temperatures are rising almost twice as fast as the daytime high temperatures. That also is a distinctive \"signature\" of greenhouse warming. [40] If the warming were part of the natural variability of the climate, the highs and lows would rise and fall more or less in parallel.\nPhysical changes to the planet\nThe final body of evidence lies in scientific findings about physical changes in the glaciers, forest, mountains and oceans:\nIn 1995, researchers were astonished to discover that warming surface waters had led to a 70 percent decline in the population of zooplankton off the coast of Southern California, creating an ocean wasteland and jeopardizing the survival of several species of fish. [41]\nIn Monterey Bay, ocean warming caused a turnover in the population of marine life, driving cold-water fish northward while warm-water fish and sea animals moved in to populate the area. [42] As ocean warming pushed fish populations northwards, atmospheric warming has pushed a whole population of butterflies from the mountains of Mexico to the hills of Vancouver. [43]\nHigh above the oceans, most of earth's glaciers are retreating at accelerating rates. The biggest glacier in the Peruvian Andes was retreating by 14 feet a year 20 years ago; today it is shrinking by 99 feet a year. [44]\nPlants are migrating up the Alps to keep pace with the changing climate. [45]\nWarming has been detected in the deep oceans, causing the break up of Antarctic ice shelves [46] -- and almost certainly fueling more frequent and severe El Ninos. For at least a century, El Ninos surfaced about every 4.2 years. Since the mid-1970s, however, they have become more frequent and long lasting. The El Nino which ended in late 1995 lasted a record 5 years and 8 months. That is a 1-in-2000 year event. [47] And we have yet to understand the full extent of its biological impacts. The El Nino of 1997-98, which has promoted wildfires in Indonesia and Mexico, record rainfalls in Chile and the beginnings of a famine in New Guinea, is far more severe. And many scientists now believe that the change in El Nino patterns is due specifically to atmospheric heating. [48]\nA new desert has recently formed in parts of Spain, Portugal and Greece and scientists last year declared that protracted droughts, punctuated by intense, soil-eroding rains, have become the norm rather than the exception. [49]\nThe Alaskan Tundra, which for thousands of years absorbed methane and CO2, is now thawing and releasing those gases back into the atmosphere. [50] In Siberia and Alaska, the ancient permafrost is turning to pea soup. 51]\nAnd in what for me is one of the most startling of these physical changes, we have actually altered the timing of the seasons. Because of the buildup of atmospheric CO2, spring is now arriving a week earlier in the northern hemisphere than it did 20 years ago. [52]\nIndustry's campaign of deception\nBut if much of the public is ignorant of the stakes, the fossil fuel lobby is acutely aware of them. Over the last seven years, the fossil fuel lobby has mounted a extremely effective campaign of disinformation to persuade the public and policy-makers that the issue of atmospheric warming is still stuck in the limbo of scientific uncertainty. That campaign for the longest time targeted the science. It then misrepresented the economics. And most recently it attacked the diplomatic foundations of the climate convention. And it has been extraordinarily successful in creating a relentless drumbeat of doubt in the public mind.\nIn 1991, Western Fuels, a $400-million coal consortium, declared in its annual report it was launching a direct attack on mainstream science and enlisting several scientists who are skeptical about climate change -- specifically Drs. Robert Balling, Pat Michaels and S. Fred Singer. [53]\nThese self-proclaimed \"greenhouse skeptics\" would normally not be worthy of much attention. There are only about a dozen visible ones versus a consensus of more than 2,000 of the world's leading climate scientists. But, with extraordinary access to the media thanks to their corporate sponsors, they have been able to create the general perception that the issue is hopelessly stuck in uncertainty.\nSeven years ago, Western Fuels and several coal utilities launched a half-million-dollar public relations campaign which called for local press, radio and TV appearances by Drs. Balling, Michaels and Singer. According to its strategy papers, the purpose of the campaign was to \"reposition global warming as theory rather than fact.\" The same document indicates the campaign was designed to target \"older, less-educated men...[and] young, low-income women\" in districts which receive their electricity from coal and, preferably, have a representative on the House Energy Committee. [54]\nAfter the fraudulent ICE campaign was exposed in the media, Western Fuels spent $250,000 on a propaganda video to convince audiences that enhanced carbon dioxide is good for us -- that it will benefit humanity by increasing crop yields to help feed an expanding population. [55] Unfortunately, the video overlooks two factors. The first is the bugs. Of all natural systems, one of the most sensitive to even the slightest temperature change is insects; even a slight warming will trigger an explosion of crop-destroying, disease-spreading insects. Plant biologists point out an even more unconscionable omission. While enhanced CO2 may temporarily increase yields in the northern latitudes, it will decimate food crop growth in the tropical latitudes where the majority of the world's poorest and hungriest people live. A half-degree increase in the average temperature will cause a substantial decline in rice yields in Southeast Asia -- and a drop-off of 20 percent of the wheat crop in India [56] -- a country where a third of the population -- more than 300 million people -- live in extreme poverty.\nFor another example, a few months after a 1995 report by the National Climatic Data Center that documented an increase in severe weather events, the oil lobby commissioned a study by a private weather forecasting firm denying any such changes. It got quite a lot of coverage in the press -- despite the fact that the latter study was a laughingstock in the scientific community. It turns out that the NCDC study was based on all the weather data in the US collected since the beginning of instrumentation -- enough to fill a half million 1995-vintage PCs. By contrast, the industry study drew on data from three towns -- Augusta, Ga., State College, Pa., and Des Moines, Iowa. [57]\nIn a similar vein, in the summer of 1997 Fred Singer put out a flurry of press announcements declaring the head of the IPCC, Dr. Bert Bolin, had renounced his previous statements and declared the science is too uncertain to justify any policy changes and denying any connection between atmospheric warming and extreme weather events. [58] When Dr. Bolin heard about these allegations, he emphatically denied them and said Singer basically made up the whole thing. [59]\nThe latest such attack occurred when Fred Seitz, of the ultra-conservative Marshall Institute, distributed a study by a Oregon chemist, with no background in climate research, dismissing the findings of the IPCC. The study was printed so as to resemble an official document of the National Academy of Science, leading the NAS to take the highly unusual step of publicly dissociating itself from the study and noting that, as early as 1992, the Academy's own panel concluded \"greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses...as insurance against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises.\" [60]\nMisrepresenting the economics\nNor have the attacks focused solely on the science. The industry has also misrepresented the economics and attacked the diplomatic foundations of the climate convention. Several economic studies released by industry groups forecast dire economic disaster from even a modest level of emissions reductions [61] -- despite a declaration by more than 2,500 economists that we can cut emissions and create more jobs at the same time. [62]\nLast fall, in the months before Kyoto, the fossil fuel lobby took aim at the United Nations climate convention by demanding we renege on our diplomatic commitments and impose first-round energy cutbacks on the developing world. [63]\nAnd as recently as April 26, a front page article in the New York Times documented the next leg of the campaign -- a new $5 million campaign by the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon, Chevron and the Southern Company, to attack the findings of the IPCC and propagate a new generation of scientific falsehoods. [64]\nGiven the past success of the greenhouse skeptics -- and the larger disinformation campaign -- this latest public relations offensive should come as no surprise. The effectiveness of the fossil fuel lobby's campaign of deception has been extraordinary. When the chairman of the House Science Committee drastically cut funding for global research programs, he cited statements by the \"greenhouse skeptics\" and ignored the testimony of four of the world's most accomplished scientists. [65] The chairman of a House subcommittee said the industry-sponsored skeptics persuaded him that funding global warming research amounted to \"throwing money down a rathole.\" [66]\nFunding the skeptics\nThe use of this tiny group of \"skeptics\" became clear in the spring of 1995 when they were forced to disclose for the first time under oath how much funding they had received from industry sources.\nFrom 1991 to 1995, Dr. Balling received about $300,000 from Cyprus Minerals, the British Coal Corporation, the German Coal Mining Association and OPEC. His book's publication in Arabic was funded by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. [67]\nMichaels received $165,000 in three years from Western Fuels, the German Coal Mining Association and Cyprus Minerals. [68] Cyprus Minerals also happens to be the largest single funder of the militantly anti-environmental Wise Use movement.\nAnother highly visible skeptic, Fred Singer, acknowledged he has received funding from Exxon, Shell, Unocal and ARCO. [69]\nTwo polls by Newsweek Magazine underscore the effectiveness of this industry deception. In 1991, 35 percent of those polled said global warming is a very serious problem. But by 1996, that percentage had dropped to 22 percent. [70]\nThe \"greenhouse skeptics\" are fond of pointing out uncertainties in the science. The science, they tell us, can't specify particular impacts in specific regions. Nor can it predict the future rates of warming -- or the thresholds of carbon dioxide concentrations which will propel the climate into abrupt shifts.\nThe real uncertainty\nThey have made a living off of scientific uncertainty. But they have used it in a very selective and misleading way. Dr. Michael McElroy, chairman of Harvard's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, cites a lesson about uncertainty he learned from the early days of the ozone depletion issue. While early computer models yielded estimates of the depletion, subsequent measurements by balloons and satellites found the depletion to be far worse than the worst-case computer scenario. \"Just because there is uncertainty,\" McElroy said, \"does not imply the reality is benign. It could easily be far worse.\" McElroy's bottom line on the climate issue is this: \"We have no right tampering with an immense system we don't understand.\" [71]\nI would go further. Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere 100 years. [72] If we could magically stop all our coal and oil burning, we would still be subject to a long spell of costly and traumatic weather extremes. Moreover new research indicates that prehistoric climate changes have happened as abrupt shifts rather than gradual transitions, and that small changes have triggered catastrophic outcomes. [73] Not only are we gambling with our collective futures. We are gambling with our eyes blindfolded. We can't even read the cards we've been dealt.\nThe risks to democracy\nIf you begin to think through the consequences of an unstable climate to our political world, you will probably arrive at the same conclusion as William Ruckelshaus. Ruckelshaus, who was the first head of the EPA and is currently CEO of Browning-Ferris Industries, said that \"long before the systems of the planet collapse, the institutions of democracy will buckle under the pressure of a series of ecological emergencies.\" [74] In fact, the threat of totalitarianism is strongest in many of the poorest countries whose ecosystems are as fragile as their traditions of democracy. It is not hard to foresee governments resorting to permanent states of martial law to respond to droughts, floods, heat waves, incursions of environmental refugees and epidemics of infectious disease.\nAs if to illustrate the point, in September, 1997, after four months of unbroken drought and frost, 700,000 people in Papua New Guinea left their homes in search of food and water and government officials said they were unable to deal with the situation. [75]\nThe consequences of climate change hold the same anti-democratic potential for the United States as well. Disruptions in other parts of the world would likely hurt our own economy, shrinking markets and impairing the flow of industrial commodities from abroad. This is not the kind of climate in which democracy flourishes. This is the kind of climate that could easily lead to food rationing, with its associated black market crime. It could lead, as well, to a military takeover of relief operations to maintain order in the face of natural disruptions. It is a fact that today the Central Intelligence Agency is assessing the potentials for political destabilization from climate-related disruptions. [76]\nSo the prospects for both our habitat and our institutions are very depressing and very frightening.\nWhich brings me to the final -- and probably most controversial -- section of this presentation.\nKyoto: a puny beginning\nIn December, 1997, the delegates to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change hammered out a global agreement to reduce coal and oil emissions. From a political point of view, the conference was surprisingly successful. Some 160 nations came together to sound an alarm about our common future. At several points, the talks nearly broke down over several major divisions -- between the US and the European Union, between the developed and developing nations and between the business and environmental communities. It is to their great credit that, at the last minute, delegates managed to resolve -- or at least create the illusion of resolving -- those divisions.\nBut if we judge Kyoto not by the obstacles of diplomacy but by the requirements of nature, the Protocol is a hollow shell. Its goals of 7 and 8 percent reductions are at least an order of magnitude below what nature requires to stabilize the global climate. It is moreover deeply flawed by an emissions-trading mechanism which is unworkable and unenforceable and which, together with a system of \"joint implementations\" amounts to little more than a grab-bag full of loopholes to be exploited by industrial interests. [77]\nNow contrast the Kyoto cuts averaging less than 7 percent with the 60 to 70 percent reductions needed to stabilize the global climate.\nThe critical role of inequity\nClearly there is a major disconnect between what nature requires to keep this planet hospitable -- and what the diplomats and business leaders say is politically achievable and economically permissible.\nAnd at the center of that disconnect is the monumental issue of global economic inequality between the North and South. I cannot emphasize this strongly enough: that inequality is as critical to our planet's climate as the burden of carbon is to the chemistry of our atmosphere. The largest source of greenhouse gases in the coming decades will not be the US, Western Europe and Japan, but the developing economies of East Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The coming eruption of carbon emissions from the poor world will dwarf any reductions in the North.\nThe fossil fuel lobby wants to address the problem by increasing trade between wealthy and poor countries. Under one proposed approach, for instance, a big emitter in the US could pay for planting trees in India to absorb more carbon dioxide and thus get credit for \"emissions avoided.\" Industry spokesmen tout as a \"win-win\" approach the sale of new US-designed coal plants to China to reduce emissions from its older, dirtier plants. [78] China might win. Westinghouse or Bechtel might win. The rest of us would lose.\nEntrepreneurs in the field of alternative energy see the issue as a windfall for their industry -- an opportunity to sell millions of dollars of renewable technologies to the developing world.\nIn fact, virtually every proposal on the table involves some sort of market-based solution to the problem. As a result, I believe, all of them will fail.\nI believe the lure of the newly globalized economy in this area is lethal. Most of the business community sees the climate issue as yet another opportunity to sell yet another category of goods to developing countries who can barely afford to feed and educate their poverty-stressed populations. They are in no position to finance energy transitions.\nThe Senate's denial\nIn the summer of 1997, the US Senate voted 95 to 0 to reject the treaty because it exempts the large developing nations from the first round of emissions cuts. [79] And last fall, the fossil fuel industry launched a $13 million ad campaign to reinforce that resistance. [80] What the industry lobby, as well as many Senators, must stop denying is that most developing nations are too burdened by debt, poverty and social instability to absorb energy restrictions. India, for instance, sells electricity through state electric boards. Those boards were breaking even until the early 1980s, when the country decided on a national policy of food self-sufficiency and began subsidizing grants of electricity to small farmers. Today, as a result, India's electric boards are in virtual bankruptcy. All that stands between order and breakdown in that country is her vast coal reserves. To impose substantial emissions restrictions on India without providing alternative sources of energy is to invite economic and social chaos.\nThe fossil fuel lobby tells us repeatedly that the exemption of the developing countries will cost us jobs in our domestic coal and oil industries. But that argument cuts both ways. If we do impose significant energy restrictions on the developing countries, we will see lots of job losses at Boeing, Gillette, Coca Cola and all those companies that see their future earnings growth coming from emerging markets.\nThe real truth is that if we in the North don't get this right, we will suffer severe economic damage whether or not we impose energy restrictions on the nations of the South.\nSome hopeful signs\nThis is not to deny some recent and hopeful signs. In the last few months, some important corporate players have begun to acknowledge the climate crisis. Days after the Kyoto Conference, Ford announced in would invest more than $400 million in a joint venture with Daimler Benz and Ballard Power Systems to begin producing fuel-cell driven cars. [81] The chairman of British Petroleum announced his company expects to be doing $1 billion in solar energy commerce within the decade. [82] And Shell also announced its intention to invest $500 million in renewable energy technologies. [83]\n(It is worth nothing here that a switch to renewables implies no decline in our living standards. An economy based on hydrogen, fuel cells, photovoltaics, solar, biomass, wind and super-efficient gas-fired co-generation technology could provide all the energy we require today and more. All renewables need to become economically competitive with fossil fuels are mass markets, mass production and economies of scale.)\nBut for the initiatives of BP, Shell and others to work, these companies need the protective regulatory leadership of the world's governments to level the playing field to help them decarbonize their energy services and position their companies to play prominent roles in a new energy economy.\nWithout a comprehensive system of mandatory and binding enforcement it would be extraordinarily difficult for these corporate leaders to sacrifice the competitive position of their company or their industry. I believe it would be impossible for them to keep their eye at the same time on the bottom line of profitability and the upper reaches of our carbon-burdened sky.\nThe law of supply and demand vs. the laws of nature\nThe fact that most shareholders and directors focus exclusively on near-term cost reveals a basic short-out in the logic of the marketplace. It denies the fundamental fact that the global environment circumscribes and supports the global economy. We can not negotiate emission levels and rates of economic growth with the biosphere. Unfortunately, the laws of supply and demand do not supersede the laws of nature. And when those two sets of laws collide, the physical planet is the court of highest appeal. If you believe the costs of changing our energy diet are too high, understand this: the costs of not changing will be incalculably higher.\nOne pathway to a future\nI believe we need a Manhattan-type Project to rewire the world in a 10-15 year period to replace all our coal and oil-fired energy sources with climate-friendly, non-polluting technologies.\nThe oil lobby tells us that even a 15 percent reduction in emissions would cost us more than 3 percent of our GDP. [84] What they don't tell is us is that a global energy transition would create millions and millions and millions of jobs all over the world.\nIf every country were given the technology and the resources to train workers to manufacture and install climate-friendly energy sources, it would create an unprecedented world-wide economic boom. It would begin to reverse the economic gap between the North and South. And in a very short time, the labor-intensive renewable energy industry would absolutely eclipse high technology as the central driving engine of growth of the global economy.\nLast year, as I mentioned, more than 2,500 economists declared that we can cut emissions -- up to 30 percent by some estimates -- simply by implementing a series of efficiency and conservation measures with a net gain in jobs to the economy. To attain the next 40 percent, however, requires a radical departure from the way we have been doing business. An unregulated market approach is far too gradual and uneven to address the challenge. And the conventional political process, with its negotiated comprises, will -- predictably and depressingly -- yield nothing more than a new arena of perpetual economic warfare in which industries and nations will devote their energies to pushing the economic pain off themselves and onto their neighbors and competitors. That is clearly the least productive response to the challenge that faces us all.\nA more productive response might involve the type of international governance the Montreal Protocol provided for the chemical industry. The primary reason that public-private partnership was successful in eliminating ozone-destroying chemicals was simple. As the economist David L. Levy has pointed out, the same companies that made the destructive chemicals were able to produce their substitutes, with no negative impact on their competitive standing within the industry. [85]\nThe job of the energy industry now is to configure itself in the same way. It will be difficult. In producing CFC substitutes, the chemical companies did not have to develop new processes and technologies. But energy is a different story. Renewable energy sources derive from very different technologies than extractive techniques. Photovoltaics are based on semiconductor technology; wind power draws on turbine technology and electronics. And many renewable sources are implicitly decentralized, off-grid, stand-alone technologies. So it will call on a great deal of corporate will and ingenuity.\nThe good news is that the renewable energy industry today is young and fragmented. There is no Microsoft of renewables. Given the emerging nature of the industry, there is today a moment of opportunity and an abundance of expertise for the energy giants majors to decarbonize their energy supplies. To accomplish this, the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol should establish an international agency to determine -- in concert with the world's major oil and coal companies -- an enforceable timetable of 10 to 15 years for this transition.\nThree strategies for survival\nThe elements for this transition seem available now.\nFirst, I think we need to divert the approximately $21 billion the federal government (and the $300 billion spent by governments all over the world) to subsidize fossil fuels and divert those subsidies to the renewable energy industry.\nSecond, I think we need to substitute a fossil fuel efficiency standard for the mechanism of emissions trading. (Currently, electrical production from gas-fired cogeneration is attaining efficiencies of 90 percent -- versus the 35 percent from oil and coal combustion.) Simply by phasing in increasingly stringent efficiency standards for each energy-use sector, we would create an instant market for renewables and efficiencies without compromising any of our energy needs. And were we to eliminate the subsidies and regulations designed to protect inefficient coal and oil use, we would create a true marketplace that rewarded free energy competition according to the dual standards of economy and efficiency. [86]\nFinally, I think we need to use a variation of the Tobin Tax to finance the transfer of climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. Such a tax would amass revenues from the commerce in international currency transactions which, today, totals about $1.3 trillion every day. A .025 percent tax on those transactions would generate from $150 to $200 billion a year to finance windmill plants in India, fuel cell factories in Russia, vast photovoltaic, hydrogen-producing farms in the Middle East, solar assemblies in El Salvador and super-efficient, gas-fired cogeneration plants in South Africa. [87]\nThat is a vision I believe we should strive to realize in the wake of Kyoto. But unfortunately there remains the stumbling block of political stalemate.\nSeveral senators have said that without an uprising of popular support, they will not be able to counteract the influence of the fossil fuel lobby in Congress and, as a result, the Kyoto Protocol may never be ratified by the Senate.\nUnfortunately, there is a political conundrum here. While the US is home to many, many very energetic and effective grass-roots groups, virtually all of them have mobilized around a local issue -- a toxic waste facility, a landfill, an asphalt plant that threatens local air and water quality. Unfortunately, the global environment is everyone's second home. However, several NGO leaders returned from Kyoto resolved to forge a national coalition of all these local grassroots groups around the climate issue. Conditions are changing quickly and I think the timing for this kind of an initiative is at hand.\nAll over the country -- and, for that matter, the world -- the public is extremely alarmed about our increasingly unstable and violent weather. They are worried about their futures -- and their children's futures. Given the attention focused on the issue by the media in the run-up to Kyoto, the issue of climate change is finally on the public's radar screen. And despite the relentless campaign of disinformation by the fossil fuel lobby, we are now seeing companies like BP, Sunoco, Shell, Texaco and Ford breaking ranks within the industry. [88]\nSo, given the emerging awareness of the public, the fissures within the fossil fuel industry, and the media backlash against the deceptions of the fossil fuel lobby, I think there is a new climate of political possibility.\nWe have the technology. We have the institutional mechanisms. What we need now is the will to think big and make it happen.\nI am not an economist. I am not wedded to any of the details of my proposal -- save for the goal of virtual zero emissions within fifteen years. What my reporting has taught me, however, is that any solution must have the same scope and sweep as this. Business-as-usual will most likely mean the fracturing of civilization -- and the end of democracy as a practicable form of government.\nWe have long since passed the point at which there is any reasonable doubt as to whether or not there is a problem. It is time to clear away the industry-generated smokescreen of deception and decide together -- on the basis of accurate and truthful information -- what to do about it.\nFinally, in addition to our energy diet, I believe we must tackle another change which may prove even more difficult. I think we must change, in a very fundamental way, the self-image we have shared since we first became a rational species.\nFor most of our history, we have thought of ourselves as helpless children of nature, dependent on her whims for our shelter and survival.\nToday, at the brink of the 21st Century, we are no longer children. Somewhere in the recent past, with the growth of our population and the power of our technology, we have grown into a collective force as powerful as any force of nature. We are no longer mere inhabitants of the planet. We are also it shapers. [89] And as we continue to act like adolescents by testing its physical limits and denying the destructive consequences of our newfound, adult power, we are putting our entire history at risk.\nWhile we treasure our past, it is time to stop denying our impact on the present. It is time, as well, to honor our responsibilities to the children. I believe the time is here for all of us all over the world to finally grow up.\nEndnotes:\n1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: Summary for Policymakers: The Science of Climate Change, IPCC Working Group I, November, 1995.\n2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: Summary for Policymakers: The Science of Climate Change, IPCC Working Group I, November, 1995. \"Global-scale temperature patterns a climate forcing over the past six centuries,\" Michael E.

According to an anonymous search-engine industry professional, questions regarding Google's Suggest function are an everyday occurrence, fruit of what he described as \"endless conspiracy theories.\" Google Earth image by Martin Stehr.\nAmong the points of interest in the unfolding climate scandal is the fact that the term \u201cclimategate\u201d rapidly eclipsed global warming in the number of links produced by a simple Google search.\nAs is standard, Google\u2019s auto-suggest function facilitated this, several days into the story\u2019s evolution. Anyone typing in the letters c-l-i would see the suggested time-saving choice of climategate. Within a day or two of the auto-suggest function being added for \u201cclimategate\u201d it had become the top item in the list.\nSuddenly, though, on Monday December 1, Google stopped offering \u201cclimategate\u201d as a choice to those who typed c-l-i and even to those who typed c-l-i-m-a-t-e-g-a-t. Strange.\nIntrigued, I sent a few questions to Google\u2019s Global Communications Department and a polite gentleman by the name of Jake Hubert responded right away.\nThis is what he wrote back in an e-mail:\nHi Harold,\nI can verify that Google has not ever removed the query [climategate] or variations of the query from Google Suggest. It was never a \u201cdecision\u201d as you suggest in your question, but instead it may have disappeared from the Suggest feature because of a normal update of the Suggest feature.\u00a0 The suggestions change dynamically over time through automated processes based on relevance algorithms.\nGoogle Suggest uses a variety of algorithms in order to come up with relevant suggestions while the user is typing. We do remove certain clearly pornographic or hateful or malicious slur terms from Suggest, but we have not removed anything in this case.\nHope this helps,\nJake\nIn my response, I pointed out that the number of links produced by a \u201cclimategate\u201d query was growing by leaps and bounds, drawing attention to the fact that \u201cclimategate\u201d had eclipsed global warming (by that point) by more than half. (The doubling would be completed in the next 24 hours.)\nCould he double-check with his product team?\nHis response was not surprising:\nHi Harold,\nI hear what you\u2019re saying, and I have already verified my prior statement with our product team.\nThanks,\nJake\nAt this point, although I suspected I was getting the run-around, I thought I\u2019d give Jake one last shot at solving this problem:\nHi Jake,\nI\u2019m not questioning whether your product team confirmed your statement. Thank you again for that. I wonder, though, whether they have the complete story.\nFor instance, I wonder whether you and they have run some experiments just to see how odd this is? In your first response, you wrote, \u201cThe suggestions change dynamically over time through automated processes based on relevance algorithms.\u201d\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but the relevance algorithms work according to numbers of searches and links. Google Suggest fills in, for instance, both your name (although your name search produces only 680,000 links) and my name (which produces only 1,690,000 links). Climategate, on the other hand, yields 16 million links (growing by the hour), but Google Suggest doesn\u2019t provide suggestions. So, the math doesn\u2019t appear to add up.\nWould it be possible to give me an example of another word or phrase that is yielding more and more hits (has more than 15 million already) but that Google Suggest does not in-fill (or stops during the word or phrase\u2019s ascendancy)?\nBarring such examples, this has the appearance of a political decision from high up the chain of command.\nWould it be possible to provide me with contact information for a press officer at Google at the executive level?\nThank you in advance.\nRegards,\nHarold\nUnlike the previous efforts at communication, this one was met with silence. At that point, I thought it might save time to work my way up the chain of command. I e-mailed a letter to Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s CEO, to whom I forwarded my correspondence with Jake. Toward the end of my letter I wrote the following:\nUnfortunately, what this situation appears like is one in which someone with an interest in suppressing Climategate prevailed upon someone within the Google structure to remove Climategate from the list of auto-suggests. (Other phrases starting with climate are still Google-suggested even though they have many fewer links than Climategate.)\nI asked him if it would it be possible to have someone from his staff look into this. I also asked if it would be possible to interview him by phone. Failing that, I said, perhaps I could send him a list of questions?\nAfter sending the message, I went out to pick up my daughter from nursery school. When I returned, there was a message from Jake on my answering machine. Without boring readers with the entirety of the message, the takeaway was the statement \u201cNo need to contact the CEO.\u201d\nI returned Jake\u2019s call and we spent a pleasant ten minutes on the phone, during which he explained that there was \u201cno conspiracy,\u201d that the algorithm governing Google Suggest simply had its own idiosyncracies, things of that nature. Nothing remotely credible, I am afraid, although I have no doubt that Jake was sincere.\nI decided then to try another e-mail to Eric Schmidt (Sorry about that, Jake!). In the meantime, I\u2019d seen that Google searching \u201cclimategate\u201d (if one was willing to type in the whole phrase) now produced 22 million links.\nDear Mr. Schmidt,\nThank you for following up with Jake Hubert, who has reached out to me by telephone.\nUnfortunately, the explanation makes no more sense by phone than it did by e-mail.\nClimategate generates 22 million links on the main Google search engine. Global warming, by comparison, generates fewer than 11 million.\nThe idea that a numbers-driven algorithm stopped Google Suggest from filling in Climategate is absurd on its face. (Google Suggest, as it should, continues to in-fill global warming when a user begins typing it.)\nThese are my questions for you and your staff:\n1. Was Google contacted by Al Gore or any one of his business associates regarding climategate searches on Google? If so, when did the approach take place?\n2. What was the process that led to the decision to remove Climategate from the Google Suggest function?\n3. Will Climategate be added to the list of Google Suggest items again?\n4. Does Google feel that it acted according to its own highest ethical principles in this matter?\nThank you in advance for your consideration.\nSincerely yours,\nHarold Ambler\nI pushed send, got my daughter into her gymnastics gear, and rushed out the door. When I returned a little less than two hours later, I put my sleeping daughter on the couch and rushed upstairs to check my e-mail. Nada. Then I did a Google search, typing c-l-i-m \u2026 and there it was \u2013 offered by the gloriously user-friendly Google Suggest function \u2013 \u201cclimategate.\u201d\nCoincidence?\nYou never know.\nWas Google briefly complicit in the largest scientific scandal in at least a generation, attempting to minimize it behind the scenes? Like I said, you never, ever, ever, ever know. Ever.\nP.S. Four hours after the function returned, Google Suggest on \u201cclimategate\u201d was altered again. Instead of the single word \u201cclimategate,\u201d which yields 27 million links per search, Google now offers \u201cclimate gate scandal,\u201d which yields 6 million. Only by hand-typing the complete word \u201cclimategate,\u201d to the last letter, can users view an additional 21 million links. The evident message from on high? \u201cTamp it down.\u201d The apparent success of the strategy: close to non-existent.\nP.P.S. As of six days after this post (today is Tuesday December 8), Google Suggest no longer offers any choices for C-l-i-m-a-t-e-g-a-t-e, no matter how many letters one types. The total number of links appears to be stable around 30 million. The first reader who finds any Google search with 30 million or more links that Google Suggest doesn\u2019t assist with wins the prize.\n"}, {"score": 606.65015, "uuid": "997bf281-9b07-5344-a60a-b17f6099e51a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0809wb-14-28825", "target_hostname": "blogs.news.com.au", "target_uri": "http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climate_is_not_weather_and_australia_is_not_warm/", "page_rank": 1.1716151e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Weather <em>is</em> not climate, <em>and</em> Australia <em>is</em> not warm | Herald Sun Andrew Bolt", "snippet": "<em>What</em> makes today so significant here in Alice Springs <em>is</em> that if <em>the</em> <em>temperature</em> fails to rise above 6.3 before 9am tomorrow, then it has well <em>and</em> truly beaten <em>the</em> lowest daily maximum <em>temperature</em> <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> at <em>the</em> Alice Springs Airport site <em>and</em> also <em>the</em> old Alice Springs Post Office site.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tue 06 Jul 10 (07:23pm)\nSteve Franks replied to The Black Knight\nTue 06 Jul 10 (08:09pm)\nWeather trends are Weather trends not climate.\nClimates is the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other elements in a given region over long periods of time.

Damn fine computer modelling that.\nThis week the CRU are saying their models are getting worse, not better. Perhaps they need to consult some real scientists. Looking at the sun is somewhat damaging to the eyes, but studying it scientifically is proving to be rather useful.\u00a0 At this time the sun is resting after a few decades of frenzied activity, that caused a warming that was rather pleasant.\nThis holiday is looking much like a Maunder minimum, if it fails to awaken soon a LIA may ensue, that would be unpleasant and harsh on the worlds food supplies.\nWeather is climate, we live in a temperate zone so our climate is temperate weather.

The records at Alice Springs Airport go back to 1942 while the records go back to the late 1800\u2019s at the old Post Office site.

In the year 1802, Mr. Symmes entered the army of the United States in the office of ensign, from which he afterwards rose to that of captain. He continued in service until after the close of the war with Great Britain. While attached to the army he was universally esteemed a brave soldier and a zealous and faithful officer. He was in the memorable battle of Bridgewater, and was senior captain in the regiment to which he belonged. The company under his immediate command that day discharged seventy rounds of cartridges and repelled three desperate charges of the bayonet.\nAfterwards, in the sortie from Fort Erie, Captain Symmes with his command captured the enemy's battery number two, and with his own hand spiked the cannon it contained.\nDuring the period of about three years after the war, and after Captain Symmes had left the army, he was engaged in the difficult and laborious task of furnishing supplies to the troops stationed on the Upper Mississippi. Since that time he has resided at Newport, Kentucky, devoting, almost exclusively, the whole of his time and attention to the investigation and perfection of his favorite Theory of Concentric Spheres. In a short circular, dated St. Louis, 1818, Captain Symmes first promulgated the fundamental principles of this theory to the world.\nCaptain Symmes published two other numbers at St. Louis in the year 1818. His two next numbers, marked four and five, treated, the one of the original formation of the Alleghany Mountains, and the other claiming the discovery of open poles. His sixth number dates at Cincinnati, in January, 1819. His seventh number, entitled Arctic Memoir, is dated at Cincinnati in February, 1819. And another number, entitled Light between the Spheres, dated at Cincinnati in August, 1819, was published in the National Intelligencer. Afterwards, numerous pieces from the pen of Captain Symmes appeared in different newspapers.\nIndependent of his written publications, he has delivered a number of lectures on the theory, first at Cincinnati in 1820, and afterwards at various other places.\nIn 1822, Captain Symmes petitioned Congress, setting forth in the first place, his belief of the existence of a habitable and accessible concave to this globe; his desire to embark on a voyage of discovery to one or other of the polar regions; his belief in the great profit and honor his country would derive from such a discovery; and prayed that Congress would equip and fit out for the expedition two vessels of two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons' burden. This petition was presented by Richard M. Johnson, on the 7th March, 1822, when, after a few remarks, it was laid on the table. In December, 1823, he forwarded similar petitions to both houses of Congress, which met with a similar fate.\nThat Captain Symmes was a high-minded, honorable man is attested by all who knew him. He has devised a theory whereby to account for various singular and interesting phenomena, and most satisfactorily to explain a great variety of acknowledged facts.\n(under construction)\nJohn C. Symmes and Hollow Earth Claims\nPart One: Early Items\nFrom H. Howe's 1851 Historical Collections of Ohio\nSymmes's Theory.\nArt. XI. -- Symmes's Theory of Concentric Spheres;\ndemonstrating that the Earth is hollow, habitable within\nand widely open about the Poles. By a Citizen of the United States. Cincinnati, Ohio: 1826. 12mo. pp. 168.\nThe earth is nearly eight thousand miles in diameter, and the deepest excavations that have been made in it by human art, do not extend to half a mile below its surface. We are, therefore, utterly ignorant of the nature and composition of the interior of this immense mass, and must, perhaps, for ever remain so. The subject is of too much interest, however, not to have excited the particular attention of philosophers, and, in the absence of facts, many of them have not hesitated to resort to speculation and conjecture.\nDr. Burnet, the earliest cosmogonist whose system is worthy of norice, supposed that the earth was originally a fluid, chaotic mass, composed of various substances differing in form and density. In the course of time, the heaviest portions subsided, and formed about the centre a dense and solid nucleus. The waters took their station around this body; on their surface floated an ocean of oil and unctuous matters; and the whole was surrounded by the air and other ethereal fluids. This atmosphere was at first full of impurities, being charged with particles of the earth with which it had been previously blended. By degrees, however, it purified itself, by depositing these particles upon the stratum of oil; and there was formed a thick and solid crust of mould, which was the firts habitable part of the globe. After many centuries, this crust, having been gradually dried by the heat of the sun, cracked and split asunder, so as to fall into the abyss of waters beneath it; and this great event was the universal deluge. Our present earth is composed of the remains of the first; our continents and islands being portions of the primordial crust, from which the waters have retired.\nDr. Woodward, who immediately followed Burnet in this career of speculation, supposed that the bodies which compose the earth, were all dissolved or suspended in teh waters of the general deluge; and that on the gradual retiring of the waters, these substances subsided, successively, in the order of their specific gravities; so that the earth is now formed of distinct strata, arranged in concentric layers, \"like the coats of an onion.\"\nWhiston supposed the original earth to be a comet, having, liek other comets, a very eccentric orbit; and, therefore, subject to such extremes of heat and cold, as to be uninhabitable. At the period of the creation described by Moses, the earth was placed in its present orbit, which is nearly circular, and was in consequence subjected to a great variety of important changes. The heavier parts of the chaotic atmosphere, by which the comet was surrounded, fell gradually upon the nucleus, and formed a great liquid abyss, on which the crust of the earth was finally deposited, and now floats. This crust, and the subterraneous fluid, are each fifty or one hundred miles in thickness; and within them lies the solid nucleus or original comet, which contains another rarer fluid, and a central loadstone. Thus, says this philospher: --\n\"The interior or entire constitution of the earth, is correspondent to that of an egg; where the central solid is answerable to the yolk, which by its fiery colour, great bulk, and innermost situation, exactly represents the same: where the great abyss is analogous to the white, whose density, viscosity, moderate fluidity, and middle portion, excellently express the like qulaities of the other: where the upper orb, or habitable earth, corresponds to the shell, whose lightness, solidity, little inequalities of surface, and uppermost situation, admirably agree to the same.\"\nThe deluge was caused by the near approach of a comet, which, by its strong attraction, caused the waters of the great deep to break through the crust, which enclosed them, and which also furnished a vast mass of vapours from its own atmosphere.\nIt will be observed, that all these theories agree in supposing the earth to be composed of successive shells, placed one within the other. The great astronomer, Hally, also adopted the hypothesis of a sphere revolving within the earth, in order to account for the variation of the magnetic needle, and in this opinion he was followed by Euler; so that the theory of \"concentric spheres,\" has been one of the oldest and most prevalent in geology.\nThe theory of the celebrated Buffon is very generally known. He supposed that the earth was struck off from the sun by a comet, and was, therefore, at first, no more than an irregular mass of melted and inflamed matter. This mass, by the mutual attraction of its parts, assumed a globular figure, which its rotary motion, caused by the obliquity of the first impulse, changed into a spheroid. The interior of the globe is, according to this theory, a vitrified mass, which the author maintains to be homogeneous, and not, as is generally thought, dispoded in layers following the order of density.\nThese are the most remarkable theories that have been presented, on the subject of the structure of the earth. It is proper to remark, that they were the productions of men of genius and learning; that they were maintained by arguments full of plausibility, and, even now, difficult of refutation; and that they attracted great attention, and made many proselytes. Yet, such is the just destiny reserved fore all extravagent and romantic speculations, that, at the present day, they have not a single advocate or believer, and are mentioned only to be condemned.\nBut these philosophic fancies have all been far outdone by the theory of our countryman captain Symmes, who, for the last nine or ten years, has been using every exertion to convince the world of its past errors, and to inculcate his own new and true theory. The newspapers have teemed with essays; circulars have been addressed to all the learned societies of Europe and America; addresses and petitions have been presented to our national and state legislatures; certificates of conviction and \"ashesion\" have been procured from men in high literary and political stations; the master and his disciples have traversed the whole country, from south to north, and from west to east, so that all men, in all places, might be enlightened in the truth; and, finally, the whole subject has been reduced to a regular body of doctrine, in the work now under review, written by \"one of the believers in the theory.\"\nLet us hear, from the author himself, a statement of this famous theory. It is presented as follows, in his second chapter:--\n\"According to Symmes's Theory, the earth, as well as all the celestial orbicular bodies existing in the universe, visible and invisible, which partake in any degree of a planetary nature, from the greatest to the smallest, from the sun, down to the most minute blazing meteor or falling star, are all consituted in a greater or less degree, of a collection of spheres, more or less solid, concentric with each other, and more or less open at their poles; each sphere being separated from its adjoining compeers by space replete with aerial fluids; an dthat every portion of infinite space, except what is occupied by sheres, is filled with an aerial elastic fluid, more subtile than common atmospheric air; and constituted of innumerable small concentric spheres, (open at the poles?) too minute to be visible to the organ of sight assisted by the most perfect microscope, and so elastic that they continually press on each other,\" &c.\nThe author here indulges himself in a dream respecting these infintesimal spherules, but after some time, returns to the more substantial part of the theory.\n\"According to captain Symmes, the planet which has been designated the Earth, is composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces between each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well upon the concave as the convex surface. Each of these spheres are widely open at their poles. The north polar opening of the sphere we inhabit, is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and the southern above six thousand. The planes of these polar openings are inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at an angle of about twenty degrees; so that the real axis of the earth, being perpendicular to the plane of the equator, will form an angle of twelve degrees with a line passing through the sphere at right angles with the plane of the polar openings; consequently the verge of the polar openings must approach several nearer to the equator on one side than on the other. The highest north point, or where the distance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the opening in the northern hemisphere, will be found either in the northern sea, near the coast of Lapland, or on a meridian passing through Spitzbergen, in about latitude sixty-eight degrees, or somewhat more eastwardly in Lapland; and the verge would become apparent, to the navigator proceeding north, in about latitude ninety degrees.\nThe lowermost point, or the place where the distance is least from the equator to the verge of the polar opening, will be found in the Pacific ocean, about latitude fifty degrees, near the north-west coast of America, on or near a meridian running through the mouth of Cook's river, being in about one hundred and sixty degrees west longitude, the real verge being in about latitude fifty degrees and becoming apparent to a person traveling northward at right angles with the magnetic equator, at the distance of about twelve hundred miles further. The verge varies progressively from the lowest to the highest point, crossing the north-west coast of America between latitude fifty-two and fifty-four, thence across the continent of North America, passing through Hudson's Bay and Greenland, near Cape Farewell; thence by mount Hecla to the highest point; thence tending gradually more to the south, across the northern parts of Asia, at or near the volcanoes of Kamtschatka, along the extinguished volcanoes of the Fox Islands, to the lowermost point again, near the north-west coast.\nIn the southern hemisphere, the highest point, or place where the distance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the polar opening, will be found in the southern Pacific ocean, in about latitude forty-six degrees south, and perhaps about longitude one hundred and thirty degrees west; and the lowermost point, or place where the distance is least from the equator to the verge of the opening, will be found on a meridian south or south-east of the island of Madagascar, in about latitude thirty-four degrees south, and longitude about fifty degrees east; thence passing near the cape of Good Hope, across the Atlantic ocean, and southern part of the continent of America, through a chain of active volcanoes, to the highest point; thence bearing regularly toward the lowest point, passing between the two islands of New-Zealand, or across the most southerly one, and the norternmost part of Van Dieman's land, to the lowest point, which is south or southeast of Madagascar; the apparent verge being several hundred miles beyond the real verge. Consequently, according to this formation of the sphere, the degrees of latitude, on different meridians, will varry according to their distance from the polar openings; and the magnetic equator; which encircles the sphere, parallel to the plane of the polar openings, would cut the real equator at an angle of twelve degrees. A person standing on the highest part of the apparent verge would appear under the pole star, or nearly so, and at the nintieth degree of latitude. The meridians all converge to the highest point of the verge, or the ninetieth degree; consequently in tracing a meridian of longitude, you would pursue a direction at right angles to the equator, until you arrived in the neighbourhood of the real verge if the polar opening, when the meridians would change their direction and turn along between the real and apparent verges towards the highest point, until they all terminated at the ninetieth degree of latitude; this being the direction a person would have to travel in order to have his back to the sun always at twelve o'clock, the time of his greatest altitude. Although the particular location of the places where the verges of the polar openings are believed to exist, may not have been ascertained with absolute certainty, yet they are believed to be nearly correct; their localities having been ascertained from appearances that exist in those regions; such as a belt or zone surrounding the globe where trees and otehr vegetation (except moss) do not grow; the tides of the ocean flowing in different directions, and appearing to meet; the existence of volcanoes; the \"ground swells\" in the sea being more frequent; the Aurora Borealis appearing to the southward; and various other phenomena existing in and about the same regions, mark the relative position of the real verges.\nThe heat and cold of the different climates are governed by their distance from the verge of the polar opening, and do not depend on their nearness or remoteness from the equator. The natural climates are parallel to the planes of the oplar openings, and cut the parallels of latitude at an angle of twelve degrees. When the sun is on the tropic of Capricorn, the circle of greatest cold would be about twenty-three and a hald degrees south of the apparent verge, and when the sun is on the tropic of Cancer, this circle would probably be just under the umbrage of the real verge: hence it follows, if this doctrine be correct, that the climate oif forty degrees north latitude on the plains of Missouri, in the western part of the continent of America, will be as cold in winter, as the latitude of fifty or fifty-two degrees in Europe; and observation has fully confirmed such to be a fact.\nThe magnetic principle which gives polarity to the needle, is believed to be regulated by the polar openings, and that the nedle always points directly to the opening, and of course parallel to a line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the opening. And when the apparent verge shall be passed, the needle will seem to turn nearly round, so as to point in an opposite direction; having the contrary end north on the interior of the sphere, that was north on the exterior, the same end being north on the interior which was south on the exterior. Hence when navigators arrive in the neighbourhood of the apparent verge, the variation of the needle is more or less reversed. The magnetic needle, on arriving at the verge, would appear to cease to pursue the same direction, but would in reality continue to maintain it, and lead directly into the polar opening.\nEach of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting the other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable both on the inner and the outer surface; and lighted and warmd according to those general laws which communicate light and heat to every other part of the universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so intense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes (about where the verge is suppose dto commence) by the paleness of the sun, and darkness of the sky; facts, which various navigators, who have visited those regions, confirm; yet they are no doubt sufficently lighted and warmed to promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable life.\nThe disciples of Symmes believe that each sphere has a cavity, or mid-plane space, near the centre of the matter composing it, filled with a very light, subtile, elastic substance, partaking somewhat, perhaps, of the nature of hydrogen gas; which aerial fluid is composed of molecules greatly rarified in comparison with the gravity of the extended or exposed surfaces of the sphere. This mid-plane space tends to give the sphere a degree of lightness and bouyancy. Besides this large mid-plane space, perhaps numerous other interstices exist in the sphere nearer the surface, and of more limited extent. The gas excaping from these spaces is, no doubt, the cause of earthquakes; and supply the numerous volcanoes. This gas, becoming rarified amd escaping, must occasion most of those great revolutions and phenomena in nature, which we know to have occured in the geology of the earth. This aerial fluid, with which the mid-plane spaces are filled, may possibly be adapted to the support of animal life; and the interior surfaces of the spheres formed by them, may abound with animals, with organs only adapted to the medium which they are destine dto inhabit.\"\nSuch is the general outline, given by our author, of the strange theory of Symmes. The arguments which he adduces in support of it are very numerous, and they have been thought, by many persons, to be plausible, if not convincing. We shall now present some of the most prominent of these arguments, and accompany them by sucj remarks as they must naturally suggest, without particular research, to any one tolerably conversant with the subjects to which they refer. Indeed, it would be trifling with the patience of our readers, to enter at large into the discussion of thsi matter; and we have, ourselves, neither the inclination nor the lesiure to do so.\nThe reasons in support of the theory, which are drawn from the mechanical properties of matter, are given in the third chapter; and, as might be supposed, our theorist places his great dependence on the centrifugal force arising from the earth's rotation about its axis.\n\"Were the matter of this globe thrown into a confused, disorganized state, and then put into a quick rotary motion, such as it is known to have, it would throw off from the centre towards the surface, first the heaviest, and next the lighter substances, which is the very order in which they are found to be arranged in the composition of the earth.\nThis principle, for it is simply the principle of projectile force, will account for mountains, hills, valleys, plains; and for nearly all the inequalities on the face of the erath. These circumstances depend on the density of substances composing the earth. Substances of the greatest specific gravity are susceptible of the greatest projectile force; and hence we find that mountains are composed of heavy masses of rock, mineral substances, and heavy earths; hills, or the next highest eminences, of earth of the next specific gravity; and plains, or level lands, of lighter substances.\"\nNothing can be more completely at variance both with reason and with facts, than the principle which is here asserted. The centrifugal force to which a body is subjected, is proportional, not to its absolute velocity, as our author always seems to suppose, but to the deflection fromn the tangent, produced by the rotation, in a given time, as in a second. The firce of gravity is proportional to the space through which a body will fall in a second. Both of these can be readily ascertained; and it has been found, that, at the equator, where the centrifugal force is the greatest, and that of gravity the least, the former is but one 289th part of the latter. Every one, indeed, can see, by the almost irresistable power with which heavy masses are bound to the earth, that the force of gravity far transcends the centrifugal force, and that it is therefore absurd to suppose that this last could have raised the Alps and the Andes, or have produced the many other wonderful effects ascribed to it in the new theory.\nThe author gives no distinct notion of the manner in which the concentric spheres are formed, and is indeed evidently embarrassed when he comes to this subject. He states that he \"has long had strong doubts whether the laws of gravity are well understood, or whether the rules on which calculations respecting the form of the earth could eb made, are exactly known.\" In these difficulties, he sagely determines \"to take the broad principles of nature for his guide,\" and then, with perfect gravity, presents us with such reasonings as the following: \"The earth must be composed of concentric spheres, because the water on the side of a cutler's grindstone arranges itself into \"something resembling concentric circles, one within another, and the surface of the earth (he apprehends) revolves with much greater velocity than any grindstone.\" -- Again, the appearance presented when steel filings are sifted upon a card placed over a magnet, (satisfactorily explained in all books of natural philosophy,) is supposed \"to illustrate that a disposition to concentric spheres does exist in nature.\" Again, the earth must be hollow, because Capt. Symmes supposes that the meteoric stones are so, since they burst like a bomb-shell, and some fo the fragments have curved surfaces.\nThe author, asopting the maxim of\nstill goes on with reasons, though they increase in absurdity. \"Inquire of the botanist, and he will tell you, that the plants which grow up spontaneously, agreeably to the established laws of nature, are hollow cylinders:\" (for example, the forest trees, &c.) \"Inquite of the anatomist, and he will tell you, that the large bones of all animals are hollow. Go to the mineralogist, and he will inform you that the stone called aerolite, (oolite?) and many other mineral bodies, are composed of hollow concentric circles.\" Lastly, \"he cannot perceive any thing more derogatory from the power, wisdom, or divine economy of the Almighty, in the formation of a hollow world, than in that of solid ones; and he is rather of opinion, that a construction of all the orbs in creation, on a plan corresponding to Symmes's theory, would display the highest possible degree of perfection, wisdom, and (as Dr. Mitchell expresses it), a great saving of stuff.\"\nThus ends the chapter. Let us now ourselves briefly inquire into the light which we may derive from the sciences, as to the structure of our earth. In the first place, then, we remark, that the fact of the earth's having a globular form, is string evidence that it must once have been composed of fluid, or, at least, of plastic materials. Now, on this supposition, to determine the form that would be assumed by the earth, in consequence of the mutual actions of gravity and the centrifugal force upon its several parts, becomes a problem of mechanics, which has been completely solved by many mathematicians. The Cartesians, who believed that the gravitating force urged all particles directly to the center of the globe, found, by an easy calculation, that, supposing the earth of uniform density, its form must be an oblate spheroid, having the equatorial and polar diameters in the ration of 578 to 577; an ellipticity which is much too small. The problem to be solved by the Newtonian philosophers, was much more difficult. As the attractive force resides in all particles, it will be itself modified by the form of the earth, and thus the very result of which we are in search, enters as an element in the calculation. This difficulty has been overcome; and the figure of the earth has been determined, not only on the hypothesis of its being homogenous, but on the probable supposition of an increase in the density of the strata as we descend below the surface. In every case, the earth must be a solid spheroid. If homogeneous, the ratio of the diameters will be 230 to 229; if increasing in density downwards, the ellipticity will not be so great.\nThese conclusions, it must be observed, are to a certain extent hypothetical. It is evident that the matter at the surface of the earth is not homogeneous, and we are wholly ignorant of the nature of that which constitutes the interior portions. We have means, however, for conducting our inquiries, which are free from this objection. Of these the most important is the measurement of different degrees of meridian, an operation which has been executed with great accuracy, at different points, from the equator, to nearly sixty-seven degrees of north latitude. These measures show some irregularity in the form of the earth, but agree, on the whole, remarkably well with the above hypothesis. They show that the earth is an oblate spheroid, having the compression equal to .0032. This ellipticity is less than that which would correspond to a homogeneous earth, and shows that, far from being hollow, the density increases towards the centre.\nThese rigid measures have not been extended to captain Symmes's verge; for it is worthy of note, that he has placed his highest point about one degree beyond the most northern measurement, which was made in Lapland by the Swedish academicians. WE shall return to this subject.\nAnother mode of estimating the figure of the earth, is by the force of gravity at different points of its surface, which may be determined by the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. Very accurate experiments have been made on this subject, in various places, from the Falkland Islands, in latitude 51 degrees 31 seconds 43 minutes south, to Spitzbergen, in latitude 79 degrees 49 minutes 58 seconds north. The results have been lately compared to a mean ellipticity of .0033, being very nearly the same as that deduced from the measurements of the meridian, and wholly inconsistent with the notion that the earth is hollow, or that it has an oblique and distorted figure... we may, therefore, consider it demonstrated, that the density of the earth increases toward the centre, so that it cannot be hollow.\nBut Capt. Symmes not only believes the earth to be hollow, but that it is inhabited on the inner surface. If it be so, the inhabitants must be placed in a most unstable position. Let us first suppose that there are but one of these soperical shells, and that it is symmetrical and complete. It is well known that a body placed within such a sphere will be equally attracted in all directions; and if it adhere to the surface, it can be only in consequence of the centrifugal force due to the earth;s rotation, Now we have seen that the maximum of this force is but the 289th part of gravity. Within the shell, it must be still less... so that here, a man of one hundred and fifty pounds' weight, would adhere to the surface with a force of but eight ounces... and it would be one of the advantages of these inner men, that they might fly through the air, with great ease, by the aid of a lady's fan.\nCapt. Symmes imagines that the sea extends quite through the outer sphere, in many places, and that seals, whales, and herrings are in the custom of passing through. But this notion is contradicted by the known laws of nature. If we suppose a column of water forming such a communication, the gravitation of its particles would indeed diminish, as they approached nearer to the inner surface; for the sperical shell, which is exterior to any particle, does not contribute to its weight. A portion of the water, near the base, might therefore, if alone, be supported by the centrifugal force. But it must be observed, that this portion is not independent, but is urged downward by the pressure of the incumbant mass, so that the whole must sink into the abyss below...\nFrom the earth, our theorist passes into the heavens, and thinks he can find there striking evidences of his system. Let us follow him for a few moments.\nThe phenomenon upon which he places the greatest dependence, is the ring, or rather the rings, of Saturn.\n\"The appearance of Saturn, I conceive, establishes the fact, that the principle of concentric spheres, or hollow planets, does exist, at least in one instance, in the solar system. And if the fact be established that it exists in one case, is it not fair, nay, is it not almost a certain and necessary consequences, that the same laws of matter which formed one planet into concentric spheres, must form all the others on a plan more or less the same? If we draw any conclusion, or form any opinion at all respecting the formation of the planets, whose inner parts we cannot see; or, if we form any opinion in relation to our own planet in particular, whose poles have never been explored, would not reasoning from analogy bring us to the cinslusion, that all bodies of matter are formed similar to that of Saturn, unless we have positive proof to the contrary?\"\nNow, nothing surely can less resemble concentric spheres than these rings. They are plates of matter, so thin, that when theire edges are turned toward us, they are completely invisible... In fact, the ring revolves like a satellite, and its periodical time has been to be exactly the same as that which the laws of Kepler would require for a satellite places at the same mean distance from the planet. Thus the ring of Saturn, instead of leading us to the adoption of any new laws of nature, serves to illustrate and confirm those which were already established, and by which we have shown the impossibility of Symmes's theory....\nThe appearances of the sun and moon puzzle our system-maker, as well they may. He makes, indeed, a kind of apology for them, but it is far from being satidfactory. We see the whole of the sun's disc brightly illuminated, and it has not the most distant appearance of polar openings. The moon, too, is our immediate neighbour, and every appearance on its surface can be accurately distinguished. The liberation in latitude latitude enables us, moreover, to see both its poles in succession. Direct observations can, therefor, be made, and they all unite in showing that the moon has no polar openings.\nBut the ungrateful moon affords still further evidences against the theory of these visionaries. In the lunar eclipses, the shadow of the earth is thrown upon the moon's surface, and thus a profile of the earth is exhibited. It is always sensibly circular. But if there were sections of four to six thousand miles in diameter cut off from the poles, this could not fail, in certain positions of the sun, to be plainly and palpably shown...\nWe come now to consider the arguments which are drawn from the evidence of voyagers and travellers in the arctic regions. This evidence, it would indeed seem, must be decisive of the question, if any question still remain; for seas and lands, far within the imaginary verges, have been repeatedly traversed, in all directions, and no signs of a polar opening have been perceived. Captain Symmes endeavours to evade this difficulty, by his winding meridians; and it is certainly true, that, if the earth have the distorted figure which he imagines, most of the meridians will no longer lie in a plane...\nThe open sea, which is reported to be found about the poles, has been adduced as a string evidence in favour of the new theory. As to the north pole, we may now, perhaps, consider this as dountful, as it is certainly not confirmed by the resulkts of the late voyages. Still it is very possible, that, in summer, the currents may carry the ice into lower latitudes, so as to leave the polar regions comparatively free...\nThe migration of the animals of the arctic regions to the north in winter, and their return to the south in summer, is strongly asserted, and it is of course imagined that they retreat into the inner earth for comfortable quarters. To this argument we reply, that it is not supported by facts. The deer, musk ox, and other quadrupeds, mentioned by our author, are not properly migratory animals, and their occasional changes of situation are irregular, and seem to be governed only by the search for food.... With regard to the other animals mentioned, we believe the author to be equally mistaken in his facts, particularly as to the migratory fish, whose winter retreat is probably in the deep sea, where the temperature is uniform and moderate.\nBUt, according to our author, the Esquimaux themselves also go north in winter, to enjoy the comforts of the pole. In proof of this, the only direct evidence that id adduced, is a conversation that took place with the first natives met by captain Ross, in his voyage to Baffin's Bay... From this conversation our author infers, that \"these people must live in a country not composed of ice, for it seems they deem such an one uninhabitable...\" Now it happens that this mysterious country was but a short distance from the place where the interview occurred; that it was, soon after, visited by captain Ross; and that he examined and describes \"the nature of the country, its produce, inhabitants, lanuage, mode of living, manners, customs, and religion.\" It is situate between the latitudes seventy-six degrees and seventy-seven degrees forty minutes north, and the longitudes sixty degrees and seventy degrees west....\nThe immense distance at which objects are said to be seen occasionally in the polar regions, is another facts brought by our author in support of his theory... Now the optical fact alluded to, was one of a series of phenomena due to the extraordinary refraction which is called looming, and which is witnessed in all latitudes....\nThe last argument that we shall mention, (for it is time to bring this discussion to a close,) is contained in the following paragraph:\n\"Those appearances observed in the southern hemisphere, which are termed Magellanic clouds, by navigators, have not, so far as I know, been accounted for... their colour is like that of far distant mountains, on which the sun is shining.... They are stationary, appearing perpetually fixed at a certain height, and in a given situation, as viewed from any given place. The stars and the heavens, in their diurnal revolutions, sweep by them... These clouds are only seen in the night, when the atmosphere is clear, at which time the sun is shining on the islands in question.\"\nStrange as it may seem, the statements which are here made respecting the Mage;;anic clouds, are wholly unfounded. These meteors are in fact nebulae, composed of clusters of telescopic stars, like the milky way; have their fixed place in the heaveans, like the other constellations; and revolve regularly about the pole in twenty-four hours. All this is so notorious, that it is astonishing how the whole Symmes school could have remaind ignorant of it. Even a common celestial globe would have shown them these constellations, near the south pole, under the names of Nebulea major, and Nebula minor....\nOur author next gives a chapter, on what the Symmesites call mid-plane spaces, and explains, by their aid, earthquakes and volcanoes, and sundry other phenomena. Our readers will readily excuse us from entering into a discussion of these matters.\nOne of the favourite projects of the adherents of Symmes's theory, is the establishment of an expedition to explore the inner earth. Our author devotes a chapter to this subject; and the master of the sect is now travelling, from place to place, and, like a second Peter the Hermit, zealously preaching up a crusade to this Holy Land. We are gravely told, that, to judge by the size of the seals, and bears, (and Esquimaux,) which come from the interior of the globe, it must be better suitd for animal life than the portion which has fallen to our lot, so that by emigrating to this land of promise, we may probably be relieved from many of the evils to which mankind are subjected here above. If our old-fashioned philosophy be correct, however, we fear that this desireable change can never be effected, and that we must be content to finish the journey of life, in the less comfortable condition of outside passengers,\nThe work is concluded by a biographical notice of the founder os the new theory. That posterity may not, as in the case of Homer and other great men, dispute about his birth-place, it is announced that this distinguished honour belongs to our sister state of New-Jersey. It appears that he fought barvely during the late war; and we are certainly not disposed to deny, that a very unsound philosopher, may be a gallant soldier and an estimable man. -- (excerpts from American Quarterly Review Vol. I, No. 1, Mar. 1827: pp. 235-253)\nVarious Articles on\nJohn C.

D.\n(In the preparation of this article I have been greatly indebted to my friend Robert Clarke, Esq., of Cincinnati. He kindly furnished me with... a biographical sketch of Captain Symmes that will appear in the second volume of \"McBride's Pioneer Biographies\"...)\nDuring the first quarter of the present century the interest in Polar explorations was scarcely less absorbing than it has been for the last twenty years.... In all the past the discovery of unknown lands and peoples has had a strange fascination for a class of men of marked intelligence and courage. The broad expanse of blue sea, untrodden paths in the wilderness, desert wastes of land and snow with all their perils and privations, have charms for these men that we of quiet ways and common ambitions can not understand. Some of these explorers have been dreamers and enthusiasts, searching for fountains of eternal youth and mines of gold and precious stones, or had aspirations for kingly power; others were led on by the noble ambition of building up the kingdom of Christ by converting heathen nations from their idolatry. They have always been ready to aid the great commercial and scientific leaders in working out their hopes and plans, or proving the baselessness of their hasty theories....\nMany of these theories of the earth's surface have been fanciful and grotesque, and their authors coveted in vain the opportunity of proving their faith. One of these more marked than any other of modern times in these respects was first announced in print from the city from which we now write. The face of the author was familiar to many still living, and his body sleeps quietly in the old burying-ground at Hamilton, Ohio. We refer to Captain John Cleve [sic, Cleves?] Symmes and his curious theory of \"Concentric Spheres,\" and an opening at the poles by which men could pass into the interior of the earth. Dying, he believed that time would prove his fancies true, and place his name beside or above Newton's. This dreamer and his startling or curious theories will be the subject of this paper. In the Spring of 1818 the good people of St. Louis were interested and amused in turn by the following, circular... [transcript follows]...\nCaptain Symmes was well known among the best and most intelligent citizens of St. Louis, and was highly esteemed even by those who had no faith in his theories. He had his family residence for a number of years at Bellefontaine, the old United States military post some sixteen miles above the city, on the banks of the Mississippi River, which post was superseded years ago by the present well-known Jefferson Barracks.... The \"Captain\" was born in New Jersey in 1780, and having received a good English education, entered the United States army, in his twenty-second year, as ensign. By regular and well-earned promotion he reached the grade of captain in 1812. During the war that was then pending he served faithfully and with distinction, retiring from the army in 1816. The greater portion of his military life was spent in the South-West.\nOn returning to civil life he engaged in furnishing supplies to the Government troops stationed on the Upper Mississippi... At the time when his first circular was published he was in the strength of his manhood, and is described as of middle stature and fairly proportioned; face somewhat small and oval, and attractive blue eyes that gave indication of a mind absorbed in speculation.... His voice was not good, nor did he succeed as a speaker, although frequently speaking in his later years before mixed audiences. Men of ability were readily attached to him, and he was greatly beloved by all who knew him well.\nThe late Col. M'Bride, of Hamilton, Ohio, who was his devoted friend and disciple, and published a small volume in 1826 in exposition and defense of his theory, describes it as follows:\n\"According to Symmes's Theory, the earth, as well as all the celestial orbicular bodies existing in the universe, visible and invisible, which partake in any degree of a planetary nature, from the greatest to the smallest, from the sun down to the most minute blazing meteor or falling star, are all constituted, in a greater or less degree, of a collection of spheres, more or less solid, concentric with each other, and more or less open at their poles * * *\n\"According to him, the planet which has been designated the Earth is composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces between each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well upon the concave as the convex surface. All of these spheres are widely open at their poles. The north polar opening of the sphere we inhabit is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and the southern above six thousand * * * * Although the particular location of the places where the verges of the polar openings are believed to exist, may not have been ascertained with absolute certainty, yet they are believed to be nearly correct, their localities having been ascertained from appearances that exist in those regions: such as a belt or zone surrounding the globe where trees and other vegetation -- except mosses -- do not grow; the tides of the ocean flowing in different directions, and appearing to meet; the existence of volcanoes; the 'groundswells' in the sea being more frequent; the aurora borealis appearing to the southward; and various other phenomena existing in and about the same regions, mark the relative position of the real verges.\n\"According to this formation of the sphere, a traveler or navigator might proceed true north any where west of the highest point of the verge, say on the continent of America, until he came to the verge. The meridian on which he was traveling would then wind along the verge to the right, until he arrived at the ninetieth degree; and by proceeding south, in the same direction, he would arrive at the coast of Siberia, without going far into the concavity of the sphere, and without knowing that he had been within the verge.\n\"Each of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting the other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable both on the inner and outer surface; and lighted and warmed according to those general laws which communicate light and heat to every part of the universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so intense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes -- about where the verge is supposed to commence -- by the paleness of the sun, and darkness of the sky; facts, which navigators who have visited these regions confirm; yet they are no doubt sufficiently lighted and warmed to promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable life.\"\nWe have culled these passages which give a general idea of the theory, which had been wrought out by Captain Symmes during a course of many years, until, when the circular was issued, it had mastered his whole life, and was to give cast to all his remaining days. Many of his arguments were too abstruse for the satisfaction of the general reader.... He did not doubt that he had penetrated the secret of the plan on which all the heavenly bodies had been constructed. But there were also terrestrial appearances and facts upon which he relied as valuable confirming evidences. The migration of animal life in the Arctic regions, to which all polar navigators had called attention, tended to sustain his theory. Shoals of fish came from the north, darkening the waters by their presence, in the Spring season; great droves of reindeer came down from the same region in March or April, and returned northward in October; the same periods and direction of movement marked the innumerable fowls of the arctic seas. We now account for these movements of animal life by our theories of an open sea; but he was satisfied that they came from quiet waters, serene skies, and luxuriant vegetation within the hollow earth....\nCopies of circular No. I were addressed to every institution of learning in the United States, and to nearly all of our distinguished men then living.... Jest and levity met it on every side; but what annoyed its author more was, that men were not willing to join him in argument, so ridiculous seemed his theory. I well remember when a boy, in Cincinnati, that \"Symmes's Hole\" was the synonym of absurdity. But undaunted by such a reception from the public, the first circular was followed by others and newspaper articles, in which he stoutly maintained the correctness of his views, sustaining himself with the reflection that many others who had given the world new ideas had been treated with corresponding neglect and contempt.\nIn 1819 he removed from St. Louis and made his residence at Newport, Kentucky, and in the following year, finding that he made slow progress in the use of his pen, he determined to enter the field as a lecturer. At Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Zanesville in Ohio, and at Lexington and Frankfort in Kentucky, large and intelligent audiences were assembled who gave him a respectful attention. The attraction of the lecture was the novelty of the theme, and then the honesty and earnestness of the lecturer commanded attention and respect. But few were won to his side or had the courage to confess that they sympathized with him. Especially he failed to convince men of wealth, from whom he hoped to obtain the means to fit out an expedition to the polar regions. As a last resort he determined to solicit aid from the National Government and the States. So in the year 1822 he addressed a petition to the Congress of the United States setting forth his views at length, and his belief that the nation would derive great honor, and possibly profit, by the verification of his theory. Congress was therefore urged to fit out an expedition consisting of two vessels of two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons burden, with supplies and men, for a voyage of discovery. It was his desire to command and be responsible for the success of the undertaking. This petition was presented to the Senate by Colonel R. M. Johnson, of Kentucky. A motion to refer it to the Committee on Foreign Relations was lost, and, without much delay, it was laid on the table. In the following year he tried again to gain the attention of Congress, but utterly failed. He now turned to the Legislature of Ohio, asking them to approve of his enterprise and recommend Congress to furnish him with the means to prosecute a voyage of discovery in the North. His petition was read, and then its further consideration was indefinitely postponed....\nAbout this time the Russian Government, which had taken great interest in polar discoveries, was fitting out an expedition, at great expense, under the direction of Count Romanoff, a distinguished patron of science. Captain Symmes applied, through our minister at the Court of St. Petersburg, for permission to accompany the expedition. The application was cheerfully granted, but he was unable to procure a proper outfit, and had to abandon the project.\nStill hoping for success, in the Fall of 1825, accompanied by a young lawyer of Ohio who was a convert to his views, he set out to make a tour eastward, intending to lecture at all the considerable towns on the route. His health was beginning to fail, and he was forced for a time to return home. But in the following year he was again in the field, and lectured at Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, passing into Canada. But his labors, and the excitement, and discouragements of his plans -- for every where he was ridiculed or looked upon as a lunatic -- preyed upon his health, and he reluctantly sought rest among his friends in his native place. As soon as he was sufficiently restored he turned homeward, broken down in spirit. He had moved his family to a farm near Hamilton, Ohio, and his great desire was to enjoy the sympathy and consolation of those who loved him. He was so feeble when he reached Cincinnati that he was removed with great difficulty to his home, but with tender care. On the 29th of May, wearied and worn out by the ten years of anxiety, disappointment, and toil which he had borne with wonderful patience, he fell asleep in death.\nHis oldest son, who still lives near Louisville, Kentucky, erected a monument over his remains, which is still to be seen...\nCaptain Symmes deserves a tender remembrance, and his friends never failed to cherish his memory, and regret that his last years were so full of cheerless mortification. Had the opportunity been afforded him to penetrate the polar latitudes, his faith and courage would have made him one of the boldest adventurers, and he would scarcely have failed to return with useful information and the broader and more truthful views that are now held by intelligent men. No man of his day had studied the subject more thoroughly, and his plans for penetrating the icy North were those that later explorers have adopted with advantage. But his theory has so many of the elements that are woven into childish Munchausen stories, that few men could consider it with any degree of seriousness... -- (excerpts from The Ladies' Repository Vol. 8, No. 2, Aug 1871: pp.133-136)\nTHE \u00a0SYMMES \u00a0THEORY \u00a0OF \u00a0THE \u00a0EARTH.\nby P. Clark.\nThis theory originated some fifty years ago with Captain John Cleves Symmes of Newport, Kentucky. He was a captain in the United States Army, and spent the best part of his life in the service of his country. He was a man of decided ability, and a bold and original thinker.\nDissatisfied with the Newtonian theory of the earth, he promulgated his own, by sundry articles in the press, and by lectures before the faculties and students of colleges in different parts of the country.... During the winter of 1826-27 he lectured before the faculty and students of Union College, and by none was he heard with more profound attention than by the learned and venerable Drs. Nott and Wayland. The writer was a member of the Senior Class of 1827, and in common with other members of his class took copious notes.\nFrom these notes he has prepared the present article, claiming only to present the theory of Captain Symmes as propounded in his lectures at Union, adding, indeed, some new facts from recent explorations, and drawing from them some inferences in accordance with the theory.\nAccording to this, the earth is globular, hollow, and open at the poles. The diameter of the northern opening is about two thousand miles, or four thousand miles from outside to outside. The south opening is somewhat larger.... The shell of the earth is about one thousand miles thick, and the edges of this shell at the openings are called verges...\nThe line which marks the location of the apex of the northern verge begins at a point in Lapland... through Hudson's Bay and over the continent to the Pacific... crossing the south part of Kamtchatka, continuing northwest through Siberia, entering Europe across the Ural Mountains... to the point of starting.\nCaptain Symmes collated with great labor many isolated facts from his own researches, and from the accounts of Ross, Howe, Parry, McKenzie, and others who had by sea and land explored the polar regions, while similar proofs have been drawn from later explorations, since the promulgation of the theory in 1829....\nThere is a remarkable difference of climate under different meridians upon the same parallel of latitude. It is known that the climate of the eastern coast of North America is much colder than that of Western Europe in the same latitude. The notion that this diversity is produced by the proximity of the ocean or of ranges of mountains is unsatisfactory...The Gulf Stream does not satisfactorily account for this diversity of climate between America and Europe....\nThe characteristics of the isothermal belts of both hemispheres throw some light upon this theory. The region of the verges must be the coldest parts of the earth's surface, because, being more convex, they diverge instead of converging the sun's rays. The temperature, therefore, of any given part of the earth's surface depends as well upon its proximity to the verge as to the equator....\nThus, while this theory does not explain all the phenomena of climatic differences as indicated by the isothermal belts, it affords a general rule for explaining why the climate of Europe is milder than that of North America....\nThe theory of ocean currents will not explain these climatic differences upon the earth's surface.... [but] Further discoveries may throw more light upon this mysterious subject, and explain these ocean currents in connection with the interior currents of the earth, across the verges in both directions, and thus demonstrate the truth of Captain Symmes's theory....\nCaptain Parry and others speak of the brilliant twilight of the North, as being sufficient to enable them to read ordinary printed matter distinctly. This curious fact is wholly inexplicable upon the Newtonian theory, but is easy of explanation upon this. This twilight coming from the north may be caused by the sun's rays thrown into the interior through the southern opening, which by two refractions, one at each opening, and two or three reflections from the inner concave surface, would pass out at the north over the verge, and produce there this strong twilight.\nCaptain Parry states that, when sailing northward in high latitude, the North Star rises over the bow of the ship to the zenith and then declines towards the stern.... The ship going north along the deflected meridians upon and over the verge causes these apparent changes in the North Star.\nFurther confirmation of the Symmes theory is drawn from the variations and dip of the magnetic needle... midway between the verges lies the magnetic equator cutting the equator of the earth at an angle of twelve degreess.... These are curious facts and are entitled to consideration. If they do not fully explain the variation of the magnetic needle, they present some views which may help to clear up these mysteries of nature.\nThe dip of the needle is another phenomenon not fully understood..... The true magnetic poles are not at the points where the \"line of no variation\" terminates, -- at the north and south, -- but are equidistant from this line and immediately under the highest points of the verges north and south, and \"the line of no variation\" lies midway between these magnetic poles. The needle, while it does not vary, along the line, to the right or left, yet, as it goes northward or southward from the magnetic equator, it is attracted towards the true magnetic poles lying under the highest part of the verges; and so the dip is increased till it reaches the apex of the verge, where it is the greatest....\nThe aurora borealis affords a most interesting illustration... rarefaction and condensation produces the aurora along the verges, where the greatest condensation takes place. In proof of this view, Captain Parry and other explorers and navigators state that, when in high latitudes upon and beyond the verge, the aurora is almost always seen in a southerly or southwesterly direction.\nNavigators in the South Atlantic, while sailing down the coast of South America, observe, low in the horizon, to the east and southeast, several bright, luminous bodies, like clouds in the sky, which become more and more elevated as the vessel goes south, until, in the vicinity of the Straits of Magellan, these clouds appear nearly in the zenith.... Captain Symmes holds that these bright clouds are produced by the light of the sun reflected from New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land, and perhaps the south part of New Holland, which lie upon the opposite side of the earth, and which, in the vicinity of Cape Horn, are nearly in the zenith....the light thrown from these islands would present them as bright, luminous bodies, always seen in the same direction, like moons, reflecting the light of the sun. They do not rise and set, as do the sun and moon; and this fact gives plausibility to the explanation.\nFacts attested by good authority prove the existence of a warmer climate beyond the verge....Hearn establishes this fact.... The statements of Hearn, so far as relates to climate, are corroborated by other travellers. They concur in stating that, in high latitude, the inhabitants speak of the south as colder than the north in the winter, and that they migrate north in the winter season to a milder climate.\nOne navigator, Captain Ross, when in high latitude beyond the verge, speaks of the Arctic Sea as being calm and clear of ice, while south of him was a wide belt of ice. He describes the currents of air coming from the north as being so warm as to dissolve the snow and ice around him and far to the south. Captain Parry makes frequent mention of these warm currents of air coming from the north and north-east, -- that is, from the. interior of the earth....\nImmense shoals of herrings in good condition, according to Buffon, come down from the polar seas, and are never known to return... Admit the Symmes theory, and the conjecture would not be unreasonable, that they make the annual circuit of the earth, over the exterior and interior surfaces and through both openings at the poles. If, on the present hypothesis of the earth, we allow land enough for the sustenance of the numerous herds of animals which annually migrate to the polar regions, there would hardly remain water sufficient for the immense shoals of fishes which abound there....\nDriftwood is found in great quantities upon the northern coasts of Iceland, Norway, Spitzbergen, and the arctic borders of Siberia, having every appearance of a tropical production. Trees of large dimensions and of different kinds are found, some in a good state of preservation. Vegetables of singular character, and flowers of peculiar fragrance and color, unknown to botanists, are sometimes found in this drift. These could not be the production of the cold arctic regions, nor is it probable they were drifted thither by the Gulf Stream or by submarine currents... one of the results of late German exploration in the arctic regions is the discovery of beds of mineral coal... Greenland must have been once covered with a rich vegetation; or, as Captain Symmes might have urged, these deposits were drifted from the interior of the earth....\nAll these facts being admitted, -- and most of them are fully established by incontestable proofs, -- the conclusion is legitimate, that, far to the north of the frozen regions of the verge, there exists a milder climate and an open sea, whose existence has never been fully explained, and is inconsistent with the Newtonian theory of the earth.\nLittle is known of the southern verge, but many of the facts in support of the northern verge are applicable to this also. The unequal distribution of land upon the globe is remarkable, three fourths of it being in the northern hemisphere. This unequal distribution might seem to [jeopardize] the equilibrium of our planet; but it may be counterpoised by a corresponding inequality of land in the interior; or the general depth of the ocean in the southern hemisphere may be less, and so compensate this unequal distribution of land surface upon the earth....\nCaptain Symmes maintained that the other planets, like the earth, were each composed of concentric spheres; but I have not space sufficient to refer to the telescopic appearances which are noticed by him in support of his theory. The most common objection to his theory is, that, if it were true, the sun could not possibly light and warm the interior of the world. This is easily answered. The rays of light come parallel from the sun to the earth, and, if he were no larger than the earth, they would fall at least twelve degrees upon the concave interior surface, as they passed over the lower part of the verge both north and south. But the earth in her annual revolution, owing to the inclination of the poles to the plane of her orbit, alternately permits the incident rays to fall much more than twelve degrees upon the interior surface. This inclination is 23 degrees 30 minutes, which, added to 12 degrees, the angularity of the verges, gives 35 degrees 30 minutes of the concave surface upon which the direct incident rays of the sun fall. But these rays, passing over the dense, cold air of the verges, are refracted many degrees, probably at least ten or fifteen degrees, so that by one refraction and one or two reflections the rays of light would be thrown out over the verge opposite to that through which they entered; and because those rays would converge upon the concave surface instead of diverging, they would produce abundant light and heat throughout the whole interior. As compared with moonlight, the sun's rays, reflected from one interior surface to the other, would be as much more intense as the square of the diameter of the inner world is less than the square of the distance of the moon from the earth. According to this law, assuming the diameter of the interior to average 4,000 miles, and the moon's distance 240,000 miles, the light of the interior would be equal to 3,600 moons as large as our sun, and this too without considering the greater intensity of the interior light upon a concave surface over that of the moonlight reflected from and falling upon convex surfaces. These views, which are in accordance with the known laws of light, show that this popular objection has not the slightest force. On the contrary, the strong probability would be, that, on account of intense light and heat, the interior would be uninhabitable, except around the vicinity of the verges both north and south....\nThe extent of the visible horizon, to the inhabitants of the interior, would be largest immediately around the verges, and it would contract as the observer receded from the verges towards the equatorial regions of the interior surface....\nThere are many other facts and arguments which were from time to time urged by Captain Symmes in support of his theory. The writer has lately seen a small anonymous book written in 1824 \"by a citizen of the United States,\" and published in Cincinnati, which has great interest. It enlarges the arguments drawn from the telescopic appearances of the planets, the laws of gravitation, and the doctrine of mid-plane spaces between the concentric spheres of the planets. It is stated in this work that Captain Symmes maintained that there were openings through the crust of the earth from the interior to the exterior surface through which the water flowed, and facts are given in support of this idea. It is one of great interest, however, as connected with the phenomena of subterranean rivers, submarine currents, earthquakes and volcanoes, artesian wells, springs on high mountains, etc.\nIn this little book it is also stated that Captain Symmes held that our earth had at least five concentric spheres. Such might have been his views as early as 1823 and 1824, at and prior to the time when this work was published, but such were not the views expressed in his lectures at Union College in 1827. Doubtless his views were modified more or less between 1827 and 1829, when he died....\nTime, the great revealer of secrets, will soon determine whether this startling theory is true, in whole or in part, and whether its author was a visionary enthusiast, or a profound philosopher whose name will be honored among men, like that of Franklin or Newton, as a benefactor of his race, and an honor to the country which gave him birth. -- (excerpts from Atlantic Monthly, v. 31, #186, Apr. 1873: pp. 471-481)\nSYMMES \u00a0AND \u00a0HIS \u00a0THEORY.\nby E. F. Madden\nOccasional allusions to what is called Symmes's theory... The writer is indebted to Mr. Americus Symmes, a son of John Cleves Symmes, the author of the theory, for much interesting information concerning the man and his hypothesis....\n[Americus said] \"...if my father's plan was adopted, the riddle of an open polar sea could soon be solved, the pole reached, and Symmes's new world found. My father's plan, as suggested in his petitions to Congress in 1823-4, was to spend a year up North at about 80 degrees north latitude, and there keep an eye to the wild animals that inhabit that region every summer -- coming from the north every spring and returning north every fall -- and in the fall of the second year follow them in their journey northward ... Whither those animals go, man can certainly follow... and if man can follow them, that is, go north with them in the fall, and return with them in the spring, it will only take two or three years at the most to determine if the pole can be reached, or the new world found to which these animals go....\"\nJohn Cleves Symmes, the author of the theory of concentric spheres, was the son of Timothy Symmes, of New Jersey... Symmes when about forty-six years of age is described as follows: \"He is of middle stature, and tolerably proportioned, with scarcely anything in his exterior to characterize the secret operations of his mind, except an abstraction which from attentive inspection is found seated on a slightly contracted brow, and the glances of a bright blue eye that often seem fixed on something beyond immediate surrounding objects....\" During the early part of his life he received what was then considered a common English education, which he improved in after-life by having access to tolerably well selected libraries. In 1802, at the age of about twenty-two years, he entered the army of the United States... After retiring from service, until his death, Captain Symmes had his residence at Newport, Kentucky. He first published his views in 1818, in St. Louis, Missouri. His theory was at first received with universal ridicule; the French Academy declared it unworthy of serious consideration, and a petition to Congress presented by Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, was disregarded. Symmes was held to be little better than a lunatic.... The latter part of Symmes's life was spent wholly in developing his theory, lecturing, writing, and traveling. He died in May, 1829....\nThe two most important features of John Cleves Symmes's theory are that all orbicular bodies in the universe partaking of a planetary nature are composed in a greater or less degree of spheres concentric, one within the other, and to some extent open at their poles; and that gravity is due to the pressure of an impalpable element composed of minute concentric spheres, existent throughout all space, elastic, and changing its molecules by any change of matter whatever throughout space. To this substance Captain Symmes attributes gravity, making it a pushing instead of a pulling force, as it is now generally held to be. But this latter theory of gravitation he holds not to be essential to his theory of concentric circles, which circles would be formed upon the old theory of gravitation.\nCaptain Symmes published notes or explanations of his theory, which he called memoirs. Memoir No. II. says:\n\"With dividers describe a circle on a plane of matter of loose texture, and in the centre add a very small circle; then draw a line through the centre. It is evident (as matter gravitates matter in proportion to quantity and distance) that either half of the inner circle, being almost equally surrounded by matter, must be very little gravitated centrewise; so being suspended, only a rotary motion is needed to throw it compactly toward the outer circle. This being admitted, it follows that half-way from the outer to the inner side of this circle of matter so thrown out, a like rarity, suspension, or balance of gravity should prevail, and hence a disposition to concentric circles; therefore it follows that successive similar subdivisions should exist, gradually lessening in force or quantity. By applying this principle to the earth, I found the necessity of hollow, concentric spheres. A decision of school-men on these lines shall be followed by additional positions, further explaining my new principles of hollow spheres, open at the poles, declared in a circular letter of the 10th of April, 1818.\n\"JOHN CLEVES SYMMES,\nof Ohio, late Captain of Infantry.\"\nThis is the basis of Symmes's theory. This theory he maintained with great earnestness, courage, and disinterestedness during a large part of his life, and were he living now, be would in all likelihood be doughtily contending for it still, accommodating his theory to the Nares expedition -- which went where he declared irrefutable optical proof could be had of the polar openings -- and all other discoveries whatsoever.\nAmong other arguments that he brought to his support were the migrations of animals to and from the arctic regions, atmospheric refraction, and the variation of the compass observed in high northern latitudes....\nSymmes believed that there were beneath our feet miles and miles of wondrous unclaimed domain; reindeer roamed its colder borders, fish swam in its seas, animals and trees and flowers of curious and unknown shape made its life a primal gladness; splendid visions of untold wonders, misty dreams of splendors unnamable, floated through his nightly and daily thoughts, and greater than all burned within him the ceaseless desire to become the discoverer of this unknown land. And the only thing needful was for the government to traverse the \"icy circle,\" pierce the polar opening, and sail in and take possession - perchance to find man, to meet a mighty race of people, to come face to face with some stupendous revelation of nature, to explore some splendid barbarism, or disclose a civilization as yet undreamed.\nAnd this theory he expounded in pamphlets, memorials, newspapers... To help himself he occasionally lectured about pure water and such things, but his heart was in the poles, and he concerned himself chiefly with his theory. Issuing circulars to the world, and lecturing, arguing, struggling with disease, poverty, and giving people, he travelled from one place to another.... And so to the end he went on striving for his theory spending as much of his property as he dared take away from his family, always sincere, earnest, using all manner of arguments from the Bible, prophecies, and such like, all manner of means of informing the public of the theory, but impressing one always with his honesty and purity of motive. No charlatan idea of notoriety inspired his efforts; he may not have been over logical or scientific; he may not have always spelled perfectly, or have been a very fluent lecturer; but he had always the utmost fixity of faith. Not a very brilliant hero this round-headed hero of ours, with his bright blue eye looking away off into space, his contracted brow, his nasal voice, and hesitating manner. Dusty, human, faulty enough, but still a self-denying, steadfast man -- man with a purpose. (excerpts from Harper's Monthly v. 65, Oct. 1882: pp. 740-744)\nSYMMES \u00a0THEORY.\nHIS SON EXPOUNDS IT -- THE EARTH HOLLOW AND INHABITED.\nA cultured audience gathered last evening in the lecture-room of the Trinity Methodist Church to hear Mr. Americus Symmes expound his father's theory. The lecturer, a gray-haired gentlemen, came on the little platform without any introduction, and said:\nLadies and Gentlemen: I presume a few of you know that there lived in Kentucky as far back as 1819 a philosopher, John Cleves Symmes, who devoted the last 80 [sic - 30?] years of his life to working out a true theory of the earth's formation. He contended that the earth was dying, he charged me to watch the polar explorations for proofs of his theory. I was a yoing man when my father died, aged 59, a poor man. He had owned 4,000 acres of land, but had borrowed money at high rates of interest and kept at his desk writing with children playing around him. The estate only paid 82 cents on the dollar. I thought that a theory which left a man so poor was not very valuable, and I had little time or money to bother with it. Twenty years ago a man called at my house to get me to subscribe to Dr. Kane's \"explorations.\" My father's charge flashed across my mind; I was now tolerably well off. I subscribed for the book, and began to inform myself about my father's theory before Dr. Kane's book arrived. My father lived the last three years of his life lecturing and traveling in the East. He wore himself out, took sick in New-York, and aftr paying his landlord all he could for board was put in jail for debt, where he remaiend two days, till his friends took him out. He then went over to New-Jersey, where he originally came from; there he remained 10 months before we at home were able to get money to bring him back. We were living on the 640 acres of land at that time, and I brought him home from Cincinnati on a matress in a wagon, he was so feeble. That was in February, and he died in May. His book, which was published in 1826, and which we gladly sold for $1, Robert Clarke & Co., of Cincinnati, now sell for $12, and they can't supply the demand for the original issue. I read that book carefully. It says the earth's shell is 100,000 [sic - 1,000?] miles thick, and that the edges 4,000 miles in converging. Perry, Kane, McClintock, Hall, Nordenskjold, and all, as I shall show you, confirm this. The summit of this verge is the coldest place in creation. The only way they tell when they pass it is the difference in the expension of the horizon; that is, the difference in how far you cna see. Before Capt. Hall passed it, he could only see a few miles; after he reached it he could see 70 miles. At the eighty-third degree my father says there is the open sea, free from ice. Sir Isaac Newton says it is a vast solitude of ice. I shall show which is correct. When Dr. Kane went on his second trip, after quitting the vessel the dog sleds went 40 miles a day; men gave out, and the doctor went no further, but William Morton, who had been there before, got permission to go on with the sleds. After four days he reached the aweful icy ridge running east and west, caused by the current from the north and the current from the south, just as the Symmes theory first claimed. Look in Kane's book, and you will see where they used the sled for a ladder to go over that icy ridge. After four days' more travel the snow began to soften, ice crusts to get thin, and in a short time the current was warmer. They had to help the dogs pull the sled, as their feet cut through the thin ice crust. At last they reachd the open Polar Sea, filled with fish, seals, shrimps, &c. There were fowls of every kind. Morton gathered 1,200 eggs in one day. I fairly shouted when I read this. A big sea and no ice, right where Newton said all was solid ice. The grass was ankle-high. Henry Clay says he brought home the biggst tree he could find in his trunk. Did you ever note how anxious all these explorers are to go back? Parry made three trips, Ross three, Kane two, and Kennedy two. I came to the Public Library and got from Mr. Toune the reports. Parry promised Parliament on his second trip to reach the North Pole. He went in a Lapland sled, which has a boat bottom and goes through water, till the north star was behind him. At 81 degrees the ice was four feet thick, at 82 degrees it was three feet thick, at 82 3/4 degrees the ice would not bear the boat; the sun melted the tar on the boat and flies swarmed around them. Symmes said it would take steam to reach the North Pole, and it will. Ross, who went very near, said: \"I stand on the bank of an open sea.\" Smith, who went to find Franklin, said he found the north end of Iceland covered with trees; he brought back one tree with the mark of an axe-cut back to London, also vegetables and flowers that he found in the drift. When Capt. Hall, of Cincinnati, was getting ready to go I went to see him. He hooted at my father's theory, and yet he found that warm country. He took Capt. Buddington and Capt. Tyson along to advise. They drank his whiskey, and he started to put them off at a polar station; they begged on their knees, and he relented. Hall surveyed his track and sent back reports of every part. They named the open sea Polaris Bay, after their ship, and the straits they called Robeson's, after the Secretary of the Navy. After passing eighty two degrees sixteen minutes Bunnington saw the North star behind them, and would go no further. All could see the cloud in front, which proclaimed the absence of ice. Hall was poisoned, and they returned. Mayers, the scientific man of that expedition, with his instruments calculated the distance to that warm locality and made it 83 degrees. There was Symmes theory proved by actual measurement. Hall left June 29, lost four months on the route, and yet reached that warm region Aug. 29, less than 60 days. The doctor who went away with Hall brought back flies, butterflies, squirrels, &c. In Sweden Nordenskjold heard of all this, and followed Hall's track. He sailed clear around the North-western passage just as Symmes said could be done. From Dundee, Scotland, Mr. Seabaum [sic - Seebohm?] went along Hall's route; he found the sea and sailing into it found a race of Roman-nozed, Hebrew-speaking people. They are the lost tribes of Israel. They have gold mines, iron mines, and mica mines there. Mr. Seabaum read his report at the Art Society of England. Capt. Wiggins was present and he confirmed it, saying the half had not been told. They have enormous wheat crops; there is where China gets her food. Humphrey Marshall, a Kentuckian, wants me to get up an expedition by subscription, as Kane did, and find this rich country. I have seen men from London who say this account of Seabaum's is no hoax.\" -- (text from the Louisville Courier-Journal, Nov. 27, 1883)\nProposing an Expedition to the North Pole.\nWashington, Dec. 24. -- Capt. George E. Tyson, of Polaris fame, has received a letter from A. Symmes, dated at Symmeszonia, Ky., December 7, on the subject of going north in command of an expedition next June or May, to be gotten up by subscription for the purpose of finding the country that Nordenskjold, Wiggins and Capt. Tuttle found after passing the magnetic pole at eighty degrees of north latitude (as laid down in the Symmes theory of the writer's father, and running south after getting into the open polar sea until they found a country and a people never before heard of, and reported to the Art Society of London by Captains Wiggins and Seabaum.\nCaptain Tuttle also reported having found the same country and people, and describes the people as being very large, with black hair and whiskers, roman noses, and speaking Hebrew. The writer says: \"I find no difficulty in finding people willing to subscribe money enough to buy a steamer like the Polaris and go ins search of the the people and country that Wiggins, Seabaum and Tuttle found, where they said they rode on horseback through the new country and saw hemp, flax, wheat, hides, wool, ivory, iron ore, and were told of ten or twelve gold mines that yield from five to seven tons each yearly. Capt. Hall said that if there were a people up there they must be giants, as the atmosphere was so life giving; and now they are found and reported to be seven or eight feet high and well proportioned. -- (text from the Chester, PA Chester Times, Dec. 24, 1883 -- see also the Atlanta Constitution of Dec. 26, 1883.)\nIT \u00a0IS \u00a0A \u00a0HOLLOW \u00a0WORLD.\nAccording to the Theory Advanced by Captain John Cleves Symmes.\n... Every now and then interest is revived in the Symmes theory that the earth is hollow and habitable and open at the poles, by such a suggestion that an Arctic expedition might well be undertaken with the special end in view to test that proposition. Such an expedition was seriously proposed as recent[ly] as two or three years ago, and is still under advisement. But save for these occasional tentative reminders the present generation has quite outgrown all knowledge of a geographical theory that by its originality and boldness and by a certain plausibility of argument deduced to its support startled and interested the scientific world three-quarters of a century ago....\nIf we were to judge of the internal surface of the sphere by its animal production -- admitting that those animals heretofore enumerated are propagated there -- we should conclude that the internal region of the earth is as much more favorable to the support of animal life as the reindeer is larger than our deer, and the white bear larger than our bear, and, consequently, we must conclude that there are more salubrious climates and better countries within than any we have yet discovered without.\nImmense shoals of herrings, in good condition, according to Buffon, come down from the polar seas, and are never known to return.\nWere the earth a compact and solid spheroid, according the old theory, and were the seas frozen nearly to the bottom at the poles, as we would be led to conclude, where could all those fish that come down to us every spring breed? Or, if they even all returned in the autumn, and all the north were a sea that did not freeze even to the poles, it would require a great stretch of credulity to imagine where they could obtain food for the winter; or even if their source of food were inexhaustible, could the region of the pole afford space sufficient for their health, so as to migrate south in the spring?\nA Question of Capacity.\nIf the earth be not hollow (or at least greatly concave about the poles) where could all those fish find room in winter? But on Symmes' plan, admitting the globe to be a hollow sphere, and the inner, or concave part, as habitable as without (at least as habitable for fish), the whole matter is at once explained.\nWhales and various fish delight in cold regions. According to Symmes' theory there is a zone at a short distance beyond the real verge of the sphere (which constitutes the coldest part, or as he has thought proper to term it, \"the icy circles\") commencing at the highest point, in about latitude 68 degrees, in the Northern Sea, near Norway, thence gradually decling to about latitude 50 degrees in the Pacific Ocean, which is the lowest point, and thence regularly round again to the highest point. A certain distance beyond this and short of the apparent verge this zone or icy circle exists, which is believed to be the coldest region of earth. After passing this we would advance into the interior of the globe and into a milder clime. In the interior region, it is contended, those immense shoals of fish are propagated and grow which annually come out and afford such an abudant supply; nor does it appear that the interior parts of the sphere are altogether forsaken by the fish in summer, for shoals of fat mackerel and herring come down from the north in autumn as well as in the spring.\nThe seal, another animal found in cold regions, is also said to migrate north twice each year, going once beyond the icy circle to produce their young and again to complete their growth, always returning remarkably fat -- an evidence that they find something more than snow and ice to feed on in the country to which they migrate.\nBasis of Symmes' Theory.\nAccording to Symmes' theory each sphere has an intermediate cavity or mid-plane space of considerable extent situated between the convex and concave surfaces of the sphere, filled with a very light and elastic fluid, rarified in proportion to the gravity or condensing power of the exposed surfaces of the respective spheres, and also various other less cavities or spaces between the larger and principal one and the outer and inner surfaces of the spheres, each filled with a similar fluid or gas, most probably partaking much of the nature of hydrogen. This fluid to lighter than that in which the sphere floats, and has a tendency to poise it in universal space.\nThe spheres. in many parts of the unfathomable ocean are believed to be water quite through from the concave or convex surfaces to the great mid-plane space, and probably the earthly or solid matter of the sphere may in many places extend quite through from one surface to the other, tending, like ribs or braces, to support the sphere in its proper form. Such a formation of spheres to be supported by various facts and phenomena.\nRecent explorers have found more and more evidence of an open polar sea and of a surprising increase in vegetation and animal life in the higher arctic regions, and the Symmes theorists hold that these facts go to prove the truth of the Symmes theory and shake our faith in Newton's idea of the north being a vast solitude of eternal ice. All these discoveries were made while running south after passing the 80 degrees latitude.\nNew Country at the Pole.\nBaron Nordenskold, of Sweden, who made two visits to the extreme North tells us \"that it is impossible to find continents of ice south of 80 degrees of north latitude.\" That is, after passing the 80 degrees, or magnetic pole, his compass indicated south, the direction we familiarly term north. An English explorer, Captain Wiggins, after passing the 80 degrees, found the country seen by Nordenskold. He made the acquaintance of the inhabitants whom he discovered spoke Hebrew. An account of his trip was published in the London Times, February 5, 1881. A Mr. Seebohm, who accompanied the expedition, took a ride on horseback with several others through this new country, and after his return to London he read a description of what he had seen before the Society of Arts. The country was rich in iron ore. A piece picked up at haphazard was so highly magnetic as to lift a large needle. There were copper mines and ten or twelve gold mines that yielded from five to seven tons a year.\nAnother explorer who visited this new country of Symmzonia is Captain Tuttle , an old United States whaling master. He gives a similar account of the people and says they speak Hebrew. He found them well contented and intelligent. He discovered during his 28 years' experience in the North that everyfourth winter was mild, and during one of these seasons he discovered this new country, which he says can only be reached with a steam vessel, as the current in Robeson's channel runs south at the rate of four to six miles per hour.\nThat is in substance the proposition and the arguments of those who have followed Captain Symmes in the belief that the earth is hollow and inhabited, and that in the interior are beautiful and fertile lands and an enjoyable climate. \u00a0 (excerpts from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of Feb. 9, 1896 -- see also on-line transcript from the Feb. 6, 1896 issue of the Pittsburg Dispatch)\nSymmes and His Theory.\nIf Nansen has really discovered land at the north pole it will smash the wild theory advanced by the late John Cleves Symmes.\nAccording to Symmes the earth is hollow and formed of concentric spheres. The openings or entrances to the \"inner world\" are at the poles, and are like an immense crater, 2000 miles in diameter, with a sloping rim, so that a vessel might sail into the bowels of the earth before those on it were aware of it.\nSymmes called attention to the northward migration of the artic reindeer, musx ox and polar bear at the approach of winter and claimed that their movements proved that the heat of the earth's interior furnished a milder climate.\nHe also said that his theory was supported by the climatic differences on the earth's surface, the vast open polar sea, the changes in the apparent extent of the horizon in high latitudes, the variation and dip of the magnetic needle and other natural phenomena. The vessel sailing north which finds its needle suddenly reversed has crossed the verge, according to Symmes, and is really sailing south without knowing it. Captain Wiggins testified to it in 1880, and gave an account of his discovery of a land with mild climate whose inhabitants spoke Hebrew.\nCaptain Symmes was generally regarded as a crank, so far as his theory was concerned, but his followers erected a fine monumnet to his memory, and of late years many persons, inclusing some sea captains, have adopted his belief.\nIt will be a relief to the public to be assured that our globe is a solid affair, instead of being shapd like an apple with the core scooped out. We want land at the pole and plenty of it -- enough to give the Monroe doctrine a foothold. -- The Atlanta Constitution Feb. 18, 1896\nSYMMES' THEORY.\nby John Weld Peck\nI want, if I can, to carry you back to the day when the West was new, when the outposts of the nation were on the Mississippi; when the boundless forests were scarred but here and there with clearings; when Cincinnati, the thriving town between Third street and the river was the undoubted and unrivaled Queen City of the West.... it was in that day of strength and crudity that lived the man who promulgated the daring, ingenious theory of cosmography, which in the light of better learning we know as the absurd, foolish theory of \"Symmes' Hole.\"\nThe Theory of Concentric Spheres! We all remember the shaft in the park at Hamilton bearing the globe open through the poles, commemorating Captain John Cleves Symmes and his theory-keeping in memory a man who believed that the world is hollow and habitable within, and that there are great holes at the poles through which one may get down on to the inner side!\nCaptain John Cleves Symmes, he of the theory of Eccentric [sic] Spheres was a nephew of that other of the same name who was the original proprietor of all the land hereabouts....\nIn the war of 1812 Symmes commanded a company with bravery, skill and gallantry, especially at the battle of Lundy's Lane for which he was honorably mentioned. At the close of the war he continued in the army until about 1816 when he resigned to take up life at the frontier village, at the mouth of the Missouri known as St. Louis... And it was while at the trading post in the wilderness that he first evolved, or at least, first announced the hypothesis of which I write. How long he had entertained these views, what length of time he had devoted to the study of the subject, what books inspired it or how or why the mind of the frontier soldier and trader was turned to the subject, I am at a loss to discover. He announced his idea in no diffident nor uncertain terms... [transcript of Symmes' \"Circular\" follows]\n... His statement of the extent of the polar opening, his proposed point and season of departure, his promise to find good lands and life one degree north of 82 degrees, all agree with the detail of his system as published later and show that he did not make his announcement first and then manufacture his argument to support it. He followed his circular with several newspaper articles elaborating his theory. Soon afterward and during the same year he moved to Newport, Ky., and continued to devote himself to the preaching of his doctrine. In 1824 he moved to Hamilton. He found not a few believers as time went on among whom the foremost, he who became Symmes patron and his collaborator, was James McBride, of Hamilton.\nJames McBride was no ordinary man. He was highly respected and held many positions of trust in his community.... James McBride became a convert to the doctrine of Symmes and used his able pen in arranging and elaborating Symmes somewhat disorderly argument. The result was a little treatise on the subject from the press of Morgan, Lodge and Fisher, Cincinnati, 1826: Symmes Theory of Concentric Spheres, demonstrating that the earth is hollow, habitable within and widely open about the poles -- by A Citizen of the United States....\nThe author undertakes to set forth the theory without asserting its truth, disclaiming scientific ability to pass upon it, inviting criticism, but requesting any who assert its fallacy to furnish some other rational and satisfactory explanation of the facts advanced....\nThe fundamental thought or idea seems to have been that unformed matter in rotation tends to form itself into concentric spheres.... assuming matter to have been at one time whirling masses of unformed substance it must have assumed the form of hollow spheres open at the poles. That not only would there be hollow spheres open about the poles but the same principle would tend to create hollow spheres within hollow spheres.\nThis theory Symmes applies not only to our earth but to the entire universe. Space is filled with microscopically invisible hollow spheres of aether -- which by their elasticity hold the planets of the universe in place....\nSymmes points to the fact that nature is an economist of matter. That she uses hollow materials where they serve her purpose as well as solid. Is not the stalk of the grain, the quill of the pinion, the bone of the animal, even each hair of the head, hollow?\nTo those who see something of the sacrilegious in thus undermining God's footstool, the author says: \"I can not discover anything derogatory from His infinite power, wisdom, or divine economy, in the formation of a hollow world and concentric spheres any more than that of solid ones. I should rather be of the opinion that a construction of all the orbs in creation on a plan corresponding with Symmes' theory, would display the highest possible degree of perfection, wisdom and goodness, the most perfect system of creative economy -- and, (as Dr. Mitchell expresses it), a great saving of stuff.\"\nThe Dr. Mitchell referred to is probably the same whom Symmes selected as a patron, along with Davy and Von Humboldt; the New York scientist and miscellaneous writer of the first quarter of the last century, and editor of the New York Repository...\nIt is interesting to know that Symmes is not the only one who has believed this planet a series of concentric spheres. Edmund Halley, the celebrated English astronomer of the early eighteenth century, averred the probability of an inner sphere. Leonhardt Euler, the great mathematician of Basle, who died in 1783, accepted Halley's theory and went further in asserting that the inner sphere might be luminous and thus light and warm the inner surface of the outer crust, and he further inferred that the interior might be inhabited. Whether the works of these writers came to Symmes' knowledge before he announced his theory from the frontier town is not known. That they were known to James McBride appears in his book... But neither Halley nor Euler had conceived the polar openings. The credit for that conception is due Symmes alone.\nNow applying his theory to our own planet Symmes argued it to be a series of five spheres of which our crust is the outermost. The opening at the north pole is four thousand milesacross, that at the south pole is six thousand. The outer crust of the earth is about a thousand miles thick giving a wide rim or verge some 1500 miles around. The rim or verge being so wide, and its curvature being gradual, would not be apparent to the voyager, who might pass from the outer side of the earth over the rim and down upon the inner side a great distance before becoming aware of the fact at all.\nThe rim is also marked by a zone of ice and snow, by that impossible Arctic belt beyond which men imagine all to be a frozen waste. Here is the zone where no vegetation but moss exists. Here is also to be noted a belt of volcanoes encircling the globe, including those of Alaska and Iceland.\nWhen a high northern latitude is reached the Aurora Borealis appears to the southward as many explorers have testified. The voyager is then upon or within the verge. The compass then forsakes the star and varies so that at times the needle turns nearly round, for the verge is the region of magnetic attraction. Each of the various spheres is inhabited both upon its inner and its outer side; warmed, lighted and watered....\nSymmes then brings forward some curious facts in regard to the migration of animals - for which he refers to and cites the published narratives of travelers and Arctic explorers. These all go to prove that there is a land beyond the frozen Arctic belt, whither some beasts, fowls and fish go at the approach of winter and whence they return in the spring sleek and fat....\nOne of the most ingenious arguments of the work is that founded upon the Magellanic clouds. They are two in number -- or perhaps one is so divided that three may fairly be counted. They are apparent only at night and from the South Atlantic, or the region of the Straits of Magellan, whence their name. These are, of course, now known to be merely two cloud like patches of nebulous stars in the pole of the Milky Way.... These are, he says, the reflections in the sky of New Zealand, New Holland and Van Dieman's land seen across the rim...\nHow can the variation of the needle be explained by Symmes' theory? -- By it assuming the polar verge to be the region of attraction it is obvious that when the verge is reached the needle will swing. And so Parry, the explorer, found it to point at one place within 14 degrees of south.\nThe question most asked of Symmes by his hearers was, no doubt, how the interior of the earth was to be provided with light and heat. His answer to that is most ingenious. The opening at the north pole is four thousand one hundred and fifty miles in width at an angle of 12 degrees to the perpendicular to the earth's axis. Therefore the sun's rays would fall within as far as 18 degrees on the inner surface of the high side. But when the sun is at the northern tropic its rays would slant 23 degrees more, or a total of 41 1/2 degrees within. So that there would only be 26 degrees between that and the equator, which would not receive direct light... But direct light is unnecessary for the interior would be illuminated by a soft, brilliant light by reflection from the concave side and the inner sphere. The interior light would... be too bright for comfort and that blue glasses would be an excellent article of commerce to take to the inner side upon the first voyage...\nSymmes was true to the consecration of his life to the theory announced in his first paper. He wrote, traveled, lectured, petitioned the legislature and congress for aid to demonstrate his ideas, and suffered poverty in its behalf. During his residence in Newport he devoted himself entirely to its study, and in 1820 made a lecture tour. He spoke in Cincinnati, Lexington, Frankfort, Hamilton, Zanesville and probably elsewhere...\nIn January, 1823, there was presented to congress by Representative J. T. Johnson, of Kentucky, a petition wherein the subscribing citizens respectfully showed that the national honor and public interest might be promoted by the equipping of an exploring expedition for the purpose of penetrating the Polar region, beyond the limits already known, with a view not only of making new discoveries in geography, natural history and geology, but of opening new sources of trade and commerce.... Mr. Johnson moved to refer the memorial to the committee on foreign relations, while Mr. Farelly, of Pennsylvania, moved to lay on the table... and there the matter ended.\nOther petitions from various parts of the country to the same end were presented at the same session. In February one was offered by sundry inhabitants of Charleston, South Carolina, showing that there were Symmesites there, although I do not find that Symmes ever lectured in the South. Another memorial came from Greenville, Ohio, and still another was presented by a Mr. Brown from Huntington, Pa., and later Mr. Ross, of Ohio, offered three more. All however were consigned to lie upon that repository of the unburied dead, the table. Benjamin Ruggles, senator from\u00ca Ohio, also presented a petition to the upper branch of Congress at the same session with the same disheartening result....\n[in 1825] Symmes, according to McBride, made application to the Russian government to accompany a polar expedition about to start under Count Romanzoff. He received the permission, but for want of money was compelled to stay at home at last. During the college year 1826-27 he delivered a series of lectures at Union College to the faculty and students. Deep interest was taken in the subject by some, at least, of the students. One of these students was a gentleman named Clark, who, in 1873, in an article published in the Atlantic Monthly of April of that year, was able to reconstruct and set forth Symmes' theory in considerable detail...\nDuring the year after that spent at Union College Symmes, in company with one J. N. Reynolds, a graduate of Ohio University, started on a lecture tour. Symmes went on to Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Maine and into Canada, but Reynolds left him early in the journey. Concerning this Reynolds, Howe... states that Jeremiah N. Reynolds traveled and lectured with Symmes... and that Reynolds... made money, with which, and the backing of Messrs. Rush and Southard of John Quincy Adams' Cabinet, fitted out a national ship, to sail to the south pole to test the theory. But the government support was withdrawn by Andrew Jackson when he came into office. That then a Dr. Watson of New York took the matter up and furnished money. A vessel, the \"Annawan,\" N. B. Palmer captain, sailed from New York October, 1829, for the southern polar opening -- that they reached land at high south latitude (82 degrees)... How much of truth and how much of pure fiction there is in this romance of Reynold's voyage is difficult to determine.\nThat a J. N. Reynolds and a Watson went on an exploring expedition in a vessel called the Annawan in 1829 is undoubtedly true. But whether that was the same Jeremiah N. Reynolds who lectured with Symmes is most doubtful... Captain N. B. Palmer certainly made some unrecorded voyages to the south polar zone and... some scientists went on the expedition among whom were Messrs. John N. Reynolds and Watson.... John and not Jeremiah. He wrote a book describing the journey round the world published in New York in 1835- and none of Howe's startling facts appear in it.... Whatever may have been the purpose of this exploration certainly no other was ever made to find Symmes Cavity. After his lecture tour in the east and Canada, Symmes health broke down and he went to his old home in New Jersey to die in May, 1829... \u00a0 (excerpts from Ohio History Vol. XVIII, No. 1. - Jan. 1909, pp. 28-42)\nSTORY OF JOHN SYMMES\nHis Plan to Lead an Expedition to the Interior of the Earth\nTo the Editor of the New York Times:\nIn these days of polar exploration a few words about Symmes's hypothesis, which some ninty-one years ago, attracted attention among the uninstructed, may not be amiss. John Flake, in his essay on \"Cranks and their Crotchets,\" discusses it fully.\n\"In 1818 one Capt. John Cleves Symmes, a retired officer whose knowledge of things in general, and especially of astronomy, physics, or geology, was not extensive, astonished the world by the following proclamation: 'To all the world I declare the earth is hollow and habitable within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles twelve or sixteen degrees. I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking. My terms are the patronage of this and the new worlds. * * * I select Doctor S. L. Mitchill, Sir H. Davy, and Baron Alexander von Humboldt as my protectors. I ask one hundred brave companions, well equipped, to start from Siberia in the fall season, with reindeer and sleighs, on the ice of the frozen sea. I engage we find a warm and and rich land, stocked with vegetables and animals, if not men, on reaching one degree northward of latitude 82 degrees.'\"\nIt is hardly necessary to say that even in 1818 this sort of thing attracted no serious attention. All of Symmes's efforts to induce scientific societies to give the matter thought and induce Congress to provide funds were futile.\nThis illustrious man died in 1820. On his grave is placed a hollow globe, open at the poles. His son later, in 1878, published a pamphlet on the theory, in which all sorts of ridiculous assertions were made as to how the hole was lighted by the moon, and how it was possible for the interior to contain the lost tribes of Israel. \u00a0 \u00a0 VERUTAN.\nNew York, Sept. 15, 1909.\n-- text from the New York Times Sept. 18, 1909\nA \u00a0PRELIMINARY \u00a0BIBLIOGRAPHY\nOF \u00a0SYMMES' \u00a0HOLES.\n\"No. 1.

In the year 1802, Mr. Symmes entered the army of the United States in the office of ensign, from which he afterwards rose to that of captain. He continued in service until after the close of the war with Great Britain. While attached to the army he was universally esteemed a brave soldier and a zealous and faithful officer. He was in the memorable battle of Bridgewater, and was senior captain in the regiment to which he belonged. The company under his immediate command that day discharged seventy rounds of cartridges and repelled three desperate charges of the bayonet.\nAfterwards, in the sortie from Fort Erie, Captain Symmes with his command captured the enemy's battery number two, and with his own hand spiked the cannon it contained.\nDuring the period of about three years after the war, and after Captain Symmes had left the army, he was engaged in the difficult and laborious task of furnishing supplies to the troops stationed on the Upper Mississippi. Since that time he has resided at Newport, Kentucky, devoting, almost exclusively, the whole of his time and attention to the investigation and perfection of his favorite Theory of Concentric Spheres. In a short circular, dated St. Louis, 1818, Captain Symmes first promulgated the fundamental principles of this theory to the world.\nCaptain Symmes published two other numbers at St. Louis in the year 1818. His two next numbers, marked four and five, treated, the one of the original formation of the Alleghany Mountains, and the other claiming the discovery of open poles. His sixth number dates at Cincinnati, in January, 1819. His seventh number, entitled Arctic Memoir, is dated at Cincinnati in February, 1819. And another number, entitled Light between the Spheres, dated at Cincinnati in August, 1819, was published in the National Intelligencer. Afterwards, numerous pieces from the pen of Captain Symmes appeared in different newspapers.\nIndependent of his written publications, he has delivered a number of lectures on the theory, first at Cincinnati in 1820, and afterwards at various other places.\nIn 1822, Captain Symmes petitioned Congress, setting forth in the first place, his belief of the existence of a habitable and accessible concave to this globe; his desire to embark on a voyage of discovery to one or other of the polar regions; his belief in the great profit and honor his country would derive from such a discovery; and prayed that Congress would equip and fit out for the expedition two vessels of two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons' burden. This petition was presented by Richard M. Johnson, on the 7th March, 1822, when, after a few remarks, it was laid on the table. In December, 1823, he forwarded similar petitions to both houses of Congress, which met with a similar fate.\nThat Captain Symmes was a high-minded, honorable man is attested by all who knew him. He has devised a theory whereby to account for various singular and interesting phenomena, and most satisfactorily to explain a great variety of acknowledged facts.\n(under construction)\nJohn C.

XI. -- Symmes's Theory of Concentric Spheres;\ndemonstrating that the Earth is hollow, habitable within\nand widely open about the Poles. By a Citizen of the United States. Cincinnati, Ohio: 1826. 12mo. pp. 168.\nThe earth is nearly eight thousand miles in diameter, and the deepest excavations that have been made in it by human art, do not extend to half a mile below its surface. We are, therefore, utterly ignorant of the nature and composition of the interior of this immense mass, and must, perhaps, for ever remain so. The subject is of too much interest, however, not to have excited the particular attention of philosophers, and, in the absence of facts, many of them have not hesitated to resort to speculation and conjecture.\nDr. Burnet, the earliest cosmogonist whose system is worthy of norice, supposed that the earth was originally a fluid, chaotic mass, composed of various substances differing in form and density. In the course of time, the heaviest portions subsided, and formed about the centre a dense and solid nucleus. The waters took their station around this body; on their surface floated an ocean of oil and unctuous matters; and the whole was surrounded by the air and other ethereal fluids. This atmosphere was at first full of impurities, being charged with particles of the earth with which it had been previously blended. By degrees, however, it purified itself, by depositing these particles upon the stratum of oil; and there was formed a thick and solid crust of mould, which was the firts habitable part of the globe. After many centuries, this crust, having been gradually dried by the heat of the sun, cracked and split asunder, so as to fall into the abyss of waters beneath it; and this great event was the universal deluge. Our present earth is composed of the remains of the first; our continents and islands being portions of the primordial crust, from which the waters have retired.\nDr. Woodward, who immediately followed Burnet in this career of speculation, supposed that the bodies which compose the earth, were all dissolved or suspended in teh waters of the general deluge; and that on the gradual retiring of the waters, these substances subsided, successively, in the order of their specific gravities; so that the earth is now formed of distinct strata, arranged in concentric layers, \"like the coats of an onion.\"\nWhiston supposed the original earth to be a comet, having, liek other comets, a very eccentric orbit; and, therefore, subject to such extremes of heat and cold, as to be uninhabitable. At the period of the creation described by Moses, the earth was placed in its present orbit, which is nearly circular, and was in consequence subjected to a great variety of important changes. The heavier parts of the chaotic atmosphere, by which the comet was surrounded, fell gradually upon the nucleus, and formed a great liquid abyss, on which the crust of the earth was finally deposited, and now floats. This crust, and the subterraneous fluid, are each fifty or one hundred miles in thickness; and within them lies the solid nucleus or original comet, which contains another rarer fluid, and a central loadstone. Thus, says this philospher: --\n\"The interior or entire constitution of the earth, is correspondent to that of an egg; where the central solid is answerable to the yolk, which by its fiery colour, great bulk, and innermost situation, exactly represents the same: where the great abyss is analogous to the white, whose density, viscosity, moderate fluidity, and middle portion, excellently express the like qulaities of the other: where the upper orb, or habitable earth, corresponds to the shell, whose lightness, solidity, little inequalities of surface, and uppermost situation, admirably agree to the same.\"\nThe deluge was caused by the near approach of a comet, which, by its strong attraction, caused the waters of the great deep to break through the crust, which enclosed them, and which also furnished a vast mass of vapours from its own atmosphere.\nIt will be observed, that all these theories agree in supposing the earth to be composed of successive shells, placed one within the other. The great astronomer, Hally, also adopted the hypothesis of a sphere revolving within the earth, in order to account for the variation of the magnetic needle, and in this opinion he was followed by Euler; so that the theory of \"concentric spheres,\" has been one of the oldest and most prevalent in geology.\nThe theory of the celebrated Buffon is very generally known. He supposed that the earth was struck off from the sun by a comet, and was, therefore, at first, no more than an irregular mass of melted and inflamed matter. This mass, by the mutual attraction of its parts, assumed a globular figure, which its rotary motion, caused by the obliquity of the first impulse, changed into a spheroid. The interior of the globe is, according to this theory, a vitrified mass, which the author maintains to be homogeneous, and not, as is generally thought, dispoded in layers following the order of density.\nThese are the most remarkable theories that have been presented, on the subject of the structure of the earth. It is proper to remark, that they were the productions of men of genius and learning; that they were maintained by arguments full of plausibility, and, even now, difficult of refutation; and that they attracted great attention, and made many proselytes. Yet, such is the just destiny reserved fore all extravagent and romantic speculations, that, at the present day, they have not a single advocate or believer, and are mentioned only to be condemned.\nBut these philosophic fancies have all been far outdone by the theory of our countryman captain Symmes, who, for the last nine or ten years, has been using every exertion to convince the world of its past errors, and to inculcate his own new and true theory. The newspapers have teemed with essays; circulars have been addressed to all the learned societies of Europe and America; addresses and petitions have been presented to our national and state legislatures; certificates of conviction and \"ashesion\" have been procured from men in high literary and political stations; the master and his disciples have traversed the whole country, from south to north, and from west to east, so that all men, in all places, might be enlightened in the truth; and, finally, the whole subject has been reduced to a regular body of doctrine, in the work now under review, written by \"one of the believers in the theory.\"\nLet us hear, from the author himself, a statement of this famous theory. It is presented as follows, in his second chapter:--\n\"According to Symmes's Theory, the earth, as well as all the celestial orbicular bodies existing in the universe, visible and invisible, which partake in any degree of a planetary nature, from the greatest to the smallest, from the sun, down to the most minute blazing meteor or falling star, are all consituted in a greater or less degree, of a collection of spheres, more or less solid, concentric with each other, and more or less open at their poles; each sphere being separated from its adjoining compeers by space replete with aerial fluids; an dthat every portion of infinite space, except what is occupied by sheres, is filled with an aerial elastic fluid, more subtile than common atmospheric air; and constituted of innumerable small concentric spheres, (open at the poles?) too minute to be visible to the organ of sight assisted by the most perfect microscope, and so elastic that they continually press on each other,\" &c.\nThe author here indulges himself in a dream respecting these infintesimal spherules, but after some time, returns to the more substantial part of the theory.\n\"According to captain Symmes, the planet which has been designated the Earth, is composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces between each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well upon the concave as the convex surface. Each of these spheres are widely open at their poles. The north polar opening of the sphere we inhabit, is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and the southern above six thousand. The planes of these polar openings are inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at an angle of about twenty degrees; so that the real axis of the earth, being perpendicular to the plane of the equator, will form an angle of twelve degrees with a line passing through the sphere at right angles with the plane of the polar openings; consequently the verge of the polar openings must approach several nearer to the equator on one side than on the other. The highest north point, or where the distance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the opening in the northern hemisphere, will be found either in the northern sea, near the coast of Lapland, or on a meridian passing through Spitzbergen, in about latitude sixty-eight degrees, or somewhat more eastwardly in Lapland; and the verge would become apparent, to the navigator proceeding north, in about latitude ninety degrees.\nThe lowermost point, or the place where the distance is least from the equator to the verge of the polar opening, will be found in the Pacific ocean, about latitude fifty degrees, near the north-west coast of America, on or near a meridian running through the mouth of Cook's river, being in about one hundred and sixty degrees west longitude, the real verge being in about latitude fifty degrees and becoming apparent to a person traveling northward at right angles with the magnetic equator, at the distance of about twelve hundred miles further. The verge varies progressively from the lowest to the highest point, crossing the north-west coast of America between latitude fifty-two and fifty-four, thence across the continent of North America, passing through Hudson's Bay and Greenland, near Cape Farewell; thence by mount Hecla to the highest point; thence tending gradually more to the south, across the northern parts of Asia, at or near the volcanoes of Kamtschatka, along the extinguished volcanoes of the Fox Islands, to the lowermost point again, near the north-west coast.\nIn the southern hemisphere, the highest point, or place where the distance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the polar opening, will be found in the southern Pacific ocean, in about latitude forty-six degrees south, and perhaps about longitude one hundred and thirty degrees west; and the lowermost point, or place where the distance is least from the equator to the verge of the opening, will be found on a meridian south or south-east of the island of Madagascar, in about latitude thirty-four degrees south, and longitude about fifty degrees east; thence passing near the cape of Good Hope, across the Atlantic ocean, and southern part of the continent of America, through a chain of active volcanoes, to the highest point; thence bearing regularly toward the lowest point, passing between the two islands of New-Zealand, or across the most southerly one, and the norternmost part of Van Dieman's land, to the lowest point, which is south or southeast of Madagascar; the apparent verge being several hundred miles beyond the real verge. Consequently, according to this formation of the sphere, the degrees of latitude, on different meridians, will varry according to their distance from the polar openings; and the magnetic equator; which encircles the sphere, parallel to the plane of the polar openings, would cut the real equator at an angle of twelve degrees. A person standing on the highest part of the apparent verge would appear under the pole star, or nearly so, and at the nintieth degree of latitude. The meridians all converge to the highest point of the verge, or the ninetieth degree; consequently in tracing a meridian of longitude, you would pursue a direction at right angles to the equator, until you arrived in the neighbourhood of the real verge if the polar opening, when the meridians would change their direction and turn along between the real and apparent verges towards the highest point, until they all terminated at the ninetieth degree of latitude; this being the direction a person would have to travel in order to have his back to the sun always at twelve o'clock, the time of his greatest altitude. Although the particular location of the places where the verges of the polar openings are believed to exist, may not have been ascertained with absolute certainty, yet they are believed to be nearly correct; their localities having been ascertained from appearances that exist in those regions; such as a belt or zone surrounding the globe where trees and otehr vegetation (except moss) do not grow; the tides of the ocean flowing in different directions, and appearing to meet; the existence of volcanoes; the \"ground swells\" in the sea being more frequent; the Aurora Borealis appearing to the southward; and various other phenomena existing in and about the same regions, mark the relative position of the real verges.\nThe heat and cold of the different climates are governed by their distance from the verge of the polar opening, and do not depend on their nearness or remoteness from the equator. The natural climates are parallel to the planes of the oplar openings, and cut the parallels of latitude at an angle of twelve degrees. When the sun is on the tropic of Capricorn, the circle of greatest cold would be about twenty-three and a hald degrees south of the apparent verge, and when the sun is on the tropic of Cancer, this circle would probably be just under the umbrage of the real verge: hence it follows, if this doctrine be correct, that the climate oif forty degrees north latitude on the plains of Missouri, in the western part of the continent of America, will be as cold in winter, as the latitude of fifty or fifty-two degrees in Europe; and observation has fully confirmed such to be a fact.\nThe magnetic principle which gives polarity to the needle, is believed to be regulated by the polar openings, and that the nedle always points directly to the opening, and of course parallel to a line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the opening. And when the apparent verge shall be passed, the needle will seem to turn nearly round, so as to point in an opposite direction; having the contrary end north on the interior of the sphere, that was north on the exterior, the same end being north on the interior which was south on the exterior. Hence when navigators arrive in the neighbourhood of the apparent verge, the variation of the needle is more or less reversed. The magnetic needle, on arriving at the verge, would appear to cease to pursue the same direction, but would in reality continue to maintain it, and lead directly into the polar opening.\nEach of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting the other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable both on the inner and the outer surface; and lighted and warmd according to those general laws which communicate light and heat to every other part of the universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so intense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes (about where the verge is suppose dto commence) by the paleness of the sun, and darkness of the sky; facts, which various navigators, who have visited those regions, confirm; yet they are no doubt sufficently lighted and warmed to promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable life.\nThe disciples of Symmes believe that each sphere has a cavity, or mid-plane space, near the centre of the matter composing it, filled with a very light, subtile, elastic substance, partaking somewhat, perhaps, of the nature of hydrogen gas; which aerial fluid is composed of molecules greatly rarified in comparison with the gravity of the extended or exposed surfaces of the sphere. This mid-plane space tends to give the sphere a degree of lightness and bouyancy. Besides this large mid-plane space, perhaps numerous other interstices exist in the sphere nearer the surface, and of more limited extent. The gas excaping from these spaces is, no doubt, the cause of earthquakes; and supply the numerous volcanoes. This gas, becoming rarified amd escaping, must occasion most of those great revolutions and phenomena in nature, which we know to have occured in the geology of the earth. This aerial fluid, with which the mid-plane spaces are filled, may possibly be adapted to the support of animal life; and the interior surfaces of the spheres formed by them, may abound with animals, with organs only adapted to the medium which they are destine dto inhabit.\"\nSuch is the general outline, given by our author, of the strange theory of Symmes. The arguments which he adduces in support of it are very numerous, and they have been thought, by many persons, to be plausible, if not convincing. We shall now present some of the most prominent of these arguments, and accompany them by sucj remarks as they must naturally suggest, without particular research, to any one tolerably conversant with the subjects to which they refer. Indeed, it would be trifling with the patience of our readers, to enter at large into the discussion of thsi matter; and we have, ourselves, neither the inclination nor the lesiure to do so.\nThe reasons in support of the theory, which are drawn from the mechanical properties of matter, are given in the third chapter; and, as might be supposed, our theorist places his great dependence on the centrifugal force arising from the earth's rotation about its axis.\n\"Were the matter of this globe thrown into a confused, disorganized state, and then put into a quick rotary motion, such as it is known to have, it would throw off from the centre towards the surface, first the heaviest, and next the lighter substances, which is the very order in which they are found to be arranged in the composition of the earth.\nThis principle, for it is simply the principle of projectile force, will account for mountains, hills, valleys, plains; and for nearly all the inequalities on the face of the erath. These circumstances depend on the density of substances composing the earth. Substances of the greatest specific gravity are susceptible of the greatest projectile force; and hence we find that mountains are composed of heavy masses of rock, mineral substances, and heavy earths; hills, or the next highest eminences, of earth of the next specific gravity; and plains, or level lands, of lighter substances.\"\nNothing can be more completely at variance both with reason and with facts, than the principle which is here asserted. The centrifugal force to which a body is subjected, is proportional, not to its absolute velocity, as our author always seems to suppose, but to the deflection fromn the tangent, produced by the rotation, in a given time, as in a second. The firce of gravity is proportional to the space through which a body will fall in a second. Both of these can be readily ascertained; and it has been found, that, at the equator, where the centrifugal force is the greatest, and that of gravity the least, the former is but one 289th part of the latter. Every one, indeed, can see, by the almost irresistable power with which heavy masses are bound to the earth, that the force of gravity far transcends the centrifugal force, and that it is therefore absurd to suppose that this last could have raised the Alps and the Andes, or have produced the many other wonderful effects ascribed to it in the new theory.\nThe author gives no distinct notion of the manner in which the concentric spheres are formed, and is indeed evidently embarrassed when he comes to this subject. He states that he \"has long had strong doubts whether the laws of gravity are well understood, or whether the rules on which calculations respecting the form of the earth could eb made, are exactly known.\" In these difficulties, he sagely determines \"to take the broad principles of nature for his guide,\" and then, with perfect gravity, presents us with such reasonings as the following: \"The earth must be composed of concentric spheres, because the water on the side of a cutler's grindstone arranges itself into \"something resembling concentric circles, one within another, and the surface of the earth (he apprehends) revolves with much greater velocity than any grindstone.\" -- Again, the appearance presented when steel filings are sifted upon a card placed over a magnet, (satisfactorily explained in all books of natural philosophy,) is supposed \"to illustrate that a disposition to concentric spheres does exist in nature.\" Again, the earth must be hollow, because Capt. Symmes supposes that the meteoric stones are so, since they burst like a bomb-shell, and some fo the fragments have curved surfaces.\nThe author, asopting the maxim of\nstill goes on with reasons, though they increase in absurdity. \"Inquire of the botanist, and he will tell you, that the plants which grow up spontaneously, agreeably to the established laws of nature, are hollow cylinders:\" (for example, the forest trees, &c.) \"Inquite of the anatomist, and he will tell you, that the large bones of all animals are hollow. Go to the mineralogist, and he will inform you that the stone called aerolite, (oolite?) and many other mineral bodies, are composed of hollow concentric circles.\" Lastly, \"he cannot perceive any thing more derogatory from the power, wisdom, or divine economy of the Almighty, in the formation of a hollow world, than in that of solid ones; and he is rather of opinion, that a construction of all the orbs in creation, on a plan corresponding to Symmes's theory, would display the highest possible degree of perfection, wisdom, and (as Dr. Mitchell expresses it), a great saving of stuff.\"\nThus ends the chapter. Let us now ourselves briefly inquire into the light which we may derive from the sciences, as to the structure of our earth. In the first place, then, we remark, that the fact of the earth's having a globular form, is string evidence that it must once have been composed of fluid, or, at least, of plastic materials. Now, on this supposition, to determine the form that would be assumed by the earth, in consequence of the mutual actions of gravity and the centrifugal force upon its several parts, becomes a problem of mechanics, which has been completely solved by many mathematicians. The Cartesians, who believed that the gravitating force urged all particles directly to the center of the globe, found, by an easy calculation, that, supposing the earth of uniform density, its form must be an oblate spheroid, having the equatorial and polar diameters in the ration of 578 to 577; an ellipticity which is much too small. The problem to be solved by the Newtonian philosophers, was much more difficult. As the attractive force resides in all particles, it will be itself modified by the form of the earth, and thus the very result of which we are in search, enters as an element in the calculation. This difficulty has been overcome; and the figure of the earth has been determined, not only on the hypothesis of its being homogenous, but on the probable supposition of an increase in the density of the strata as we descend below the surface. In every case, the earth must be a solid spheroid. If homogeneous, the ratio of the diameters will be 230 to 229; if increasing in density downwards, the ellipticity will not be so great.\nThese conclusions, it must be observed, are to a certain extent hypothetical. It is evident that the matter at the surface of the earth is not homogeneous, and we are wholly ignorant of the nature of that which constitutes the interior portions. We have means, however, for conducting our inquiries, which are free from this objection. Of these the most important is the measurement of different degrees of meridian, an operation which has been executed with great accuracy, at different points, from the equator, to nearly sixty-seven degrees of north latitude. These measures show some irregularity in the form of the earth, but agree, on the whole, remarkably well with the above hypothesis. They show that the earth is an oblate spheroid, having the compression equal to .0032. This ellipticity is less than that which would correspond to a homogeneous earth, and shows that, far from being hollow, the density increases towards the centre.\nThese rigid measures have not been extended to captain Symmes's verge; for it is worthy of note, that he has placed his highest point about one degree beyond the most northern measurement, which was made in Lapland by the Swedish academicians. WE shall return to this subject.\nAnother mode of estimating the figure of the earth, is by the force of gravity at different points of its surface, which may be determined by the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. Very accurate experiments have been made on this subject, in various places, from the Falkland Islands, in latitude 51 degrees 31 seconds 43 minutes south, to Spitzbergen, in latitude 79 degrees 49 minutes 58 seconds north. The results have been lately compared to a mean ellipticity of .0033, being very nearly the same as that deduced from the measurements of the meridian, and wholly inconsistent with the notion that the earth is hollow, or that it has an oblique and distorted figure... we may, therefore, consider it demonstrated, that the density of the earth increases toward the centre, so that it cannot be hollow.\nBut Capt. Symmes not only believes the earth to be hollow, but that it is inhabited on the inner surface. If it be so, the inhabitants must be placed in a most unstable position. Let us first suppose that there are but one of these soperical shells, and that it is symmetrical and complete. It is well known that a body placed within such a sphere will be equally attracted in all directions; and if it adhere to the surface, it can be only in consequence of the centrifugal force due to the earth;s rotation, Now we have seen that the maximum of this force is but the 289th part of gravity. Within the shell, it must be still less... so that here, a man of one hundred and fifty pounds' weight, would adhere to the surface with a force of but eight ounces... and it would be one of the advantages of these inner men, that they might fly through the air, with great ease, by the aid of a lady's fan.\nCapt. Symmes imagines that the sea extends quite through the outer sphere, in many places, and that seals, whales, and herrings are in the custom of passing through. But this notion is contradicted by the known laws of nature. If we suppose a column of water forming such a communication, the gravitation of its particles would indeed diminish, as they approached nearer to the inner surface; for the sperical shell, which is exterior to any particle, does not contribute to its weight. A portion of the water, near the base, might therefore, if alone, be supported by the centrifugal force. But it must be observed, that this portion is not independent, but is urged downward by the pressure of the incumbant mass, so that the whole must sink into the abyss below...\nFrom the earth, our theorist passes into the heavens, and thinks he can find there striking evidences of his system. Let us follow him for a few moments.\nThe phenomenon upon which he places the greatest dependence, is the ring, or rather the rings, of Saturn.\n\"The appearance of Saturn, I conceive, establishes the fact, that the principle of concentric spheres, or hollow planets, does exist, at least in one instance, in the solar system. And if the fact be established that it exists in one case, is it not fair, nay, is it not almost a certain and necessary consequences, that the same laws of matter which formed one planet into concentric spheres, must form all the others on a plan more or less the same? If we draw any conclusion, or form any opinion at all respecting the formation of the planets, whose inner parts we cannot see; or, if we form any opinion in relation to our own planet in particular, whose poles have never been explored, would not reasoning from analogy bring us to the cinslusion, that all bodies of matter are formed similar to that of Saturn, unless we have positive proof to the contrary?\"\nNow, nothing surely can less resemble concentric spheres than these rings. They are plates of matter, so thin, that when theire edges are turned toward us, they are completely invisible... In fact, the ring revolves like a satellite, and its periodical time has been to be exactly the same as that which the laws of Kepler would require for a satellite places at the same mean distance from the planet. Thus the ring of Saturn, instead of leading us to the adoption of any new laws of nature, serves to illustrate and confirm those which were already established, and by which we have shown the impossibility of Symmes's theory....\nThe appearances of the sun and moon puzzle our system-maker, as well they may. He makes, indeed, a kind of apology for them, but it is far from being satidfactory. We see the whole of the sun's disc brightly illuminated, and it has not the most distant appearance of polar openings. The moon, too, is our immediate neighbour, and every appearance on its surface can be accurately distinguished. The liberation in latitude latitude enables us, moreover, to see both its poles in succession. Direct observations can, therefor, be made, and they all unite in showing that the moon has no polar openings.\nBut the ungrateful moon affords still further evidences against the theory of these visionaries. In the lunar eclipses, the shadow of the earth is thrown upon the moon's surface, and thus a profile of the earth is exhibited. It is always sensibly circular. But if there were sections of four to six thousand miles in diameter cut off from the poles, this could not fail, in certain positions of the sun, to be plainly and palpably shown...\nWe come now to consider the arguments which are drawn from the evidence of voyagers and travellers in the arctic regions. This evidence, it would indeed seem, must be decisive of the question, if any question still remain; for seas and lands, far within the imaginary verges, have been repeatedly traversed, in all directions, and no signs of a polar opening have been perceived. Captain Symmes endeavours to evade this difficulty, by his winding meridians; and it is certainly true, that, if the earth have the distorted figure which he imagines, most of the meridians will no longer lie in a plane...\nThe open sea, which is reported to be found about the poles, has been adduced as a string evidence in favour of the new theory. As to the north pole, we may now, perhaps, consider this as dountful, as it is certainly not confirmed by the resulkts of the late voyages. Still it is very possible, that, in summer, the currents may carry the ice into lower latitudes, so as to leave the polar regions comparatively free...\nThe migration of the animals of the arctic regions to the north in winter, and their return to the south in summer, is strongly asserted, and it is of course imagined that they retreat into the inner earth for comfortable quarters. To this argument we reply, that it is not supported by facts. The deer, musk ox, and other quadrupeds, mentioned by our author, are not properly migratory animals, and their occasional changes of situation are irregular, and seem to be governed only by the search for food.... With regard to the other animals mentioned, we believe the author to be equally mistaken in his facts, particularly as to the migratory fish, whose winter retreat is probably in the deep sea, where the temperature is uniform and moderate.\nBUt, according to our author, the Esquimaux themselves also go north in winter, to enjoy the comforts of the pole. In proof of this, the only direct evidence that id adduced, is a conversation that took place with the first natives met by captain Ross, in his voyage to Baffin's Bay... From this conversation our author infers, that \"these people must live in a country not composed of ice, for it seems they deem such an one uninhabitable...\" Now it happens that this mysterious country was but a short distance from the place where the interview occurred; that it was, soon after, visited by captain Ross; and that he examined and describes \"the nature of the country, its produce, inhabitants, lanuage, mode of living, manners, customs, and religion.\" It is situate between the latitudes seventy-six degrees and seventy-seven degrees forty minutes north, and the longitudes sixty degrees and seventy degrees west....\nThe immense distance at which objects are said to be seen occasionally in the polar regions, is another facts brought by our author in support of his theory... Now the optical fact alluded to, was one of a series of phenomena due to the extraordinary refraction which is called looming, and which is witnessed in all latitudes....\nThe last argument that we shall mention, (for it is time to bring this discussion to a close,) is contained in the following paragraph:\n\"Those appearances observed in the southern hemisphere, which are termed Magellanic clouds, by navigators, have not, so far as I know, been accounted for... their colour is like that of far distant mountains, on which the sun is shining.... They are stationary, appearing perpetually fixed at a certain height, and in a given situation, as viewed from any given place. The stars and the heavens, in their diurnal revolutions, sweep by them... These clouds are only seen in the night, when the atmosphere is clear, at which time the sun is shining on the islands in question.\"\nStrange as it may seem, the statements which are here made respecting the Mage;;anic clouds, are wholly unfounded. These meteors are in fact nebulae, composed of clusters of telescopic stars, like the milky way; have their fixed place in the heaveans, like the other constellations; and revolve regularly about the pole in twenty-four hours. All this is so notorious, that it is astonishing how the whole Symmes school could have remaind ignorant of it. Even a common celestial globe would have shown them these constellations, near the south pole, under the names of Nebulea major, and Nebula minor....\nOur author next gives a chapter, on what the Symmesites call mid-plane spaces, and explains, by their aid, earthquakes and volcanoes, and sundry other phenomena. Our readers will readily excuse us from entering into a discussion of these matters.\nOne of the favourite projects of the adherents of Symmes's theory, is the establishment of an expedition to explore the inner earth. Our author devotes a chapter to this subject; and the master of the sect is now travelling, from place to place, and, like a second Peter the Hermit, zealously preaching up a crusade to this Holy Land. We are gravely told, that, to judge by the size of the seals, and bears, (and Esquimaux,) which come from the interior of the globe, it must be better suitd for animal life than the portion which has fallen to our lot, so that by emigrating to this land of promise, we may probably be relieved from many of the evils to which mankind are subjected here above. If our old-fashioned philosophy be correct, however, we fear that this desireable change can never be effected, and that we must be content to finish the journey of life, in the less comfortable condition of outside passengers,\nThe work is concluded by a biographical notice of the founder os the new theory. That posterity may not, as in the case of Homer and other great men, dispute about his birth-place, it is announced that this distinguished honour belongs to our sister state of New-Jersey. It appears that he fought barvely during the late war; and we are certainly not disposed to deny, that a very unsound philosopher, may be a gallant soldier and an estimable man. -- (excerpts from American Quarterly Review Vol. I, No. 1, Mar. 1827: pp. 235-253)\nVarious Articles on\nJohn C.

D.\n(In the preparation of this article I have been greatly indebted to my friend Robert Clarke, Esq., of Cincinnati. He kindly furnished me with... a biographical sketch of Captain Symmes that will appear in the second volume of \"McBride's Pioneer Biographies\"...)\nDuring the first quarter of the present century the interest in Polar explorations was scarcely less absorbing than it has been for the last twenty years.... In all the past the discovery of unknown lands and peoples has had a strange fascination for a class of men of marked intelligence and courage. The broad expanse of blue sea, untrodden paths in the wilderness, desert wastes of land and snow with all their perils and privations, have charms for these men that we of quiet ways and common ambitions can not understand. Some of these explorers have been dreamers and enthusiasts, searching for fountains of eternal youth and mines of gold and precious stones, or had aspirations for kingly power; others were led on by the noble ambition of building up the kingdom of Christ by converting heathen nations from their idolatry. They have always been ready to aid the great commercial and scientific leaders in working out their hopes and plans, or proving the baselessness of their hasty theories....\nMany of these theories of the earth's surface have been fanciful and grotesque, and their authors coveted in vain the opportunity of proving their faith. One of these more marked than any other of modern times in these respects was first announced in print from the city from which we now write. The face of the author was familiar to many still living, and his body sleeps quietly in the old burying-ground at Hamilton, Ohio. We refer to Captain John Cleve [sic, Cleves?] Symmes and his curious theory of \"Concentric Spheres,\" and an opening at the poles by which men could pass into the interior of the earth. Dying, he believed that time would prove his fancies true, and place his name beside or above Newton's. This dreamer and his startling or curious theories will be the subject of this paper. In the Spring of 1818 the good people of St. Louis were interested and amused in turn by the following, circular... [transcript follows]...\nCaptain Symmes was well known among the best and most intelligent citizens of St. Louis, and was highly esteemed even by those who had no faith in his theories. He had his family residence for a number of years at Bellefontaine, the old United States military post some sixteen miles above the city, on the banks of the Mississippi River, which post was superseded years ago by the present well-known Jefferson Barracks.... The \"Captain\" was born in New Jersey in 1780, and having received a good English education, entered the United States army, in his twenty-second year, as ensign. By regular and well-earned promotion he reached the grade of captain in 1812. During the war that was then pending he served faithfully and with distinction, retiring from the army in 1816. The greater portion of his military life was spent in the South-West.\nOn returning to civil life he engaged in furnishing supplies to the Government troops stationed on the Upper Mississippi... At the time when his first circular was published he was in the strength of his manhood, and is described as of middle stature and fairly proportioned; face somewhat small and oval, and attractive blue eyes that gave indication of a mind absorbed in speculation.... His voice was not good, nor did he succeed as a speaker, although frequently speaking in his later years before mixed audiences. Men of ability were readily attached to him, and he was greatly beloved by all who knew him well.\nThe late Col. M'Bride, of Hamilton, Ohio, who was his devoted friend and disciple, and published a small volume in 1826 in exposition and defense of his theory, describes it as follows:\n\"According to Symmes's Theory, the earth, as well as all the celestial orbicular bodies existing in the universe, visible and invisible, which partake in any degree of a planetary nature, from the greatest to the smallest, from the sun down to the most minute blazing meteor or falling star, are all constituted, in a greater or less degree, of a collection of spheres, more or less solid, concentric with each other, and more or less open at their poles * * *\n\"According to him, the planet which has been designated the Earth is composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces between each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well upon the concave as the convex surface. All of these spheres are widely open at their poles. The north polar opening of the sphere we inhabit is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and the southern above six thousand * * * * Although the particular location of the places where the verges of the polar openings are believed to exist, may not have been ascertained with absolute certainty, yet they are believed to be nearly correct, their localities having been ascertained from appearances that exist in those regions: such as a belt or zone surrounding the globe where trees and other vegetation -- except mosses -- do not grow; the tides of the ocean flowing in different directions, and appearing to meet; the existence of volcanoes; the 'groundswells' in the sea being more frequent; the aurora borealis appearing to the southward; and various other phenomena existing in and about the same regions, mark the relative position of the real verges.\n\"According to this formation of the sphere, a traveler or navigator might proceed true north any where west of the highest point of the verge, say on the continent of America, until he came to the verge. The meridian on which he was traveling would then wind along the verge to the right, until he arrived at the ninetieth degree; and by proceeding south, in the same direction, he would arrive at the coast of Siberia, without going far into the concavity of the sphere, and without knowing that he had been within the verge.\n\"Each of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting the other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable both on the inner and outer surface; and lighted and warmed according to those general laws which communicate light and heat to every part of the universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so intense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes -- about where the verge is supposed to commence -- by the paleness of the sun, and darkness of the sky; facts, which navigators who have visited these regions confirm; yet they are no doubt sufficiently lighted and warmed to promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable life.\"\nWe have culled these passages which give a general idea of the theory, which had been wrought out by Captain Symmes during a course of many years, until, when the circular was issued, it had mastered his whole life, and was to give cast to all his remaining days. Many of his arguments were too abstruse for the satisfaction of the general reader.... He did not doubt that he had penetrated the secret of the plan on which all the heavenly bodies had been constructed. But there were also terrestrial appearances and facts upon which he relied as valuable confirming evidences. The migration of animal life in the Arctic regions, to which all polar navigators had called attention, tended to sustain his theory. Shoals of fish came from the north, darkening the waters by their presence, in the Spring season; great droves of reindeer came down from the same region in March or April, and returned northward in October; the same periods and direction of movement marked the innumerable fowls of the arctic seas. We now account for these movements of animal life by our theories of an open sea; but he was satisfied that they came from quiet waters, serene skies, and luxuriant vegetation within the hollow earth....\nCopies of circular No. I were addressed to every institution of learning in the United States, and to nearly all of our distinguished men then living.... Jest and levity met it on every side; but what annoyed its author more was, that men were not willing to join him in argument, so ridiculous seemed his theory. I well remember when a boy, in Cincinnati, that \"Symmes's Hole\" was the synonym of absurdity. But undaunted by such a reception from the public, the first circular was followed by others and newspaper articles, in which he stoutly maintained the correctness of his views, sustaining himself with the reflection that many others who had given the world new ideas had been treated with corresponding neglect and contempt.\nIn 1819 he removed from St. Louis and made his residence at Newport, Kentucky, and in the following year, finding that he made slow progress in the use of his pen, he determined to enter the field as a lecturer. At Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Zanesville in Ohio, and at Lexington and Frankfort in Kentucky, large and intelligent audiences were assembled who gave him a respectful attention. The attraction of the lecture was the novelty of the theme, and then the honesty and earnestness of the lecturer commanded attention and respect. But few were won to his side or had the courage to confess that they sympathized with him. Especially he failed to convince men of wealth, from whom he hoped to obtain the means to fit out an expedition to the polar regions. As a last resort he determined to solicit aid from the National Government and the States. So in the year 1822 he addressed a petition to the Congress of the United States setting forth his views at length, and his belief that the nation would derive great honor, and possibly profit, by the verification of his theory. Congress was therefore urged to fit out an expedition consisting of two vessels of two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons burden, with supplies and men, for a voyage of discovery. It was his desire to command and be responsible for the success of the undertaking. This petition was presented to the Senate by Colonel R. M. Johnson, of Kentucky. A motion to refer it to the Committee on Foreign Relations was lost, and, without much delay, it was laid on the table. In the following year he tried again to gain the attention of Congress, but utterly failed. He now turned to the Legislature of Ohio, asking them to approve of his enterprise and recommend Congress to furnish him with the means to prosecute a voyage of discovery in the North. His petition was read, and then its further consideration was indefinitely postponed....\nAbout this time the Russian Government, which had taken great interest in polar discoveries, was fitting out an expedition, at great expense, under the direction of Count Romanoff, a distinguished patron of science. Captain Symmes applied, through our minister at the Court of St. Petersburg, for permission to accompany the expedition. The application was cheerfully granted, but he was unable to procure a proper outfit, and had to abandon the project.\nStill hoping for success, in the Fall of 1825, accompanied by a young lawyer of Ohio who was a convert to his views, he set out to make a tour eastward, intending to lecture at all the considerable towns on the route. His health was beginning to fail, and he was forced for a time to return home. But in the following year he was again in the field, and lectured at Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, passing into Canada. But his labors, and the excitement, and discouragements of his plans -- for every where he was ridiculed or looked upon as a lunatic -- preyed upon his health, and he reluctantly sought rest among his friends in his native place. As soon as he was sufficiently restored he turned homeward, broken down in spirit. He had moved his family to a farm near Hamilton, Ohio, and his great desire was to enjoy the sympathy and consolation of those who loved him. He was so feeble when he reached Cincinnati that he was removed with great difficulty to his home, but with tender care. On the 29th of May, wearied and worn out by the ten years of anxiety, disappointment, and toil which he had borne with wonderful patience, he fell asleep in death.\nHis oldest son, who still lives near Louisville, Kentucky, erected a monument over his remains, which is still to be seen...\nCaptain Symmes deserves a tender remembrance, and his friends never failed to cherish his memory, and regret that his last years were so full of cheerless mortification. Had the opportunity been afforded him to penetrate the polar latitudes, his faith and courage would have made him one of the boldest adventurers, and he would scarcely have failed to return with useful information and the broader and more truthful views that are now held by intelligent men. No man of his day had studied the subject more thoroughly, and his plans for penetrating the icy North were those that later explorers have adopted with advantage. But his theory has so many of the elements that are woven into childish Munchausen stories, that few men could consider it with any degree of seriousness... -- (excerpts from The Ladies' Repository Vol. 8, No. 2, Aug 1871: pp.133-136)\nTHE \u00a0SYMMES \u00a0THEORY \u00a0OF \u00a0THE \u00a0EARTH.\nby P. Clark.\nThis theory originated some fifty years ago with Captain John Cleves Symmes of Newport, Kentucky. He was a captain in the United States Army, and spent the best part of his life in the service of his country. He was a man of decided ability, and a bold and original thinker.\nDissatisfied with the Newtonian theory of the earth, he promulgated his own, by sundry articles in the press, and by lectures before the faculties and students of colleges in different parts of the country.... During the winter of 1826-27 he lectured before the faculty and students of Union College, and by none was he heard with more profound attention than by the learned and venerable Drs. Nott and Wayland. The writer was a member of the Senior Class of 1827, and in common with other members of his class took copious notes.\nFrom these notes he has prepared the present article, claiming only to present the theory of Captain Symmes as propounded in his lectures at Union, adding, indeed, some new facts from recent explorations, and drawing from them some inferences in accordance with the theory.\nAccording to this, the earth is globular, hollow, and open at the poles. The diameter of the northern opening is about two thousand miles, or four thousand miles from outside to outside. The south opening is somewhat larger.... The shell of the earth is about one thousand miles thick, and the edges of this shell at the openings are called verges...\nThe line which marks the location of the apex of the northern verge begins at a point in Lapland... through Hudson's Bay and over the continent to the Pacific... crossing the south part of Kamtchatka, continuing northwest through Siberia, entering Europe across the Ural Mountains... to the point of starting.\nCaptain Symmes collated with great labor many isolated facts from his own researches, and from the accounts of Ross, Howe, Parry, McKenzie, and others who had by sea and land explored the polar regions, while similar proofs have been drawn from later explorations, since the promulgation of the theory in 1829....\nThere is a remarkable difference of climate under different meridians upon the same parallel of latitude. It is known that the climate of the eastern coast of North America is much colder than that of Western Europe in the same latitude. The notion that this diversity is produced by the proximity of the ocean or of ranges of mountains is unsatisfactory...The Gulf Stream does not satisfactorily account for this diversity of climate between America and Europe....\nThe characteristics of the isothermal belts of both hemispheres throw some light upon this theory. The region of the verges must be the coldest parts of the earth's surface, because, being more convex, they diverge instead of converging the sun's rays. The temperature, therefore, of any given part of the earth's surface depends as well upon its proximity to the verge as to the equator....\nThus, while this theory does not explain all the phenomena of climatic differences as indicated by the isothermal belts, it affords a general rule for explaining why the climate of Europe is milder than that of North America....\nThe theory of ocean currents will not explain these climatic differences upon the earth's surface.... [but] Further discoveries may throw more light upon this mysterious subject, and explain these ocean currents in connection with the interior currents of the earth, across the verges in both directions, and thus demonstrate the truth of Captain Symmes's theory....\nCaptain Parry and others speak of the brilliant twilight of the North, as being sufficient to enable them to read ordinary printed matter distinctly. This curious fact is wholly inexplicable upon the Newtonian theory, but is easy of explanation upon this. This twilight coming from the north may be caused by the sun's rays thrown into the interior through the southern opening, which by two refractions, one at each opening, and two or three reflections from the inner concave surface, would pass out at the north over the verge, and produce there this strong twilight.\nCaptain Parry states that, when sailing northward in high latitude, the North Star rises over the bow of the ship to the zenith and then declines towards the stern.... The ship going north along the deflected meridians upon and over the verge causes these apparent changes in the North Star.\nFurther confirmation of the Symmes theory is drawn from the variations and dip of the magnetic needle... midway between the verges lies the magnetic equator cutting the equator of the earth at an angle of twelve degreess.... These are curious facts and are entitled to consideration. If they do not fully explain the variation of the magnetic needle, they present some views which may help to clear up these mysteries of nature.\nThe dip of the needle is another phenomenon not fully understood..... The true magnetic poles are not at the points where the \"line of no variation\" terminates, -- at the north and south, -- but are equidistant from this line and immediately under the highest points of the verges north and south, and \"the line of no variation\" lies midway between these magnetic poles. The needle, while it does not vary, along the line, to the right or left, yet, as it goes northward or southward from the magnetic equator, it is attracted towards the true magnetic poles lying under the highest part of the verges; and so the dip is increased till it reaches the apex of the verge, where it is the greatest....\nThe aurora borealis affords a most interesting illustration... rarefaction and condensation produces the aurora along the verges, where the greatest condensation takes place. In proof of this view, Captain Parry and other explorers and navigators state that, when in high latitudes upon and beyond the verge, the aurora is almost always seen in a southerly or southwesterly direction.\nNavigators in the South Atlantic, while sailing down the coast of South America, observe, low in the horizon, to the east and southeast, several bright, luminous bodies, like clouds in the sky, which become more and more elevated as the vessel goes south, until, in the vicinity of the Straits of Magellan, these clouds appear nearly in the zenith.... Captain Symmes holds that these bright clouds are produced by the light of the sun reflected from New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land, and perhaps the south part of New Holland, which lie upon the opposite side of the earth, and which, in the vicinity of Cape Horn, are nearly in the zenith....the light thrown from these islands would present them as bright, luminous bodies, always seen in the same direction, like moons, reflecting the light of the sun. They do not rise and set, as do the sun and moon; and this fact gives plausibility to the explanation.\nFacts attested by good authority prove the existence of a warmer climate beyond the verge....Hearn establishes this fact.... The statements of Hearn, so far as relates to climate, are corroborated by other travellers. They concur in stating that, in high latitude, the inhabitants speak of the south as colder than the north in the winter, and that they migrate north in the winter season to a milder climate.\nOne navigator, Captain Ross, when in high latitude beyond the verge, speaks of the Arctic Sea as being calm and clear of ice, while south of him was a wide belt of ice. He describes the currents of air coming from the north as being so warm as to dissolve the snow and ice around him and far to the south. Captain Parry makes frequent mention of these warm currents of air coming from the north and north-east, -- that is, from the. interior of the earth....\nImmense shoals of herrings in good condition, according to Buffon, come down from the polar seas, and are never known to return... Admit the Symmes theory, and the conjecture would not be unreasonable, that they make the annual circuit of the earth, over the exterior and interior surfaces and through both openings at the poles. If, on the present hypothesis of the earth, we allow land enough for the sustenance of the numerous herds of animals which annually migrate to the polar regions, there would hardly remain water sufficient for the immense shoals of fishes which abound there....\nDriftwood is found in great quantities upon the northern coasts of Iceland, Norway, Spitzbergen, and the arctic borders of Siberia, having every appearance of a tropical production. Trees of large dimensions and of different kinds are found, some in a good state of preservation. Vegetables of singular character, and flowers of peculiar fragrance and color, unknown to botanists, are sometimes found in this drift. These could not be the production of the cold arctic regions, nor is it probable they were drifted thither by the Gulf Stream or by submarine currents... one of the results of late German exploration in the arctic regions is the discovery of beds of mineral coal... Greenland must have been once covered with a rich vegetation; or, as Captain Symmes might have urged, these deposits were drifted from the interior of the earth....\nAll these facts being admitted, -- and most of them are fully established by incontestable proofs, -- the conclusion is legitimate, that, far to the north of the frozen regions of the verge, there exists a milder climate and an open sea, whose existence has never been fully explained, and is inconsistent with the Newtonian theory of the earth.\nLittle is known of the southern verge, but many of the facts in support of the northern verge are applicable to this also. The unequal distribution of land upon the globe is remarkable, three fourths of it being in the northern hemisphere. This unequal distribution might seem to [jeopardize] the equilibrium of our planet; but it may be counterpoised by a corresponding inequality of land in the interior; or the general depth of the ocean in the southern hemisphere may be less, and so compensate this unequal distribution of land surface upon the earth....\nCaptain Symmes maintained that the other planets, like the earth, were each composed of concentric spheres; but I have not space sufficient to refer to the telescopic appearances which are noticed by him in support of his theory. The most common objection to his theory is, that, if it were true, the sun could not possibly light and warm the interior of the world. This is easily answered. The rays of light come parallel from the sun to the earth, and, if he were no larger than the earth, they would fall at least twelve degrees upon the concave interior surface, as they passed over the lower part of the verge both north and south. But the earth in her annual revolution, owing to the inclination of the poles to the plane of her orbit, alternately permits the incident rays to fall much more than twelve degrees upon the interior surface. This inclination is 23 degrees 30 minutes, which, added to 12 degrees, the angularity of the verges, gives 35 degrees 30 minutes of the concave surface upon which the direct incident rays of the sun fall. But these rays, passing over the dense, cold air of the verges, are refracted many degrees, probably at least ten or fifteen degrees, so that by one refraction and one or two reflections the rays of light would be thrown out over the verge opposite to that through which they entered; and because those rays would converge upon the concave surface instead of diverging, they would produce abundant light and heat throughout the whole interior. As compared with moonlight, the sun's rays, reflected from one interior surface to the other, would be as much more intense as the square of the diameter of the inner world is less than the square of the distance of the moon from the earth. According to this law, assuming the diameter of the interior to average 4,000 miles, and the moon's distance 240,000 miles, the light of the interior would be equal to 3,600 moons as large as our sun, and this too without considering the greater intensity of the interior light upon a concave surface over that of the moonlight reflected from and falling upon convex surfaces. These views, which are in accordance with the known laws of light, show that this popular objection has not the slightest force. On the contrary, the strong probability would be, that, on account of intense light and heat, the interior would be uninhabitable, except around the vicinity of the verges both north and south....\nThe extent of the visible horizon, to the inhabitants of the interior, would be largest immediately around the verges, and it would contract as the observer receded from the verges towards the equatorial regions of the interior surface....\nThere are many other facts and arguments which were from time to time urged by Captain Symmes in support of his theory. The writer has lately seen a small anonymous book written in 1824 \"by a citizen of the United States,\" and published in Cincinnati, which has great interest. It enlarges the arguments drawn from the telescopic appearances of the planets, the laws of gravitation, and the doctrine of mid-plane spaces between the concentric spheres of the planets. It is stated in this work that Captain Symmes maintained that there were openings through the crust of the earth from the interior to the exterior surface through which the water flowed, and facts are given in support of this idea. It is one of great interest, however, as connected with the phenomena of subterranean rivers, submarine currents, earthquakes and volcanoes, artesian wells, springs on high mountains, etc.\nIn this little book it is also stated that Captain Symmes held that our earth had at least five concentric spheres. Such might have been his views as early as 1823 and 1824, at and prior to the time when this work was published, but such were not the views expressed in his lectures at Union College in 1827. Doubtless his views were modified more or less between 1827 and 1829, when he died....\nTime, the great revealer of secrets, will soon determine whether this startling theory is true, in whole or in part, and whether its author was a visionary enthusiast, or a profound philosopher whose name will be honored among men, like that of Franklin or Newton, as a benefactor of his race, and an honor to the country which gave him birth. -- (excerpts from Atlantic Monthly, v. 31, #186, Apr. 1873: pp. 471-481)\nSYMMES \u00a0AND \u00a0HIS \u00a0THEORY.\nby E. F. Madden\nOccasional allusions to what is called Symmes's theory... The writer is indebted to Mr. Americus Symmes, a son of John Cleves Symmes, the author of the theory, for much interesting information concerning the man and his hypothesis....\n[Americus said] \"...if my father's plan was adopted, the riddle of an open polar sea could soon be solved, the pole reached, and Symmes's new world found. My father's plan, as suggested in his petitions to Congress in 1823-4, was to spend a year up North at about 80 degrees north latitude, and there keep an eye to the wild animals that inhabit that region every summer -- coming from the north every spring and returning north every fall -- and in the fall of the second year follow them in their journey northward ... Whither those animals go, man can certainly follow... and if man can follow them, that is, go north with them in the fall, and return with them in the spring, it will only take two or three years at the most to determine if the pole can be reached, or the new world found to which these animals go....\"\nJohn Cleves Symmes, the author of the theory of concentric spheres, was the son of Timothy Symmes, of New Jersey... Symmes when about forty-six years of age is described as follows: \"He is of middle stature, and tolerably proportioned, with scarcely anything in his exterior to characterize the secret operations of his mind, except an abstraction which from attentive inspection is found seated on a slightly contracted brow, and the glances of a bright blue eye that often seem fixed on something beyond immediate surrounding objects....\" During the early part of his life he received what was then considered a common English education, which he improved in after-life by having access to tolerably well selected libraries. In 1802, at the age of about twenty-two years, he entered the army of the United States... After retiring from service, until his death, Captain Symmes had his residence at Newport, Kentucky. He first published his views in 1818, in St. Louis, Missouri. His theory was at first received with universal ridicule; the French Academy declared it unworthy of serious consideration, and a petition to Congress presented by Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, was disregarded. Symmes was held to be little better than a lunatic.... The latter part of Symmes's life was spent wholly in developing his theory, lecturing, writing, and traveling. He died in May, 1829....\nThe two most important features of John Cleves Symmes's theory are that all orbicular bodies in the universe partaking of a planetary nature are composed in a greater or less degree of spheres concentric, one within the other, and to some extent open at their poles; and that gravity is due to the pressure of an impalpable element composed of minute concentric spheres, existent throughout all space, elastic, and changing its molecules by any change of matter whatever throughout space. To this substance Captain Symmes attributes gravity, making it a pushing instead of a pulling force, as it is now generally held to be. But this latter theory of gravitation he holds not to be essential to his theory of concentric circles, which circles would be formed upon the old theory of gravitation.\nCaptain Symmes published notes or explanations of his theory, which he called memoirs. Memoir No. II. says:\n\"With dividers describe a circle on a plane of matter of loose texture, and in the centre add a very small circle; then draw a line through the centre. It is evident (as matter gravitates matter in proportion to quantity and distance) that either half of the inner circle, being almost equally surrounded by matter, must be very little gravitated centrewise; so being suspended, only a rotary motion is needed to throw it compactly toward the outer circle. This being admitted, it follows that half-way from the outer to the inner side of this circle of matter so thrown out, a like rarity, suspension, or balance of gravity should prevail, and hence a disposition to concentric circles; therefore it follows that successive similar subdivisions should exist, gradually lessening in force or quantity. By applying this principle to the earth, I found the necessity of hollow, concentric spheres. A decision of school-men on these lines shall be followed by additional positions, further explaining my new principles of hollow spheres, open at the poles, declared in a circular letter of the 10th of April, 1818.\n\"JOHN CLEVES SYMMES,\nof Ohio, late Captain of Infantry.\"\nThis is the basis of Symmes's theory. This theory he maintained with great earnestness, courage, and disinterestedness during a large part of his life, and were he living now, be would in all likelihood be doughtily contending for it still, accommodating his theory to the Nares expedition -- which went where he declared irrefutable optical proof could be had of the polar openings -- and all other discoveries whatsoever.\nAmong other arguments that he brought to his support were the migrations of animals to and from the arctic regions, atmospheric refraction, and the variation of the compass observed in high northern latitudes....\nSymmes believed that there were beneath our feet miles and miles of wondrous unclaimed domain; reindeer roamed its colder borders, fish swam in its seas, animals and trees and flowers of curious and unknown shape made its life a primal gladness; splendid visions of untold wonders, misty dreams of splendors unnamable, floated through his nightly and daily thoughts, and greater than all burned within him the ceaseless desire to become the discoverer of this unknown land. And the only thing needful was for the government to traverse the \"icy circle,\" pierce the polar opening, and sail in and take possession - perchance to find man, to meet a mighty race of people, to come face to face with some stupendous revelation of nature, to explore some splendid barbarism, or disclose a civilization as yet undreamed.\nAnd this theory he expounded in pamphlets, memorials, newspapers... To help himself he occasionally lectured about pure water and such things, but his heart was in the poles, and he concerned himself chiefly with his theory. Issuing circulars to the world, and lecturing, arguing, struggling with disease, poverty, and giving people, he travelled from one place to another.... And so to the end he went on striving for his theory spending as much of his property as he dared take away from his family, always sincere, earnest, using all manner of arguments from the Bible, prophecies, and such like, all manner of means of informing the public of the theory, but impressing one always with his honesty and purity of motive. No charlatan idea of notoriety inspired his efforts; he may not have been over logical or scientific; he may not have always spelled perfectly, or have been a very fluent lecturer; but he had always the utmost fixity of faith. Not a very brilliant hero this round-headed hero of ours, with his bright blue eye looking away off into space, his contracted brow, his nasal voice, and hesitating manner. Dusty, human, faulty enough, but still a self-denying, steadfast man -- man with a purpose. (excerpts from Harper's Monthly v. 65, Oct. 1882: pp. 740-744)\nSYMMES \u00a0THEORY.\nHIS SON EXPOUNDS IT -- THE EARTH HOLLOW AND INHABITED.\nA cultured audience gathered last evening in the lecture-room of the Trinity Methodist Church to hear Mr. Americus Symmes expound his father's theory. The lecturer, a gray-haired gentlemen, came on the little platform without any introduction, and said:\nLadies and Gentlemen: I presume a few of you know that there lived in Kentucky as far back as 1819 a philosopher, John Cleves Symmes, who devoted the last 80 [sic - 30?] years of his life to working out a true theory of the earth's formation. He contended that the earth was dying, he charged me to watch the polar explorations for proofs of his theory. I was a yoing man when my father died, aged 59, a poor man. He had owned 4,000 acres of land, but had borrowed money at high rates of interest and kept at his desk writing with children playing around him. The estate only paid 82 cents on the dollar. I thought that a theory which left a man so poor was not very valuable, and I had little time or money to bother with it. Twenty years ago a man called at my house to get me to subscribe to Dr. Kane's \"explorations.\" My father's charge flashed across my mind; I was now tolerably well off. I subscribed for the book, and began to inform myself about my father's theory before Dr. Kane's book arrived. My father lived the last three years of his life lecturing and traveling in the East. He wore himself out, took sick in New-York, and aftr paying his landlord all he could for board was put in jail for debt, where he remaiend two days, till his friends took him out. He then went over to New-Jersey, where he originally came from; there he remained 10 months before we at home were able to get money to bring him back. We were living on the 640 acres of land at that time, and I brought him home from Cincinnati on a matress in a wagon, he was so feeble. That was in February, and he died in May. His book, which was published in 1826, and which we gladly sold for $1, Robert Clarke & Co., of Cincinnati, now sell for $12, and they can't supply the demand for the original issue. I read that book carefully. It says the earth's shell is 100,000 [sic - 1,000?] miles thick, and that the edges 4,000 miles in converging. Perry, Kane, McClintock, Hall, Nordenskjold, and all, as I shall show you, confirm this. The summit of this verge is the coldest place in creation. The only way they tell when they pass it is the difference in the expension of the horizon; that is, the difference in how far you cna see. Before Capt. Hall passed it, he could only see a few miles; after he reached it he could see 70 miles. At the eighty-third degree my father says there is the open sea, free from ice. Sir Isaac Newton says it is a vast solitude of ice. I shall show which is correct. When Dr. Kane went on his second trip, after quitting the vessel the dog sleds went 40 miles a day; men gave out, and the doctor went no further, but William Morton, who had been there before, got permission to go on with the sleds. After four days he reached the aweful icy ridge running east and west, caused by the current from the north and the current from the south, just as the Symmes theory first claimed. Look in Kane's book, and you will see where they used the sled for a ladder to go over that icy ridge. After four days' more travel the snow began to soften, ice crusts to get thin, and in a short time the current was warmer. They had to help the dogs pull the sled, as their feet cut through the thin ice crust. At last they reachd the open Polar Sea, filled with fish, seals, shrimps, &c. There were fowls of every kind. Morton gathered 1,200 eggs in one day. I fairly shouted when I read this. A big sea and no ice, right where Newton said all was solid ice. The grass was ankle-high. Henry Clay says he brought home the biggst tree he could find in his trunk. Did you ever note how anxious all these explorers are to go back? Parry made three trips, Ross three, Kane two, and Kennedy two. I came to the Public Library and got from Mr. Toune the reports. Parry promised Parliament on his second trip to reach the North Pole. He went in a Lapland sled, which has a boat bottom and goes through water, till the north star was behind him. At 81 degrees the ice was four feet thick, at 82 degrees it was three feet thick, at 82 3/4 degrees the ice would not bear the boat; the sun melted the tar on the boat and flies swarmed around them. Symmes said it would take steam to reach the North Pole, and it will. Ross, who went very near, said: \"I stand on the bank of an open sea.\" Smith, who went to find Franklin, said he found the north end of Iceland covered with trees; he brought back one tree with the mark of an axe-cut back to London, also vegetables and flowers that he found in the drift. When Capt. Hall, of Cincinnati, was getting ready to go I went to see him. He hooted at my father's theory, and yet he found that warm country. He took Capt. Buddington and Capt. Tyson along to advise. They drank his whiskey, and he started to put them off at a polar station; they begged on their knees, and he relented. Hall surveyed his track and sent back reports of every part. They named the open sea Polaris Bay, after their ship, and the straits they called Robeson's, after the Secretary of the Navy. After passing eighty two degrees sixteen minutes Bunnington saw the North star behind them, and would go no further. All could see the cloud in front, which proclaimed the absence of ice. Hall was poisoned, and they returned. Mayers, the scientific man of that expedition, with his instruments calculated the distance to that warm locality and made it 83 degrees. There was Symmes theory proved by actual measurement. Hall left June 29, lost four months on the route, and yet reached that warm region Aug. 29, less than 60 days. The doctor who went away with Hall brought back flies, butterflies, squirrels, &c. In Sweden Nordenskjold heard of all this, and followed Hall's track. He sailed clear around the North-western passage just as Symmes said could be done. From Dundee, Scotland, Mr. Seabaum [sic - Seebohm?] went along Hall's route; he found the sea and sailing into it found a race of Roman-nozed, Hebrew-speaking people. They are the lost tribes of Israel. They have gold mines, iron mines, and mica mines there. Mr. Seabaum read his report at the Art Society of England. Capt. Wiggins was present and he confirmed it, saying the half had not been told. They have enormous wheat crops; there is where China gets her food. Humphrey Marshall, a Kentuckian, wants me to get up an expedition by subscription, as Kane did, and find this rich country. I have seen men from London who say this account of Seabaum's is no hoax.\" -- (text from the Louisville Courier-Journal, Nov. 27, 1883)\nProposing an Expedition to the North Pole.\nWashington, Dec. 24. -- Capt. George E. Tyson, of Polaris fame, has received a letter from A. Symmes, dated at Symmeszonia, Ky., December 7, on the subject of going north in command of an expedition next June or May, to be gotten up by subscription for the purpose of finding the country that Nordenskjold, Wiggins and Capt. Tuttle found after passing the magnetic pole at eighty degrees of north latitude (as laid down in the Symmes theory of the writer's father, and running south after getting into the open polar sea until they found a country and a people never before heard of, and reported to the Art Society of London by Captains Wiggins and Seabaum.\nCaptain Tuttle also reported having found the same country and people, and describes the people as being very large, with black hair and whiskers, roman noses, and speaking Hebrew. The writer says: \"I find no difficulty in finding people willing to subscribe money enough to buy a steamer like the Polaris and go ins search of the the people and country that Wiggins, Seabaum and Tuttle found, where they said they rode on horseback through the new country and saw hemp, flax, wheat, hides, wool, ivory, iron ore, and were told of ten or twelve gold mines that yield from five to seven tons each yearly. Capt. Hall said that if there were a people up there they must be giants, as the atmosphere was so life giving; and now they are found and reported to be seven or eight feet high and well proportioned. -- (text from the Chester, PA Chester Times, Dec. 24, 1883 -- see also the Atlanta Constitution of Dec. 26, 1883.)\nIT \u00a0IS \u00a0A \u00a0HOLLOW \u00a0WORLD.\nAccording to the Theory Advanced by Captain John Cleves Symmes.\n... Every now and then interest is revived in the Symmes theory that the earth is hollow and habitable and open at the poles, by such a suggestion that an Arctic expedition might well be undertaken with the special end in view to test that proposition. Such an expedition was seriously proposed as recent[ly] as two or three years ago, and is still under advisement. But save for these occasional tentative reminders the present generation has quite outgrown all knowledge of a geographical theory that by its originality and boldness and by a certain plausibility of argument deduced to its support startled and interested the scientific world three-quarters of a century ago....\nIf we were to judge of the internal surface of the sphere by its animal production -- admitting that those animals heretofore enumerated are propagated there -- we should conclude that the internal region of the earth is as much more favorable to the support of animal life as the reindeer is larger than our deer, and the white bear larger than our bear, and, consequently, we must conclude that there are more salubrious climates and better countries within than any we have yet discovered without.\nImmense shoals of herrings, in good condition, according to Buffon, come down from the polar seas, and are never known to return.\nWere the earth a compact and solid spheroid, according the old theory, and were the seas frozen nearly to the bottom at the poles, as we would be led to conclude, where could all those fish that come down to us every spring breed? Or, if they even all returned in the autumn, and all the north were a sea that did not freeze even to the poles, it would require a great stretch of credulity to imagine where they could obtain food for the winter; or even if their source of food were inexhaustible, could the region of the pole afford space sufficient for their health, so as to migrate south in the spring?\nA Question of Capacity.\nIf the earth be not hollow (or at least greatly concave about the poles) where could all those fish find room in winter? But on Symmes' plan, admitting the globe to be a hollow sphere, and the inner, or concave part, as habitable as without (at least as habitable for fish), the whole matter is at once explained.\nWhales and various fish delight in cold regions. According to Symmes' theory there is a zone at a short distance beyond the real verge of the sphere (which constitutes the coldest part, or as he has thought proper to term it, \"the icy circles\") commencing at the highest point, in about latitude 68 degrees, in the Northern Sea, near Norway, thence gradually decling to about latitude 50 degrees in the Pacific Ocean, which is the lowest point, and thence regularly round again to the highest point. A certain distance beyond this and short of the apparent verge this zone or icy circle exists, which is believed to be the coldest region of earth. After passing this we would advance into the interior of the globe and into a milder clime. In the interior region, it is contended, those immense shoals of fish are propagated and grow which annually come out and afford such an abudant supply; nor does it appear that the interior parts of the sphere are altogether forsaken by the fish in summer, for shoals of fat mackerel and herring come down from the north in autumn as well as in the spring.\nThe seal, another animal found in cold regions, is also said to migrate north twice each year, going once beyond the icy circle to produce their young and again to complete their growth, always returning remarkably fat -- an evidence that they find something more than snow and ice to feed on in the country to which they migrate.\nBasis of Symmes' Theory.\nAccording to Symmes' theory each sphere has an intermediate cavity or mid-plane space of considerable extent situated between the convex and concave surfaces of the sphere, filled with a very light and elastic fluid, rarified in proportion to the gravity or condensing power of the exposed surfaces of the respective spheres, and also various other less cavities or spaces between the larger and principal one and the outer and inner surfaces of the spheres, each filled with a similar fluid or gas, most probably partaking much of the nature of hydrogen. This fluid to lighter than that in which the sphere floats, and has a tendency to poise it in universal space.\nThe spheres. in many parts of the unfathomable ocean are believed to be water quite through from the concave or convex surfaces to the great mid-plane space, and probably the earthly or solid matter of the sphere may in many places extend quite through from one surface to the other, tending, like ribs or braces, to support the sphere in its proper form. Such a formation of spheres to be supported by various facts and phenomena.\nRecent explorers have found more and more evidence of an open polar sea and of a surprising increase in vegetation and animal life in the higher arctic regions, and the Symmes theorists hold that these facts go to prove the truth of the Symmes theory and shake our faith in Newton's idea of the north being a vast solitude of eternal ice. All these discoveries were made while running south after passing the 80 degrees latitude.\nNew Country at the Pole.\nBaron Nordenskold, of Sweden, who made two visits to the extreme North tells us \"that it is impossible to find continents of ice south of 80 degrees of north latitude.\" That is, after passing the 80 degrees, or magnetic pole, his compass indicated south, the direction we familiarly term north. An English explorer, Captain Wiggins, after passing the 80 degrees, found the country seen by Nordenskold. He made the acquaintance of the inhabitants whom he discovered spoke Hebrew. An account of his trip was published in the London Times, February 5, 1881. A Mr. Seebohm, who accompanied the expedition, took a ride on horseback with several others through this new country, and after his return to London he read a description of what he had seen before the Society of Arts. The country was rich in iron ore. A piece picked up at haphazard was so highly magnetic as to lift a large needle. There were copper mines and ten or twelve gold mines that yielded from five to seven tons a year.\nAnother explorer who visited this new country of Symmzonia is Captain Tuttle , an old United States whaling master. He gives a similar account of the people and says they speak Hebrew. He found them well contented and intelligent. He discovered during his 28 years' experience in the North that everyfourth winter was mild, and during one of these seasons he discovered this new country, which he says can only be reached with a steam vessel, as the current in Robeson's channel runs south at the rate of four to six miles per hour.\nThat is in substance the proposition and the arguments of those who have followed Captain Symmes in the belief that the earth is hollow and inhabited, and that in the interior are beautiful and fertile lands and an enjoyable climate. \u00a0 (excerpts from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of Feb. 9, 1896 -- see also on-line transcript from the Feb. 6, 1896 issue of the Pittsburg Dispatch)\nSymmes and His Theory.\nIf Nansen has really discovered land at the north pole it will smash the wild theory advanced by the late John Cleves Symmes.\nAccording to Symmes the earth is hollow and formed of concentric spheres. The openings or entrances to the \"inner world\" are at the poles, and are like an immense crater, 2000 miles in diameter, with a sloping rim, so that a vessel might sail into the bowels of the earth before those on it were aware of it.\nSymmes called attention to the northward migration of the artic reindeer, musx ox and polar bear at the approach of winter and claimed that their movements proved that the heat of the earth's interior furnished a milder climate.\nHe also said that his theory was supported by the climatic differences on the earth's surface, the vast open polar sea, the changes in the apparent extent of the horizon in high latitudes, the variation and dip of the magnetic needle and other natural phenomena. The vessel sailing north which finds its needle suddenly reversed has crossed the verge, according to Symmes, and is really sailing south without knowing it. Captain Wiggins testified to it in 1880, and gave an account of his discovery of a land with mild climate whose inhabitants spoke Hebrew.\nCaptain Symmes was generally regarded as a crank, so far as his theory was concerned, but his followers erected a fine monumnet to his memory, and of late years many persons, inclusing some sea captains, have adopted his belief.\nIt will be a relief to the public to be assured that our globe is a solid affair, instead of being shapd like an apple with the core scooped out. We want land at the pole and plenty of it -- enough to give the Monroe doctrine a foothold. -- The Atlanta Constitution Feb. 18, 1896\nSYMMES' THEORY.\nby John Weld Peck\nI want, if I can, to carry you back to the day when the West was new, when the outposts of the nation were on the Mississippi; when the boundless forests were scarred but here and there with clearings; when Cincinnati, the thriving town between Third street and the river was the undoubted and unrivaled Queen City of the West.... it was in that day of strength and crudity that lived the man who promulgated the daring, ingenious theory of cosmography, which in the light of better learning we know as the absurd, foolish theory of \"Symmes' Hole.\"\nThe Theory of Concentric Spheres! We all remember the shaft in the park at Hamilton bearing the globe open through the poles, commemorating Captain John Cleves Symmes and his theory-keeping in memory a man who believed that the world is hollow and habitable within, and that there are great holes at the poles through which one may get down on to the inner side!\nCaptain John Cleves Symmes, he of the theory of Eccentric [sic] Spheres was a nephew of that other of the same name who was the original proprietor of all the land hereabouts....\nIn the war of 1812 Symmes commanded a company with bravery, skill and gallantry, especially at the battle of Lundy's Lane for which he was honorably mentioned. At the close of the war he continued in the army until about 1816 when he resigned to take up life at the frontier village, at the mouth of the Missouri known as St. Louis... And it was while at the trading post in the wilderness that he first evolved, or at least, first announced the hypothesis of which I write. How long he had entertained these views, what length of time he had devoted to the study of the subject, what books inspired it or how or why the mind of the frontier soldier and trader was turned to the subject, I am at a loss to discover. He announced his idea in no diffident nor uncertain terms... [transcript of Symmes' \"Circular\" follows]\n... His statement of the extent of the polar opening, his proposed point and season of departure, his promise to find good lands and life one degree north of 82 degrees, all agree with the detail of his system as published later and show that he did not make his announcement first and then manufacture his argument to support it. He followed his circular with several newspaper articles elaborating his theory. Soon afterward and during the same year he moved to Newport, Ky., and continued to devote himself to the preaching of his doctrine. In 1824 he moved to Hamilton. He found not a few believers as time went on among whom the foremost, he who became Symmes patron and his collaborator, was James McBride, of Hamilton.\nJames McBride was no ordinary man. He was highly respected and held many positions of trust in his community.... James McBride became a convert to the doctrine of Symmes and used his able pen in arranging and elaborating Symmes somewhat disorderly argument. The result was a little treatise on the subject from the press of Morgan, Lodge and Fisher, Cincinnati, 1826: Symmes Theory of Concentric Spheres, demonstrating that the earth is hollow, habitable within and widely open about the poles -- by A Citizen of the United States....\nThe author undertakes to set forth the theory without asserting its truth, disclaiming scientific ability to pass upon it, inviting criticism, but requesting any who assert its fallacy to furnish some other rational and satisfactory explanation of the facts advanced....\nThe fundamental thought or idea seems to have been that unformed matter in rotation tends to form itself into concentric spheres.... assuming matter to have been at one time whirling masses of unformed substance it must have assumed the form of hollow spheres open at the poles. That not only would there be hollow spheres open about the poles but the same principle would tend to create hollow spheres within hollow spheres.\nThis theory Symmes applies not only to our earth but to the entire universe. Space is filled with microscopically invisible hollow spheres of aether -- which by their elasticity hold the planets of the universe in place....\nSymmes points to the fact that nature is an economist of matter. That she uses hollow materials where they serve her purpose as well as solid. Is not the stalk of the grain, the quill of the pinion, the bone of the animal, even each hair of the head, hollow?\nTo those who see something of the sacrilegious in thus undermining God's footstool, the author says: \"I can not discover anything derogatory from His infinite power, wisdom, or divine economy, in the formation of a hollow world and concentric spheres any more than that of solid ones. I should rather be of the opinion that a construction of all the orbs in creation on a plan corresponding with Symmes' theory, would display the highest possible degree of perfection, wisdom and goodness, the most perfect system of creative economy -- and, (as Dr. Mitchell expresses it), a great saving of stuff.\"\nThe Dr. Mitchell referred to is probably the same whom Symmes selected as a patron, along with Davy and Von Humboldt; the New York scientist and miscellaneous writer of the first quarter of the last century, and editor of the New York Repository...\nIt is interesting to know that Symmes is not the only one who has believed this planet a series of concentric spheres. Edmund Halley, the celebrated English astronomer of the early eighteenth century, averred the probability of an inner sphere. Leonhardt Euler, the great mathematician of Basle, who died in 1783, accepted Halley's theory and went further in asserting that the inner sphere might be luminous and thus light and warm the inner surface of the outer crust, and he further inferred that the interior might be inhabited. Whether the works of these writers came to Symmes' knowledge before he announced his theory from the frontier town is not known. That they were known to James McBride appears in his book... But neither Halley nor Euler had conceived the polar openings. The credit for that conception is due Symmes alone.\nNow applying his theory to our own planet Symmes argued it to be a series of five spheres of which our crust is the outermost. The opening at the north pole is four thousand milesacross, that at the south pole is six thousand. The outer crust of the earth is about a thousand miles thick giving a wide rim or verge some 1500 miles around. The rim or verge being so wide, and its curvature being gradual, would not be apparent to the voyager, who might pass from the outer side of the earth over the rim and down upon the inner side a great distance before becoming aware of the fact at all.\nThe rim is also marked by a zone of ice and snow, by that impossible Arctic belt beyond which men imagine all to be a frozen waste. Here is the zone where no vegetation but moss exists. Here is also to be noted a belt of volcanoes encircling the globe, including those of Alaska and Iceland.\nWhen a high northern latitude is reached the Aurora Borealis appears to the southward as many explorers have testified. The voyager is then upon or within the verge. The compass then forsakes the star and varies so that at times the needle turns nearly round, for the verge is the region of magnetic attraction. Each of the various spheres is inhabited both upon its inner and its outer side; warmed, lighted and watered....\nSymmes then brings forward some curious facts in regard to the migration of animals - for which he refers to and cites the published narratives of travelers and Arctic explorers. These all go to prove that there is a land beyond the frozen Arctic belt, whither some beasts, fowls and fish go at the approach of winter and whence they return in the spring sleek and fat....\nOne of the most ingenious arguments of the work is that founded upon the Magellanic clouds. They are two in number -- or perhaps one is so divided that three may fairly be counted. They are apparent only at night and from the South Atlantic, or the region of the Straits of Magellan, whence their name. These are, of course, now known to be merely two cloud like patches of nebulous stars in the pole of the Milky Way.... These are, he says, the reflections in the sky of New Zealand, New Holland and Van Dieman's land seen across the rim...\nHow can the variation of the needle be explained by Symmes' theory? -- By it assuming the polar verge to be the region of attraction it is obvious that when the verge is reached the needle will swing. And so Parry, the explorer, found it to point at one place within 14 degrees of south.\nThe question most asked of Symmes by his hearers was, no doubt, how the interior of the earth was to be provided with light and heat. His answer to that is most ingenious. The opening at the north pole is four thousand one hundred and fifty miles in width at an angle of 12 degrees to the perpendicular to the earth's axis. Therefore the sun's rays would fall within as far as 18 degrees on the inner surface of the high side. But when the sun is at the northern tropic its rays would slant 23 degrees more, or a total of 41 1/2 degrees within. So that there would only be 26 degrees between that and the equator, which would not receive direct light... But direct light is unnecessary for the interior would be illuminated by a soft, brilliant light by reflection from the concave side and the inner sphere. The interior light would... be too bright for comfort and that blue glasses would be an excellent article of commerce to take to the inner side upon the first voyage...\nSymmes was true to the consecration of his life to the theory announced in his first paper. He wrote, traveled, lectured, petitioned the legislature and congress for aid to demonstrate his ideas, and suffered poverty in its behalf. During his residence in Newport he devoted himself entirely to its study, and in 1820 made a lecture tour. He spoke in Cincinnati, Lexington, Frankfort, Hamilton, Zanesville and probably elsewhere...\nIn January, 1823, there was presented to congress by Representative J. T. Johnson, of Kentucky, a petition wherein the subscribing citizens respectfully showed that the national honor and public interest might be promoted by the equipping of an exploring expedition for the purpose of penetrating the Polar region, beyond the limits already known, with a view not only of making new discoveries in geography, natural history and geology, but of opening new sources of trade and commerce.... Mr. Johnson moved to refer the memorial to the committee on foreign relations, while Mr. Farelly, of Pennsylvania, moved to lay on the table... and there the matter ended.\nOther petitions from various parts of the country to the same end were presented at the same session. In February one was offered by sundry inhabitants of Charleston, South Carolina, showing that there were Symmesites there, although I do not find that Symmes ever lectured in the South. Another memorial came from Greenville, Ohio, and still another was presented by a Mr. Brown from Huntington, Pa., and later Mr. Ross, of Ohio, offered three more. All however were consigned to lie upon that repository of the unburied dead, the table. Benjamin Ruggles, senator from\u00ca Ohio, also presented a petition to the upper branch of Congress at the same session with the same disheartening result....\n[in 1825] Symmes, according to McBride, made application to the Russian government to accompany a polar expedition about to start under Count Romanzoff. He received the permission, but for want of money was compelled to stay at home at last. During the college year 1826-27 he delivered a series of lectures at Union College to the faculty and students. Deep interest was taken in the subject by some, at least, of the students. One of these students was a gentleman named Clark, who, in 1873, in an article published in the Atlantic Monthly of April of that year, was able to reconstruct and set forth Symmes' theory in considerable detail...\nDuring the year after that spent at Union College Symmes, in company with one J. N. Reynolds, a graduate of Ohio University, started on a lecture tour. Symmes went on to Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Maine and into Canada, but Reynolds left him early in the journey. Concerning this Reynolds, Howe... states that Jeremiah N. Reynolds traveled and lectured with Symmes... and that Reynolds... made money, with which, and the backing of Messrs. Rush and Southard of John Quincy Adams' Cabinet, fitted out a national ship, to sail to the south pole to test the theory. But the government support was withdrawn by Andrew Jackson when he came into office. That then a Dr. Watson of New York took the matter up and furnished money. A vessel, the \"Annawan,\" N. B. Palmer captain, sailed from New York October, 1829, for the southern polar opening -- that they reached land at high south latitude (82 degrees)... How much of truth and how much of pure fiction there is in this romance of Reynold's voyage is difficult to determine.\nThat a J. N. Reynolds and a Watson went on an exploring expedition in a vessel called the Annawan in 1829 is undoubtedly true. But whether that was the same Jeremiah N. Reynolds who lectured with Symmes is most doubtful... Captain N. B. Palmer certainly made some unrecorded voyages to the south polar zone and... some scientists went on the expedition among whom were Messrs. John N. Reynolds and Watson.... John and not Jeremiah. He wrote a book describing the journey round the world published in New York in 1835- and none of Howe's startling facts appear in it.... Whatever may have been the purpose of this exploration certainly no other was ever made to find Symmes Cavity. After his lecture tour in the east and Canada, Symmes health broke down and he went to his old home in New Jersey to die in May, 1829... \u00a0 (excerpts from Ohio History Vol. XVIII, No. 1. - Jan. 1909, pp. 28-42)\nSTORY OF JOHN SYMMES\nHis Plan to Lead an Expedition to the Interior of the Earth\nTo the Editor of the New York Times:\nIn these days of polar exploration a few words about Symmes's hypothesis, which some ninty-one years ago, attracted attention among the uninstructed, may not be amiss. John Flake, in his essay on \"Cranks and their Crotchets,\" discusses it fully.\n\"In 1818 one Capt. John Cleves Symmes, a retired officer whose knowledge of things in general, and especially of astronomy, physics, or geology, was not extensive, astonished the world by the following proclamation: 'To all the world I declare the earth is hollow and habitable within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles twelve or sixteen degrees. I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking.

That is the stark assessment of Nasa scientist and leading climate expert Jim Hansen who last week warned only urgent action by the new president could halt the devastating climate change that now threatens Earth. Crucially, that action will have to be taken within Obama's first administration , he added.\nSoaring carbon emissions are already causing ice-cap melting and threaten to trigger global flooding, widespread species loss and major disruptions of weather patterns in the near future. \"We cannot afford to put off change any longer,\" said Hansen. \"We have to get on a new path within this new administration. We have only four years left for Obama to set an example to the rest of the world. America must take the lead.\"\nHansen said current carbon levels in the atmosphere were already too high to prevent runaway greenhouse warming . Yet the levels are still rising despite all the efforts of politicians and scientists.\nHansen - head of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies and winner of the WWF's top conservation award - first warned Earth was in danger from climate change in 1988 and has been the victim of several unsuccessful attempts by the White House administration of George Bush to silence his views .\nHansen's institute monitors temperature fluctuations at thousands of sites round the world , data that has led him to conclude that most estimates of sea level rises triggered by rising atmospheric temperatures are too low and too conservative. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a rise of between 20cm and 60cm can be expected by the end of the century.\nHowever, Hansen said feedbacks in the climate system are already accelerating ice melt and are threatening to lead to the collapse of ice sheets. Sea-level rises will therefore be far greater - a claim backed last week by a group of British, Danish and Finnish scientists who said studies of past variations in climate indicate that a far more likely figure for sea-level rise will be about 1.4 metres, enough to cause devastating flooding of many of the world's major cities and of low-lying areas of Holland, Bangladesh and other nations.\nAs a result of his fears about sea-level rise, Hansen said he had pressed both Britain's Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences to carry out an urgent investigation of the state of the planet's ice-caps. However, nothing had come of his proposals. The first task of Obama's new climate office should therefore be to order such a probe \"as a matter of urgency\", Hansen added.\n"}, {"score": 573.54877, "uuid": "a7639ef0-0ae1-5059-aa2f-ebbd1f1ecb6e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1012wb-17-27244", "target_hostname": "www.explorationscience.org", "target_uri": "http://www.explorationscience.org/REPRINTS/zonalbelthypothe00wheerich_djvu.txt", "page_rank": 1.1813702e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "BERKELEY LIBRARY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA <em>EARTH</em> SCIENCES LIBRARY <em>THE</em> LIBRARY", "snippet": "<em>On</em> <em>the</em> other hand, <em>where</em> flood, <em>and</em> fire (volcanic), <em>and</em> <em>earth</em>- quake, turned <em>the</em> <em>earth</em> into a cemetery, <em>where</em> was there a man left to preserve <em>the</em> record?

CHARLES A. KOFOID AND MRS. PRUDENCE W. KOFOID THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS A NEW EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES BY JOSEPH T. WHEELER PHILADELPHIA 6r LONDON J. B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY 1908 COPTKIQHT, 1908 BT JOSEPH T. WHEELER Published November 8 1908 Printed by J. B. Lippincott Company The Washington Square Press, Philadelphia, U. S. A Ws EARTH SCIENCES LIBRARY PREFACE IT is purposed in this work to show that a vast amount of evidence exists which proves that throughout the geolog- ical ages up to recent time our earth was girt with belts of planetesimal or gaseous matter. The nature of the evidence demonstrates that these belts were potent factors in producing' the climatic changes which marked the various geologic periods. They were the cause of the Ice ages. Primitive man saw the last remnants of these strange sights in the sky, and the echo of his thought in the form of mythology has sounded down through the lapse of the centuries. Facts cannot be ignored. Agassiz demonstrated that the till and boulder deposits scattered over the mantle rock of northern Europe and North America were the product of glacier action, but though the fact of the existence of great continental ice-sheets was established, the cause has remained up to the present date a scientific mystery. Now, in presenting the belted-canopy or zonal-ring hypothesis the cause or causes which brought them into exist- ence is of secondary importance. The all-important matter is to establish their actuality. Nevertheless, in order to present the argument in a consecutive form, the author under- takes in the opening chapters to show how the belts could have been brought into existence. This portion of the work, however, may be considered as merely tentative, and if he has failed in this particular, it in nowise compromises the main issue. This is not the first time that an hypothesis somewhat similar to the one about to be launched has been subjected to 4 PREFACE the critical eye of the investigator. In fact, there have been several. Briefly, the history of the growth of the idea is as follows: To Emanuel Kant, who lived some hundred and fifty years ago, belongs the distinction of being the first modern scientist to entertain the thought that this earth was at one time girt about with rings or belts similar to those which now surround our sister planet, Saturn. Kant, however, after due deliberation, cast the idea from him as not worthy of serious consideration. 1 There was nothing in particular new about this concep- tion. The Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Hebrews held that this earth was a flat disk canopied by a vaulted arc or water- sky, the firmament of the Scriptures. Not that the substance of the vaulted arc was actually water, but that this was the appearance of things to the ancients. Because the theory of a vaulted firmament retarded the progress of astronomy, it was dropped entirely. But the question is, How could such a theory have originated and become general throughout the earth without a prototype ? Certainly it must have had some legitimate ancestor, and the myths and hero-tales that have come down to us are the vibrations from this far distant age. The present hypothesis deals with the prehistoric. Where it comes into more intimate relationship with the past, it is because of the echo which vibrates in and through the lan- guage, relics, literature, etc., of the ancients. The redis- covery of the lost phenomena has been very gradual. Perhaps in this connection the theories of Ignatius Donnelly are deserving of mention. In his work entitled, \"Kagnarok: The Age of Eire and Gravel,\" this author builds a superstructure of sand on a rock foundation. To say that the origin of drift and gravel is unknown, and further to suggest that they are the debris from the wreck Kant's Cosmology, pp. 129-131. PREFACE 5 of a comet, is too radical. Yet in spite of this absurdity there is a fascination that arises from the residuum of truth. The fossil thought of the by-gone days cannot be ignored, and Donnelly has collected and jumbled together a large number of these stories from the myths of many people, which plainly indicate that they were witnesses of some strange sights in the sky. There must have been some com- mon source for these tales. Again, a similar work was published in 1885, entitled \" Paradise Found : The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole.\" Its author was William F. Warren, S.T.D., LL.D., President of Boston University. Lenormant's tes- timony 2 is in the same direction, and it goes to show that the Chaldean, Persian, and Indian traditions all point to the northern mountains as the original home of the Caucasian race, therefore conditions in that region must have been very different from those now existing. Comparative religion indicates the same conclusions. The above works bring together large masses of fact and fable which in some cases, it must be admitted, are grotesque and visionary. They are mentioned in this place, however, as they bear on the history of the development of the present hypothesis. Speculations such as are introduced by these authors must have some foundation. The north seems to have been much warmer in the past. Indeed, zonal atmospheric temperature belts have existed up to recent times. Briefly, the facts of arctic paleontology have induced the belief that there was a primitive Eocene continent in the highest lati- tudes. The purely scientific aspect of the question is pre- sented in Gr. Hilton Scribner's monograph, \" Where Did Life Begin ? \" Professor Heer of Zurich and Baron Nordensk- jold both arrived at the same conclusion. J. Starkie Gardner has reviewed the evidence and has stated that this continuous Ancient History of the East and Beginnings of History.\" 6 PHEFACE land which once united Europe with North America was probably submerged by the ocean along with northern Asia in late glacial or post-glacial time. 3 Since the historic and mythological evidence shows that many minds have had an insight into some portion of the features connected with the zonal atmospheric climatic belts, it is only surprising that Emanuel Kant's suggestion was not followed up long ago. It is true that geologists of the old school, who believed that the earth cooled from a molten state, postulated some form of cloud-blanket. Dana men- tions the Astral aeon, as it was called, when a heavy, vaporous envelope containing the future waters of the globe or its dis- sociated elements, and other heavy vapors and gases, was supposed to compass the earth. 4 But that was in its early history. Isaac !N\". Vail seems to have been the first to advance the idea that conditions somewhat similar to these could have continued until recent time. His argument runs as follows: \" Our earth once had a Saturn-like system of rings, which in their progressive fall became canopies, such as the planets Saturn and Jupiter have now ; that these canopies, acting as a greenhouse roof, made all the warm ages of geologic time, and, gravitating to the polar regions, fell largely as snows, making all the glacial epochs and all the ages the earth ever had.\" 5 In the light of modern science the suggestion of the old school geologists, and the further statement of Professor Vail, that these rings were composed of aqueous and metallic matter sent up from the molten earth, do not bear scrutiny. 8 Professor G. Frederick Wright, \"Geology and the Deluge,\" McClure's Magazine, June, 1901. * Manual of Geology, 4th ed., p. 440. 5 Isaac 1ST. Vail, \"The Waters Above the Firmament,\" \"The Deluge and its Cause,\" \"Eden's Flaming Sword,\" etc., etc., Pasadena, Cal. Captain R. Kelso Carter, C.E., a friend of Professor Vail, has pub- lished a work on the same subject, entitled \"Alpha and Omega.\" PREFACE 7 It has been proved that Saturn's rings would disrupt if they were composed of aqueous solutions, and, again, the idea that the earth has formed from a fire-mist or heated nebula has given way to Chamberlin's Planetesimal Hypothesis. Vail deserves great credit, however, for the vast amount of mythology which he has interpreted. All this goes to show that some form of belted canopy must have existed. Perhaps the next best hypothesis comes from Marsden Manson. 6 His is a scientific presentation of an atmospheric cloud canopy. If to this he had added belts or zones situated on the outer confines of the earth's gaseous envelope, the hypothesis about to be introduced might have used the same for a foundation, and it would have been neces- sary only to postulate that the said belts were visible, and that they continued as a feature in the heavens until recent time, geologically speaking. It is purposed to expand these ideas, and further to connect these belts with the Planetesimal Hypothesis. A brief knowledge of the ground covered by this last hypothesis is essential to a clear understanding of the idea that zonal belts once girt our planet, and the following com- parison of the nebular and plantesimal hypotheses will supply that need. \" The old hypothesis assumes the existence of a mass of incandescent vapor, with or without a nucleus, which by con- densation and rotation was differentiated into successive rings ; the latter being eventually gathered up into the planets while still retaining intense heat. From this postulate there necessarily follows the conception of a cooling earth; and hypogeic geology has been founded on the idea of crustal solidification on a molten globe. The new hypothesis holds that the disseminated planet-forming matter had lost its heat e See articles in the American Geologist; also pamphlet, \" The Evolution of Climates.'* 8 PREFACE while yet existing in the loose form, as rings or zones or wisps of the parent nebula, and that the globular planets were formed by the slow accretion or infalling of cold, discrete bodies or particles (' planetesimals ').\" 7 The zonal belt hypothesis simply takes hold where the above lets go. Since Saturn still has rings of infalling par- ticles there is nothing startling or improbable in the assump- tion that our earth had the same, up to the close of the last Ice age.

This fact has to be considered by all who would investigate the genesis of things mundane. The geologists and biologists never lose sight of it, but it is difficult to reconcile their requirements with the maintenance of the sun's energy. The best reply seems to be that radiant energy is probably the reflex action of the perpetual motion of the ether. This means that there is no cause left for controversy between the mathematicians on the one side and the aforementioned geologists and biolo- gists on the other. Whether this explanation be accepted or not, the fact of the existence of this long time period of comparative slight temperature fluctuation remains. If it be true that the supply of radiant energy is con- stant, then a factor must be discovered that from time to time has modified the amount of energy received, a factor capable of punctuating the geological eras. On the other hand, if, as the advocates of the shrinkage hypothesis gen- erally contend, the sun in past ages has been giving out a greater flow of energy, then this same factor is needed in order to mitigate the results. Again, if the gravitational heat of the earth, due to the consolidation of the original planetesimal structure has entered into the question of the maintenance of this narrowness in the range of temperature, then once more this factor will be very useful, as it is neces- sary to conserve this dissipation. The factor that best answers the foregoing requirements is a protecting canopy, and such a one is here postulated a canopy floating high above the present cloud-belt, and 11 12 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS probably outside the existing atmosphere. The evidence connected with this hypothesis will be presented in the suc- ceeding chapters. It is now purposed to consider the nature of the structure and the possible source of its origin. The evidence will show that this atmospheric protector existed until recent time, and that primitive man lived under its beneficent roof. Furthermore, it was visible to him, for he has recorded the fact on his monuments, and many of the roots from which his archaic languages are derived have their origin in sky scenes. He worshipped the phenomena which he saw, making gods and devils of the various features, handing down to us the substance of his impressions in that form of mythology which portrays the nature myth. Since the sky-features were visible, it proves that a canopy of uniform texture spreading evenly over the whole earth could not have fulfilled the requirements. Such a blanket has been postulated by many scientists. Tyndall thus depicts the influence of such an atmospheric appendage on planetary temperature. He says: \"Let us now consider for a moment the effect upon the earth's tem- perature of a shell of olefiant gas, surrounding our planet at a little distance above its surface. The gas would be trans- parent to the solar rays, allowing them, without sensible hindrance, to reach the earth. Here, however, the luminous heat of the sun would be converted into non-luminous terres- trial heat; at least 26 per cent, of this heat would be inter- cepted by a layer of gas one inch thick, and in great part returned to the earth. Under such a canopy, trifling as it may appear, and perfectly transparent to the eye, the earth's surface would be maintained at a stifling temperature. \" A few years ago a work possessing great charms of style and ingenuity of reasoning was written to prove that the more distant planets of our system are uninhabitable. Apply- ing the law of inverse squares to their distances from the sun, the diminution of temperature was found to be so great THE HYPOTHESIS 13 as to preclude the possibility of human life in the more remote members of the solar system. But in those calcula- tions the influence of an atmospheric envelope was over- looked, and this omission vitiated the entire argument. An atmosphere may act the part of a barb to the solar rays, per- mitting them to reach the earth, but preventing their escape. A layer of air two inches in thickness, saturated with the vapor of sulphuric ether, would offer very little resistance to the passage of the solar rays, but I find that it would cut off fully 35 per cent, of the planetary radiation. It would require no inordinate thickening of the layer of vapor to double this absorption ; and it is perfectly evident that, with a protecting envelope of this kind, permitting the heat to enter but preventing its escape, a comfortable temperature might be obtained on the surface of the most distant planet.\" l As stated above, the envelope of uniform texture does not fulfil the requirements which the evidence about to be pro- duced demands. If visible at all, the monotony of its same- ness would have failed to arouse the religious superstitions of early man, hence they would have left no records of it. Again, the continuance of arctic and tropic life shows that climate was differentiated in such a manner as to preclude uniformity. In explanation of the vagaries of climate which have existed in the past, two alternatives now present themselves. The one is Chamberlin's hypothesis, that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere itself is responsible for the physical phenomena. The other is that a fractured shell or envelope composed of rings or belts floated above or on the outer bounds of the atmosphere. This latter hypothesis not only accounts for the physical phenomena, but it also explains the origin of the myths we have so often referred to. The one hypothesis may be as complicated as the other. Chamberlin's requires a fine adjustment between the ocean Heat a Mode of Motion,\" 6th ed., pp. 417-418. 14 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS and the atmosphere. Thus the originator of the hypothesis quotes Schloesing's views as follows : \" The carbon dioxide of the atmosphere is in equilibrium, not only with the free carbon dioxide absorbed in the sea water, but, through dis- sociation, with the second equivalent of carbon dioxide in the oceanic bicarbonates. The sum-total of such free and loosely combined carbon dioxide available at present as a possible supply for the atmosphere may be some twenty-five times the present atmospheric content. Schloesing held that any depletion of the atmospheric content would be followed by emanation from the ocean, and any excess acquired by the atmosphere would be followed by oceanic absorption, and hence great changes in the atmospheric content would only be brought about by reducing or increasing the large sum- total of atmospheric and oceanic supply.\" 2 RTow, the diffusion of gases in water is a slow process, and it would seem that the supply of carbon dioxide which the ocean would yield to the atmosphere might be far too slow to offset the consumption of the same under certain chemic geologic conditions. This depletion, according to Chamberlin's hypothesis, would bring about an ice age, the location of the main centres of glaciation being determined by the path of cyclonic storms. So far all seems well, but, unfortunately for the hypothesis, it is difficult to account for the return to normal conditions. The restocking of the atmospheric supply from the ocean would be very slow, and a question arises as to whether the evidence does not indicate a more rapid recession, comparatively speaking. Again, if the cold of the ice ages was due to depletion, then the warmth of the Carboniferous age was due to excess. This amount could not have exceeded a percentage that would allow of the continuance of animal life. \" According to Berzelius, common air containing 1 / 20 of its volume of * Journal of Geology, vol. xiv, No. 5, p. 367. THE HYPOTHESIS 15 carbon dioxide can be breathed without producing any serious effects ; but from Angus Smith's later experiments it appears that when air contains only 0.20 per cent, by volume of this gas, its effect in lowering the action of the pulse is rendered evident after the respiration has continued for about an hour. It seems, therefore, premature to say that the smallest increase of the atmospheric carbonic acid may not be pro- ductive of hurtful results.\" 3 But let us examine one of the statements of the author himself. He says : \" If we consider what a possible atmos- phere and ocean richer in carbon dioxide might do, it seems idle to look to the atmosphere as even a possible competent reservoir, consistently with the life that existed; for the carbon dioxide of the present atmosphere, if converted into limestone, would form a layer about one-thirtieth of an inch thick only, over the globe. To form a layer one foot thick it would have to be increased 360 fold, which would surely imperil active, air-breathing life, unless it were different from similar present life.\" 4 Dropping this line of argument and approaching it from another standpoint, it seems rash to postulate a colder climate as a requisite to an ice age. It takes heat to evaporate water in order to furnish the supply of snow. Belts of carbon dioxide hanging above the atmosphere would have caused remarkable climatic contrasts, and as they would not neces- sarily have changed the atmospheric content, animal life would not have suffered. The saturated warm air drifting from beneath such a canopy would have been quickly con- gealed into snow and ice by the cold air in the open zones. Intense cold near the poles during the Ice age is at variance with the recorded facts. Again reverting to Chamberlin's hypothesis, we find that it is based on the views of Arrhenius regarding the effects Roscoe and Schorlemmer, \"Treatise on Chemistry,\" vol. i, p. 625; Angus Smith, \"Air and Rain,\" p. 209. *Chamberlin and Salisbury, Geo., vol. ii, p. 661. 16 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS on the climate of small changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Now, his views have been contested by Angstrom and Very, and are not accepted by Hann. Thus, since the physicists disagree, it may be that the foundation is itself insecure. The alternate hypothesis which postulates that belts or rings environed the earth may be presented in two forms, or in a combination of the two. The first assumes that their origin was terrestrial, the second that it was planetesimal. The one is atmospheric, the other rises high above it. The first fulfils all requirements, but a possible difficulty exists in connection with the flotation stability of the belts. The density of carbon dioxide compared to air is 1.524, therefore it does not seem likely that this substance entered into their composition. However, as there are numerous other lighter gases which might have answered the purpose, this objection is not serious. Centrifugal force undoubtedly played a con- spicuous part, as it was this whirling energy that broke the canopy up into belts. If the rings had their origin beyond the atmosphere, then the forces which control Saturn's system must have sustained ours. In other words, we are presenting two diametrically opposed ideas, the one working outward and the other inward. It may be true that both forms of the hypothesis are correct. There may have been a system of rings composed of planetesimal accretions received from outer space, and there may also have been belts on the outer confines of the atmosphere, somewhat similar to the belts now visible on Jupiter. These belts may have had a volcanic origin, or, again, they may have been derived from the rings, for undoubtedly in falling these became canopies, their substance drifting off in the direction of the poles, where centrifugal force was at a minimum. It is a significant fact that our sister planets present us with an object lesson, and that we do not comprehend the exact working of the, laws involved. CHAPTER II ATMOSPHERIC BELTS ACCORDING to the planetesimal hypothesis of the earth's origin, the hydrosphere and atmosphere were acquired through gravitational action driving out the internal gases. This process has gone on from the initial stages to the present time. Every volcanic eruption witnesses large additions, that can be measured, as in the case of explosive vents like that of Mount Pelee, by the standard of cubic miles. 1 The principal gaseous product excluded by volcanoes are water-vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. To these may be added chlorine, sulphur, and many other temporary gases, together with certain other light and volatile material. Even at the present day enor- mous quantities of these products are shot forth into very high altitudes. Witness the eruption of Krakatoa, the pow- dery dust from which was carried up at least seventeen miles, and the gaseous ejections may have reached still more amaz- ing heights. 2 Volcanic action in the past has been more active than at present. 3 In the case of our sun, protuber- 1 James Furman Kemp, \"Economic Geology,\" Dec.-Jan., vol. i, No. 3, pp. 219-220, 229. 2 Joseph Le Conte, \"Elements of Geology,\" 5th ed., revised by Her- man Le Roy Fairchild, p. 91. 'Archibald Geikie describes the following basalt-plain visited on his return trip from the Yellowstone, which illustrates this greater activity of the past. He says: \"The last section of our ride proved to be in a geological sense one of the most interesting parts of the whole journey. We found that the older trachytic lavas of the hills had been deeply trenched by lateral valleys, and that all these valleys had a floor of the black basalt that had been poured out as the last of the molten materials from the now extinct volcanoes. There were no visible cones or vents from which these floods of basalt could have 17 18 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS ances are shot out to heights of many thousands of miles. \" The expansive potency of this prodigious elasticity,\" say Chamberlin and Salisbury, \" is held in restraint by the equally prodigious power of the sun's gravity.\" As it is, some of these outshoots closely approach the controlling limit of the sun's gravity. 4 In the case of our moon, the expansive potency of its volcanoes has been too great to be controlled by its feeble gravity, hence the moon lacks an atmosphere. Now, gravity exerts on our own planet a force much less than that of the sun, and much greater than that of the moon. It is generally admitted that we may have lost a part of our atmosphere, therefore it may be log- ically surmised that more than one of our outer gaseous shells or envelopes in past time escaped. The joint authors above cited say in this connection that \" the mean velocity of hydrogen is more than four times that proceeded. We rode for hours by the margin of a vast plain of basalt, stretching southward and westward as far as the eye could reach. It seemed as if the plain had been once a great lake or sea of molten rock which surged along the base of the hills, entering every valley and leaving there a solid floor of bare black stone. We camped on this basalt plain, near some springs of clear cold water which rise close to its edge. Wandering over the bare hummocks of rock, on many of which not a vestige of vegetation had yet taken root, I realized with vividness the truth of an assertion made first by Richthofen, but very generally neglected by geologists, that our modern volcanoes, such as Vesuvius or Etna, present us with by no means the grandest type of volcanic action, but rather belong to a time of failing activity. There have been periods of tremendous volcanic energy, when, instead of escaping from a local vent, like a Vesuvian cone, the lava has found its way to the surface by innumerable fissures opened for it in the solid crust of the globe over thousands of square miles. I felt that the structure of this and the other volcanic plains of the Far West furnish the true key to the history of the basaltic plateaux of Ireland and Scotland, which had been an enigma to me for many years.\" (\"Geolog- ical Sketches at Home and Abroad,\" pp. 237-238.) To this we may add that the explosive type of volcanic eruption was also greater in the past than at present. * Chamberlin and Salisbury, Geo., vol. ii, p. 55. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 19 of oxygen, and it may be assumed that it would be at least four times as liable to escape from the control of the earth.\" 6 If these belts, composed of gases lighter than air, were working outwards, all that is required of them is that they remained under gravitational control long enough to produce the pronounced climatic effects known to biology and to geology. They may have been invisible to the eye and yet have fulfilled all the requirements of the hero-tales left us by early man, for, although invisible themselves, they would have caused certain phenomena to be introduced into th*, atmos- phere beneath which would have been visible, and this sec- ondary class of phenomena would have given birth to the myths. The secondary phenomena referred to may be explained as follows: When a column of air saturated with aqueous vapor ascends from the earth it is invisible until radiation or the meeting with cooler currents condenses it. Thus cumuli are the heads of vaporous columns which are precipitated as soon as they reach a certain elevation. 6 ]STow, gaseous belts floating on the outer confines of the atmosphere would have prevented this radiation. They would have intro- duced greenhouse conditions, admitting the luminous heat, and preventing the escape of the dark heat. Aqueous vapor is lighter than air, and the only thing that stops its upward career is this condensation. Under the influence of such belts as are postulated, undoubtedly the present storm belt would have been surmounted by one immeasurably higher, and this stupendous belt of cloud being visible in- spired the ancients to worship and to build monuments that have along with the Scriptures perpetuated the memory of the crooked flying serpent. 5 Ibid, p. 98. \"Tyndall, \"Heat a Mode of Motion,\" 6th ed., p. 384. 20 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens ; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.\" 7 The serpent portrayed girded the sky in an east and west direction. The storm- belt, postulated, not only floated at great heights, but also had its boundaries established by the overruling zonal extra- atmosphaBra belts, and it follows that it could not extend further north, or further south, than these boundaries. The greenhouse conditions are thus described by Le Conte : \" It seems almost certain that during the whole recorded history of the earth, i.e., during the time it has been inhabited by organisms, the surface-temperature of the earth has been almost wholly due to external causes. Now, the composition of the atmosphere is an external cause, which greatly affects the surface-temperature, but which has hith- erto been almost wholly neglected. The thorough explana- tion of this point will require some discussion of the proper- ties of transparent media in relation to light and heat. \" Many bodies which are transparent to light are opaque to heat. Such bodies, however, will freely transmit heat, if the heat be accompanied with intense light. It is as if the light carried the heat through with it. Heat thus associated with light is sometimes called light heat, while that which is not thus associated is called dark heat. Now, the bodies spoken of are transparent to light heat, but opaque to dark heat. Glass is such a body. If a pane of glass be held between the face and the sun,, the heat passes freely and burns the face, but the same pane would act as a partial screen before a fire, and as a perfect screen before a hot, but not incandescent, cannon-ball. \" It is in this way we explain the fact that a glass green- house, even in the coldest sunshiny winter's day, becomes insupportably warm if shut up. The sunlight and heat pass freely through the glass and heat the ground, the benches, T Job xxvi: 13. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 31 the flower-pots ; but the light-heat thereby becomes converted into dark heat, and thus is imprisoned within. Now, the earth and its atmosphere are such a greenhouse. The light- heat passes readily through, warms the ground, changes into dark heat, and is in a measure imprisoned by the partial opacity of the atmosphere to this kind of heat. The atmos- phere is a kind of blanket put about the earth to keep it warm. So much has long been recognized. But Tyndall has shown that the property of opacity to dark heat in the case of the atmosphere is due wholly to the small quantity of carbonic acid and aqueous vapor present; that oxygen and nitrogen are transparent to dark heat, and, therefore, if the atmosphere consisted only of those two gases, it would not be heated by radiation from the earth, and the ground would lose all its heat by radiation during the night, and become intensely cold, like space. In other words, the blanket put about the earth to keep it warm is woven of carbonic acid and aqueous vapor.\" 8 The matter resolves itself into the question, What gases of light density would exert a similar influence? Langley says : \" The temperature of this planet, and with it the existence not only of the human race but of all organized life on the globe, appears, in the light of the conclusions reached by the Mount Whitney expedition, to depend far less on the direct solar heat than on the hitherto too little regarded quality of selective absorption in our atmosphere.\" 9 Geology and biology unveil the fact that in the past the earth has been at times a vast orchard-house blooming with a luxuriant vegetation that has even extended to the polar regions. \" We know by experiment,\" remarks Sir Charles Lyell, \" that plants which are natives of the tropics can dispense 8 Geo., 5th ed., revised by Fairchild, pp. 395-396. \"George F. Barker, \"Physics,\" 4th ed., p. 393. 22 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS more easily with the bright light of those countries than with the heat of the same. Few palms can live in our temperate latitudes without protection from the cold; but when placed in hot-houses they grow luxuriantly, even under a cloudy sky and where much light is intercepted by the glass and framework. At St. Petersburg, in lat. 60 1ST., many tropical plants have been successfully cultivated in hot-houses, although there they must exchange the perpetual equinox of their native regions for days and nights which are alternately protracted to nineteen hours and shortened to five. How much farther towards the pole even the existing species might continue to live, provided a due quantity of heat and moisture were supplied, has not yet been determined ; but St. Peters- burg is probably not the utmost limit, and we should expect that in lat. 65 at least, where they would never remain twenty-four hours without enjoying the sun's light, they might still exist.\" 10 Greenhouse conditions have existed in the past all the way up to the pole, thus all these facts go to show that a canopy exerting a selective absorption must have existed. Pure hydrogen, though light enough to float above the atmos- phere, was not the material out of which this blanket was made, for its atoms, apparently, are quite incompetent to stop the calorific waves. But there are other gases, such as argon, krypton, neon, helium, and their combinations, which have to be considered. Some of the hydrocarbons likewise, which also are products of vulcanism, and which have a rela- tively high power of absorption, cannot be ignored. The radiation-enigmas of the boreal auroras have recently been identified with the spectra of some of the new atmos- pheric gases. This indicates that remnants of the old canopy still exist. This phenomenon often takes the form of an arc from which stream curtains of light. Principles of Geology,\" vol. i, llth ed., p. 226. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 23 There is a possibility that these rarefied belts may have been upheld by electrical expulsion originating in the earth, in which case they may have been heavier than air. Centrif- ugal force also was a very powerful factor, the rate of gyra- tion being the same or slightly slower than the earth. One matter is certain, the gaseous envelope could not have been of uniform texture. The physical evidence as recorded by the zonal climatic temperatures and the records of primitive man unite against such a supposition. In other words, it was broken up into belts or rings, and, furthermore, the laws of mathematics, mechanics, and physics demand that it should be. It is not unlikely that electricity alone would have caused such a break up. Biela's comet separated into two parts, mutually affecting each other. 11 Though this comparison may have but little value, it does, however, introduce a pos- sible factor. Yet why deal with uncertainties, since this feature is so clearly proved ? Thus it is plain to all that the power of gravity being at least partially neutralized by centrifugal tendency due to axial speed, allowed the latter to gain progressively in lift- ing capacity from the poles, where that speed had a zero value, to the equator, where it attained the maximum. Here, then, the gaseous materials of the rotating body were vir- tually lighter than elsewhere, and consequently retreated farther from the earth. ~Not only did this introduce strains into the canopy itself, which probably disrupted it, but it also caused an unevenness in the height to which the ascend- ing columns of aqueous vapor could rise. This is all impor- tant, for since the canopy quite probably was invisible, it makes little difference whether it was ruptured or not. The fact to grasp is that the secondary cloud uplift was visible, \"Agnes M. Clerke, \"History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., p. 120. 24 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS and this, owing to these physical conditions, must have been divided into serpent-like belts. It must not be inferred because of the use of the word \" rupture \" that the upper belt which we are considering was of one piece. Such a structure is impossible. Our concep- tion makes every individual particle independent, but liberty is not license, and when these individuals transgressed the law of their station they were to all intents and purposes ruptured from it. Even under existing conditions signs are not wanting that point to the existence of belts in the heights of our atmos- phere. Twenty miles above the earth's surface there is a stupendous wind blowing which completes its circuit in about thirteen days. The great explosion of Krakatoa, which took place August 27, 1883, revealed to us its existence. Through the medium of the dust from this eruption it was seen that this mighty wind circled around the earth in the vicinity of the Equator. Afterwards the dust dissipated as a canopy drifting towards the poles. Those who saw the brilliant sun- sets tinged by these particles will never forget them. Kraka- toa certainly thundered forth its voice as a witness to this hypothesis. 12 This is not the only instance in recent time when the dust from volcanoes and from arid regions has revealed these upper air-currents. The following are given as illustrations : \" This phenomenon is frequent on the northwest of Africa, about the Cape Verde Islands, in the Mediterranean, and over the bordering countries. A microscopic examination of this dust by Ehrenberg led him to the belief that it contains numerous diatoms of South American species; and he in- ferred that a dust-cloud must be swimming in the atmos- phere, carried forward by continuous currents of air in the 12 James D. Dana, \" Manual of Geo.,\" 4th ed., pp. 163, 291. Archibald Geikie, Geo., 3d ed., pp. 214, 338. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 25 region of the trade-winds and anti-trades, but suffering par- tial and periodical deviations. But much of the dust seems to come from the sandy plains and desiccated pools of the north of Africa. Daubree recognized in 1865 some of the Sahara sand which fell in the Canary Islands. On the coast of Italy a film of sandy clay identical with that from parts of the Libyan desert is occasionally found on windows after rain. In the middle of the last century an area of northern Italy, estimated at about 200 square leagues, was covered with a layer of dust which in some places reached a depth of one inch. In 1846 the Sahara dust reached Lyons, and it is said to have been since detected as far as Boulogne-sur- Mer. Should the travelling dust encounter a cooler tempera- ture, it may be brought to the ground by snow, as has hap- pened in the north of Italy, and more notably in the east and southeast of Kussia, where the snows are sometimes rendered dirty by the dust raised by winds on the Caspian steppes. It is easy to see how widespread deposits of dust may arise, mingled with the soil of the land and with the silt and sand of lakes, rivers, or the sea ; and how the minuter organisms of tropical regions may thus come to be preserved in the same formations with the terrestrial or marine organisms of tem- perate latitudes.\" 13 This kind of evidence may be somewhat tiresome, but it is very suggestive, for since dust can be suspended in the atmosphere, as now constituted, and carried to such great distances, a little reflection shows what a potent factor it must have been in the by-gone ages. In those days this same dust must have been sucked up, along with the water-vapor, to very great heights, where it was held in suspension for correspondingly long periods. A few more instances may be pardoned : \" M. Stanislas Meunier, the well-known authority upon \"Archibald Geikie, Geo., 3d ed., p. 337. 26 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS meteorological effects, gives an account of a phenomenon which occurred at Paris and which was no doubt caused by the eruption of Vesuvius. On the morning of the llth of April a dry and yellowish fog extended over the city. It was strong enough to interfere with the navigation on the Seine, and the sun appeared under a peculiar aspect. Supposing that this phenomenon might be caused by the eruption of Vesuvius, M. Meunier placed upon the roof of his dwelling a series of plates covered with glycerine, so as to retain the floating dust. These plates when treated with water gave a rather abundant deposit in which soot and organic matter were visible to the naked eye. The fine portion of the deposit, which was separated by the Thoulet heavy liquid, gave an extremely fine sand, and a microscopic examination of this confirmed M. Meunier's idea. \" Comparison of this sand with the ash sent up by Vesu- vius in 1822, of which he had a sample, showed a complete identity with the latter. The main difference consists in the presence of some perfectly spherical globules of oxidized iron in the Paris dust. We may therefore admit that the fog seen in Paris was caused by the very fine dust sent up from Vesuvius.\" 14 Tyndall says : \" Ashes have been shot through the lower current by volcanoes, and, from the places where they have subsequently fallen, the direction of the wind which carried them has been inferred. Professor Dove, who has so enriched the knowledge of the age by his researches in meteorology, cites the following instance : ' On the night of April 30 explosions like those of heavy artillery were heard at Barba- does, so that the garrison at Fort St. Anne remained all night under arms. On May 1, at daybreak, the eastern portion of the horizon appeared clear, while the rest of the firmament was covered by a black cloud, which soon extended to the 14 Scientific American, vol. xcv, No. 13. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 27 east, quenched the light there, and at length produced a dark- ness so intense that the windows in the rooms could not be discerned. A shower of ashes descended. Whence came these ashes? From the direction of the wind, we should infer that they came from the Azores; they came, however, from the volcano Morne Garou in St. Vincent, which lies about 100 miles west of Barbadoes. The ashes had been cast into the current by the upper trade. A second example of the same kind occurred on January 20, 1835. On the 24th and 25th the sun was darkened in Jamaica by a shower of fine ashes, which had been discharged from the mountain Coseguina, distant 800 miles. The people learned in this way that the explosions previously heard were not those of artillery. These ashes could only have been carried by the upper current, as Jamaica lies northeast from the mountain. The same eruption gives also a beautiful proof that the ascending air-current divides itself above, for ashes fell upon the ship Conway, in the Pacific, at a distance of 700 miles southwest of Coseguina. ' \" 15 Another class of phenomena which points to the existence of belts in the upper confines of the atmosphere is the aurora polaris. It is a most interesting fact that these displays have a tendency to follow local time, as though they were in some way connected with an invisible belt whose rotation period was in harmony with that of the earth's. Thus in the great aurora of February 4, 1872, which was visible in both hemispheres, it had its maximum at about the same local time, between 8.30 and 9.30 P.M., and not at the same physi- cal instant. 16 A common appearance of the aurora is that of parallel arches or curtains of light, always running from east to west \"Heat a Mode of Motion,\" 6th ed., pp. 209-210. 16 Frank Wilbert Stokes, Century Magazine, Feb., 1903, vol. Ixv, No. 4. 28 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS or from west to east a significant fact, for as electric phe- nomena depend upon a material surface on which to accu- mulate, and as the aurora is generally acknowledged to be of electrical origin, it proves the existence of invisible belts in our modern atmosphere. It is said of these arcs that \" in certain regions, and probably also at certain epochs, the polar aurora manifests itself simply as a very regular arc of a circle, with well- defined outlines and uniformly luminous in all its parts, so that it presents an absoutely homogeneous texture. It is under this form that the aurora borealis most often presented itself to Professor Nordenskjold in 187&-79, during the celebrated wintering of the Vega on the northern coast of Siberia, almost at the entrance to Behring Strait. In this station the summit of the arc rarely exceded a height of thirty degrees above the horizon, so that its centre remained well below the horizon. \" These arcs are generally completely motionless and remarkably permanent: they often retain their position for hours and even for several days.\" 17 Now, unquestionably these belts or rivers flow above the cloud-zone. Thus the aurora furnishes still another valuable idea. It gives certain data regarding the height of these gaseous belts. Floegel deduces the following conclusions: \" The altitude of the base of the rays is very variable ; it is usually comprised between 150 and 250 kilometres (93 to 155 miles), but its extreme limits attain perhaps 100 and 300 kilometres (62 and 186 miles). As to the summits of the rays, they often reach a greater height than 500 kilo- metres (310 miles) ; it is even probable that they pass 750 kilometres (565 miles) ; but they appear never to reach 1,500 kilometres (930 miles).\" 18 \"Alfred Angot, \"The Aurora Borealis,\" The International Scien- tific Series, pp. 20-21. 19 IUd, p. 59. ATMOSPHERIC BELTS 29 It is said also that these displays may be in part con- nected with the presence of ferruginous dust derived from the disintegration of meteoric masses or from volcanic eruptions. As canopies are subject to the laws of centrifugal force, which becomes of zero value at the poles, it follows that there always has been an open place in the sky in those zones. In this connection any invisible series of belts existing to-day would also be outlawed from the far north. This feature is indicated by the aurora and is thus described in the Century article from which we have already drawn: \" Contrary to received opinion, the auroras do not in- crease as we advance poleward; for in the regions where polar expeditions have mostly wintered, Melville Island, Baffin Bay, and Smith Sound, the aurora is generally less brilliant and also less frequent than in Iceland, Labrador, and South Greenland. Its maximum of frequency is at !N\"orth Cape, Nova Zembla, and at Cape Chelyuskin, Siberia cutting the meridian of Behring Strait at latitude 70, entering America a little to the west of Barrow Strait, cross- ing Hudson Bay and Labrador, passing to the south of Greenland and Iceland, and forming an oval zone which has for its centre a point situated between the geographical and magnetic poles. The latter is situated in Boothia Felix Land, in. latitude 73 north and 98 west longitude from Paris.\" 19 An objection may arise in the minds of some to the effect that if the arc of the aurora reveals belts in the upper atmos- pheric gases, then since these arcs are often elliptical rather than circular, the belts assume a form not reconcilable with the expected conditions. This may be true, but whether the conditions are such as we picture in our minds or not, the fact remains, Saturn's ring system is elliptical. 20 \"Vol. IXT, No. 4, Feb., 1903, p. 495. 80 Agnes M. Clerke, \"History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., pt. ii, chap, viii, p. 364. CHAPTER III PLANETESIMAL RINGS IT is a vast step from Jupiter-like belts to rings such as circle Saturn, and yet there are features that are common to both. Rings composed of planetesimal bodies riding at immense heights may have caused a secondary cloud system in the atmosphere, or, again, in falling, these rings may have themselves formed canopies. Be this as it may, Saturn has Jupiter-like belts. Since these marvels exist, it will be well to glance at certain of the conditions which they intro- duce, and the laws which they are forced to obey, with the object of showing that it is quite possible that our earth once had such a system. To begin with, as the force exerted by gravity on our earth is not much greater than on Saturn, conditions similar to those now prevailing on that body may have existed on our globe. Thus a falling body on our sphere passes through a space of sixteen feet during the first second of its journey. On Saturn in the polar regions it would cover seventeen and five-tenths of a foot, but at the equator, owing to the increased velocity of rotation, the force is lessened one-sixth, therefore the falling body would travel only fourteen and eight-tenths feet in the first second. Mathematical calculations (Kepler's Third Law) require the rings in the case of our earth to have been about 2,200 miles from the surface in order to maintain their stability. It is known that our sister planet has belts as well as rings. This is a very important point. An annular system such as Saturn's, taken by itself, would not have influenced the climate of our planet in such a way as to mark the con- trasts required by the geological ages. For this reason it 30 PLANETESIMAL RINGS 31 is obvious that a secondary cloud system is necessary. Again, though it is true that the upper system itself, if it continued as a feature in the sky until man appeared on the earth, would have impressed itself upon his imagination and re- ligious instinct so vividly that it would have contributed largely to his primitive nature myths, yet the secondary canopy system is needed to round out this record. Taking the primary system into consideration, if we could travel over the surface of the planet Saturn to-day, we would find that from the pole as far as the 63d degree of latitude the great annular system would be invisible. Advancing toward the equator, the arches would begin to rise above the distant horizon more and more. It would be only during the two seasons, spring and summer, that the face of the rings would turn toward the hemisphere where we would be standing. Their appearance at night would be that of a bright bow reflecting the light from the sun, but in day-time probably only a feeble light, analogous to that of our moon when seen in broad daylight, would be visible. In mean latitudes, of say 45, the several series of nearly concentric rings would be viewed sideways. We would see three principal rings and several minor subdivisions, sepa- rated by certain well-defined spaces. Under the equator, glancing up at the zenith, we would be looking only at the thin interior edge. It would be ribbon-like in appearance, for, according to the evidence derived from the breadth of the shadow cast on the planet, the rings are only sixty miles thick. As to the height of these wonderful appendages of our sister planet, the inner or \" crape \" ring, also known as the \" gauze \" ring, begins at a distance of some 6,400 miles from the surface of the planet and extends upward to about 8,400 miles. This first ring merges by imperceptible gradations into another circlet which is some 18,000 miles wide. Then comes an interval of about 1,450 miles, known as \" Cassini's division \" ; after which follows the outer ring, some 10,000 32 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS miles wide, whose exterior edge is approximately 43,000 miles distant from the surface of the planet. The substance of the crape ring is now generally admitted to be a cloud of cosmical dust, similar to the cloud that causes the phenomenon of the zodiacal light. \" The disk of Saturn is seen through this ring in undiminished brightness, and in May, 1905, Saturn's satellite lapetus passed bodily through it. The circumstances and consequences of this passage proved that the gauze ring is composed of separate particles, which are either smaller or less closely aggregated than those which form the outer rings.\" 1 As the rings draw nearer to the planet, increased col- lisions probably account for the finer character of the dust, the dashing together of the particles reducing them to a con- dition which when they finally fall into the upper strata of the atmosphere would result in their immediate combustion, the gases resulting spreading out and forming the canopy. 2 There is a close relationship between meteoric dust and the aurora polaris. \" According to this view, the light of the aurora is caused by clouds of ferruginous meteoric dust, which is ignited by friction with the atmosphere. Groneman has shown that these might be arranged along the magnetic curves by action of the earth's magnetic force during their descent, and that their influence might produce the observed magnetic disturbances. . . . The correspondences with iron lines in its spectrum are sufficiently close to favor the idea. Ferruginous particles have been found in the dust of 1 Illustrirte Zeitung, and Scientific American Supplements, Nos. 192, 1600. 2 It is well to emphasize the fact that the gaseous nature of the canopy is derived from combustion, and that no part of it comes in the aeriform fluid condition directly from the rings. The water-sky of the ancients was of secondary origin, the water, or rather the vapor, being derived from the surface of the earth itself. As no refraction is visible upon the limb of the planet seen through the gauze ring, it follows that the ring itself is not gaseous. PLANETESIMAL RINGS 33 the Polar regions, but whether they are derived from stellar space or from volcanic eruption is uncertain.\" 3 The geographical distribution of the fall of meteorites indicates that they have been whirling for some time in belts before finally reaching the earth. This of course does not apply to the shooting stars, which, coming from a stationary radiant point in upper inter-planetary space, are usually consumed in our atmosphere. With regard to the former class, a prediction was made by Dr. Oliver C. Farrington in the Popular Science Monthly in February, 1904, 4 in the following words. He said : \" It is usual to dismiss inquiries regarding the meaning of such groupings with the remark that they are mere coincidences. But it is the mission of science to investigate coincidences, and however long the task may be of determining the laws which bring about the particular occurrences here referred to, there can be no doubt that they are the result of law, and of law which will some day be discerned by the human mind.\" If a few meteorites can make a belt of sufficient density to give rise to the auroral phenomenon, naturally great things should result from the consumption of a ring of such material. Saturn's rings are falling. \" Since 165 7, when Huygens described the interval between the ring and the planet as rather exceeding the width of the ring, it is all but certain that a growth inward has actually occurred. For the two bright rings together, instead of being narrower than the interval, are now more than one and a half times as broad. Hence the expressions used by Huygens, no less than most of the old drawings, are glaringly inconsistent with the planet's present appearance.\" 5 8 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed., article on the aurora. *Vol. Ixiv, No. 4, p. 354. 5 Agnes M. Clerke, \"History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., pt. ii, chap, viii, p. 366. 3 34 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Inf ailing material naturally drifts towards the poles where centrifugal force is annulled, therefore since Saturn's rings to-day are falling and are forming a canopy, and it is not reasonable to suppose that another process of nature in the past originated the blankets now seen on Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, and that our earth was garnished by one of these appendages derived in some other way. In our last chapter a volcanic origin was suggested as a possibility, but the fact remains. It is altogether improbable that projectiles from terrestrial volcanoes ever received im- pulses powerful enough to enable them not only to surmount the earth's gravity, but also to penetrate its atmosphere. In order to meet this difficulty we were forced to postulate gases lighter than air, but the present assumption of an infalling ring system accounts for the heavier-than-air gases, such as carbon dioxide, riding on top. There is a certain class of meteorites that are carbonaceous. As to the origin of the material which formed the rings, the meteoric hypothesis meets with little favor, for the dis- tribution of meteorites through space is too sparse. The planetesimal hypothesis assumes a cold spiral nebula, out of which the solar system has evolved, but long ages ago, it is believed, inter-planetary space was swept clean of the dusty material. A question arises Could this supply in any way have been replenished ? It is generally supposed that the nebulae, from which the stellar systems are derived, are rendered luminous by virtue of the continually recurring contacts of their various par- ticles. It is highly probable that in space there exists a far larger number of invisible nebulae than visible, for the reason that the number of contacts in a system of lighter texture would be so few that their existence would not be made known. Our sun is continually rushing into new fields, and the suggestion is made that in some past age, geologically speaking, not so very long ago, he ran into one of these minor PLANETESIMAL RINGS 35 dark nebulae. 6 This would have replenished the inter- planetary dust, and the velocities and distribution of such particles would have lent themselves to the formation of just such annular systems, as that which has passed away from our own earth, and those now visible in the final or canopy stage on Venus and Jupiter, and which still survives on the planet Saturn. These show us, not how the worlds were made, but how the geologic ages were separated by the planetesimal-ring clock. It must be understood that whether the nebula into which our finished solar system plunged was a gaseous spheroid or one arising from an aggregation of meteors, matters not, the important factor being that this newly acquired material conformed to the general law of such systems, revolving in concentric orbits about its common centre, which was no doubt captivated by our sun. The several constituent parts must have been attracted towards the different planets, around which they must have first revolved as a nebulous satellite, but, owing to their disrupted condition, they no doubt soon trailed out into a characteristic ring formation. The joint authors of Chamberlin's and Salisbury's Geology grant that \" the rings of Saturn may have been satellite nuclei at the outset, and have been drawn within the Roche limit by the growth of Saturn, and then disinte- grated by tidal action and distributed into the ring form.\" 7 Other methods of acquiring satellites also exist. \" This possibility, it now seems, has been actually realized. The identification of Brooks's with LexelPs comet is due to the acumen of Dr. Chandler. He found that the former body had spent eight months in 1886 under Jupiter's immediate control had, in fact, barely escaped being reduced to the 6 The suggestion that the sun ran into a nebulous region is somewhat similar to that hypothesis, advanced to account for the Ice age, which pictures certain regions in space as colder than others. 7 Vol. ii, p. 63. 36 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS position of his satellite and had issued from the proximity with all the elements of its motion turned, so to speak, topsy- turvy.\" 8 If annular systems have been acquired as suggested, it follows that their period of rotation would not at the first have been likely to conform to that of their adopted primary. Tidal retardations would in time adjust these differences, but in the beginning this added initial impulse derived from their original system would have tended to float them high in the heavens of their new relative. Jupiter to this day furnishes us with evidence of this nature. \" The time of rotation of the red spot is not the same as that of the adjacent cloud-forms. In 1890 a large spot was moving directly toward the red spot; but it was diverted from its course, and passed at one side of the spot. After it passed by it did not return to its original course, but remained at the higher latitude into which it had been shunted; it passed the red spot at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Professor Keeler has likened the great red spot to a sand-bank in a river, past which the flecks of foam go scurrying.\" 9 In Jupiter's case, the true globe has never been seen, so the period of rotation is unknown, though the red spot may represent some mighty physical disturbance near the sur- face. But this does not seem likely, for even this wonderful feature is itself subject to a changing rate of rotation. With one or two exceptions, the vapor-cloud currents are pretty constant, their normal speed conforming closely to the gen- eral movement of the latitude in which they circle. As regards the relative altitudes of the various markings, observation tends to show that the more swiftly moving objects are situated at a greater height than those which jour- 8 \"History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., p. 445. 8 Herbert A. Howe, \"A Study of the Sky,\" p. 255. PLANETESIMAL RINGS 37 ney more slowly. According to the conditions outlined in our last chapter, this is just what should be expected. In Jupiter's case, an invisible gaseous canopy surrounds the planet, the lower system of cloud-belts being lifted to heights far above the natural storm zone by the inability of these vaporous masses to radiate their heat through the greenhouse roof. They are aided somewhat in their upward tendency by two causes: first, as already mentioned, aqueous vapor, being lighter than air, would always reach greater heights than it does were it not due to condensation resulting from the above-mentioned radiation; second, the great ocean of gas, or rather planetesimals, resting above the clouds, exerts a certain well defined gravitational pull. The equatorial belts observed in Jupiter's canopy are probably composed of ring material not yet reduced to the gaseous form by the oxidizing agency of the atmosphere. Returning to the problem of axial rotation, we have seen that atmospheric retardation in the case of Jupiter's cloud- belts has reduced the speed of the lower members of the system. The opposite characteristic, however, prevails in the case of ring systems. Thus Keeler demonstrated by means of the light waves received from opposite sides of Saturn's rings, that they rotate, but the most marvelous part of his spectroscopic work is the point established, that the interior part of the rings rotate faster than the outside. The following rotation periods are very suggestive : The inner edge of the bright ring, 7 hours and 45 minutes. The inner edge of the innermost or crape ring, 5 hours 39 min- utes. The mean time of the rings as a whole, however, is 10 hours and 29 minutes, which is somewhat longer than that of the planet itself. The atmospheric canopy of Saturn does not rotate as fast as the planet itself, and, moreover, different streams or belts have relative motion with respect to their surroundings. 38 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS If satellites and annular systems have been acquired as postulated, we should expect to find instances where tidal action has not yet brought about a perfect harmony. The most prominent examples are found in the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, which have a retrograde rotation from east to west, a fact of which neither Kant nor Laplace had been aware. Another striking instance is that of Phobos, one of Mars' moons, which is the only known case of a satellite circulating faster than its primary rotates. \" Jupiter's innermost moon conforms in its motions strictly, and indeed inevitably, to the plane of his equa- torial protuberance, following, however, a sensibly elliptical path. Its very insignificance raises the suspicion that it may not prove solitary. Possibly it belongs to a zone peopled by asteroidal satellites. More than fifteen thousand such small bodies could be furnished out of the materials of a single full- sized satellite spoiled in the making.\" 10 10 \"A Popular History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Cen- tury,\" 3d ed., chap, viii, pp. 357-358. CHAPTER IV PHYSICAL EFFCTS GEOLOGIC THE new factors introduced by this hypothesis throw fresh light on many mooted questions. In this chapter it is purposed to glance at some of these; namely, tidal action, planetesimal deposits, and the division of the geologic periods by the great annular time-clock. Taking these up in the above order, first we have the matter of the earth's rotation affected by these conditions, and we find two very important factors diametrically opposed to each other. The contraction of the loosely compacted planet- esimal world matter, on the one hand, has increased our planet's rate of rotation, thus shortening the day, while on the other hand, the tidal brake is to be credited with the pre- vention of an excessive gain of this speed. A doubt arises as to how long the moon has been respon- sible for this tidal restraint. The fact is, most of the elabo- rate calculations of the mathematicians are based on a terres- trial birth and gradual withdrawal of our satellite. Yet this birth and withdrawal itself may be questioned. . Thus astron- omers tell us : \" It is not unlikely that the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars (we may safely add, of Uranus or Neptune) 'never revolved in much narrower orbits than those they now traverse; it is practically certain that they did not, like our moon, originate very near the present surfaces of their primaries.\" 1 It is very strange if nature provided two different methods for the birth of these children of the planets. Plainly the 1 Agnes M. Clerke, \"A Popular History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., pt. ii, chap, ix, p. 387. Phil. Trans., vol. clxxii, p. 530. 40 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS trouble with this whole proposition is that it is founded on the old version of the nebula hypothesis. Now, turning to the new interpretation, the moon-zones or rings out of which all the satellites of the planets were formed according to the planetesimal hypothesis had a gravi- tational but not a tidal effect on their primaries. Take the case of our earth. In opposition to terrestrial gravity the contrary attraction of the annular system must have lifted immense bodies of water in the equatorial regions. Again, these rings attracted each other. As some of the inner rings fell they acted as a partial release to the outer or moon-zone ring, allowing it to drift off farther and farther into space; hence the late birth of the moon tends to ratify the inference that we had a regular annular system. The grinding down of axial velocity and the expanding of orbital range were greatly retarded by the annular system. In fact, the above is the only tenable hypothesis advanced to explain the birth of our satellite. The break-up of the primeval planet into two mases as a consequence of a too rapid rotation is open to the objection that the lesser mass would have been entirely disrupted. After this catastrophe these broken remnants necessarily had to reunite. Why introduce into the proposition two elements of uncertainty when one is more than sufficient ? We remarked that the above is the only tenable hypothe- sis advanced to explain the origin of our moon, but it may be well to qualify this remark with the suggestion that per- haps when our sun picked up the unknown system in stellar space, our moon was already a developed member of that community. According to this view, other satellites may have been added to our mundane system, which, however, became disrupted, thus forming the rings postulated. But to return to the proposition that our moon was not born from, or rather torn from, our semi-molten earth, which, to begin with, assumes a condition of earthly things PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 41 which we cannot admit ever existed, the best authorities concurring in this opinion. \" Mr. James Nolan of Victoria has made it clear that the moon could not have subsisted as a continuous mass under the powerful disruptive strain which would have acted upon it when revolving almost in contact with the present surface of the earth ; and Professor Darwin, admitting the objection, concedes to our satellite, in its initial stage, the alternative form of a flock of meteorites. But such a congregation must have been quickly dispersed, by tidal action, into a meteoric ring. The same investigator fixed 6500 miles from centre to centre as the minimum distance at which the moon could have revolved in its entirety.\" 2 If the moon had its origin from the terrestrial spheroid, then the period of critical instability that brought about its birth occurred long aeons before the geologic time-clock began to lay down its divisions of rock. Keeping this in mind, if the moon is to be credited with being the chief agency in developing oceanic tides, then it follows from these two propositions that the earliest geologic ages should have seen the highest tides. Now, the geological record shows that very high tides occurred in the Triassic period of Mesozoic time; if the moon were so close as to raise these tides during the Reptilian age, then the whole harmony of a gradual with- drawal outward on its long spiral journey is upset. The first part of the trip would have been unreasonably slow and the last portion at an unthinkable speed; therefore we are forced to the conclusion that the moon was born at too late a date to allow of the thought that it was separated intact from its primary. At first sight it would appear that there is no connection between gravitational action on the part of the belt system and geologic divisions of rock and of time, but there is. *llid, pt. ii, chap, viii, p. 386. 42 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS j Take, for example, the fact that this pull exerted by the rings was uniform around the circumference of the earth. It follows that there was no tidal action due to this cause, but there must have been a great uplift of the waters of the ocean under these appendages. Astronomers and physicists claim that the earth is a stable body more rigid than steel, and they are extremely skeptical of the claims of the geologists that involve vast terrestrial uplifts, for they argue, if the earth were less rigid, the enormous united tidal influences of the sun and moon would cause waves of flexure to travel around the globe as ocean tides do, and these agencies would be powerful enough to have a disrupting influence. Now, the idea which we advance relative to the uplift of the waters of the ocean under the annular appendages does much to reconcile these views. It is not necessary to suppose that the earth is as plastic as is generally claimed by the geologists, nor on the other do we have to admit the stability of the rigid condition required by the astronomers and physi- cists. The evidence shows that as we descend from the earth's surface we enter a zone where owing to the augmented heat rocks would be in a state of flowage were it not for the in- creased gravitational pressure. Below this region the pres- sure controls the situation. Now, the critical region is rigid so long as it remains under control, but the shifting of the oceanic weights has from time to time upset these stable con- ditions and introduced the plastic. Since the annular system was subject to certain periodic and also perhaps to erratic oscillations, it follows that the heaped up waters must from time to time have been forced to shift. This calls to mind the old ' waves of translation.' In the early days of geological theory one hypothesis advanced the idea that in some manner a series of gigantic waves were propagated in the far north. These mysterious movements were styled e waves of translation. ' James Geikie says, \" It PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 43 was unfortunate for this view that it violated at the very outset the first principles of the science, by assuming the former existence of a cause which there was little in nature to warrant.\" 3 Perhaps the old hypothesis is not so bad after all, though the direction of the inundation should be reversed. Shoal water did exist at the poles, as is witnessed by the land bridges, by means of which the flora and fauna migrated from one continental plain to the other, and also by the buried river channels, firths, and fiords. It is generally admitted by all but the astronomers and physicists that the weight of the great continental ice sheets caused the settling of the land masses, and that the vast accumulation of this same ice also lent a gravitational pull that tended to draw the oceanic waters towards the north ; but in addition to these reasons there certainly is no objection to admitting a third cause which logically accompanies them. To wit, when the canopy passed away the uplifted waters in the equatorial regions sought their level. The canopy, as we shall see in a future chapter, was the direct cause of the ice ages. Le Conte is authority for the statement that \" at the same time, partly by subsidence, and therefore slacked water- currents, and partly by moderated climate and melting of glaciers, there was a flooded condition of rivers and lakes in Middle Europe, France, Germany, and Switzerland. At the same time, also, the northern portion of Asia and the lake-region of that continent were submerged. The Caspian Sea, Lake Aral, and other lakes in that region were probably then united into one great inland sea, connecting either with the Black Sea or the then greatly-extended Arctic Ocean, or with both.\" 4 \" The Great Ice Age,\" 3d ed., chap, iii, p. 26. 4 Elements of Geo., 5th ed., p. 596.

Frederick Wright says : \" Coming down from the neighbor- hood of the White Mountains, the Adirondacks, and the Archaean highlands of Canada, sediment-laden streams have, from the earliest geological ages, been engaged in wearing away the hills, scooping out the valleys, and silting up the sea. The Alleghany Mountains were at one time the bed of the ocean upon which this sediment was deposited. The sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the coal-measures attest the activity of the forces of that early period. The tops of the mountains in southern ~New York and northern and eastern Pennsylvania are covered with subcarboniferous conglomerates of almost incredible depth and extent, con- sisting largely of well-rounded quartz pebbles, of all sizes up to two or three inches in diameter. These are water- worn, and must have been rolled along by impetuous currents from far-distant regions.\" 5 The size of these deposits is indeed incredible, and the tremendous currents required for their assortment are indeed a puzzle. The key to the situation is found in the warmth of the carbonic climate, and this key when turned in the lock reveals a greenhouse-roof-canopy that not only piled the waters up in a heap but also furnished the materials for the coal plants and the limestones of that era. In connection with the possible aerial origin of some of the above deposits, H. L. Fairchild makes the following sug- gestions, which show that geologists are ready to admit the extra-terrestrial origin of certain deposits. \" With the pass- ing of the old hypothesis,\" he says, \" it will be desirable to change the terminology of the rocks as far as this now implies an original molten or c igneous ' state of the earth. Some new name will be desirable for the sediments which were formed chiefly or wholly from planetesimals (the cosmic \"\"The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., chap, xii, pp. 268-269. PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 45 matter) in the early seas of the growing globe. Let us call such deposits cosmo elastics, and the primitive massive rocks, the cosmics. The downward succession of the rocks would thus be from unaltered elastics through altered elastics (meta- morphics) to metamorphosed cosmoclastics ; while beneath these, perhaps ever invisible, lie the altered cosmics, the primitive deposits.\" 6 Naturally any ring stuff which may have been added to the earth as late as the Carboniferous cannot be expected to show forth its origin as clearly as the formations of the archseozoic, for the reason that decomposition of the loose clastic material was greatly enhanced by the luxuriant vege- tal growth in the former era. Fairchild distinctly points out that the detritus which formed the sandstones, shales, and conglomerates was not all due to the wearing away of earlier formations. He remarks : \" The nebular hypothesis requires that the globe should have been fully formed before the surface or epigene agencies began their work, and that all the vast deposits of fragmen- tal origin, the clastic rocks, have been wholly derived from the primitive land areas by rock destruction. The new hypothesis allows a different view. According to this, the ocean began its work long before the earth and moon had attained full size by gathering to themselves all the particles of the earth-moon ring or zone. Consequently, there were oceanic sediments which were not wholly detrital, but were primitive world-stuff. The earlier ocean sediments must have been deeply buried under the later, and may now con- stitute part of the interior mass of the globe.\" 7 Even archaeology testifies to strange, loosely shifting material which may be in part the wind blown remnants of cosmical world chaff. Thus in connection with BePs sanc- 8 American Geologist, vol. xxxiii, No. 2, p. 101. f lUd, p. 100. 46 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS tuary at Nippur, Herman V. Hilprecht says : \" In descend- ing into the pre-Sargonic period below Naram-Sin's pave- ment, which itself lies six to eight feet above the present level of the desert, Haynes penetrated through more than thirty feet of ruins before he reached the virgin soil, or thirty-five feet before he was at the water level. What do these ruins contain? To what period of human history do they lead us ? How was this great accumulation beneath the level of the desert possible ? What geological changes have taken place since to explain this remarkable phenomenon? Such and other similar questions may have come to many thoughtful students when they first read these extraordinary facts.\" 8 Ignatius Donnelly imagined the earth covered with the fragments from the wreck of a comet. Natural phenomena, however, connected with the every-day physical forces, ex- plain the origin of all of these deposits, but though they may be explained, it does not follow that some of them, in part at least, may not owe their origin to the ring-belt system. In other words, it's time to break away from the time-honored but antiquated principle of Charles Lyell, that geological evidence excludes the thought of catastrophic changes. Thus the late Joseph Prestwich contended for a comparatively recent submergence of western Europe and the Mediter- ranean coasts. 9 The distribution of rubble-drift was one of his strong lines of argument. Rubble-drift hardly answers the requirements, but Prestwich also mentions the wide- spread formations of the loess. In almost all parts of the \"\"Explorations in Bible Lands During the Nineteenth Century,\" p. 891. 8 Articles on this subject may be found in the following publications : \"On the Raised Beaches and 'Head' or Rubble-drift of the South of England, etc..\" Quart. Journ. Geol. Society, vol. xlviii, p. 263; \" On the Evidences of a Submergence of Western Europe and of the Mediterranean Coasts at the close of the Glacial Period,\" etc., Phil. Trans., for 1893. PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 47 world this peculiar deposit is found. Several theories have been proposed to account for it, but none are satisfactory. It appears to be associated with the ground-up materials from the glaciers and to have been rearranged by fluviatile and eolian processes. The fossil content belongs to the land. Bust from the belts may readily enter in part into its com- position. By far the largest percentage of meteoric material which reaches this earth is in dust form. However, we are not forced to accept the statement that all the material pre- cipitated from the belts was consumed to powder before reaching terra firma, for if larger bodies did fall it follows that they would have been quickly reduced in the mill of the glaciers and the extreme weather conditions to which they were exposed. Prestwich also remarks the red breccia which covers the hills of southern Europe. The conclusion arrived at is that no distinctive deposit can be found that owes its origin wholly to the belts, for the reason that from the beginning such material was loose and scattered, and therefore subjected to the most rigorous of the disintegrating processes. Though it is impossible at this time to identify any of the superficial debris as planetesimal dust, yet some of the old views regarding these depositions are in this connection of rare interest. For instance, Sir. J. W. Dawson says of them: \" The deposits of the mammoth age, and it would seem of the reindeer age as well, are covered with beds of yellow earth, brick earth, and earth with angular stones, which ante- date the later stone age and bronze age. These deposits con- stitute the ordinary soil of the country, and at all levels, and they are evidently of the same nature with the superficial gravels, soils, and loess to be found resting on the pleistocene deposits everywhere in the northern hemisphere, and which have poured into the old caverns of the Palseocosmic age. They are not to be confounded with the ordinary glacial 48 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS deposits which in northern districts underlie them. They are not river deposits, because no possible extension of the river beds could overflow the places where they lie, or bring the stones from very distant localities which the gravels often contain. They prove as Howorth, the Duke of Argyll, and the writer have argued, that at the close of the Palseocosmic age a deluge of water swept over our continents and caused the physical break between the earlier and later human ages. This great cataclysm was preceded, in Europe at least, by a gradual refrigeration and a progressive extinction of the larger animals, and was followed by a diminished size of the continents, and by the advent over the depopulated sur- face of a more limited fauna and a new race of men. That it must have been this great cataclysm which has fixed itself in the traditions of all races of men as the historical deluge, we can scarcely doubt.\" 10 Before the facts of the stupendous work done in the ice ages were generally understood, certain phenomena which have since been attributed to this agency were given other interpretations. Thus the loess was called \" inundation mud,\" and perhaps the idea was not so very wrong after all. It was known to have covered much of Europe and of Asia, and inasmuch as G. Frederick Wright has found evidence of a very extensive recent submergence in this latter con- tinent, 11 the old idea gains new credence. The Duke of Argyll says: \" On the continent of Europe, too, we know that a large part of its central area is occupied by a formation (the ' loess ') which Lyell calls ' inundation mud,' and which he designates as the last and latest of all the great formations known to geology. The difficulty of accounting for it is proved by the number of theories which have been pro- 10 \" Modern Science in Bible Lands,\" chap, in, pp. 137-138. n American Geologist, vol. v, No. 3, p. 182. McClure's, June, 1901. PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 49 pounded. The shells in this formation are not fluviatile, nor are they lacustrine. On the other hand, they are not marine. They are terrestrial. They are land shells the shells of damp woods or morasses in short, of a land surface which has been covered with this ' inundation mud.' One possible explanation is obvious. The sea establishes its own forms of life where itself is established for any length of time. But if its invasion of any land area be not lasting, but temporary, it may fail to carry its mere dead shells over that area, whilst its living fauna would not have had time to grow.\" 12 Having outlined the powerful influence that the gravita- tional pull of the annular system exerted, it is next pur- posed, as set forth in the opening statement of this chapter, to show how these inundations and the climatic changes brought about by the canopy itself may be likened to a great annular time-clock, dividing the geological periods from each other. Every one knows that a geological clock would be a very convenient thing, an instrument that would assure the inves- tigator that the same time divisions were synchronous in all localities. It is manifest to a greater or less extent that such an instrument has existed throughout the geological ages. The present hypothesis reveals the clock, its work- ings, and the method by which we may ascertain the striking of the hours. It is a significant fact that even the subordinate groups of a formation are almost as definitely marked off in the same order, the world over, as the major terranes themselves. This is true not only of the stratagraphic arrangement, but also of the fossil content. Why, it might be asked, could not a migration have occurred backwards from one conti- nent to the other, the Silurian fauna being imposed upon the \"Article by Argyll in the Contemporary Review. i 50 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Devonian, for instance? Clearly there was some hindering and controlling cause that made the conditions nearly uni- form throughout the world, and there can be no doubt that even the minor subdivisions were practically synchronous or contemporaneous. The singular uniformity of the litho- logical record, moreover, indicates that this controlling cause was more than physical; it was material. It is postulated that a separate fall marked the end of each geological age, and to a lesser extent subsidiary falls punctuated each era, period, and epoch. These falls were not, generally speaking, catastrophic, but were gradual. Take that which marked the Ice age. Large quantities of snow and ice, no doubt, fell from the upper cloud belt itself. Not only must this fall have been long drawn out, but the result- ing glaciers also protracted the time by locking in their icy chain such hordes that the heat of centuries was not sufficient to melt them. In chapter three it was stated that it was possible that the earth's annular system was picked up from new sweepings derived from the cosmical dust of a minor or dark nebula into whose territory our solar system had plunged. It is established, however, from the evidence of the time clock, that our system has survived from the dawn of geo- logical phenomena. Following inevitable law, ring after ring has broken away from the equatorial system, has spread out and formed canopies, only to be eventually claimed by the earth. It follows from this order that between the fall of each separate ring there was probably a time of clear skies, except for the ribbon-like edge of the disks which spanned the zenith at the equator. The fact of these clear skies is very important to the present hypothesis because the existence of exogenous trees, growing by annular rings added to the outside, as early as Devonian time, proves the action of alternating seasons of summer and winter, and hence a solar climate. Again, PHYSICAL EFFECTS GEOLOGIC 51 since it is purposed to show that the last remnant of the ring system did not pass away until after civilized man appeared on the earth, it is necessary that he could have seen the clear sky, for otherwise the early records which he has left us would be violated, as they contain accurate descriptions of solar and stellar phenomena. In the American Geologist of February, 1904, 13 attention is called to a twisted form of stem exhibited by certain shallow-water monticuliporoids of the lower Silurian, which Sardeson interprets as possibly due to heliotropism, and hence an indication of direct sunlight. The article goes on to state that \" if these indications of early solar climate can be explained conformably with Mr. Manson's theory, or a modification of it, certainly a most serious obstacle will be overcome.\" Now, in our preface Manson's theory was men- tioned as a scientific presentation of an atmospheric cloud- canopy. Here where it is lacking, the hypothesis under con- sideration is strong. Open skies did exist for a large part of the time. Vol. xxxiii, No. 2, p. 120; vol. xxvii, p. 388. CHAPTER V PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC \" THE very limited number of generic forms that pass from one major formation to another is remarkable. Bar- rande enumerates but seven of the twenty-seven Cambrian genera which pass over into the Silurian, and twelve of the fifty-five Silurian genera which reappear in the Devonian. The Carboniferous genera are but three or four in number (Phillipsia, Griifithides, Brachymetopus, Proetus). Of the fifty-five Silurian genera, with three exceptions, all the forms are already represented in the lower division. The number of genera that extend through two or more formations is reduced to two or three (Phillipsia, Proetus).\" x Rutherford has aptly said : \" Since the different forms of life found in the successive geological strata indicate the stages of evolution, it is evident that the biological and geo- logical clock is the same, and that whatever time is required for the changes in the one science must be conceded by the other.\" 2 As a canopy fell a geological age ended, and with it its life conditions. In course of time a second and originally a higher ring descended, forming another canopy, with its resultant new world environment and with its new life con- ditions admitting of a higher order. These in turn gave way to similar falls and to successive marches of still other rings and canopies across the ephemeral sky. Thus the record is written, and the facts are for our investigation. In the succeeding chapters it is purposed to show that the new 1 Angelo Heilprin, \" The Geographical and Geological Distribution of Animals,\" International Scientific Series, pt. iii, chap, i, p. 277. 8 Harper's Monthly, Feb., 1905, p. 390. 52 PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 53 physical conditions introduced by annular phenomena are responsible for these deaths, and that they also are potent factors in causing the surviving species to mutate. Finally the geographical distribution of the flora and fauna will be shown to have taken place in accord with the new hypothesis. The fact of the imperfection of the geological and bio- logical record demonstrates the catastrophic nature of the end of the age changes. Had these occurred by gradual stages, the missing links would be wanting, that is, if life had developed along the lines of the Darwinian School. But there are missing links, as every one knows, and each one of these links means a catastrophe of some nature. Each succeeding geological age had its own development, which, though it was a continuation in part of the preceding age, nevertheless had distinctive peculiarities, due to climate, absorption of light and heat rays, weight of the atmosphere, etc. Probably also the waters were at times impregnated and the air vitiated. To begin with, as Darwin himself showed, the intervals that elapsed between consecutive formations were usually much longer than the formations themselves. Angelo Heil- prin says : \" It must be admitted that there are certain anomalies connected with the occurrence of breaks which have not thus far received an adequate explanation. Their broad distribution it might, indeed, almost be said univer- sality in equivalent periods of time, has long been noted as a surprising fact, and one that still remains in the nature of a puzzle to the geologist. Nowhere on the surface of the earth has there as yet been found a distinct connection between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic series of deposits, and only at a very few points (India, New Zealand, California) what may be considered to be an unequivocal link between the Mesozoic and Cainozoic series (Cretaceous and Tertiary).\" 3 \"The Geographical and Geological Distribution of Animals,\" p. 193. 54 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS This is as it should be, for only during a period of change were the forces of nature fully awakened, and the general character of these changes was the natural result of a shift or alteration in a system that environed the world. Sec- ondary results followed immediately, and these in turn fre- quently followed others. Thus the violent shifting of the oceanic waters as pictured in our last chapter must have induced sympathetic volcanic action. Illustrations of all kinds are plentiful. The Arctic mammoth luxuriating in polar pastures were overwhelmed suddenly and placed in cold storage with undigested food in the stomach. Elephant Point, Alaska, is famous as the locality where Kotzebue found remains of the fossil elephant, ox, and other mammals. Its bluffs are said to be composed of tough blue clay, light loose soil, bones, and solid ice. These cliffs are some- times fifty feet thick, and extend for two miles east and west. \" The smell of these ice cliffs,\" says Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, \" resembles that of a stable or something worse.\" \" The old Russians living in Siberia were of opinion that the mammoth was an animal of the same kind as the elephant, and that Siberia had been warmer before the Flood than now, and elephants had then lived in numbers there; that they had been drowned in the .Flood, and afterwards, when the climate became colder, had frozen in the river mud.\" 4 The question as to the origin of this graveyard is easily explained by the present hypothesis. Looking back at some of the early ages, the same record of sudden death confronts us. Even Lvell. who always tj / */ emphasized gradual development along ultra conservative lines, cannot help recognizing this feature. He says : \" It has been remarked, and truly, that many fish and saurians, found fossil in the Lias, must have met with sud- den death and immediate burial: and that the destructive 4 Nordenskjold, \"Voyage of the Vega,\" p. 305. PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 55 operation, whatever may have been its nature, was often repeated. \" ( Sometimes/ says Dr. Buckland, ' scarcely a single bone or scale has been removed from the place it occupied during life ; which could not have happened had the uncov- ered bodies of these saurians been left, even for a few hours, exposed to putrefaction, and to the attacks of fishes and other smaller animals at the bottom of the sea.' Not only are the skeletons of the Ichthyosaurs entire, but sometimes the contents of their stomachs still remain between their ribs, as before remarked, so that we can discover the particular species of fish on which they lived, and the form of their excrements. Not unfrequently there are layers of these coprolites, at different depths in the Lias, at a distance from any entire skeletons of the marine lizards from which they were derived ; ' as if/ says Sir H. de la Beche, ' the muddy bottom of the sea received small sudden accessions of matter from time to time, covering up the coprolites and other exuviaa which had accumulated during the intervals.' It is further stated that, at Lyme Regis, those surfaces only of the coprolites which lay uppermost at the bottom of the sea have suffered partial decay, from the action of water before they were covered and protected by the muddy sediment that has afterwards permanently enveloped them. \" Numerous specimens of the Calamary, or pen-and-ink fish (Geoteuthis bollensis), have also been met with in the Lias at Lyme, with the ink-bags still distended, containing the ink in a dried state, chiefly composed of carbon, and but slightly impregnated with carbonate of lime. These cephalo- poda, therefore, must, like the saurians, have been soon buried in sediment; for, if long exposed after death, the membrane containing the ink would have decayed.\" 5 5 Elements of Geo., pp. 362, 363. Bridgewater Treatise, p. 115. Geological Researches, p. 334. Buckland, Bridgewater Treatise, p. 307. 56 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Hugh Miller says : \" The river bull-head, when attacked by an enemy, or immediately as it feels the hook in its jaws, erects its two spines at nearly right angles with the plates of the head, as if to render itself as difficult of being swallowed as possible. The attitude is one of danger and alarm; and it is a curious fact * * * that in this attitude nine- tenths of the Pterichthys of the Lower Old Red Sandstone are found. We read in the stone a singularly preserved story of the strong instinctive love of life, and of the mingled fear and anger implanted for its preservation ' The champions in distorted postures threat. 7 It presents us, too, with a wonderful record of violent death falling at once, not on a few individuals, but on whole tribes.\" 6 Again, the above author describes a scene of death which suggests at once the agency of pollution from the fall of cosmical canopy dust. He says: \" At this period of our history, some terrible catastrophe involved in sudden destruction the fish of an area at least a hundred miles from boundary to boundary, perhaps much more. The same platform in Orkney as at Cromarty is strewed thick with remains, which exhibit unequivocally the marks of violent death. The figures are contorted, con- tracted, curved; the tail in many instances is bent round to the head ; the spines stick out ; the fins are spread to the full, as in fish that die in convulsions. The PterlchtJiys shows its arms extended at their stiffest angle, as if prepared for an enemy. The attitude of the ichthyolites on this platform are attitudes of fear, anger, and pain. The remains, too, appear to have suffered nothing from the after-attacks of predaceous fishes; none such seem to have survived. The record is one of destruction at once widely spread and total, so far as it extended. There are proofs that, whatever may have been the cause of the catastrophe, it must have taken \" Old Red Sandstone,\" chap, ii, p. 48. PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 57 place in a sea unusually still. The scales, when scattered by some slight undulation, are scattered to the distance of only a few inches, and still exhibit their enamel entire, and their peculiar fineness of edge. The spines, even when separated, retain their original needle-like sharpness of point. Rays well nigh as slender as horse-hairs are enclosed unbroken in the mass. Whole ichthyolites occur, in which not only all the parts survive, but even the expression which the stiff and threatening attitude conveyed when the last struggle was over. Destruction must have come in the calm, and it must have been of a kind by which the calm was nothing dis- turbed. In what could it have originated ? By what quiet but potent agency of destruction were the innumerable exist- ences of an area perhaps ten thousand square miles in extent annihilated at once, and yet the medium in which they had lived left undisturbed by its operations ? Conjecture lacks footing in grappling with the enigma, and expatiates in uncertainty over all the known phenomena of death. Dis- eases of mysterious origin break out at times in the animal kingdom, and well nigh exterminate the tribes on which they fall. The present generation has seen a hundred millions of the human family swept away by a disease unknown to our fathers. Virgil describes the fatal murrain that once depopulated the Alps, not more as a poet than as a historian. The shell-fish of the rivers of North America died in such vast abundance during a year of the present century, that the animals, washed out of their shells, lay rotting in masses beside the banks, infecting the very air. About the close of the last century, the haddock well nigh disappeared, for several seasons together, from the eastern coasts of Scotland ; and it is related by Creech that a Scotch shipmaster of the period sailed for several leagues on the coast of Norway, about the time the scarcity began, through a floating shoal of dead haddocks. But the ravages of no such disease, how- ever excessive, could well account for some of the phenomena 68 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS of this platform of death. It is rarely that disease falls equally on many different tribes at once, and never does it fall with instantaneous suddenness; whereas in the ruin of this platform from ten to twelve distinct genera seem to have been equally involved; and so suddenly did it perform its work that its victims were fixed in their first attitude of terror and surprise. I have observed, too, that groups of adjoining nodules are charged frequently with fragments of the same variety of ichthyolite; and the circumstance seems fraught with evidence regarding both the original habits of the creatures and the instantaneous suddenness of the destruc- tion by which they were overtaken. They seem, like many of our existing fish, to have been gregarious, and to have perished together ere their crowds had time to break up and disperse. \" Fish have been found floating dead in shoals beside submarine volcanoes killed either by the heated water or by mephitic gases. There are, however, no marks of volcanic activity in connection with the ichthyolite beds no marks, at least, which belong to nearly the same age with the fossils. The disturbing granite of the neighboring eminences was not upheaved until after the times of the Oolite. But the volcano, if such was the destroying agent, might have been distant; nay, from some of the points in an area of such immense extent, it must have been distant. The beds abound, as has been said, in lime; and the thought has often struck me that calcined lime, cast out as ashes from some distant crater, and carried by the winds, might have been the cause of the widely spread destruction to which their organisms testify. I have seen the fish of a small trouting stream, over which a bridge was in the course of building, destroyed in a single hour, for a full mile below the erection, by the few troughfuls of lime that fell into the water when the centring was removed.\" 7 , pp. 221-225. PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 59 It was stated above that during the periods of canopy change sympathetic earth movements occurred. James D. Dana illustrates this point in the following language: \" Prominent among the events influencing the rock-structure and life of a continent is that of mountain-making. The Appalachian Mountains stand as a grand time-boundary between the Paleozoic seon and the Mesozoic; and contem- poraneous orographic movements make a like limit in Euro- pean geology. Moreover, it was attended by the most re- markable of organic breaks. The Taconic Mountains mark the close of the Lower Silurian, an epoch of abrupt change in North America; and parallel disturbances occurred in Britain and Europe. The Laramide or post-Cretaceous mountain system along the Rocky Mountains is another such boundary for America, separating Mesozoic and Cenozoic time, though not as complete in the attendant organic break as in the physical. But it so happens that no corresponding event occurred at this time in Europe, the orographic move- ments most nearly synchronous taking place after the com- mencement of Cenozoic time. Nevertheless, the organic break at the close of the Cretaceous period is even greater for Europe than for America. Such a fact seems to show that there was some other catastrophic event concerned; but its nature is yet to be studied out.\" 8 Again Dana says : \" Paleozoic time is naturally divided into two sections at the break between the Lower and Upper Silurian. This boundary line is marked in the history by an epoch of mountain-making in eastern North America and western Europe, and by a somewhat abrupt transition in animal life of the seas.\" 9 We need not stop to point to the drift and meaning of all this testimony. In the last hundred years geology, like biology, has tossed from the cataclysms of Cuvier and his 'Manual of Geo., 4th ed., pt. iv, p. 406. 9 Ibid, p. 460. 60 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS geological revelations to the slow principle of the Doctrine of Uniformity as advocated by Sir Charles Lyell. The latter is antiquated, and at the present time the best thought of the age is swinging back under the leadership of Suess to recognize sudden transformations. The late Joseph Le Conte is one of those who have recog- nized the fact that \" the present condition of geological evi- dence is undoubtedly in favor of some degree of suddenness.\" He adds further on in the same work from which the above is cited : \"In the evolution of the organic kingdom, as in the evolution of the earth, in the evolution of society, in the evolution of the egg, in fact, as in all evolution, there have been periods of comparative quiet and periods of rapid change.\" 10 The doctrine of evolution by distinct and abrupt muta- tions, as advanced by De Vries, 11 which is now claiming the closest attention of the biological world, clearly recognizes this fact. The present hypothesis presents the causes which stimulated the individual or perhaps whole colonies to become mutants. Closely related to the suddenness is the fact of periodicity in the introduction of species. They come in by bursts or flood tides at particular points of time. These periods are followed and preceded by times of ebb in which little that is new is evolved. It is a significant fact that since the Glacial age no new species of mammal has originated. \" A great number of zoologists, botanists, and paleon- tologists are inclined to adopt this notion of sudden changes as consonant with the teachings of experience. We may cite in this connection the well-known argument of Agassiz. This celebrated naturalist called attention to the simultaneous appearance, in the first fossiliferous strata, of a mixed fauna 10 \" Keligion and Science,\" pp. 22, 25. \"Die Mutationstheorie, 1903. PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 61 comprising representations of all the grand divisions of the animal kingdom. This is shown in the Upper Silurian or Devonian horizon in which the vertebrates make their appear- ance in the form of fish. In the most ancient fauna, and that which has become known most recently (that of the Lower Silurian or Cambrian), all the grand divisions are still found, except that of vertebrates, each represented by quite high types. It is a question to be decided whether, lower down, in the sedimentary rocks hitherto considered as azoic, there is really a living population, more scattered, and reduced to the most rudimentary animals and plants that is to say, to protophytes and protozones, as appears from the researches of MM. Barrois, Bertrand, and Cayeux. Yet it is none the less certain that the very important remark of Agassiz is true, and that, in the Cambrian horizon, all the principal types appear simultaneously. We recognize here a sort of explosion of universal life. \" In consequence of this the transformists are obliged to admit that in the short space of time that corresponds to the deposit of the most ancient fossiliferous rocks the first living beings must have undergone all the evolutions neces- sary for passing from the state of a simple mass of proto- plasm to that of types characteristic of all the grand divi- sions, the vertebrates only excepted. We are authorized to conclude that the time during which the most ancient fos- siliferous rocks were deposited was short, because we can judge of it from their thickness, which is much inferior to that of the subsequent strata. Therefore, but a comparatively short space of time was required for the modifications by virtue of which the first living forms produced the principal grand divisions. The Lower Silurian epoch was one of rapid transformations, of active morphogenesis, of intensive muta- tions. If we wished to suppose that these were caused by the Darwinian mechanism of slow accumulations of minute variations, we would be obliged to throw back the origin of 62 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS life into an epoch inconceivably beyond the most ancient geologic epoch now known. \" In the same way, as other paleontologists have ob- served, among whom is Dr. Charles A. White, the extraor- dinary flora of the carboniferous epoch developed abruptly. We know nothing or but very little of the floras that pre- ceded it. Its appearance and its extinction were sudden. ''' We might multiply these remarks relative to the abrupt explosions of creation in living things. Here is another. The dinosaurian lizards that abounded throughout the sec- ondary epoch, forming, indeed, the dominant animal type, show an extreme variety taken from any point of view. There were some gigantic ones, like Brontosaurus, having a mass that was certainly equal to that of four or five ele- phants; others of small stature, not larger than a domestic fowl. The group included carnivora and herbivora, aquatic species and terrestrial species, quadrupeds, and bipeds quite similar to birds, except as to the faculty of flight. By the variety of their types of organization, they form, as aptly stated by Frederick A. Lucas, a sort of epitome of the class of reptiles. Now, their appearance and differentiation were com- paratively abrupt and sudden phenomena. It does not seem probable that they were formed by the mechanism of natural selection, and that they were destroyed because of their inferiority to other species in the struggle for existence. \" We arrive at similar conclusions from an examination of the first placental mammals. They appeared abruptly at the beginning of the Tertiary period ; they assumed a variety of forms almost as numerous as those of the mammals of to-day, and they finally disappeared.\" 12 L. P. Gratacap, in a paper on \" Biological Crises,\" says : \" Assuming a great age for this development [reference is to the faunal basins of the Lower Carboniferous], the expres- u A. Dastre, Article on the New Theory of the Origin of the Species, Scientific American Supplement, No. 1510. PHYSICAL EFFECTS BIOLOGIC 63 sion of suddenness is not unwarranted in referring to them. There is certainly slender suggestion in the Devonian of such large and opulent supplies of crinoidal life. The ' biological crisis ' they present is not simply apparent. It is real.\" 13 New species arise from an old stock, not by continuous and slow changes, but suddenly. The genius of evolution seems to be seeking that mystic cause ; the modifying effects of external circumstances due to the various phenomena con- nected with this belted canopy hypothesis rounds out the whole scheme. In a manner never dreamt of in the philosophy of Lamarck, physical conditions enter into the problem of evo- lution, evolving, as it were, a new evolution. As stated above, the present hypothesis presents the causes which stimulated the individual, or perhaps whole colonies, to become mutants. According to De Yries' hypothesis, the degree of muta- bility is dependent upon external life conditions. Our new hypothesis presents the greatest variety of these. As each canopy overspread the earth, the whole environment was changed. Climate was changed and food supply. The qual- ity of the light was altered. Absorption of the red rays of the solar spectrum took place. The content of the air and its density were altered. The pull of gravity from above caused a loss of weight. Waters were impregnated. Sym- pathetic volcanic action caused by the disarrangement of the tidal uplift occurred. Land connections or land bridges in the polar regions partially laid bare by the rush of waters towards the equator facilitated geographical migration, etc., etc. All these and many more disturbances went to make up quite a budget of altered external conditions. These produced great changes in life already existent, and when a canopy system fell, extermination in whole or in part, and readap- 18 American Geologist, vol. xxviii, No. 4, p. 234. 64 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS tation of the survivors, followed. Mutation under such con- ditions was necessary; it meant natural preservation. In this way the single steps of evolution were brought about. The survival of the fittest meant the survival of those indi- viduals or species best fitted to adapt themselves to the new conditions. Evolution is at a comparative standstill since the Glacial age, for the reason that physical nature has been in a like quiescent state. CHAPTER VI DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND OTHER PHYSICAL PHENOMENA LAM ABC K gives the following as a definition of species: \" A species is a collection of similar individuals which are perpetuated by generation in the same condition as long as their environment has not changed sufficiently to bring about variation in their habits, their character, and their forms.\" Herbert Spencer says : \" The direct action of the medium was the primordial factor of organic evolution.\" The botanist Sachs asserts : \" A far greater portion of the phenomena of life is called forth by external influences than one formerly ventured to assume. Every phenomenon of life arises from two factors : on the one hand from the structure transmitted from the mother organism, and on the other from external forces working on this structure.\" This truth is aptly illustrated by the following experi- ment : If a radium tube of proper strength be suspended in water containing tadpoles, this first stage of the common frog is prolonged, but eccentricities of growth occur and monsters are produced. 1 Another striking demonstration is found in the external anatomy of the celebrated trout which was introduced into New Zealand. In this case the number of pyloric appendages about the stomach augmented rapidly, and even the form and the size of the animal changed. This all took place quickly, and it shows the potent effects of environment. When Nature is stimulated by sufficient causes it is capable of transforming animals, we might say, suddenly. 1 Robert H. Bradbury, \"Radium and Radio- Activity in General,\" The Franklin Institute Journal, vol. clix, No. 3, March, 1905. 5 65 66 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS But in this age Nature is not stimulated to this degree, hence it is an age of quiescence. Yet this is the age which, according to the Doctrine of Uniformity, should show the greatest changes, for it is an age of complex organisms. The possibilities for a complex or old form to undergo changes cannot be questioned. The complex is more easily deranged than the simple. Why, then, do forms not change in this present age ? Plainly, Nature is not stimulated by sufficient causes. It will not do to say that variation was at one time more active with each species because forms were younger. In fact, such an argument only strengthens our position, for the above reasoning shows us that the further we get away from simple forms, the greater are the varieties, hence, plainly, the causes which stimulated Nature when she was young must have been very pronounced. Natural selection is always ready to make use of adapted variations. Thus, the gull fed on corn will develop a gizzard. The wild duck when tamed will differ from the same species in the length of wing. The green frogs taken from the forest and placed in colorless surroundings become sombre gray. But these examples do not become \" fixed \" that is, their biological associations have not been sufficiently changed to cause them to develop into new animals and the sombre frog replaced in the bright green foliage soon regains his former color. Changes resulting from age-producing canopy falls were of a more serious and permanent character. Nature apparently has some pretty large blanks, and it must have taken correspondingly great physical changes to bridge these chasms. The present hypothesis reveals the most powerful physical agencies ever dreamt of in the philos- ophy of man, therefore it is best fitted to cope with the conditions. James D. Dana says, speaking of these blanks : \" One of these is the apparently sudden appearance of DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE 67 plants of the tribe of Angiosperms, the most common kind of Kecent time, in the Lower Cretaceous ; another, the still more remarkably abrupt introduction of ordinary or placental Mammals as successors to the Marsupials at the commence- ment of the Tertiary; another, the introduction of well- characterized Fishes, without the discovery of their pre- cursors.\" 2 Such gaps are of course every day being lessened by the discoveries of intermediate links, but if correctly balanced, there is still a very wide interval in the chain of life that physical environment alone can account for. Again, the destruction of vast horizons at the end of the ages speaks volumes. Dana describes the fact in these words : \" This sweeping from the world of so large a part of its life, and especially that of Mesozoic characteristics, was a much-needed preparation for the era of the ' Reign of Mam- mals.' It was an opportunity for the ' survival of the fittest ' on a grand scale ; that is, the survival of those species that could withstand the special causes of destruction, and of the many that were out of harm's way. The exterminations were the removals of hindrances to progress. The survival of the fittest and of the lucky ones, while not directly species- making, was the origin of new associations in continental and oceanic life ; that is, of new faunas and new floras over the world, in which, under the modified geographical and physical conditions, the elements existed for further change and progress,\" 3 One of the potent physical changes which would have caused a general extermination at the end of an age would have been a fluctuation in the density of the atmosphere. It has been facetiously said that the Dinosaur of the species of Triceratops died of its big head. Many a true word has been spoken in jest, and this is not one of the least of the 2 Manual of Geology, 4th ed., p. 1031. 8 Ibid., p. 878. 68 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS many. \" A head of one of these has been found more than six feet long and four feet wide, and another over eight feet long.' 7 4 Every skeleton is the solution of a problem in mechanics, to wit, the problem of carrying a given weight and of adaptation to a given mode of life. Thus often a variation in condition has proved fatal to a whole race. Elephas ganesa, a species of mammoth found in Pliocene deposits of the Sidwalik Hills, India, had tusks twelve feet nine inches long and two feet two inches in circumference. It is a mystery how these animals ever carried them, owing to their enormous size and leverage. Another one of the creatures that came to its end through its big head was Dinotherium giganteum. This animal was of elephantine proportions, and lived in the Miocene. It was characterized by an enormous head, over six feet long, and unquestionably it labored under great mechanical dis- advantage in lifting its immense weight in the process of mastication. It can be seen, then, how any change in the density of the atmosphere directly influenced its chances in the struggle for life. Again, such great and necessarily sluggish brutes as Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, with their tons of flesh to carry, and their small heads and feeble teeth, were obviously reared in circumstances that must have been easy for them, as they were unfitted to serve in any strenuous struggle for existence. The peculiar make-up of these animals has a meaning that may now be understood. The great ground sloths, the Mylodons, Megatheres, and their allies, are another case in point; they became extinct when the conditions changed. These are only instances taken at random. Geology reveals the fact that in the past our earth has been peopled with huge creatures. Plant life also was very different then 4 Le Conte, Geo., 5th ed., p. 518. DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE 69 from now. Grasses and ferns were as large as our trees. Everything was so gigantic that plant and animal life seemed fairly to vie with each other in the production of monstrous growths. There was a reason for all this. Was it not the greater density of the atmosphere ? Geologists say that dur- ing certain ages, especially the Carboniferous, the air was very heavy and excessively damp. But why was it heavy and damp? Explanations are not necessary. It is understood that the belts as they descended formed canopies which in turn pressed downward on the upper air, materially increasing the density and weight of the atmosphere itself. One of the secondary results was that oxygenation was freer. A candle burns brighter in a condensed atmosphere, as seen in the caissons where the laborer works under pressure. The effect of all this upon life was to foster gigantic growths. 5 The increased buoyant power of the atmosphere was also derived from another cause, to wit: In opposition to ter- restrial gravity the contrary attraction of the annular system diminished the weight in a notable proportion. There must have been a zone where bodies were attracted equally from above and below. It has been claimed that since the fossil impress of rain- drops in the past geological ages are such as would be made by our modern storms, therefore the atmosphere of these periods must have been of a like density to our own. This argument seems to overlook the increased buoyancy. Prob- ably these drops were heavier and therefore had a greater penetrating power, yet on the whole why should we say this ? There was nothing in the conditions to cause their form to differ radically from those of to-day, and if they were heavier the increased buoyancy of the atmosphere would have neutralized the results. '\"Alpha and Omega,\" pp. 144, 145. 70 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS The increased buoyancy must have been specially favor- able at times to large bird and insect life, and the conditions in general to a cryptogamic and gymnospermous flora. But these same conditions must have been alike adverse to the well-being of the higher order of flowering plants, and of the quick-breathing animals. Of course birds come under this last capitation, but the winged denizens of the air in the early paleontologic ages were of a different character from their posterity, and then it must not be forgotten that during certain geological periods the condensed oxygen of the atmos- phere took the place of the miasmatic influence of other periods. The dragons of the air which soared in ancient times, like the Roc of Arabian romance, were not able to survive the changes, which were to them of vital moment. Ptero- dactyles, computed to have had a spread of wing of over twenty feet, perished in great numbers. Their battered and broken bones are found in the graveyard of the rocks. \" At least two Pterodactyles are found in the Oxford clay, known from more or less fragmentary remains or isolated bones; just as they occur in the Kimeridge clay, Purbeck limestone, Wealden sandstones, and especially in newer Secondary rocks, named Gault, Upper GTreensand, and Chalk, in the southeast of England.'' 6 A thousand of these bones taken from the Cambridge Greensand are now in the Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge. Seeley draws attention to the fact that these were mostly all gathered dur- ing two or three years. This gives us some idea of their abundance in the days when their outstretched pinions enabled them to seek the air for their safety. But how long did this safety endure ? When the canopy disintegrated the atmosphere was released from the superincumbent burden and the sustaining power e H. G. Seeley, \" Dragons of the Air,\" p. 33. DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE 71 of the air was gone. 7 Thus the chapter of these great birds was closed forever. The ostrich and the recently extinct moas of New Zealand are survivors of a late annular or canopy fall that have been able to adapt themselves to a terrestrial existence. Deprived of their power of flight, they have become the fleet-footed creature which \" scorneth the horse and his rider.\" Nature flung away the wings, as she always does with every part of a skeleton which is not vital. In New Zealand the skeleton of the Dinornis ele- phantopus from the Post-Pliocene, and in Madagascar the bones of another huge wingless bird, the ^Epiornis maximus, are but instances taken at random, which show how this class of beings existed for a time and then perished. Nature changed their organisms, but as the altered conditions of Kfe were too radical, she could not save them from ultimate extinction. The great size of some of the Devonian and Carbonifer- ous insects is another indication of the denser atmosphere. Dana says : \" A spread of wing exceeding two feet is a size now existing only in large bats and birds.\" 8 The infer- ence is obvious. The consensus of geological opinion is that the atmos- phere must originally have differed in its constituents from its present condition. Planetesimal dust and gaseous emana- tions entering the air belt would largely account for this phenomenon. Canopy formation and decline produced at different times and in different ways divers conditions. These conditions are at the root of the process of evolution. De Vries' theory is the key; the lock in which it turns is set forth in this present hypothesis. Little and great physi- cal differences, little and great changes, simply meant adap- tion, adjustment, or extinction. 7 A calamity of this nature appears from the evidence to have oc- curred in the Cretaceous era of Mesozoic time. \"Manual of Geo., 4th ed., p. 721. 72 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS As an illustration of the influence of a very slight change in the atmospheric content, it is remarked that ferns and monocotyledons are scarce in comparison with dicotyledons in the Rocky Mountains. Dryness and rarity of the atmos- phere, less pressure, heat, and carbon dioxide, being the assigned cause. An important result of Langley's bolometric investiga- tion is the discovery that the earth's atmosphere exerts a selective absorption to a remarkable degree, keeping back an immense proportion of blue and green. It is postulated that our atmosphere has varied a great deal in the past, and so must have exerted a great effect on the flora and fauna of these bygone ages. The fact is, the unveiled sun is blue. 9 Our atmosphere now stops the shortest wave-lengths, the ultra-violet, and it is said that scarcely sixty per cent, of the solar rays penetrate to the earth's surface. Has it always been so ? Probably yea, we can almost say with certainty there have been ages in the past when the selective absorption was even more pronounced than now. The spectra of Saturn, and Jupiter show the distinctive dark line in the red (wave-length 618). This is an unmis- takable indication of aqueous absorption. 10 Tyndall says that, \" regarding the earth as a source of heat, I estimate that at. least 10 per cent, of its heat is intercepted within ten feet of the surface. This single fact suggests the enor- mous influence which this newly-developed property of aque- ous vapor must have in the phenomena of meteorology.\" n Experiments have been made at the laboratory in the Catacombs on the effect of darkness upon animals. The crustaceans ( Gammarus Huviatilis) changed as follows : The gray pigment disappeared entirely. The organs of 9 A. M. Clerke, \" History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Cen- tury,\" 3d ed., pt. ii, chap, v, p. 278. 10 Ibid., pt. ii, chap, viii, p. 368. 11 \" Heat a Mode of Motion,\" 6th ed., Lect. xiii, pp. 380-381. DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE 73 smell, touch, and taste showed a marked hypertrophy at the end of a few months, and their length increased gradually until their dimensions tripled. Again, in the aquarium building in the Jardin des Plantes just over the laboratory in the Catacombs, experiments were made of a reverse nature, and the Proteus commenced to assume a color; at first this was light, but it ended in a violet black, with occasional small yellow patches. 12 Most of the dinosaurs, owing to their great eye-sockets, are thought to have had nocturnal habits, yet possibly this was a result of physical conditions. The Reptilian age may have been characterized by a dense dark canopy that admitted the passage of only a little light. The flora of the period also points to this conclusion. Instances such as these could be added indefinitely, but all that is required is to show that variation in the quality and quantity of light would have exerted a great influence on life in general. It may be well to add that at times of darkness, like the ones we have just pictured, open zones existed at the poles, where no doubt certain species that could not have existed without light sur- vived the ordeal. Clouds are more translucent than transcalent, hence light rays, in the days of the canopy, reached the earth's surface to a far greater degree than the heat rays, though those which did come through were boxed in, as it were, since radiation into space was largely intercepted. Thus to a great extent there was a complete reversal of present conditions. The effects of heat and cold on the process of evolution cannot be questioned; however, a few illustrations will not be out of place. \" It has been suspected,\" says the Scientific American, \"that temperature changes and new environments might have something to do with the origin of species, and the experiment has been tried of breeding butterflies at various 32 Scientific American, vol. xc, No. 17. 74 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS degrees of heat. Dr. M. Standfuss, of Zurich, has done some very extensive work along this line, producing arctic and tropical varieties as well as intermediate forms by raising the butterflies in heated or cooled boxes. It is claimed that butterflies thus reared are not fixed species and will not breed true. In one case, however, Standfuss has apparently succeeded in obtaining a fixed species by this treatment.\" 13 Another article in a later number of the same paper contains the following notice : \" Prof. Max Standfuss has for years been propagating butterflies and moths under arti- ficial temperature conditions. He has taken the eggs of middle European moths, for example, and bred them at very low temperatures, and obtained varieties of that same middle European moth found only in Arctic regions. Similarly, eggs of the middle European moths, hatched at very high temperatures, produce varieties that are to be found only in tropical countries. Furthermore, by changing the tempera- tures he has obtained varieties which have existed but are now extinct.' 7 14 Climatic influences may have also been largely aided in their work by secondary causes. Thus it is well known that the gorilla does not thrive when removed from his native miasmatic swamps. The effluvia of decaying vegetation and the humid reeking atmosphere seem necessary to his very existence. Again, in certain localities in our American tropics a rich gray moss is found growing luxuriously; it is an aerial plant, and yet it does not thrive if removed into a region of pure air; indeed, it seems to imbibe something from the surrounding swamps. It is not carbonic acid gas, the chief food of plants, nor is it nitrogen; all we know is that the element which this plant requires is found in that murky atmosphere, and that it is deadly to human life. Moisture and heat alone will not account for it. 13 Vol. xcv, No. 10, Sept. 8, 1906. 14 Ibid., vol. xcv, No. 15, Oct. 13, 1906. CHAPTER VII VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE ALL who possess any knowledge whatever of geology know that in the past eras meteorological conditions differed radically from those extant. However, as this work is for the general reader as well as the specialist, and as all have not been schooled in the workings of nature, a few facts relative to what is really known of the past climates will be in order. Consideration of these same facts naturally stimulates the mind to inquire as to the cause of these won- derful variations, and every little detail that helps is wel- comed. Thus, even though the hypothesis that the earth has cooled from a molten condition is thoroughly discredited, it would seem natural if the records of the past showed that from age to age the climate was gradually cooling, for the planetesimal hypothesis, now generally accepted, postulates a condition of heat brought about by gravitational settling. Probably, however, this was in the remote 'days before geological time dawned, for the fact remains, the records of the science do not show this gradual cooling. While it is not purposed to arrange the quotations which follow in their geological sequence, still they may be read with this point in mind. The reader's attention is called to the fact that glacial ages frequently followed periods of luxuriant growth. James D. Dana says : \" Using the facts from the rela- tions of existing plants to climate that Ferns and Lycopods thrive best in tropical and temperate latitudes, and Equiseta in temperate it is inferred from the occurrence of coal- plants of each of these groups in all latitudes to the Arctic regions that the climate of the globe in the Carbonic era was nowhere colder than the modern temperate zone, or 75 76 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS below a mean temperature of 60 F. Similarly, the occur- rence in Spitzbergen of Corals of the genera Ltthostrotion, Cyathophyttunij and Syringopora, and of some species of Brachiopods of twice the size they have in Europe, seems to show that the waters of the ocean were equally temperate throughout. As to excessive heat in the tropics, we have no evidence, since the common Carboniferous Brachiopods, Productus semireticulaius, P. longispinus, Athyris subtilita, and a Bellerophon near B. Urii, are found in the Bolivian Andes.\" * Again, our author states : \" During the Cretaceous period a warm climate still prevailed over the earth even to the poles, but with some cooling during the closing part of the period; and in North America with a great Central Interior Sea, to the end of the period, the climate- was moist. The Cycads and associated species of plants, in the lower Cretaceous beds of Greenland indicate, according to Heer, a mean temperature of 21 C. to 22 C., or about 70 F. to 72 F. This temperature is that of Cuba. The facts prove that a somewhat similar temperature prevailed at the same time over Spitzbergen and Alaska, where the same flora existed; even along the Atlantic border, at least as far north as Long Island; in the region of the Kootanie beds in Montana, and the neighboring part of British America; and over more western North America to Alaska.\" 2 Professor Arthur Lake's testimony may be added as follows : \" The recent discoveries of fields of lignitic and bituminous coal in Alaska, besides their great economic importance in that partially treeless and much besnowed region, point to some well-known and interesting geological facts ; viz., that there were periods in the world's history when, instead of the present ice cap and treelessness, the Arctics 1 Manual of Geo., 4th ed., p. 711. *IUd., p. 872. VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 77 were a region clad with a luxuriant, temperate, if not tropical, vegetation, and enjoying a temperate, if not a warm, climate. There may or may not have been an open Polar sea, but it needed no Arctic hardships to explore it, and there certainly was no ice cap.\" 3 T. C. Chamberlin says : \" It appears necessary now to accept as demonstrative the evidences of extensive glacia- tion in India, Australia, and South Africa in the midst of the later coal-forming stages of the Paleozoic era. The glacial beds lie even between coal beds of Permian or Permo- Carboniferous age; while, strangely enough, the areas of glaciation approach, and even overlap, the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. And yet figs and magnolias have grown in Greenland since, and mild polar climates are as well authen- ticated after as before this climacteric glaciation. Less com- plete evidences from China and Norway imply a very much earlier glaciation, falling in the oldest Cambrian, or perhaps even pre-Cambrian, times. Still more recently, similar evidences of early Paleozoic glaciation in South Africa have been announced. \" The climatic student seems therefore compelled to face oscillations within the known geologic periods, ranging from sub-tropical congeniality within the polar circles, on the one hand, to glacial conditions in low latitudes, on the other, and these in alternating succession; while neither of these oscillations was permitted to swim across the narrow limital lines of organic endurance.\" 4 Again turning to Professor Dana, we find that \" the cold that followed the Champlain period, or that of the Reindeer era of Lartet, appears to have brought destruction among the northern tribes of Europe and Asia, and, at the same time, to have driven southward the more active sur- 8 \" Mines and Minerals,\" vol. xxvi, No. 9, p. 401. 4 Journal of Geology, vol. xiv, No. 5, p. 366. 78 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS vivors, or those which had the best chance for escape. The encasing in ice of huge Elephants, and the perfect preserva- tion of the flesh, shows that the cold finally became suddenly extreme, as of a single winter's night, and knew no relenting afterward. The existence of remains of the Reindeer in southern France, of the Marmot, also a northern species, and of the Ibex and Chamois, now Alpine species, is at- tributed by Lartet to the forced migration thus occasioned. In the caves of Perigord (Dordogne, etc.) the bones of the Reindeer, far the most abundant kind, lie along with those of the Cave Hyena, Cave Bear, Cave Lion, Elephant, and Rhinoceros, as well as Horse and Aurochs.\" 5 In the Monograph on the Geology of the Narragansett Basin the following remarks are made by the authors: \" We may first note that the deposits formed during the times represented by the conglomerates of the Carboniferous series have a character which warrants the hypothesis that they are to a considerable extent the products of glacial action. * * * \"Although there are instances in which a torrent may accumulate a large detrital cone composed of boulders and pebbles, I know of no geological machinery now at work on the earth's surface, or which can reasonably be supposed to have operated in the past, except glaciation, that is competent to produce such immense masses of coarse detritus as are contained in these conglomerates, or bring them into position where water action can effect their arrangement into beds. The area of the deposits lying on the two sides of the old Appalachian axis probably now exceeds 60,000 square miles ; the average thickness of the section is certainly not less than 2,500 feet; so that the amount of matter of a prevailingly coarse nature which was laid down along the old Appalachian ridge in a period apparently of no great duration was not 5 Man. of Geo., 4th ed., pp. 1007, 1008. VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 79 less than 20,000 cubic miles, and probably was far more than that amount. * * * \" It should be noted that the pebbles of the Carboniferous conglomerates, especially in the Narragansett district, show no trace of glacial scratches; moreover, they generally have a rather rounded form and are of less varied size than those in any of the till deposits formed during the last Glacial period. In some cases, however, they seem to me to retain the faceted shape which is so characteristic of ice-made pebbles. When compared with the pebbles of the last Glacial period, which, in a measure, have been subjected to marine or stream action, they are found to correspond with them in all essential features, except when, as is often the case, the old fragments have been deformed by stresses which came upon them since they were built into the Carboniferous strata. * * * \" In no way save by glacial work does it seem to me possible to account for the rapid formation of the great mass of pebbly detritus which is contained in these beds. It therefore may fairly be held that the Carboniferous period, in this district at least, was one of extensive and long-con- tinued glacial action, and that the greater part of the section exhibited in the basin is made up of rocks which owe their more important features to the action of glaciation.\" 6 Ernest H. L. Schwartz, who made a geological survey of Cape Colony in 1896, says: \" \"No matter how good the specimens of glaciated boulders and the photographs of ice- scored floors, that came home from India, Australia, or South Africa, no one would believe in the Permian Ice age. I was myself skeptical when I first came to South Africa, and at a meeting in Cape Town, when some of the glaciated Dwyka Conglomerate pebbles were exhibited, assisted in recording the belief that there was in these scratches no satisfactory evidence of ice-action. * ' Mono, xxxiii, pp. 64-67. 80 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" In the field it is different ; there the evidence is over- whelming, as I was soon to see when I joined the Geological Survey. * * * \" The Dwyka Conglomerate, and its equivalent in Aus- tralia and India, is too well known now to require description here, but I have introduced the account of the part which Mr. Rogers and myself played in the elucidation of the problem in order to show the credentials with which we offer evidence of two more glacial periods in South Africa. The evidence of each was discovered by Mr. Rogers ; the evidence of one, probably Devonian in age, I have examined in the field; the other is probably Archean, and although I have not seen the glacial beds in place, the specimens which Mr. Rogers has sent me form ample material for confirming his interpretation. * * * \" At some future date it will perhaps be established that there is a rhythmic recurrence of glacial conditions in sub- tropical and even tropical countries, and we shall be able to date the rock strata according to the positions of these tills. In Australia they have two the Permian or Carbo-Permian, and the so-called Cambrian one, which is, at any rate, older than the Ordovician, and possibly Algonkian. We have three in South Africa, the oldest of which may be equivalent to the older of the two Australian ones. * * * \" Sir Andrew Ramsay's evidence as to the European Paleozoic Ice age, and the character of the striations on the stones, is admitted, even by those who do not accept his explanation, to be strongly suggestive.\" 7 Alexander Winchell records like facts in the following. He says: \" Some of the most salient phenomena attributed to the reign of glacier ice are smoothed and striated rock- surfaces, and accumulations of rounded pebbles. Precisely these phenomena have been detected among the rocks of re- ' Journal of Geology, vol. xiv, No. 8, pp. 683, 684, 689, 690, VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 81 moter ages of the world's history. More than thirty years ago the New York geologists called attention to the smoothed surfaces of the Medina Sandstone in the western part of that State. They did not then dare to utter the conjecture that these are glaciated surfaces; though recent opinion strongly inclines in that direction. Foreign geologists have made similar observations in numerous other formations. In the Miocene System, that vast Swiss formation known as the Molasse, seems to be but an older bed of glacier pebbles, extremely similar to those accumulated upon the existing surface along the slopes and flanks of the Alps.\" 8 Le Conte states : \" The Permo-Carbonif erous of Aus- tralia, India, South Africa, and Brazil all contain enormous glacial deposits and other evidences of glaciation. Appar- ently Permian glaciation was on a vaster scale than that of the Pleistocene in the northern hemisphere.\" 9 He also says, speaking of the late period : \" Of alternations of colder and warmer periods during the Glacial epoch there are evidences both in Europe and America.\" 10 Again William North Rice says : \" The Quaternary period, instead of being brief and comparatively simple, has been shown to be of long duration and great complexity. It has been analyzed into a succession of glacial and inter- glacial epochs; and, from the vast amount of erosion in some of the inter-glacial epochs, it has been inferred that post- Glacial time is very short in comparison with inter-Glacial time.\" n The flora and fauna of a region show how the climate has changed ; thus G. Frederick Wright says : \" On both continents, at the close of the Tertiary period, there occurred a remarkable extinction of animals which is doubtless con- 8 \" Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer,\" 3d ed., pp. 177-178. 9 Geo., 5th ed., p. 430. 10 Ibid., p. 615. 11 Scientific American Supplement, No. 1648. 6 82 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS nected with the advance of the continental ice-sheet. Among these we may mention two species of the cat family as large as lions ; four species of the dog family, some of them larger than wolves; two species of bears; a walrus, found in Vir- ginia ; three species of dolphins found in the Eastern States ; two species of the sea-cow, found in Florida and South Caro- lina; six species of the horse; the existing South American tapir ; a species of the South American llama ; a camel ; two species of bison; three species of sheep; two species of ele- phants and two of mastodons; a species of Megatherium, three of Megalonyx, and one of Mylodon huge terrestrial sloths as large as the rhinoceros, or even as large as elephants, which ranged over the Southern States to Pennsylvania, and the Mylodon as far as the Great Lakes and Oregon. \" This wondrous assemblage of animals became extinct upon the approach of the Glacial period, as their remains are all found in post-Pliocene deposits. The intermingling of forms is remarkable.\" 12 Alexander Winchell tells us that \" it is impossible to refrain from speculating on the nature of the events which resulted in the burial of entire mammoths in glacier-ice. That the climate in which they had lived was not tropical, like that of Africa or India, may be regarded as proved by the presence of the fur in which these animals were clothed. That it was not similar to the existing climate of northern Siberia is apparent from the consideration that such a climate would not yield the requisite supply of vegetation to sustain their existence. More especially would forest vegetation be wanting, which seems to have been designed as the main reliance for proboscidians. Northern Siberia must, therefore,' have possessed a temperate climate.\" 13 \"\"The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 386. \"The Geo- graphical Distribution of Animals,\" vol. i, p. 129. 11 \"Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer,\" 3d ed., pp. 243-244. VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 83 On the same line as all this testimony the great Agassiz has left the following record : \" It is my belief/' he says, \" founded upon the tropical character of the Fauna, that a much milder climate then prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere than is now known to it. Some naturalists have supposed that the presence of the tropical Mammalia in the Northern Temperate Zone might be otherwise accounted for, that they might have been endowed with warmer covering, with thicker hair or fur. But I think the simpler and more natural reason for their existence throughout the North is to be found in the difference of climate ; and I am the more inclined to this opinion because the Tertiary animals gener- ally, the Fishes, Shells, etc., in the same regions, are more closely allied in character to those now living in the Tropics than to those of the Temperate Zones. The Tertiary age may be called the geological summer ; we shall see, hereafter, how abruptly it was brought to a close. * * * \" The long summer was over. For ages a tropical climate had prevailed over a great part of the earth, and animals whose home is now beneath the Equator roamed over the world from the far south to the very borders of the Arctics. The gigantic quadrupeds, the Mastodons, Elephants, Tigers, Lions, Hyenas, Bears, whose remains are found in Europe from its southern promontories to the northernmost limits of Siberia and Scandinavia, and in America from the Southern States to Greenland and the Melville Islands, may indeed be said to have possessed the earth in those days. But their reign was over. A sudden intense winter, that was also to last for ages, fell upon the globe; it spread over the very countries where these tropical animals had their homes, and so suddenly did it come upon them that they were embalmed beneath masses of snow and ice, without time even for the decay which follows death.\" 14 \"\"Geological Sketches,\" pp. 205-206, 208. 84 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Professor Wright quotes from the Scientific Papers of Asa Gray 15 and records his own views of the past climatic conditions in the far north as follows: \" Geologically the coal beds of Greenland are much later than the Carboniferous period. The accompanying plants indicate that some of them belong to the Upper Cretaceous and others to the Middle Tertiary (Miocene). * * * \" The Tertiary beds in this region bear striking witness to the changes of climate which the region has experienced, and to the fact that there is a lineal connection between the present flora of the north temperate zone and the ancient arctic flora of Greenland. During the middle portion of the Tertiary period the climate of north Greenland corresponded closely with that which now exists in Virginia and North Carolina. As enumerated by Asa Gray, the familiar plants found in these beds comprise ' magnolias, sassafras, hickories, gum trees, our identical southern cypress (for all we can see of difference), and especially sequoias not only the two which obviously answer to the two big trees now peculiar to California, but several others; they equally comprise trees now peculiar to Japan and China three kinds of gingko trees, for instance, one of them not evidently distinguishable from the Japan species which alone survives. We have evi- dence not merely of pines and maples, birches, lindens, and whatever characterize the temperate-zone forests of our era, but also of particular species of these so like those of our own time and country that we may fairly reckon them as ancestors of several of ours.' \" 16 Sir Archibald Geikie's testimony of the vicissitudes of climate is that \" in Europe and North America a tolerably sharp demarcation can usually be made between the Pliocene formations and those now to be described. The Crag deposits 15 Vol. ii, p. 227. \"Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" pp. 113-114. VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 85 of the southeast of England, as we have seen, show traces of a gradual lowering of the temperature during later Pliocene times, and the same fact is indicated by the Pliocene fauna and flora on the Continent even in the Mediterranean basin. This change of climate continued until at last thoroughly Arctic conditions prevailed, under which the oldest of the Post-Tertiary or Pleistocene deposits were accumulated in northern and central Europe, and in Canada and the northern part of the United States.\" 17 In a foot-note the same author remarks : \" That a glacial period occurred at the close of the Cretaceous period, again at the end of the Eocene and in the Miocene (erratics of Superga, near Turin), has been regarded by some geologists as probable.\" ls Chamberlin and Salisbury tell us that : \" In the upper division of the Old Red sandstone of Great Britain there are conglomerates of such a character as to have raised a question concerning the existence of glaciers in this region in Devonian times. The conglomerates contain boulders of all sizes, up to eight feet in diameter. While the smaller stones are usually well worn, the larger ones are often distinctly subangular. All sorts of durable rock are represented. The large boulders seem not to have come in from distant regions, but some of the smaller stones may have come from greater distances, since no local source for them is known. Further- more, some of the boulders are said to be striated, and it is believed by some geologists at least that the strisG are glacial. The matrix of the conglomerate is in keeping with the hypothesis that ice cooperated in its making. It has been suggested that the Highlands of Scotland were then much higher than now, that they harbored glaciers, and that the \"Text Book of Geo., 3d. ed., pp. 1023-1024. Ibid., note 3, p. 979. A.

The conglomerate is to be seen in the Lammermuir Hills, and in the Silurian hills of Cumberland and Westmoreland, in northern England.\" 19 Heat and cold certainly seem to have followed each other very closely. The same authors say : \" Taking the phe- nomena of India, Australia, and South Africa together, they make a puzzling combination. If the chief coal-beds be re- ferred to the Carboniferous proper, it introduces glacial beds, and a great floral break, into the midst of a system which has usually been held to be marked by great uniformity the world over.\" 20 Again, these authors say : a Unwilling as geologists were to believe that there was a glacial period at this early stage of the earth's history, the evidence now in hand is over- whelming, and a glacial period in Australia in the late Carboniferous or Permian period must be regarded as a demonstrated fact.\" * * * The recurrence of the boulder beds points to the repeated recurrence of glacial conditions, and the great thickness both of clastic beds and of the in- cluded coal point to the great duration of the period through which the several glacial epochs were distributed. \" These remarkable phenomena are not local. Counting Tasmania, where glacial deposits are also found, the Paleo- zoic glaciation of Australia had a known range of nearly 22 in latitude (42 in Tasmania to 20 30' in Queensland), and about 35 in longitude (west from 137 30'), though it is not known, nor perhaps probable, that all the area within these limits was glaciated. On the other hand, it is not to be understood that the phenomena here described are re- stricted to high altitudes; rather are they known chiefly at low levels, descending in some places nearly to the sea. The 19 Geo., vol. ii, p. 446. id., p. 602. VICISSITUDES OF CLIMATE 87 altitude of this region is not only low now, but it was prob- ably low during glaciation, as shown by the relation of the glacial deposits to the marine beds. Whatever the difficulties in the way of its explanation, therefore, the fact of a long period during which glacial conditions recurred many times must be accepted.\" 21 James Geikie sums up in a few paragraphs the general results obtained by a review of the British deposits. His summary shows in the clearest manner the remarkable fluctu- ations of climate in a single period. It is as follows: \" 1. Weybourn Crag. The North Sea occupied by an Arctic fauna. \" 2.

CHAPTER VIII EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION DE VRIES' doctrine of evolution advances physical environment and conditions to first place in the chain of cause and effect. The great accelerations noticed in the de- velopment of life, spasmodically as it were, indicate that these conditions were radical, and it is imperative that the source should be adequate. The first cause must have been some- thing out of the ordinary. It is postulated that the canopy at times belted the earth, even as far north as the Arctic circle. This introduces into the polar regions three powerful factors, light, heat, and land connections. Archibald Geikie says: \" The climate during Tertiary time underwent in the northern hemisphere some remarkable changes. Judging from the terrestrial vegetation preserved in the strata, we may infer that in England the climate of the oldest Tertiary periods was of a temperate character, but that it became during Eocene time tropical and subtropical, even in the centre of Europe and North America. It then gradually grew more temperate, but flowering plants and shrubs con- tinued to live even far within the Arctic circle, where, then as now, unless the axis of the earth has meanwhile shifted, there must have been six sunless months every year. Grow- ing still cooler, the climate passed eventually into a phase of extreme cold, when snow and ice extended from the Arctic regions far south into Europe and North America. Since that time the cold has again diminished, until the present thermal distribution has been reached.\" 1 Again, speaking of Greenland, he says : \" One of the 'Geo., 3d ed., p. 964. 89 90 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS most remarkable geological discoveries of modern times has been that of Tertiary plant-beds in North Greenland. Heer has described a flora extending at least up to 70 N. lat., containing 137 species, of which 46 are found also in the central European Miocene basins. More than half of the plants are trees, including 30 species of conifers (Sequoia, Thujopsis, tSalisburia, etc.), besides beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples, walnuts, limes, magnolias, and many more. These plants grew on the spot, for their fruits in various stages of growth have been obtained from the deposits. From Spitzbergen (78 56' K lat.) 136 species of fossil plants have been named by Heer. But the latest English Arctic expedition brought to light a bed of coal, black and lustrous like one of the Paleozoic fuels, from 31 45' E\". lat. It is from 25 to 30 feet thick, and is covered with black shales and sandstones full of land-plants. Heer notices 30 species, 12 of which had already been found in the Arctic Miocene zone. As in Spitzbergen, the conifers are most numerous (pines, firs, spruces, and cypresses), but there occur also the Arctic poplar, two species of birch, two of hazel, an elm, and a viburnum. In addition to these terrestrial trees and shrubs, the lacustrine waters of the time bore water-lilies, while their banks were clothed with reeds and sedges. When we remember that this vegetation grew luxuriantly within 8 15' of the North Pole, in a region which is now in darkness for half of the year, and almost continuously buried under snow and ice, we can realize the difficulty of the problem in the distribution of climate which these facts present to the- geologist.\" 2 The difficulty has been thoroughly appreciated. J. W- Dawson makes this acknowledgment of it. He says : \" It is difficult to account for these vicissitudes of climate, and much controversy. exists on the subject; but it seems certain d., pp. 1001-1002. EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION 91 that in the earlier Tertiary and Cretaceous periods, for ex- ample, the supplies of heat and light were so diffused over the earth as to permit the growth of a temperate vegetation in Greenland, and even Spitzbergen.\" 3 The polar regions now have unremitted light for six months in the year, but, owing to the climate, this energy is wasted. When the canopy induced greenhouse conditions clear up to the Arctic circle, this heat was wafted over the clear space of the north. But this is not all of the good which it did, for when the sun sank in the southern sky this marvellous roof caught its slant-wise rays. Holding these in its embrace, it reflected them back on the land, which otherwise was a land of darkness. Sunlight and twilight must therefore have endured the whole twelve months. Next to light, the importance of the electric stimulus should be considered. Electricity must have a material con- ductor. When the canopy extended to the Arctic circle, the conductor was spread out as a curtain, and the frequency and intensity of the auroras may be imagined. Their effect as a stimulant to plant-growth cannot be questioned. The Scientific American says : \" The flora of the north polar region is remarkable for rapid growth, fertility, and brilliancy of coloring, phenomena which seem incompatible with the climate. For the Arctic summer, though nightless, is very short, the sun is low, and its rays are often intercepted by fog and clouds, so that it cannot furnish an amount of light and heat favorable to very rapid growth. \" The investigations of Prof. Lemstrom, of Helsingfors, and others, tend to show that electricity exerts a great influ- ence on the growth of plants, and this view is confirmed by the luxuriant vegetation of the zone of action of that violent electrical manifestation, the aurora borealis. Furthermore, 8 \" Origin of the World,\" p. 395. 92 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS a close connection has been found, in Finland, between fruit- fulness and frequency of auroras. Finally, Lemstrom was led to attribute to the sharp points of plants, such as the beard of grains, the function of i lightning rods/ which collect atmospheric electricity and facilitate the exchange of the charges of the air and the ground. \" Thereupon he proceeded to submit the suspected effect of electricity upon vegetable growth to the test of experiment, beginning in 1885 with a number of flower-pots containing similar soil and seed. Some of the pots were subjected to the action of an influence or inductive statical machine, one pole of which was connected with the soil in the pot, and the other with a wire netting stretched over it. The other pots were left to nature. The electric machine was driven several hours daily. Within a week the electrified plants showed a more vigorous growth than the others, and in eight weeks the disparity in weight, of grain and straw alike, amounted to forty per cent.\" 4 A continent is said to have existed in these far northern latitudes in the primitive Eocene, and this same canopy-like structure which had its origin from equatorial rings points us back to the southern oceans, where the waters were held up in a heap by the gravitational pull. In after ages, when these waters were released, they not only sought their level, but they were also attracted toward the north by the weight of the ice itself. H. W. Pearson has recently come out with a new idea as to the cause of the raised beaches, which were once necessarily near the water's level, but which have now acquired consider- able elevation. The correlation of his facts relative to the uniformities of elevation and gradient of these old markings are germane to our own hypothesis. We cannot admit, how- ever, the cause which he assigns for their origin, namely the 4 Vol. xcii, No. 23, June 10, 1905. EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION 93 Adhemar-Croll hypothesis, of which we will have more to say hereafter. Oscillations of such long duration will not fit in with facts such as those introduced at the end of our last chapter, which showed fourteen vicissitudes of climate, some of them of a sudden nature, and all within one geological period. Pearson, however, has done a very good work in revealing the wide scope and the symmetrical character of the remains left by the inundations of the past. He says: \" Now, then, if glacial dams and chance upheaval of the crust are both to fail us when we seek for explanation of these strange facts in the raised beaches, it is our duty to look elsewhere, and in such a search it is soon discovered that there is but one physical cause that can be considered adequate to our needs, and this may be stated as the displace- ment of the earth's centre of gravity by the accumulated ice of the last glacial epoch, and the consequent submergence of all northern shore lines/' 5 This brings us back to the point we were discussing: the disappearance of the primitive Eocene Arctic Continent. Pearson has found that the inclination of the beaches shows a raised gradient toward the north. Starting at sea level at the equator, they rise approximately as the sine of the latitude, until, as estimated, they would reach an altitude of 1,467 feet above present sea level at the pole. No doubt this great weight of water was the cause of the permanent depres- sion of the land surface. Pearson believes that the shifting of the waters as indicated could have taken place only at the expense of the waters of the southern hemisphere, and while it may be true that the north claimed more than its rightful share from that region, still it seems to us more probable that it was the equatorial waters alone that were transferred. Other authorities have likewise recognized the potent in- fluence of the great mass of ice in causing a shifting of the waters. James Geikie says: 5 Scientific American Supplement, No. 1682, March 28, 1908. 94 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" The view set forth by Mr. Jamieson, 6 that the apparent rise of the sea-level in glacial times was induced by sub- sidence of the earth's crust under the weight of the ice-sheets, has been received with considerable favor by geologists. His leading idea is ' that the ice-covered regions were depressed by reason of the great weight of ice placed upon them, and that when the ice disappeared they rose again with extreme slow- ness, and may have eventually attained nearly their former level ; but in most cases/ he believes, e some amount of perma- nent depression probably occurred.' This hypothesis appears to explain so many facts, that geologists are naturally inclined to accept it. It accounts for the striking association of glaciation and submergence.\" 7 It is suggested that the subsidence that followed this gen- eral movement was only started by these influences. It is a matter of geological record that once a land begins to rise or to sink the movement usually continues through long successive ages. Even now the waters are not deep in the north polar region. Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, in his journal of the voyage of the Yukon, writes under date of August 24 : \" The water is quite shoal here, and generally in the Arctic, 32 fathoms being the deepest sounding on my chart so that while an ugly sea rises quickly, it also subsides quickly with a change of wind, and does not make life miserable for days and days after a storm, as is the case in the deep sea.\" 8 These thoughts lead to a consideration of the conditions which existed before the Ice age set in. G. Frederick Wright says : \" From Maine and Puget Sound to the arctic archi- pelago and Greenland, the abundant long and branching fiords of these northern regions, and the wide and deep channels 8 Geological Magazine, 1882, p. 400.

EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION 95 dividing their islands, attest a very long time of pre-glacial high elevation there.\" 9 The same author says of this flooded continent, in con- nection with its bearing on the distribution of species, that \" the polar projection of the earth down to the northern tropic shows to the eye as our maps do not how all the lands come together into one region, and how natural it may be for the same species, under homogeneous conditions, to spread over it. When we know, moreover, that sea and land have varied greatly since these species existed, we may well believe that any ocean-gaps, now in the way of equable distribution, may have been bridged over. There is now only one considerable gap.\" 10 Again our author remarks : \" Asa Gray and others have shown that the affinity of the plants of southern Greenland with those of Europe is such as to make it probable that they emigrated directly from Europe, rather than by the longer route across Asia and North America. Davis Strait seems to have been a more effectual barrier to the emigration of plants than was the North Atlantic on the east of Greenland. This would imply that the elevation of the bed of the North Atlantic is more certainly proved, or that it was longer con- tinued than that of Davis Strait or Baffin Bay ; or possibly it may prove simply that, from being freer of ice, it was more available for the passage of plants and animals.\" u Yet one more citation from this great glacialist may be pardoned. He says : \" From the geographic distribution of animals, not less than of plants, abundant evidence is found that in a late geologic time, probably comprising the closing stage of the Tertiary era and the early part of the Quaternary until the Ice age, an extensive land area occupied the present place of Behring Strait and Sea, upon which the 9 \" Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" p. 320. 10 \"The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 379. \"\"Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" p. 369. 96 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS fauna and flora of the northern lands freely migrated from Europe and Asia to America, and the reverse, becoming nearly alike in these two great continental regions. Over all the circumpolar land expanse the mammoth, mastodon, and many other large animals roamed from the United States to Alaska, Siberia, Continental Europe, and the British Isles during late Tertiary times.\" 12 In an editorial comment on \" Where Did Life Begin ? \" E\". H. Winchell says : \" In several of his chapters Dr. Warren directs attention to the conditions favoring the com- mencement of life at the pole. See p. 59. Wallace (quoted by Warren) shows that i the facts of arctic paleontology call for the supposition of a primitive Eocene continent in the highest latitudes/ Professor Heer of Zurich noted the same. Baron Nordenskjb'ld arrived at the same conclusion. J. Starkie Gardner argued from the facts known then (1878) that continuous land once united Europe and North America. This arctic continent, whether it was that which was sub- merged by the ocean that covered northern Asia, as shown by Professor G. F. Wright, in late Glacial or post-Glacial time, or was that which gave birth to the great glaciers of the Glacial epoch, subsisted through the Tertiary, since fossil Tertiary land plants, indicating warm and moist climates, have been found at numerous points within the Arctic circle. Given this continent and the tropical warmth that its fossils denote, the great preponderance of light over darkness, the intensity of direct, continued sun's rays, and the conditions were favorable for the most luxuriant, if not for spontaneous, life. It is now a well-known doctrine of fossil botanists that the oldest land plants of the earth originated in the region of the North Pole and from there spread southwardly. This evolution toward the south continued. That the Arctic region was the birth place of plants and continued to send Ibid., p. 215. EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION 97 her progeny southward until the close of the Tertiary has been demonstrated by Gray, Heer, Hooker, Kuntze, Saporta, and others. \" With the existence of such a continent at the North Pole, and with the demonstrated stream of migratory plant life emerging from it, the author does not fail to inquire as to the evidence of animal origin in the same region. He quotes Orton (1876) and Wallace (1876) to the effect that the north temperate and Arctic regions have been the starting- points of long continued migrations, and concludes this branch of his inquiry in the following words : ' From all the facts, but one conclusion is possible, and that is that like as the Arctic pole is the mother region of all plants, so it is the mother region of all animals the region where in the beginning God created every beast of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind. And this is the conclusion now being reached and announced by all comparative zoologists who busy themselves with the problem of the origin and prehistoric distribution of the animal world. 7 \" 13 It is not assumed in our hypothesis that the origin of life was at the pole, but simply that the canopy introduced condi- tions favorable to development and distribution from that point. It gives a reason for the many apparent anomalies in the distribution of living beings in time and space. The facts show this much, and the greenhouse roof explains the facts. The conditions were recurrent with the appearance of each successive canopy. Warren's central idea of sun-controlled climates is all wrong. Manson's theory of earth-controlled or canopy- controlled climates approaches the truth, but this roof must be broken up into separate belts, otherwise the whole earth was encompassed by a mantle of cloud, a separate cause has 18 American Geologist, vol. xxxiii, No. 3, March, 1904; Wm. F. Warren, \"Paradise Found\"; G. Hilton Scribner, \"Where Did Life Begin?\" 7 98 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS to be found to account for the subsidence of the Arctic con- tinent, the evolution of exogens remains unexplained, and finally the recurrence of similar polar conditions in different geological ages makes the idea untenable. For these reasons the content of the atmosphere could not have formed the blanket. In this connection Chamberlin and Salisbury have put the following on record : \" An atmosphere so heavily sur- charged with carbon dioxide and water-vapor must have been rich in heat-absorbing power, and should have given a very warm, equable climate to the earth, as has been rightly assumed. Warm equable climates did indeed prevail in a portion of the earlier history of the earth, as also in the later ; but the investigations of the past two decades in India, Australia, and South Africa have forced the recognition of extensive glaciation on the very border of the tropics, at a period as early as the closing Paleozoic. Evidences of glacia- tion in northwestern Europe, and also in China in about 30 N\". lat, at or near the base of the Cambrian, has recently been presented. Less striking but perhaps not less sig- nificant is the occurrence in the early Paleozoic, of extensive salt and gypsum beds in rather high latitudes. These de- posits seem to imply severe and protracted aridity, and such aridity, especially where north of the 30 belt, is not readily reconcilable with an enormous equalizing atmospheric envelope. u There seem, therefore, to have been, in Paleozoic times, much the same alternations of very uniform with very diversified climates that marked the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras ; in other words, the alternations of climate seem to have been of much the same order throughout the known eras. The hypothesis of an enormous original atmosphere suffering gradual depletion finds, therefore, but scant and uncertain support in a critical study of either the biological or the physical history of the earth.\" 14 \"Geo., vol. ii, pp. 87-88. EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION 99 It is hardly necessary to state that like conditions existed at the South pole, and that this section also testifies that the atmospheric content could not have been the controlling factor of the climates. The zoogeographical distributions establish the fact of the land connection, and science has even gone so far as to name this Antarctic continent. In the Permic it was known as Gondwana Land, and it is said to have embraced Brazil, India, South Africa, and Australia. ~No doubt the causes- which brought about the .destruction of the North polar continent were the -same that brought about its destruction. In a future chapter we will show that the action in both hemispheres was contemporaneous. This co- incidence of time, and the fact of equatorial glaciation. exclude the Adhemar-Croll hypothesis. 15 During the Cretaceous, Australia and South America were united. 16 In the Quaternary the continent appears to have again been enlarged to the wide limits it had in Permian time. 17 \" If the land extensions and connections in the Southern Hemisphere in the Permian period be made as slight as biological data permit,\" say the joint authors of Chamber- lin and Salisbury's Geology, \" they would probably at least consist of a connection from India, via Australia and the old submerged land, to New Zealand, and thence to Antarc- tica, and through this to South America. Other and more northerly connections between India and South Africa, and between the latter and South America, have usually been postulated.\" ls 15 Charles Schuchert, Journal of Geology, vol. xiv, No. 8, p. 725.

The records as re- vealed to date are as follows : \" In New Zealand the marks of the Glacial period are unequivocal. The glaciers which now come down from the lofty mountains upon the South Island of New Zealand to within a few hundred feet of the sea then descended to the sea-level. The longest existing glacier in New Zealand is sixteen miles. One of the ancient moraines contains a boulder from thirty to forty feet in diameter, and the amount of glacial debris covering the mountain-sides is said to be enormous. Reports have also been recently brought of signs of ancient glaciers in Australia. \" According to Darwin, there are distinct signs of glacia- tion upon the plains of Patagonia, sixty or seventy miles east of the foot of the mountains, and in the Straits of Magellan he found great masses of unstratified glacial material con- taining boulders which were at least one hundred and thirty miles away from their parent rock; while upon the island of Chiloe he found embedded in ' hardened mud ' boulders which must have come from the mountain-chains of the continent. Agassiz also observed unquestionable glacial phenomena on various parts of the Fuegian coast, and indeed everywhere on the continent south of latitude 37. Between Concepcion and Arauco, in latitude 37, Agaseiz observed, near sea-level, a glacial surface well marked with furrows and scratches, and as well preserved, he says, ' as any he had seen under the glaciers of the present day.' \" 19 M G. Frederick Wright, \"Man and the Glacial Period,\" 2d ed., pp. 126-128. CHAPTER IX CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES THE cause of the ice inundations, up to this time, has remained locked in the bosom of nature. Nearly all the hypotheses advanced in explanation of the phenomena may be grouped under the following heads: (1) the astronomic, which call upon influences from outside the earth; (2) the hypsometric, those which appeal to continental elevation; (3) the atmospheric, those depending upon the constitution and movements of the earth's gaseous envelopes. Croll's semi-astronomic hypothesis, 1 founded on the -vari- ations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the preces- sion of the equinoxes, is dead. The greatly exaggerated estimate of the time element kills it. Croll placed the close of the last glacial epoch as 80,000 years ago, which, in the light of modern discovery, is simply preposterous. Later modifications which bring the last stages of the ice down to within ten thousand years are also open to question. The phenomena connected with the ice invasion seem to have been practically universal, even the elevated areas in the tropics being glaciated. Here once more CrolFs theory, that the glacial epochs in one hemisphere coincided with the interglacial epochs in the other, and vice versa, is sadly want- ing. This same reason also rules out the epeirogenic or elevation theory, 2 and Sir Charles Lyell's oscillations between the continents and oceans, and all other hypotheses founded 1 \" Climate and Time in Their Geological Relations,\" also \" Climate and Cosmology,\" by James Croll; \"The Cause of the Ice Age,\" Sir Robert Ball; and \"The Great Ice Age,\" James Geikie. 2 G.

Dana, Man. of Geo., 4th ed., p. 978. 101 102 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS on changes in the distribution of land and water, together with the hypothesis of a shifting polar axis. In this connec- tion the following citation from Le Conte is to the point. He says: \" The more important element in the glacial problem is the cause of the lower temperature. The fact of Permian glaciation in low latitudes, either side of the equator, rules out the astronomic hypothesis, and continental elevation alone is insufficient. But a sufficient cause of secular changes of temperature, affecting the whole earth alike, is found in the variation in amount of the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere/' 3 The true cause, then, should be sought in or above the atmosphere, but, as already intimated, a uniform blanket will not do, and to this we may add, neither will variation in the amount of carbon dioxide answer, for if depletion brought on the cold, then evaporation would have been less. Cyclonic action and precipitation would have been at a minimum. In other words, the idea that cold alone is responsible for bringing about glacial conditions is like killing the goose which lays the golden eggs. \" It is perfectly mani- fest,\" remarks Tyndall, \" that by weakening the sun's action, either through a defect of emission or by steeping of the entire solar system in space of a low temperature, we shall be cutting off the glaciers at their source.\" 4 Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere makes a uniform blanket, depletion makes the air more transparent to re- flected heat (dark heat). The blanket once thinned, the temperature falls, the moisture decreases, and for this reason conditions are not good for an ice age; but nevertheless, as stated above, the true cause should be sought in the atmosphere, or, more correctly, in the regions immediately above the atmosphere. 'Elements of Geo., 5th ed., p. 617. 4 \" Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion.\" CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES . 103 Step by step now let us follow the on-coming of the Glacial epoch and its explanation as revealed by the present hypothesis. Previous to the period of cold, we have seen that the warm climates did actually exist everywhere north of the Arctic circle, and a canopy was postulated as existing up to the boundaries of the polar regions. The warm tem- peratures originating under this roof are further supposed to have drifted out over the open space of the north, carrying with them a temperate climate almost to the pole itself. At this time the vegetation of central Europe and of the Middle Atlantic States of America flourished in northern Greenland and in Spitzbergen. It is not assumed that the blanket which existed outside or above the atmosphere was of any great degree of thickness ; on the contrary, it was probably exceedingly thin. Yet its influence was such that it prevented the free radiation of heat, and thus it caused the secondary belts of vapor to be raised in the atmosphere itself. ISTow, since the primary canopy was upheld by centrifugal force, and since this force was at a minimum at the axis of rotation, it follows that, as it spread beyond the point of stability, its northern edge must have been subjected to a continual depletion. It is postulated on the strongest scientific grounds that as the canopy aged it lost energy, hence this point of stability retreated further and further south, and the great secondary vapor belts withdrew with it. IsTatural sun-controlled climatic conditions then began to appear in its wake, and the average temperature became cooler and cooler. Picture now the descent and dispersal of the forests adjusted to a temperate climate. The tropical forms were forced to migrate southward, and this made room for the downward march of the inhabitants of Greenland and Spitz- bergen to more hospitable latitudes. A single tree is helpless before such a change in environment, since a tree alone cannot migrate. But a forest of trees can, hence they followed the 104 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS retreating canopy, keeping under it or just beyond its con- fines, according to the conditions to which they were best suited. As the favorable conditions near the pole were dis- turbed, the individual trees on that side of the forest-belt gradually perished, but at the same time new territory was continually being invaded southward. The first changes in the climate, then, were not of a sudden nature. But conditions were rapidly ripening for an ice age. On the one hand vast belts of vapor circled in the lower atmosphere of the middle zones; on the other the open space of the north had expanded to such an extent that the warm currents from the south could no longer maintain an even temperature. In other words, the north was becom- ing a condensing area, and the arctic flora and fauna began to descend into the cloudy debatable region. Charles Darwin says : \" The identity of many plants and animals on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of miles of low-lands, where Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one point to the other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of Europe ; but it is far more remarkable that the plants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe.\" 5 Sir Charles Lyell gave as an explanation of the com- mingling of arctic and southern forms of animal life his opinion that the periods of summer and winter were more strongly contrasted. The fact of this commingling must have \" Origin of Species,\" vol. ii, p. 92. CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 105 greatly troubled Sir Charles, as he was the great exponent of the doctrine of uniformity. But let us take up once more the thread of the on-coming of the Ice age. When the northern limit of the canopy had retreated to, say, the 35 of north latitude, and the cor- responding edge in the south had withdrawn to the 35 of south latitude, the condensing area as portrayed above was represented by the middle ground between the pole and the canopy belt. The great masses of cloud undoubtedly reduced the aver- age summer temperature. Chamberlin and Salisbury recog- nize the potent influence of such persistent cloud and wind factors, but to account for these same factors is as difficult a problem to them as the original puzzle. Having shown how these originated under the influence of the canopy, it is inter- esting to see what the joint authors have to say about what they call the Proximate hypotheses. We therefore quote them as follows: \" In the atmospheric class of hypotheses are to be reckoned two that are proximate but not ultimate hypotheses : namely, the cloud hypothesis and the wind hypothesis. With- out doubt, clouds and wind are important factors in the development of glaciation, but if clouds are made the essential factor, the problem is only shifted to the cause of such persistent clouds covering such large areas for tens of thou- sands of years consecutively, with a cooling potency compe- tent to develop the great ice-sheets. The solution of this seems as formidable as the problem in its usual form.\" 6 The united effect of persistent cloud and wind conditions was the lowering of the snow line, probably some several thousand feet, and thus all the conditions became favorable to the rapid accumulation of the ice. It has been estimated that a lowering of the average temperature of the globe from 6 Geo., vol. iii, p. 445. 106 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS 5 to 8 C. below the present temperature would be sufficient to produce general conditions of glaciation. 7 \" Prof. Shaler has warned us that New England at the present time barely escapes glacial conditions. The rudi- ments of a glacier still remain in Tuckermann's Ravine upon Mount Washington. A slight lowering of temperature or a slight increase of snowfall would again start the glaciers of the White Mountains out upon their career, and when once started, it is difficult to tell where they would stop ; for glaciers intensify the conditions to which they owe their origin, and would seem to have almost unlimited power when once the forces producing them have come fully into play. Equally close is the approach to glacial conditions in Norway and Alaska.\" 8 The circumstances, then, preeminently favoring the intro- duction of the Ice age, were all present when the canopy had receded to say the 35 of lat., abundant moisture was in the atmosphere, and climatic conditions favorable to the precipi- tation of this moisture as snow rather than as rain prevailed. Once these heavy falls exceeded the melting capacity of the sun's rays, there arose an annual addition to the ice-sheet \" Snow locks up, as it were, the capital upon dry land, where, like all other capital, it becomes conservative, and resists with great tenacity both the action of gravity and heat.\" Profes- sor Wright analyzes these cumulative effects and he further says: \" Under the influence of heat ice melts, but in melting it consumes an enormous amount of force. In order to melt one cubic foot of ice, as much heat is required as would heat a cubic foot of water from the freezing-point to 176 Fahr., or two cubic feet to 88 Fahr. To melt a layer of ice a foot thick will therefore use up as much heat as would raise a 'Mid., p. 444. 8 G. Frederick Wright, \"Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" p. 377. CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 107 layer of water two feet thick to the temperature of 88 Eahr. ; and the effect becomes still more easily understood if we esti- mate it as applied to air, for to melt a layer of ice only one and a half inches thick would require as much heat as would raise a stratum of air eight hundred feet thick from the freez- ing-point to the tropical heat of 88 Fahr. We thus obtain a good idea both of the wonderful power of snow and ice in keeping down temperature and also the reason why it takes so long a time to melt away, and is able to go on accumulating to such an extent as to become permanent.\" 9 The importance of the cold polar currents, furnishing, as they did, the cold dry air necessary to cause precipitation, must not be overlooked. The path which these currents took was established by the same laws that exist to-day, hence the cyclonic areas cover the same ground. Persistent clouds and fog, habitual to such conditions, formed and shielded the glacial surface by their high reflecting powers, hence all the auxiliary forces of nature may be said to have fallen into line, doing their share to promote the general glacial conditions. The next point that attracts our attention is the centres of distribution. The localization of these show that they occupied areas of permanent atmospheric depression. There is a remarkable correspondence between the border of the ice-sheets and the course of the movement of storms to-day. In other language, the atmospheric conditions were simply exaggerated. The extremes were greater, but the cyclonic paths of the storms were the same. It is notable that the great ice-lobes converged toward the area where storm- frequency is now greatest. The canopy established the mechanical factor which produced the vapor, and as this was fixed geographically the cyclonic area also became fixed, in- stead of moving with the atmosphere as the familiar stray \" The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 406. 108 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS cyclones do. It seems natural, therefore, that their paths should have been approximately the same then as now. This conception provides for the precipitation of the vapors brought into existence by a fixed mechanical agency, and it gives a reason for the low temperature that caused this precipitation to be in the form of snow. In Siberia, as at present, the average precipitation should have been rela- tively low, therefore the conditions never quite reached the glacial stage; nevertheless, it is probable that great floods swept over that land. A glance at the map of North America shows that the glacial centres were somewhere in the vicinity of Lake Superior and Labrador. Chamberlin and Salisbury remark that: \"It is not a little remarkable that the ice-sheets after their several retreats, and perhaps entire disappearances, should have advanced repeatedly in nearly the same forms and to nearly the same extents, though in some particulars their habits otherwise were noticeably unlike. All these and many minor facts are associated in theory with these perma- nent ' lows ' and the related storm-tracks. These features are presumed to have been extended and intensified during the glacial stages, but to have retained the general relations and configurations they now possess.\" 10 From the standpoint of the present hypothesis, it does not appear remarkable that the several ice-sheets should have occupied nearly the same identical region. A machine turns out the same results simply because it is mechanical, and the canopy was to all intents and purposes a fixed feature. Fluctuations in the declining edge of the canopy, causing it to advance further north or retreat further south, are prob- ably answerable for like advances and retreats of the ice- sheets. The recognition of these recessions and advances is of much more importance than the question whether they are to be regarded as distinct glacial epochs. 10 Geo., vol. iii. p. 433. CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 109 Here is another feature. Wright says : \" It must be confessed that Professor Dana's estimates of the size of the Connecticut River floods at that time are somewhat startling, even with all the changes of level for which he provides in his theory. For, after reducing, by reason of the Champlain depression, the gradient of the stream during the close of the Ice period by one third, the slope of the surface of the Con- necticut would still have been more than one foot per mile. This, in a torrent 2,500 feet wide, with a depth of 140 feet, would produce a current of eight miles per hour on the surface and of six miles on the bottom. With this size of the flood, the rate of discharge would be about four hundred cubic miles of water per annum; whereas, at the present time the total discharge of a year is only about five cubic miles. To cause this enormous rate, Professor Dana supposes that, for a short period, the Connecticut glacier melted at the rate of more than a cubic mile per day. As he estimates the area of this drainage-basin to be about 8,500 square miles, this would imply that at times as much as eight inches per day melted from this surface. This rapid rate of removal in summer is not, however, supposed to continue for a long period probably less than five years.\" n James Geikie, speaking of certain interglacial beds, tells us that they \" are of the very highest interest, since their evidence amounts to a demonstration that the Ice age was not one long uninterrupted period of cold conditions.\" 12 Vegetation sometimes grew up to the edge of the ice. Re- mains are found in the drift. The mere presence of this material in situ between beds of drift is no proof of distinct glacial epochs, for this growth may have occurred during a temporary retreat, and a slight advance of the ice may have buried it beneath more drift. It is proof, however, that the 11 \" The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., pp. 306-307.

A slight advance of the canopy bringing this perpetual sum- mer warmth over the edge of the glacier caused floods such as that pictured by Dana. Forest remains, found under like conditions as those above portrayed, not only show the presence of this warmth, but also that the periods of fluctuation were sometimes of considerable length. \" Among the most remarkable of the interglacial forest beds are those near Toronto. Among the identifiable plant remains are those of the pawpaw, the ash, the elm, the oak, and the yew. Most of these species now range as far north as Toronto, but most of them have their greatest development farther south. The pawpaw is not known so far north. It flourishes in the latitude of the Ohio River, ranging thence north to Lake Erie. At the present time these species as a whole seem to belong to the climate of a latitude somewhat lower than that of Toronto. Their testimony is that the climate of Toronto, during the interval of deglaciation when they grew, was somewhat warmer than that of the present time in the same locality. Toronto is 800 miles or more from the centre of the Labrador ice sheet.\" 13 Because of this evidence of heat, the joint authors of the !N\"ew Jersey publication arrive at the following conclusion: \" The temperate climate which the plant remains prove makes it clear that the ice sheet which existed north of Toronto at that time must have been small, for with no ice sheet there at the present time, the climate is less warm than during the interval of deglaciation when the plants grew. \" It is of significance to note that the phenomena of America are in keeping with those of Europe on this point. # * * \"j\"]^ r emains of land animals are often found in the forest beds or at corresponding horizons. Their significance 13 \"Glacial Geology of New Jersey,\" vol. v, Final Report, pp. 171-172. CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 111 is similar. At Toronto, for example, animal remains are found, and, like the plants, they indicate a temperature warmer than that of the same region at the present time.\" 14 It has been shown by the migrations of the plants and animals that the on-coming of the Ice age was gradual, but there are likewise features of suddenness. Thus the burial of entire mammoths by a mighty storm, and just such storms must have taken place. The swirling power of the canopy may at times have set the atmospheric belts themselves in motion, and the latter carrying the moisture laden vapors must have caused deluges and snows that at times were of cataclysmal magnitude. Winchell says: \" If the change to an arctic climate had been gradual, the herds of mammoths would probably have slowly migrated southward ; or, if no actual migration occurred, the extinction of the mammoth population would have been distributed over many years, and the destruction of individuals would have taken place at temperatures which were still insufficiently rigorous to preserve their carcasses for a hundred ages. Whole herds of mammoths must have been overwhelmed by a sudden invasion of arctic weather. Some secular change produced an unprecedented precipitation of snow. We may imagine elephantine communities huddled together in the sheltering valleys and in the deep defiles of the rivers, where, on previous occasions, they had found that protection which carried them safely through wintry storms. But now the snow-fall found no pause. Like cattle overwhelmed in the gorges of Montana, the mammoths were rapidly buried. By precipitation and by drifting, fifty feet of snow, perhaps, accumulated above them. They must perish; and with the sudden change in the climate, their shroud of snow would remain wrapped about them through all the mildness of the ensuing summer. The fleecy snow would become granular; 14 IUd., p. 172. 112 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS it would be neve or firn, as in the glacier sources of the Alps. It would finally become solid ice, compact, clear and sea- green in its limpid depths. It would be a glacier ; and so it would travel down the gorges, down the valleys toward the frozen ocean, sweeping buried mammoths bodily in its resist- less stream. Thus, in the course of ages, their mummied forms would reach a latitude more northern than that in which they had been inhumed.\" 15 The mammoth may have found the physical conditions under the canopy insupportable, or, again, it may be that the extinction of this great beast may best be accounted for by saying, it was his intelligence that killed him. Elephants are acknowledged to be the most knowing animals, and the mam- moth belongs to this family. Looking at the lowering skies to the south, perhaps he feared to explore the only region which would have meant safety, whereas other creatures, of less intelligence, rushed blindly in and so came into posses- sion of the garden-land. The mammoths' stay in the de- batable land resulted in their being overcome \" suddenly.\" One of the difficult problems in connection with the cause of the Ice age has always been to account for the remarkable fact that the greater part of Alaska, the extreme North, and also portions of Greenland, were not extensively glaciated during Pleistocene time. 16 Our explanation is that the gradual withdrawal of the canopy did not allow of the forma- tion of ice-sheets in the far north. The area of precipitation followed the outer rim of the canopy, and until this had descended into the lower latitudes the clear space of the north was not large enough to allow of the radiation of suf- 13 \" Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer/' pp. 244-245. \"Israel C.

CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 113 ficient hea^t to cause, the vapors from the south to turn to snow. When this point was finally reached the area of precipitation was south of the arctic circle. The fact here clearly stated proves conclusively that the cause of the Ice age was some other than the gradual lowering of temperature, such as might have been brought about by a depletion of the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere, or by elevation of the con- tinental masses. The distribution of the ice during the Glacial period was not such as to indicate a gradual exten- sion of it from the north pole, but rather its accumulation upon centres many degrees to the south. There was a northern limitation and there was a southern limitation. The continental ice belts reached 40 of lati- tude. If no influence existed to prevent the cold from this region descending southward, it would seem certain that it would have done so. Sympathetic glaciation would surely have reached the equator. All tropical vegetation would have been exterminated. Since it was not, it follows that a preventive cause must have existed. The survival of in- numerable tropical plants shows that the Glacial age was not a period of universal cold. JSFow, the preventive cause of southern invasion was the belt of tropical or semi-tropical heat girding the earth under the greenhouse roof at about the 35 of latitude. At first this canopy formed one blanket from the 35 of south latitude to a like latitude in the north, but as time went on it is further postulated that the sky cleared at the equator, leaving a northern and a southern belt. Under these conditions the high lands between the belts also became somewhat glaciated. Thus the hypothesis we are considering accounts for a vast storehouse of heat, where vapor was formed, which in turn furnished the material for deluges of rain and great storms of snow. Accumulation of ice north of the protected belt established the ice-sheets, and at a much later period local glaciation began to appear on the mountains to the south. 8 114 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS The cold and warm zones, brought thus into juxtaposition, gave rise to cyclonic convulsions upon a scale which the ordinary operations of nature cannot begin to parallel. The final breaking up of the belt caused the sympathetic glaciation above referred to to invade the whole earth. As an illustration of how this would have occurred, it is inter- esting to know that \"the small precipitation in Greenland commonly stated to be only about ten inches annually on and near the coast renders it quite probable that if the ice were once melted away, it would not, under present conditions, accumulate* again.\" 17 We have already quoted the same author as saying: \" Under the influence of heat ice melts, but in melting it consumes an enormous amount of force. In order to melt one cubic foot of ice as much heat is required as would heat a cubic foot of water from the freezing-point to 176 Fahr., or two cubic feet to 88 Fahr. To melt a layer of ice a foot thick will therefore use up as much heat as would raise a layer of water two feet thick to the temperature of 88 Fahr. ; and the effect becomes still more easily understood if we estimate it as applied to air, for to melt a layer of ice only one and a half inch thick would require as much heat as would raise a stratum of air eight hundred feet thick from the freezing-point to the tropical heat of 88 Fahr. We thus obtain a good idea both of the wonderful power of snow and ice in keeping down temperature, and also the reason why it takes so long a time to melt away, and is able to go on accumulating to such an extent as to become permanent.\" 18 James Geikie says : \" Every one, indeed, has heard of the heat of the arctic sun, which shines day and night during the whole summer-tide. But despite the sun's power the \" Wright, \" Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" p. 367. 18 \" The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 406. CAUSE OF THE ICE AGES 115 mean temperature of summer in North Greenland does not exceed one or two degrees above freezing-point, and this is entirely owing to the presence of snow and ice.\" 19 We can understand from these citations how it was that glaciation reached the tropics. When the canopy finally dispersed it was like removing a wall or dam which had stopped or held in check the cooling currents which obtained their low degree of temperature from the vast accumulations of ice to the north, and which had already invaded the lower latitudes. The duration of this southern glaciation, how- ever, was short-lived. The sun got in its work . in time to save the tropical forms of life, but not in time to prevent the migration of certain arctic species from the one zone to the other. In connection with the fact of the migration of arctic species, Sir Robert Ball tells us that \" we have the high authority of Sir J. Hooker for the remarkable fact that a great number of the flowering plants in Patagonia are either identical with or closely allied to plants in temperate North America and Europe. To realize the significance of this fact, consider not so much that Patagonia and Northern Europe are separated by thousands of miles of land and sea, as that between them lies the torrid zone, in which these plants adapted to temperate regions could not live. There is no continuity between the flora of Patagonia and that of North America, for equatorial America is a barrier through which such organisms could not pass. How, then, are we to explain the community of botanical forms in two regions so remote ? It is impossible to believe that these separate floras can have sprung independently into being, for all analogies of nature demonstrate that they must have had some common source. The glacial theory is at hand to render an explana- tion of the facts.\" 20 \"The Great Ice Age,\" 3d ed., p. 800. 20 \"The Cause of an Ice Age,\" p. 146. 116 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Ball supported the Crollian hypothesis, and his explana- tion of these facts is not very satisfactory. T. G. Bonney, along with many others, tells us that \" the extension of the glaciers on Mount Kenya (19,500) is specially interesting, because its position (almost on the equator) suggests a pos- sible refrigeration of the earth as a whole rather than of its hemispheres alternately. Formerly its glaciers de- scended to a height of about 9,800 feet above sea-level, or their end was about 9,700 feet vertical beneath the summit, instead of about 4,000 feet, as at present. Kenya, in those days, must have presented conditions generally corresponding with those of a peak in the Alps rising to a height of about 14,000 feet (where the snow-line is about 8,000 feet, or 6,000 below the summit). On Kenya formerly this line should have been not far from 13,500 feet above the sea, and its present level must be about 15,000 feet; a difference which roughly corresponds with a lowering of temperature amounting to 5.\" That which is true of the recent Pleistocene glaciation is likewise true of those which occurred in remote geological ages. \" Evidence has been adduced from the Carboniferous times,\" says Archibald Geikie, \" to support the view that in spite of the genial temperature indicated by the vegetation there were glaciers even in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Coarse boulder-conglomerates and striated stones have been cited from various parts of India, South Africa, and eastern Australia, as evidence of ice-action.\" 21 ., 3d ed., p. 809. CHAPTER X SYMPATHETIC FEATURES THEEE were a great many other sympathetic features connected with the Ice age upon which the present hypothesis throws light. II. W. Pearson's views relative to the drift- wood origin of coal, accounting for, as they do, the remains of the plants grown in situ, might be transferred bodily into this volume. 1 Both hypotheses, though they are as far apart as the east is from the west, in their primary conceptions, recognize the fact that the ice caused the inundations re- quired to accumulate the vast deposits of the Carboniferous, and is responsible also for the phenomenon of the raised beaches of the several geological ages involved. These views have been held more or less definitely by 'many others. Thus, Professor Penck \" thinks it likely that the pluvial periods, of which there is evidence in many of the deserts of the world, were contemporaneous with ice- advances, and that desiccation phenomena accompanied inter- glacial epochs.\" 2 The phenomena of desiccation seem to have been first cousins of the pluvial manifestations. We would point out that no other hypothesis than the one now before us can explain how it is that within a range of a few hundred miles these two extremes should be contrasted, and yet there is geological evidence to show that such were the actual conditions. Frederick S. Dellenbaugh says of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado that \" the inner gorge appears to have been cut far more rapidly than the outer one, and at a much later \" * Scientific American Supplement, No. 1683, April 4, 1908. 2 Geographical Journal, Feb. 1906, pp. 182-187. The Journal of Geology, vol. xiv, No. 6, Sept.-Oct., 1906, p. 570. 117 118 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS period. Were this not the case, there would be no inner gorge. It is a singular fact that some side canyons the Kanab, for example while now possessing no running water, or at best a puny rivulet, and depending for their corrasion on intermittent floods, meet on equal terms the great Colo- rado, the giant that never for a second ceases its ferocious attack. * * * A suspicion arises, on contemplating some of these apparent discrepancies, that the prevailing conditions of corrasion are not what they were at some earlier period, when they were such that it was rendered more rapid and violent ; that there was perhaps an epoch when these deep-cut tributary canyons carried perennial streams, and when the volume of the Colorado itself was many times greater, pos- sessing a multiplied corrasive power, while the adjacent areas were about as arid as now.\" 3 Dellenbaugh, who was one of the members of Major J. W. Powell's second expedition, undoubtedly correctly surmises that the cause of the addi- tional corrasive power was increased precipitation on the mountain summits during the Glacial epoch. We might add, the result of the sympathetic glaciation. The significant point is that the region of the canyons, according to the evi- dence, was then as arid as at present. The inference is obvious : the region in question lay under the protecting belt, hence, though great quantities of moisture were in the air, geologically speaking the area was one of desiccation. Like conditions naturally prevailed in the remote geolog- ical ages when other belts caused other glaciations. Thus the problems of the Permian are summed up by Chamberlin and Salisbury, and we would point out that desiccation under the canopy belt existed then just as it existed in the Pleisto- cene. The joint authors say: \"Between a marvelous deployment of glaciation, a strangely dispersed deposition of salt and gypsum, an extra- 8 \"The Romance of the Colorado River,\" pp. 46-47. SYMPATHETIC FEATURES 119 ordinary development of red beds, a decided change in ter- restrial vegetation, a great depletion of marine life, a remarkable shifting of geographic outlines, and a pronounced stage of crustal folding, the events of the Permian period constitute a climacteric combination. Each of these phe- nomena brings its own unsolved questions, while their combination presents a plexus of problems of unparalleled difficulty. More than any other period since the Cambrian, the Permian is the period of problems. With little doubt these marked phenomena were related to one another, and their elucidation is quite sure to be found in a common group of cooperative agencies. While it is too much to hope for a full elucidation at once, there is no occasion to blink the facts or evade the issues they raise.\" 4 Evaporation is akin to desiccation, and this took place under the zonal belts. Precipitation occurred in the open zones, outside the influence of the protecting canopy. Under these conditions salt deposits could be formed in one region while in an adjacent territory torrential floods were accom- plishing their work. As this hypothesis has no occasion to evade an issue raised, the phenomena of crustal folding and kindred questions next attract attention. Undoubtedly they were of a sympathetic nature, elucidation of the one great cause opening the way for a discussion of the cooperative agencies. According to Professor G. Pozzi, the principal volcanic outbreaks of Italy are of the Glacial period. 5 Professor Wright says : \" The connection of lava-flows on the Pacific coast with the Glacial period is unquestionably close. For some reason which we do not fully understand, the vast ac- cumulation of ice in North America during the Glacial period is correlated with enormous eruptions of lava west of the Rocky Mountains, and, in connection with these events, 4 Geo., vol. ii, pp. 655-656. 5 Atti Linci, 3d ser., vol. ii (1878), p. 35. 120 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS there took place on the Pacific coast an almost entire change in the plants and animals occupying the regions.\" 6 The same author says of the columnar outflows of basalt of Disco Island and contiguous and more northern islands along the Greenland coast : \" The date of these lava outflows was approximately the same with similar or even grander volcanic action in the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and the region of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington.\" 7 Chamber] in and Salisbury give the following summary of the evidence in America : \" There are lava-flows and cinder cones of Quaternary age in ~New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and at various points in the Sierras. On many of them vegetation has hardly begun to gain a foothold. Gilbert estimates that of 250 lava fields observed in these states 15 per cent, are of Pleistocene age, and of the 350 volcanic cones in the same States, 60 per cent, are considered to be Pleistocene. Vol- canic ash is* interbedded with loess at various points in eastern Washington and Oregon, and overlies glacial moraines in some parts of Alaska. Glacier Peak, Washing- ton, is the remnant of a volcano formed after the elevation of the base-leveled tract. Mount Eainier dates from about the same time.\" 8 Associated as these instances were with the Glacial period, there can be no doubt that the redistribution of the land, caused by the heaping up of the ice, was the proximate cause. 9 The ice depressed the Champlain valley about 200 6 \"Man and the Glacial Period/' 2d ed., p. 301. 7 \" Greenland Icefields and Life in the North Atlantic,\" p. 208. 8 Geo., vol. iii, p. 479. 9 N.

SYMPATHETIC FEATURES 121 feet, and it is generally conceded that the whole St. Lawrence region must have stood some hundreds of feet lower than now. Where did the crushed out or displaced strata go ? \" These relations between the amount of post-glacial ele- vation and the centre of the icefield have led to the hypothesis '(1) that the low altitude of the land at the close of the last glacial epoch was the result of sinking caused by the great load of ice, and that the sinking was greatest where the ice was thickest; and (2) that the rise of the land since the glacial period is the result of the removal of the load of ice, and that the resilience was greatest where the depression was greatest, namely, where the ice was thickest. This hypothesis, which makes the crust of the earth responsive to ]oad, is the doctrine of isostasy. \" Attempts have been made to test this hypothesis in various ways. The result of all investigations thus far carried out seems to point to the conclusion that it contains a truth, and that load, or the removal of load, affecting a great area, is a real cause of crustal movement. It is not to be inferred, however, that this responds promptly or uni- formly to it. It is probable that other forces originate crustal oscillation, or may limit, delay, or defeat the movement which load or its removal would tend to produce.\" 10 After the ice disappeared the ocean invaded the Cham- plain depression, but, the load having been removed, the land began to return to its normal elevation. \" The conclusion that the northern lands were lower than now when the ice melted carries with it the farther conclusion that the land has since risen, relative to the sea level. Much other evi- dence, gathered from a wide range of territory, points to the same conclusion. Not only this, but the post-glacial rise of the land seems to have been greater, as the centre of the icefield is approached, and amounts to as much as 1,000 feet 10 \" Glacial Gteo. of N. J., vol. v, Final Report, pp. 200, 201. 122 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS or more near the centre of the field.\" n The time factor of this dynamic oscillation was certainly much faster than is generally realized. 12 Load was only one of the proximate factors resulting from the atmospheric belts, that caused plutonic and other terrestrial disturbances. All the most pronounced mani- festations of vulcanism occurred at periods when the belted canopy was undergoing some form of change. Thus during the Tertiary vast floods of lava were poured out in both the Old and the ISTew Worlds. Going still further back, like phenomena mark the later parts of the Cretaceous, and it is the same story in the still more remote ages. 13 The immedi- ate cause of these outbreaks was undoubtedly the weight of ice and the pressure of the atmosphere. But these factors only acted on the critical region (anamorphic zone) of rock flowage. Be it remembered we advocate a rigid earth. Archibald Geikie, in this connection, says : \" Leaving for the present the general question of the cause of volcanic action, it may be here remarked that the conditions determin- ing any particular eruption are still unknown. The explo- sions of a volcano may be to some extent regulated by the conditions of atmospheric pressure over the area at the time. In the case of a volcanic funnel like Stromboli, where, as Scrope pointed out, the expansive subterranean force within, and the repressive effect of atmospheric pressure without, just balance each other, any serious disturbance of that pressure might be expected to make itself evident by a change in the condition of the volcano. Accordingly, it has long been remarked by fishermen of the Lipari Islands that in stormy 11 Ibid., p. 200. 12 For figures relative to this interesting phenomenon, see New York State Museum, Bui. 84, Geo. 8, pp. 236-238. 13 A.

SYMPATHETIC FEATURES 123 weather there is at Stromboli a more copious discharge of steam and stones than in fine weather. They make use of the cone as a weather-glass, the increase of its activity indi- cating a falling, and the diminution a rising, barometer. In like manner, Etna, according to Sartorius von Waltershausen, is more active in the winter months. Mr. Coan has indicated a relation between the eruptions of Kilauea and the rainy seasons of Hawaii, most of the discharges of that crater taking place within the four months from March to June. \" When we remember the connection, now indubitably established, between a more copious discharge of fire-damp in mines and a lowering of atmospheric pressure, we may be prepared to find a similar influence affecting the escape of vapors from the upper surface of the lava-column of a vol- cano ; for it is not so much to the lava itself as to the expan- sive vapors impregnating it that the manifestations of volcanic activity are due. Among the Yesuvian eruptions since the middle of the seventeenth century, the number which took place in winter and spring has been to that of those which broke out in summer and autumn as 7 to 4. In Japan also the greater number of recorded eruptions have taken place during the cold months of the year, February to April. * * * \" The greater frequency of Japanese volcanic eruptions and earthquakes in winter has been referred in explanation to the fact that the average barometric gradient across Japan is steeper in winter than in summer, while the piling up of snow in the northern regions gives rise to long-continued stresses, in consequence of which certain lines of weakness in the earth's crust are more prepared to give way during the winter months than they are in summer.\" 14 14 Geo., 3d ed., pp. 205-206. CHAPTER XI RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE THIS chapter is introduced to show that the last stages of the ice invasion were of such recent date that man, includ- ing even civilized man, was a witness of the grand phenomena of the belted canopy. The demonstration of this point is very important, as its establishment admits before the court the evidence locked up in the mythological tales, the fossil thought of those ancient days, which has come down to us as an echo. It is generally admitted by the scientists that man lived on the earth during the Pleistocene, therefore in a measure this chapter is unnecessary, but that the lay mind may find it easier to follow the argument, and that no link may be wanting, especially at such an important junction, it seems best to present a general outline of the evidence. Further, it may be well to state that remnants of the belts probably survived in the heavens long after the ice disap- peared. Now, since man lived in the Pleistocene, he saw the system in its glory, and as it is assumed that remnants remained until a much later period, he saw the decline and fall of the same, the Ragnarok of his gods. The popular idea that the Ice age occurred at a very remote date, humanly speaking, lives on in spite of the fact that science has controverted the data on which it was orig- inally founded. Estimates of this character are based more or less on three worn-out theories: (1) Ly ell's principle of uniformity in Nature's operations, which has led to an exaggerated estimate of the Glacial age, in order to proportion it to the other events in geologic time; (2) Croll's hypothesis of the precession of the equinoxes (now generally dis- credited) ; (3) Darwin's system of evolution, which requires 124 RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 125 long periods of time for the development of new species from a parent stem. De Vries removes this difficulty, as his \" mutants \" fulfil all requirements for the shortening of the time element. The data we are now after are those of the withdrawal of the last of the ice from the centre of glaciation. In one sense the age is not yet over; the glaciers, especially those of Alaska, are still receding. But this slow recession, while it shows that the date of heavy glaciation was recent, is of little value in the present connection, for it only demonstrates the tenacity with which cold stored up in the past has en- dured. It does not show that the cause itself still existed until recent time. In order to find out what this date may be, we want to determine the approximate date of the first withdrawal of ice from the southern border of the ice sheet. To that end we introduce the following testimony. Prestwich places a rough estimate within the limits of 6,000 to 12,000 years as necessary for the wearing back along the coast-line of certain cliffs since the glacial submergence in the soft Cretaceous, Oolitic, and Liassic strata in the South of England. 1 The evidence from weathering in America confirms this. T. C. Chamberlin, State Geologist of Wis- consin, says : \" ~No sensible denudation had taken place there since glacial times.\" 2 H. Carville Lewis says in connection with the striae on Cannon Hill, Kerry, Ireland : \" At the present day the northwest winds are the wet winds. The winds were the same in the time of the local glaciers. The marks are so fresh that they may not be over 5,000 years old.\" 3 \" In Europe, likewise, numerous estimates of the lapse of time ia On Certain Phenomena Belonging to the Close of the Last Geological Period, etc.,\" p. 71. *Geo. of Wis., vol. ii, p. 632. 8 \"The Glacial Geo. of Great Britain and Ireland,\" pp. 93, 94. 126 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS since the Glacial period, as collated by Hansew, are found to be comprised between the limits of 5,000 and 12,000 years.\" 4 Material comprising deposits of the Glacial age is very slightly oxidized and disintegration is very slightly advanced, even when said deposits occupy exposed positions. All this indicates that the lapse of time has not been long. fce late Professor White,^of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, de- scribes freshly preserved leaves at great depths which he found in terraces on the Monongahela River. He also de- scribes a certain pebble which he found near the Big Sandy, and which is peculiarly liable to disintegration, nevertheless his specimens were in good condition. \" There is not space to mention the many other places where wood is reported in the modified drift filling what are perhaps preglacial torrents, and which may therefore have been transported a long dis- tance from their native place. One such was reported to me in the valley of Raccoon Creek, in Granville, Licking County, Ohio, and but a few miles from the glaciated border. This was found ninety-four feet below the surface of the terrace, which would bring it about forty feet below the present bed of the stream. A few miles farther up in this same valley so many red-cedar logs were formerly found beneath the glacial terraces along the valley, and the wood was so fresh, that a flourishing business was for a while carried on in manufacturing household utensils from them. Red cedar is not found in that region now, and these logs are probably of the same period with those described as found in true glacial till in Butler County, and which are so fresh as to preserve still the peculiar odor of the wood. \" Professor Collett reports that all through that portion of southwestern Indiana included within the glacial boundary there are found, from sixty to a hundred and twenty feet 4 American Geologist, vol. xxviii, No. 4, p. 243.

In the vicinity of Morgan- town, Professor I. C. White, as already noted, reports that in the terraces which he connects with the period of the Cin- cinnati ice-dam the leaves of our common forest-trees are most beautifully preserved some distance below the surface, and that logs of wood in a semi-rotted condition were encoun- tered seventy feet below the surface.\" 5 Very little erosion has taken place since the Kames of Scotland or America were deposited, and in both these locali- ties these peculiar relics of the Glacial period retain their sharpness of outline. \" When, also, one considers the chemical agencies at work to decompose the rocks everywhere protected by a covering of till, the freshness of the glaciated surfaces never ceases to be a cause of astonishment. * * * \" Closely connected with the preceding class of facts are the observations made upon the extent to which the lakes, dating from the Glacial period, have been filled with sedi- ment. Little reflection is required to make it evident that our present lake-basins could not always have existed; for, except where counteracting agencies are at work, the ' wash ? of the hills will in due time fill to the brim all inclosed areas of depression. Mr. Upham, of the Minnesota Geological Survey, expresses surprise at the small extent to which the numerous lakes of that State have been filled with the sedi- ment continually washing into them. e The lapse of time since the Ice age has been insufficient for rains and streams to fill these basins with sediment, or to cut outlets low enough B \" The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 493. 128 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS to drain them, though in many instances we can see such changes going forward.' 6 \" Dr. E. Andrews, of Chicago, has made calculations, deserving of more attention than they have had, concerning the rate at which the waters of Lake Michigan are eating into the shores and washing the sediment into deeper water or toward the southern end of the lake. 7 The United States Coast Survey have carefully sounded the lake in all its parts, and have ascertained the width of the area of shallow water extending inward from the shores. It is well known that waves are limited in their downward action, so that there will be a surrounding shelf, or shoulder of shallow water, in cases where the waves of a deep lake are eroding its banks. This fringe of shallow water encircling Lake Michigan is only a few miles wide; and from such data as have been gathered, the average rate of erosion is found to be as much as five or six feet per annum ; which would indicate that the lake-basins had not been in existence more than seventy-five hundred years.\" 3 The author from whom we have just quoted enters into a lengthy discussion of the date of the Glacial period, 9 from which we cite the following : \" Seven thousand years may, with a good deal of confi- dence, be taken as the age of the lower part of the Niagara gorge. This, of course, does not take us back to the period when the front of the glacier lay in the headwaters of the Delaware and the Little Miami River, and when glacial floods were depositing the gravel at Trenton, 'New Jersey, and at Loveland and Madisonville, Ohio, and where Drs. Abbott and Metz have found paleolithic implements ; but it does bring us back to within a comparatively short distance of that period, \"Minnesota Geological Report for 1879, p. 73. 1 'American Journal of Science, vol. xcviii, 1869, pp. 172 et seq. \"Wright, \"The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., pp. 470-471. *IUd., pp. 448-505.

The problem here presented has been carefully studied by Professor N. li. Winchell, the State Geologist of Minnesota, who thinks he can pretty closely approximate to the truth concerning its antiquity.\" The average arrived at for these calculations is 7,803 years. 10 \" The .Falls of St. Anthony,\" says Le Conte, \" recedes about five feet per annum, and has made its gorge in about 8,000 years.\" 1X Warren Upham arrives at a somewhat earlier date, though the region on which he founds his conclusion is farther north. He writes : \" Likewise probably the uprise of the St. Lawrence basin was at first relatively rapid, so that it all might take place within the period of about 7,000 or 6,000 years which is indicated for Postglacial time in that part of the northern United States and Canada by Prof. N. li. Winchell, in his studies of the recession of the Falls of St. Anthony, with which my studies of the Niagara falls and gorge well coincide. The former estimate of the period since the Ice age as tens of thousands of years, still advocated by Gilbert and Woodworth, is opposed by a great range of well accordant evidence on the glacial areas of both North America and Europe.\" 12 \" These calculations concerning the age of Niagara and the Falls of St. Anthony are amply sustained by the study of various minor waterfalls and gorges in Ohio, to which I have IMd., pp. 458, 464. \"Elements, 5th ed., p. 15. 18 American Geologist, November, 1905, vol. xxxvi, No. 5, p. 288. 130 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS myself given special attention/' says Wright. \" For ex- ample, at Elyria, twenty-five miles west of Cleveland, Black River plunges over the outcropping Waverly sandstone, and flows onward to the lake through a wide valley in the Erie shale, which was doubtless preglacial, though no buried chan- nel above has yet been discovered. The gorge below the falls/ which has been eroded since glacial times, and which approxi- mately represents the work done by Black River during that time, is only a trifle over two thousand feet long. The water flowing over the falls represents the drainage of about four hundred square miles, and the sandstone which forms the precipice over which the water plunges is underlaid by soft shale very favorable to rapid erosion.\" 13 Warren Upham in \" Popular Astronomy \" gives the fol- lowing data, which ably summarize what has already been said. He remarks : \" In various localities we are able to measure the present rate of erosion of gorges below water- falls, and the length of the postglacial gorge divided by the rate of recession of the falls gives approximately the time since the Ice age. Such measurements of the gorge and falls of St. Anthony by Prof. ~N. H. Winchell show the length of the Postglacial or Recent period to have been about 8,000 years; and from the surveys of Niagara Falls, Prof. G. F. Wright and the present writer believe it to have been 7,000 years, more or less. From the rates of wave-cutting along the side of Lake Michigan and the consequent accumulation of sand around the south end of the lake, Dr. E. Andrews estimates that the land there became uncovered from the ice-sheet not more than 7,500 years ago. Prof. Wright ob- tains a similar result from the rate of filling of kettle-holes among the gravel knolls and ridges called kames and eskers, and likewise from the erosion of valleys by streams tributary to Lake Erie; and Prof. B. K. Emerson, from the rate of 13 \" The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 466. RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 131 deposition of modified drift in the Connecticut Valley at Northampton, Mass., thinks that the time since the Glacial period cannot exceed 10,000 years. An equally small estimate is also indicated by the studies of Gilbert and Russell for the time since the highest rise of the Quaternary lakes, Bonne- ville and Lahontan, lying in Utah and Nevada, within the arid Great Basin of interior drainage, which are believed to have been contemporaneous with the great extension of ice- sheets upon the northern part pf our continent. * * * \" In Wales and Yorkshire the amount of denudation of limestone rocks on which boulders lie has been regarded by Mr. D. Mackintosh as proof that a period of not more than 6,000 years has elapsed since the boulders were left in their positions. The vertical extent of this denudation, averaging about six inches, is nearly the same with that observed in the southwest part of the Province of Quebec by Sir William Logan and Dr. Robert Bell, where veins of quartz marked with glacial stria3 stand out to various heights not exceeding one foot above the weathered surface of the inclosing lime- stone. \" Another indication that the final melting of the ice- sheet upon British America was separated by only a very short interval, geologically speaking, from the present time, is seen in the wonderfully perfect preservation of the glacial striation and polishing on the surfaces of the more enduring rocks. Of their character in one noteworthy district, Dr. Bell writes as follows : ' On Portland promontory on the east coast of Hudson's Bay, in latitude 58 and southward, the high rocky hills are completely glaciated and bare. The striae are as fresh-looking as if the ice had left them only yesterday. When the sun bursts upon these hills after they have been wet by the rain, they glitter and shine like the tinned roofs of the city of Montreal.' \" From this wide range of concurrent but independent testimonies, we may accept it as practically demonstrated that 133 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the ice-sheets disappeared from North America and Europe some 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.\" 14 Upham also remarks: \" Niagara history may be placed in round numbers between 5,000 and 10,000 years.\" 15 In the Final Report of the State Geologist of New Jersey the following concise statement occurs : \" The date and duration of the glacial period are matters of the greatest interest, but neither has been determined with numerical exactness. Many lines of calculation, all of them confessedly more or less uncertain, point to the retreat of the last ice-sheet from the northern part of the United States 6,000 years to 10,000 years ago. While these figures are to be looked upon as estimates only, there are so many lines of evidence pointing in the same direction that the recency (geologically speaking) of the last glaciation must be looked on as established.\" 16 Humphreys and Abbot estimated that the whole delta of the Mississippi had been laid down in 5,000 years. 17 De Lanoye gives but 6,350 years for the making of the delta of the Nile. 18 The recentness of the date of the waning of the ice having been established, a few citations are now given to show that man's relics have been found in widely dispersed regions in formations of said period, and also that deductions founded on this assumption are borne out by the facts of ethnology. \" Geologic archeology in Europe demonstrates,\" says Warren Upham, \" man's existence there before the culmina- tion of the Glacial period, and indeed, I think, before its be- ginning.

RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 133 recognized and published, I conclude that Paleolithic men began their occupation of that country before the epoch of great elevation of the lands which became glaciated, probably contemporaneously, in both Europe and North America.\" 19 Frederick S. Dellenbaugh says : \" There has been an error, I believe, in considering the Glacial period as of the remote past. It does not seem to have yet closed. It influ- ences our climate now, and probably a thousand years ago its meteorological effects were marked as far south as Yuca- tan. The glaciers of the Northern Hemisphere everywhere appear to be slowly disappearing, and not so slowly either, if the Muir can be taken as a gauge, for it has been for twenty years receding at the rate of 500 feet per annum, and prob- ably at the same rate before that. However this may be, it is probably less than 5,000 years since the ice front was at Lake Erie. Eminent geologists have estimated it at less than 7,000, based on the erosion at Niagara; but as the erosion immediately following the disappearance of the ice is ex- tremely rapid, it seems safe to cut down the estimate.\" 20 Dellenbaugh is so sure of the recentness of the Ice age that he advances the following argument on that stone for a foundation. He reasons : \" That the continent was en- tirely peopled by way of Behring Strait within the last thousand years, by migration through a zone of ice, is improbable. To assume that a population came over and passed down to Mexico and Yucatan and even South Amer- ica, carrying with them their arts, but not exercising them on their interminable journey, is ridiculous. No pottery has yet been found between the Yukon and the Humboldt, or even farther south, probably because the Eskimo learned what little they knew about it while in the St. Lawrence Valley or the Atlantic region.\" 21 19 American Geologist, vol. xxii, pp. 350-363; Yol. xxviii, p. 251. 20 \" The North Americans of Yesterday,\" Preface, p. xi. p. 428. 134 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Our author again says : \" How the Amerinds came here, I explain by a theory that there was before, or perhaps during the early part of, the Glacial period, a wider distribu- tion of land surfaces on latitudinal lines, which invited migrations. These land surfaces may have been no more than groups of larger or smaller islands which have been since wholly submerged or have left only their highest parts above the sea. Before the beginning of the glacial cold a mild climate extended to the North Pole, facilitating migra- tions also in that region. Changes in the ocean's bottom were probably greater in preglacial time than now, but they have not altogether ceased. It is little more than fifteen years since a new island appeared off the Aleutian chain, and I think it is doubtful if any of that group existed above water six or eight hundred years ago. I am also of the opinion that no human life was in Alaska or in northeast Siberia five hundred years back. \" Races not being all of an even grade of culture before the beginning of the cold period any more than now, the tribes that found themselves isolated on this continent by changes in the land levels and by the southward extension of the glaciation, were unevenly developed, some being in ad- vance of others in various ways, though none, of course, had passed beyond the use of stone tools, a condition in which they practically continued down to the Discovery. In this respect the term ' Stone Age, 7 as indicating a condition, is applicable, but it would not be possible to differentiate it into e Paleolithic ' and ' Neolithic ? periods. The cold pushed them all southward, whether they came by northlands or by latitudinal lands, or both, towards the narrow, funnel-like part of the continent, and also to the lower levels, as there was no chance for latitudinal expansion as in the Eastern Hemisphere, the most advanced tribes being the most south- erly, if not from original position, because they were able to choose. Eventually communication with Asia and Europe RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 135 by the north was by the glaciation severed completely, as it had previously been latitudinally by the disappearance of favorable land surfaces, and communication by the north remained closed till within three or four hundred years. The most crowded tribes developed most rapidly, because such development was imperative for self-preservation, and their culture filtered through in diminishing ratio, according to distance, to the less crowded regions that is, to the climatic- ally less favorable regions ; but all who were closely crowded in the e funnel ' progressed along similar lines and in much the same degree, without regard to relationships, so that we find in the narrow part of the continent, where the largest number found refuge from the cold, many different stocks in parallel ' areas of characterization/ as in the latitudinally broader lands of the Eastern Hemisphere, though in some cases there were slight barriers tending to produce or maintain slight variations. The long longitudinal chain of the Sierra Nevada abounding in glaciers to a late date, and to a less extent that of the Rocky Mountains, brought about a partial isolation of the stocks in the great north-and-south migrations, maintaining previous differences and originating others, so that we now distinguish differences between what is called the Pacific group, while they are yet practically the same. The tribes farthest advanced at the beginning of the isolation on this continent would not necessarily continue at the front of progress, for a change of conditions that might cripple such tribes might at the same time be beneficial to others previously inferior. For instance, as the heat gradually returned, the highly developed lowland tribes began to find themselves at a disadvantage, which grew with the intensity of heat, while others, inured to harsher conditions, found warmth stimulat- ing, and they began to develop germs received from the superior but now declining stocks. c The American Indians,' says Brinton, ' cannot bear the heat of the tropics even as well as the European.' The heat, which at first seems to 136 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS have been intense in the daytime, then caused a decline of the highest stocks, and a corresponding progression of lower stocks existing on, or migrating to, higher levels. The Yuca- tec tribes declined, while the IsTahuatls, at higher altitudes, began to develop. The finest monuments of North American antiquity, for these reasons, are generally found on com- paratively low levels and below a certain latitude, where conditions during the greatest cold were most favorable; conditions that may have continued fairly favorable down to within, say, a thousand years. \" Long before the dawn of the Columbian era, therefore, the Amerind peoples had become, through the influences indi- cated, a world-race by themselves, existing in various stages of the same general culture, and with a rising and a declining of tribes and stocks directed by environment and circumstances.\" 22 Speaking of languages and dialects Dellenbaugh says elsewhere : \" The widest differences were in the Maya and the Timuquanan. Each of these differed greatly from the bulk of the Amerind languages and from each other, probably because both stocks held more isolated positions than the others during the glacial period, and preserved more of their earlier life, whatever it may have been.\" 23 It will now be interesting to see what this ethnologist says of the effects of the glacial age on the human race as a whole. Discussing this problem, he says : \" The people inhabiting the world before it may have been originally much alike in kind and color, with local variations, and the isolation pro- duced by glacial conditions modified this color and increased the variations, those finally left in hot lands becoming darker, medium temperatures producing brown, still cooler the reds and yellows, and the forests of Europe evolving a shade or 22 Hid., Preface, pp. viii-x. 26 Hid., p. 17. RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 137 shadow people, shrinking from the strong sun; the so-called white race.\" 24 The author of this work does not agree with these last conclusions of Dellenbaugh. Briefly rearranging the order according to his light, it would seem that the orig- inal color of the inhabitants of the world before the canopies fell was black ; as time went on, and more especially towards the north, the browns, reds, and yellows developed, and then finally the Caucasian or Adamite race was evolved. The conditions arising from the fall of the heat-retaining canopies of course were the leading stimuli which fostered these changes. After these long citations from Dellenbaugh, by way of contrast we will indulge in a few shorter ones, that by the mouth of several witnesses these things may be established. G. Frederick Wright says : \" The evidence of man's existence in North America before the close of the Glacial period would indicate that he too shared in the sharp struggle which ensued with the new and rapidly changing conditions of that time. Did he also, like so many of his companions among the larger animals, share in this extinction ? The sharpness of the transition from paleolithic to the neolithic implements, as we pass out from the Trenton gravel into the shallow soil above it, would seem to indicate an absolute distinction between the two succeeding races. 77 25 \" The geological succession of events,' 7 says J. W. Foster, \" as disclosed by the Danish discoveries, would appear to be after the following order: The Reindeer Epoch had closed, and the animals fitted for an Arctic climate, which formerly roamed over France and almost to the shores of the Mediter- ranean, had retired to the far north, before the earthen tumuli and shell-heaps and other relics of human occupancy \"IUd., p. 435. 25 \"The Ice Age in North America,\" 4th ed., p. 568. 138 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS had been erected; and were succeeded by a fauna now in- digenous to the region. On the land, changes in the character of the arborescent vegetation were going on. The pine associated with the oldest stone implements, and on whose buds the capercailzie fed gave place to the oak - associated with bronze implements which in turn gave place to the beech associated with iron implements, the predomi- nant type of vegetation at this time. Thus, this succession in climatic changes corresponded very closely with the archaeological changes of the ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron, bringing down the record to the Historical Period.\" 26 James Geikie tells us that \" no relics of Paleolithic man have been detected anywhere in Northern Europe in beds of later date than the accumulations of the third glacial epoch. Implements, etc., of Neolithic age, on the other hand, make their first appearance on a much higher horizon. They occur in the older beds of peat, but never in the clays with arctic plants which underlie the peat-bogs. It would seem, then, that Neolithic man did not appear in Northern Europe until the cold of the fourth glacial epoch was passing away.\" 27 Since Paleolithic relics have been found, we have direct proof that man lived on the earth before the last belts, which caused the last glacial and interglacial periods, had dissi- pated. \" It is interesting to know that relics of Paleolithic Man have been found in the same deposits with remains of mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, wapiti, etc., near Irkutsk. The relics consisted of rudely worked bones, coarse objects of burnt clay, one of which was pyramidal in form and ' holed ' for the obvious purpose of being fixed to a shaft, while the point was worn and blunted as if from use.\" 2S \" Prehistoric Races of the United States of America,\" 6th ed., p. 40. \"\"The Great Ice Age,\" 3d ed., pp. 499-500.

RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 139 It is interesting to know that the same story comes from Africa. There they had a pluvial period almost within Historic time, as the accompanying evidence shows* : \" The exploration of the Sahara daily yields unexpected discoveries ; and already fifteen different stations formerly inhabited by man have been made out. In those remote days a large river flowed near Wargla, which was then an important centre, and a number of tools picked up bear witness to the former presence of an active and industrious population. At one place the flint implements, arrow-heads, knives, and scrapers are all of a very primitive type, and were found sorted into piles. This was evidently a depot, probably forming the reserve stock of the tribe. Wargla, or perhaps Golea, at one time appears to have been the extreme limit of the Stone age in Algeria, but quite recently traces of primitive man have been discovered amongst the Tuaregs.\" 29 The Egyptologist, A. B. Edwards, tells of a dry river somewhere between Wady Sabooah and Maharrakeh. Here she found the ruins of a comparatively modern town, whose location led her into the following speculation. She says: \" Supposing yonder town to have been founded in the days when the river was a river, and the plain fertile and well watered, the mystery of its position is explained. It was protected in front by the Nile, and in the rear by the ravine and the river. But how long ago was this ? Here apparently was an independent stream, taking its rise among the Libyan mountains. It dated back, consequently, to a time when those barren hills collected and distributed water that is to say, to a time when it used to rain in Nubia. And that time must have been before the rocky barrier broke down at Silsilis, in the old days when the land of Kush flowed with milk and honey.\" 30 29 The Marquis de Nadaillac, \"Manners and Monuments of Pre- historic Peoples,\" trans.

We find ourselves in a new Egypt: the seat of power has been transferred to Thebes, the physical type of the ruling caste is no longer that of the Old Empire, and a change has passed over the religion of the people; it has become gloomy, introspective, and mystical; the light- hearted freedom and practical character that formerly dis- tinguished it are gone. Art, too, has undergone modifications which imply a long age of development: it has ceased to be spontaneous and realistic, and has become conventional. Even the fauna and flora are different; and the domestic cat, imported from Nubia, for the first time makes its appear- ance in the threshold of history.\" No doubt the increased cold resulting from the break-up of the Ice age started the Hyksos invasion. It must be remembered that the effects of the Ice age have not yet entirely disappeared from our climate, and that when the protecting belt which was the immediate cause of the great storms that heaped up the snow over North America and Europe passed away, then these storms descended into the south country. Thus for a long 81 Angelo Heilprin, \" The 'Geographical and Geological Distribution of Animals,\" p. 21. RECENTNESS OF THE LAST STAGES OF THE ICE 141 time after the belt bad dissipated, its removal disturbed the genial climate of the heretofore favored middle-lands. Prob- ably most of the barbarian invasions resulted from this cause. As a summary to all that has been said, two more citations may be pardoned : \" Prof. James Geikie maintains that the use of paleolithic implements had ceased, and that early man in Europe made neolithic (polished) implements, before the recession of the ice-sheet from Scotland, Denmark, and the Scandinavian peninsula; and Prestwich suggests that the dawn of civilization in Egypt, China, and India may have been coeval with the glaciation of northwestern Europe.\" 32 Winchell says : \" There has been a time in the history of the Aryan family of men when they seem to have suffered from a sudden change of climate which compelled them to migrate southward. When we trace the movements of the European nations backward, we find, in the remote past, a point of divergence from the nations which crossed the Hindu-Kush into the peninsula of India. In Central Asia the ancestors of the Hindus, Iranians, and Europeans were one people. There arose the Brahmanic and Zoroastrian religions. But the sacred books of the latter contain allusions to a remoter time, when the ancestors of the Aryans dwelt in a country blessed with seven months of summer. This was Aryana-Vaejo, a land of delight, given by Ahura-Mazda, and supposed to have been located in southern Turkestan, upon the Plateau of Pamir, or somewhat f artber east in the beauti- ful valley of Cash gar. But lest this paradise should tempt all nations to crowd in and overpopulate it, the c evil being, Angra-Mainyus (Ahriman), full of death, created a mighty serpent, and winter, the work of the Devas.' Now ten months of frost prevailed, succeeded by only two months of summer. Of this transformed region the Vendidad says: 82 G. Frederick Wright, \"Greenland Icefields and Life in the Korth Atlantic,\" p. 339. 142 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS ' There is the heart of winter ; there all around falls deep snow; there is the worst of evils.' So the ancestors of the Zoroastrians migrated from Aryana-Vaejo, or Old Iran, southward into New Iran, within the modern Afghanistan. \" Is there no analogy between the Aryana-Yaejo of the Zend-Avesta and the Eden of the Hebrew sacred books ? In both, the primitive home of the white race was a country of spontaneous productiveness and a delightful climate. Both lands were given by a beneficent Deity for human occupation. From both lands our ancestors were driven through the machinations of the Evil One. In both narratives the power of evil is personified in a serpent. The consequence in both narratives is the necessity of resort to cultivation of the soil for the production of bread. May both narratives be pictures reproducing from national memory the same encroachment of physical severities upon the same land of Edenic de- lights ? \" 33 In the future chapters of this work it will be seen that the vapor-belt in the sky was the great serpent. Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer/' 3d ed., pp. 245-246. CHAPTER XII FOSSIL THOUGHT WITH apologies for taking such liberty with Shakespeare the following question is asked: Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt; but at least inquire What theory fits the groove. Serpent worship was once a world-wide cult, and in Egypt this serpent was linked with Canopus (the canopy), who conquered the fire in the sky-ring (the sun) by his water- jar. Canopus was the Egyptian god of water, and was represented by the hieroglyphic of a water- jar, though sometimes a ser- pent was used in its stead. As the vapor-belt formed a secondary arc under the canopy, it was natural to associate it with water; hence the water- jar. It can readily be seen how our word \" canopy \" is derived from this serpent-net or covering. It comes to us through the Greek. Leaving the thought of the serpent for the present, we find many references to the canopy ; thus one of the maxims from Theognis the Megarean, translated by the Rev. J. Blank, M.A., reads as follows: \" Then may the broad brazen vault-of-heaven fall on me from above, that terror of men of the olden-time, if I shall not help them indeed who love me : but be to my foes a vexa- tion and great source-of-loss.\" The same translated by J. H. Frere runs thus : \"Then let the brazen fiery vault of heaven Crush me with instant ruin, rent and riven, (The fear and horror of a former age,) If from the friends and comrades that engage In common enterprise I shrink, or spare Myself or any soul! If I forbear Full vengeance and requital on my foes! All our antagonists! all that oppose! \" 143 144 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS This brazen fiery vault was the sun, or \" shiner,\" of the ancients ; the true sun imparted its light to the fire belt, but was itself unseen. Herodotus tells of the account he heard from the Egyptians, how that for a period of ten thousand years none of the sky gods assumed the form of man. Speak- ing of the shiner, or, as he calls it, the sun, he says : \" Dur- ing this time, they related that the sun had four times risen out of his usual quarter, and that he had twice risen where he now sets, and twice set where he now rises; yet that no change in the things in Egypt was occasioned by this, either with regard to the productions of the earth or the river, or with regard to diseases, or with respect to deaths.\" 1 The early Aryans called \" the vault \" Varuna. Beneath it the region of clouds was enthroned. The light of luminous air they called Dyaus. The Greeks conceived the same idea of a hollow or concave vault, KoUo$. Among the Latins the name ccelum has the same signification. Thus we see how tenaciously the record of the facts survived the rise and fall of empires, even after their meaning had been forgotten. Should we go back to the earliest days of the first Baby- lonian Empire, we would find that these matters which we are depicting were even then in a great measure only echo. On investigation, however, we would find the sound was very close, the echo was very loud and clear. We often tell chil- dren to count the seconds intervening between the flash of the lightning and the growl of the thunder, in order to estimate the distance. Applying this rule, we find in this instance a very short interval. Rassam found in the ruins of Abu Habba a marble tablet, eleven inches and a half long by seven inches wide, covered with writing and adorned with a beautiful bas-relief on the top of the obverse. The subject represents Sippara, the god of the shiner, seated in his shrine, under the canopy. The 1 Henry Gary's trans., B. 2, <|f 142, p. 152.

The Egyptians beheld the same scene, and, according to the custom of the age, it became a part of their religion. They called the arc of the sky Nu or Nu-t and represented it by a female figure bending over Seb, the earth, who lay in a recumbent position. N~u~t's body was elongated in a very peculiar manner, her feet resting on one horizon and her finger-tips on the other. Over her arched back the sun-god traversed the sky daily from east to west in his boat. The vapor arc or halo which surrounded the dimly seen sun accounts for this myth. Sometimes K~u-t is represented as double. The upper bending figure being covered with stars clearly portrays her nature. She must have been nearly transparent. The lower Nu-t is evidently a band of water, which suggests the Hebrew idea of the firmament. The proximate cause of the formation of this vapor belt, we have seen, was the upper canopy. Seb, the earth, is represented covered with leaves. When the canopy first began to split at the equator, divid- ing into the northern and southern halves, the Egyptians saw the two belts descending on the one horizon as the arms of Nu-t and on the other as the legs. Job speaks of these two divisions as \" the pillars of heaven.\" He says : \" They tremble and are astonished at His reproof. He divideth the sea with His power.\" * * * \" He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.\" 2 Herman V. Hilprecht, \"Explorations in Bible Lands During the Nineteenth Century,\" pp. 269-271. 10 146 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS * * * \" By His Spirit He hath garnished the heavens ; His hand hath formed the crooked serpent.\" 3 The Hindus called these two belts the Acvins. At night they were seen as two pillars of light receiving the sun rays from the under-world. These were also the original Pillars of Hercules. As the vapors thinned out over the tropical region, the sun rose between the great pillars or divisions of Nu-t, and set between them again on the other side. And this sun was a blazing, flaming creature, a god, traveling in his halo boat. When the fact is recalled that the sun was said by the ancients to set between the Pillars of Hercules, it will be granted that it was natural that when the sky scenes passed away, the twin rocks at the entrance of the Mediterranean came to inherit the name. Some may even have considered them the stumps out of which the sky-pillars grew. They were at the \" world's end \" to the Greeks, nothing but the all- encircling ocean-river lying beyond. As we have seen, in Job \" the pillars of heaven \" are associated with the \" crooked serpent.\" Hercules (the sun), when he took the place of the giant Atlas, supporting the heavens on his shoulders while the latter obtained the golden apples (stars) from the garden of Hesperides, is another account by a different people of the same thing. We can readily see the \" Pillars \" (Atlas) arising from the horizon and apparently supporting the heavens ; the stars are discov- ered in its open rifts guarded by the dragon or serpent. Another name of the \" Pillars \" is the \" World-Tree.\" Serpent worship was universal. Frequently the myths tell of two serpents. These undoubtedly represent the two halves of the canopy, and the people who left the record lived on or near the equator, where both belts could be seen. When only one serpent is mentioned the people leaving the record Job xxvi: 11, 12, 8, 13. FOSSIL THOUGHT 147 usually lived in the middle regions under the canopy or nearer the poles. The infant Hercules (the new-born sun, just bursting through the canopy) is said to have strangled two serpents with his own hands before he was out of his cradle (the vapor arc boat). \" First two dread Snakes at Juno's vengeful nod Climb'd round the cradle of the sleeping god; Waked by the thrilling hiss and rustling sound, And shrieks of fair attendants trembling round, Their gasping throats with clenching hands he holds, And Death untwists their convoluted folds.\" 4 It is said of the ancient Hindus that they must have known of yore that Saturn was encircled by rings. 5 This assumption is made on the ground that an image in one of their temples represents the god Sani, or Saturn, intwined by two wreathing serpents. It seems more likely that this image originally represented our own system, as the two snakes are certainly very suggestive of the two halves of the divided canopy. The Persian legends tell us of a serpent-king called Zohak. He was a power for good until the demon Iblis kissed him on the shoulder. This seems to have been the place from whence the good emanated. On his shoulder, like in the story of Atlas, the world-roof rested. Thus when he was kissed in this spot there issued two dreadful serpents, and the golden age, with its Eden-like conditions under the canopy, came to an end. We will find a great many myths of this character as we go on with the study. The parting of the canopy brought with it death and destruction. In this par- ticular instance Iblis told Zohak that the two dreadful serpents must be fed every day with the brains of two chil- dren. So the country gradually became depopulated. The end was to destroy the human race. 6 4 Darwin. 'Maurice, \"Indian Antiquities.\" \"Poor, \"Sanskrit Literature,\" p. 158. 148 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS At Circleville, Ohio, some time ago, a very curious cir- cular disc of stone, about a foot in diameter, was found. Around it was carved the figures of two intwined serpents. Bernal Diaz, who accompanied Cortez, stated that in one town whose buildings were of lime and stone they found \" figures of serpents and idols painted upon the walls.\" The arms of the Peruvians were two serpents with their tails interlaced. At San Juan de Maguana, in the Island of Haiti, \" curious relics of the aboriginal cult,\" says A. K. Fiske, \" have been found, including a circle of stones roughly representing the emblem of eternity, in the form of a serpent with its tail in its mouth.\" 7 Many such relics have been found elsewheres. The usual form of the serpent myth, however, represents only one belt at a time. The Midgard Serpent occupied the local heaven, or middle world (middle heaven), of the Norse- man. In Egypt, Apophis, the lofty serpent, reigned over the mighty water. Archaeological remains show the same veneration for this ubiquitous sky-serpent. Some of the new-world \" finds \" have already been referred to. \" Some additional light ap- pears to have been thrown upon ancient serpent worship in the West by the recent archaeological explorations of Mr. John S. Phene, F.G.S., F.E.G.S., in Scotland. Mr. Phene has just investigated a curious earthen mound in Glen Feechan, Argyllshire, referred to by him, at the late meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh, as being in the form of a serpent or saurian. ( The mound/ says the Scotsman, ' is a perfect one.' The head is a large cairn, and the body of the earthen reptile 300 feet long; and in the centre of the head there were evidences, when Mr. Phene first visited it, of an altar having been placed there.\" 8 T \"The West Indies,\" p. 252. 8 Ignatius Donnelly, \" Atlantis,\" 21st ed., pp. 204-205. FOSSIL THOUGHT 149 In America the Mound Builders are comparatively a recent people. Their works overlie the formations of the Glacial age, but the existence of serpent worship amongst them indicates that there were still remnants of the old belted vapor system left in the sky when they inhabited the land. Probably the most famous monument left by them is that of the great serpent mound of Adams County, Ohio. This serpent has an egg in its mouth, which undoubtedly represents the sun in his vapor-arc, the boat of the Egyptians. Other groups of mounds also include the egg. In the south the canopy divided, and the sun, appearing in the rift, seemed to conquer, but in the higher latitudes, in the middle regions, as it were, the belts slowly descending polewards seemed to swallow the orb of day as depicted by the serpent mounds. The Iroquois say that the White one, meaning the sun, was overcome by the frog monster, who swallowed him up. This tale is found on both sides of the Atlantic. At Waukesha, Wisconsin, is a relic similar to the serpent mound of Adams County, Ohio. It is called by Lapham a \" Turtle mound.\" Body, 56 feet, engulfing an egg; tail 250 feet ; height 6 feet. The so-called \" Lizard mounds \" also occur here. They have remarkable curved tails. These long tails portray what their builders actually saw in the sky. And no doubt we here have the origin of that primeval serpent-worship found all over the world. First he was the good serpent, the protector, but as his aspect became menac- ing, with the passing of time, he became associated with the evil one. \" In itself the serpent should no more represent moral wrong,\" says Donnelly, \" than the lizard, the crocodile, or the frog; but the hereditary abhorrence with which he is regarded by mankind extends to no other created thing. He is the image of the great destroyer, the wronger, the enemy.\" 9 \"Ragnarok,\" p. 175. 150 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS A peculiarity about serpent worship was that it was quickly forgotten, being superseded by its successor in a few turns of the hour-glass ; but this is as the present hypothesis requires, for when the hidden sun came into view he came as a conqueror and claimed all that adoration which ones be- longed to the snake. The slimy reptile which we all abhor to-day never could have commanded the veneration which we find was accorded it in the prehistoric age. The conclusion is obvious The snakes of old, that by all men were praised Must have been grand as in the sky they blazed The people called them gods and stood amazed. In India, Amanta, the good, who was the serpent of celestial waters, and who dwelt in the lower sky, was con- quered by a supreme god, who lived above, on high. The Toltecs called their sky-god, Quetzalcoatl. \" The Popol Vuh, the great collection of Quiche myths, presents Gukumatz as one of the four principal gods who created the world. Gukumatz means shining or brilliant snake, and hence seems to be the same character as that known to the Nahuatls, or Aztecs, as Quetzalcoatl, whose name means the bright or shining snake.\" 10 Quetzalcoatl was reputed to be a very good vapor spirit, a kind of coverer. He was the son of Camaxtli, the shiner of yesterday ; that is, of a shining canopy or sun that had passed away. \" He fought the enemies that had risen against his father, and attacked the temple of the Cloud- Snakes' mountain.\" * * * \" He was tall, of white com- plexion.\" His reign was the Golden Age of the Toltecs. He was pursued by enemies and obliged to fly. One of these was a near kinsman, a splendid youth, named Tezcatlipoca, the smoking mirror, whom we recognize as a canopy. This 10 F. S. Dellenbaugh, \" The North Americans of Yesterday,\" p. 397. FOSSIL THOUGHT 151 kinsman was his bitter enemy. \" Quetzalcoatl was pressed from land to land. By some accounts he disappeared in a boat on the sea; by others he perished on the snow-covered peak of Orizaba (the Olympian cloud-mountain of the Aztecs), mounting to heaven on the smoke of the funeral pile. When he vanished the sun withdrew his shining.\" 11 In the museum down at Mexico an image of Quetzalco- atl is on exhibition which is girt about with snakes of very savage mien. Their peculiarity is that they are both bird and reptile, a kind of feathered flying serpent, indicating rapid flight. This idea of rapid flight is frequently associ- ated with the White one, the illuminated and fleeting canopy, or perhaps rather with the true sun seen in his vapor-arc or boat passing rapidly over the canopy-sea. Turning to the Arabian tales, the identity of thought with all that we have already set forth bespeaks a common origin of this class of nature myth. Thus, \" Abou Mohammed the Lazy, who is a very great magician, with power over the forces of the air and the Af rites, beholds a battle between two great snakes, one tawny-colored, the other white. The tawny serpent is overcoming the white one; but Abou Mohammed kills it with a rock. The white serpent (the sun) departed, and was absent for a while, but returned; and the tawny serpent was torn to pieces and scattered over the land, and nothing remained of her but her head.\" 12 The white one, or the egg in some of the myths, which was seen through the canopy was the sun. His foe was the glittering prince of serpents, the feathered serpent, etc. In the Bible there is the flying serpent: Isa. xiv: 29 ; Job xxvi : 13 ; Isa. xxvii : 1. The Aztecs represented their god, Tezcatlipoca, as a flying or winged serpent. Other myths represent the canopy as a dragon, while still others picture it 11 Charles De B. Mills, \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 44, 45. \"Ignatius Donnelly, \" Ragnarok,\" p. 268. 152 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS as a giant bird, a frog, a wolf, a dog, a boar, or as some other creature. The Hindu legends often represent it as a cow, and amongst all primitive people the deer and the hare are common. It must be remembered that the belts in falling advanced through several different stages, forming many different sky-forms, which were seen from a great many different angles, and by a great many different people. Speed seems to have impressed them all, hence the comparison with flying animals. The belts as they drifted northward or southward broke into separate divisions. These were the immediate cause of the various stages of ice recession. Mythology is full of these broken and wicked forms wicked because of the evil that they introduced on the earth ; and sometimes these forms are called serpents. They were the hundred-armed giants, known as Typhon, Briareus, and Enceladus. Again, they were the three huge monsters, the terrible speckled serpent, Typhon, and Chimaera, the fire ring, a lion in front, a goat in the middle, and a serpent behind. Chimsera breathed resistless fire, and, like the speckled serpent, was huge, swift, and fierce. Typhon, associated with both of these, seems to have been the most terrible of all. This dreadful monster, born of Hell, was also a serpent or fierce dragon. He was many-headed, dusky tongues of fire gleamed throughout his body, and it was said that he emitted appalling noises and caused earthquakes. The story told in the Typhon legend is found in the mythology of many peoples. In the Norse account we see the same threefold aspect, to wit, the three monsters called \" the Midgard serpent,\" \" the Fenris wolf,\" and lastly \" the dog Gram.\" In the book of Job again we have the three divisions : first, the \" winding \" or \" twisting \" serpent, with which God \" adorned the heavens \" ; then \" Behemoth,\" the monster who drank up rivers; and finally the terrible \" Leviathan,\" whose name means \" the twisting animal gath- FOSSIL THOUGHT 153 ering itself into folds.\" The Saxon legend tells us how Beowulf killed savage monsters Grendel, the devil's dam, and thirdly a dragon. Association of ideas recalls to our minds the three roots of the tree Ygdrasil, the three-pronged trident of Poseidon, etc., etc. Says the Russian fairy-tale : \" Once there was an old couple who had three sons. Two of them had their wits about them, but the third, Ivan, was a simpleton. Now, in the land in which Ivan lived there was never any day, but always night. This was a snake's doing. Well, Ivan undertook to kill that snake. Then came a third snake, with twelve heads. Ivan killed it, and destroyed the heads ; and immedi- ately there was bright light throughout the whole land. The myth is pushed on, and there is also the monster who devours maidens, called a i Norka ' ; and Perun takes the work of Indra and Saint George, enters the castle (dark clouds), and rescues her. But the dark power takes a distinctive Russian appearance in the awful figure of Koshchei the deathless.\" 13 This victory of the sun over the serpent is told by all primitive peoples. It is the victory of Adonis over Typhon, of Indra over Yritra, of Dimiriat over Dahish, of Timadonar over Ariconte, of Hercules over the two serpents strangled while he was still an infant; of Osiris over Seb, etc., etc. \" Pleasing was his shape, And lovely; never since of serpent kind, Lovelier; not those that in Illyria changed Hermione and Cadmus, or the god In Epidaurus, nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen.\" 14 The serpent, as we have already seen, was not always lovely. In the early stages of canopy decline he was the dark and threatening one. The Peruvians tell of a certain hero named Guamansuri, who descended to the earth and 13 L. E. Poor, \" Sanskrit and its Kindred Literatures,\" p. 390. 14 Milton. 154 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS seduced the sister of Guachemines, who was the rayless one, or the Darkling; that is to say, she was the Power of Dark- ness. The sister proved pregnant, and died in her labor, giving birth to two eggs, the sun and moon. Again the Miztecs, who dwelt on the outskirts of Mexico, said : \" In the year and in the day of obscurity and dark- ness, yea, even before the days or the year were (before the visible revolution of the sun marked the days, and the universal canopy prevented the distinguishing of the sea- sons) , when the world was in great darkness and chaos, when the earth was covered with water, and there was nothing but mud and slime on all the face of the earth behold a god became visible, and his name was the Deer, and his surname was the Lion-snake. There appeared also a very beautiful goddess called the Deer, and surnamed the Tiger-snake. These two gods were the origin and beginning of all the gods.\" 15 0rigen de los Ind., pp. 327-329. CHAPTER XIII GENESIS IN the development of Christianity on its intellectual side, what is needed to-day is more synthetical work; it is often forgotten that parts only go to make up a whole. Sepa- rate truths go to make up one testimony, and that testimony is of the unity of truth, and nothing but the truth ; it is the revelation of God in all and through all and above all, and all truth has its place somewhere in the scheme of this tes- timony. Truth cannot annihilate truth, hence we say, what is needed to-day is more synthetical work. Frederick Har- rison has well said : \" There never was an age so deeply intoxicated with specialism in all its forms as our own, so loftily abhorrent of anything systematic, so alien to synthesis, that is, organic coordination of related factors. Everything nowadays is treated in infinitesimal subdivisions. Each biologist sticks to his own microbe ; each historian to his own ' period ' ; the practical man leaves ' ideas ' to the doctrinaire, and the divine leaves it to the dead worldling to bury his dead in his own fashion. Specialism is erected into a philos- ophy, a creed, a moral duty, an intellectual antiseptic.\" 1 Now, as the various parts are brought together, we see that science and comparative theology, as recorded in the fossil rock and fossil thought handed down to us, unite har- moniously in the present cosmological hypothesis. Each shoemaker has been sticking to his own last, but it is now time to do the fitting, and the foot-gear should be in keeping with the whole dress of the man. The historian, the archae- ologist, the paleontologist, the anthropologist, the ethnologist, \" Great Keligions of the World,\" art. on \" Positivism,\" p. 170. 155 156 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the philologist, the mythographer, and the theologian, all need to get together. The present hypothesis brings them together, and, further- more, it sets its seal on God's revelation. God's created record and God's written record, Nature and the Bible, testify with one voice. And the written word is inspired by the Holy Ghost. Proof that the Bible is inspired is set forth in the fact that its various parts were written in an unscientific age and yet they are scientific. For this reason theology, when it properly interprets the evidence, may be set down as an exact science. In an unscientific age a correct account of creation was written. Since the unknown has been revealed, why should not the unknowable of this age also be opened to the eyes of a future generation ? Cicero says : \" When you look upon a large and beautiful house, though you should not see the master and find it quite empty, no one can persuade you that it was built for the mice and weasels that abound in it,\" The plan of the universe is far too grand to suppose that it is \" accident,\" therefore we are glad to say with the patriarch, \" In the beginning God.\" Let us look into this creation record. In Genesis i : 1 , there is a heaven mentioned which seems to be the same as the firmament heaven of verse 8. This is not to be understood to be the expanse above and around us, studded with innu- merable stars, which is really infinite space, but a heaven that was according to the divine account \" created.\" It was associated with the earth. God made heaven (Heb. shamayim, heaved up things) and earth. Jer. xxxii : 17 ; Ps. xxxiii : 6-9. This fact is forgotten to-day. II Pet. iii : 3-6; Isa. xl:21-22. The necessity of some such interpre- tation as this was apparent to the early Church Fathers. St. Basil, St. Csesarius, and Origen argued that the sun, moon, and stars existed from the beginning, but that they did not appear until the fourth day. GENESIS 157 This heaven, or heavens, had an expansion or division in it (Gen. i : 6). The vapor helt was suspended, as we have seen in our scientific chapters, in the atmosphere under the canopy, and the Scriptures call them the waters which were under and which were above the expanse. Unless this account be based on fact, who would have ever risked his reputation to be sponsor for such a statement? Does the heaven look to us as though the blue arch were a few hundred feet high, and that on top of it are the clouds ? Job says : \" Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of Him which is perfect in knowledge? * * * Hast thou with Him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking-glass ? \" 2 It has been demonstrated in our scientific chapters that the geological age-changes were brought about by the disrup- tion of these vapor belts, or heavens. These broke the sequence in the chain of life. The great mutations occurred almost instantaneously, becoming established in a generation or so. Verily they were new \" creations,\" and they occurred in a day. The etymology of this word day \" gives it the sense,\" says J. W. Dawson, \" of the time of glowing or warmth, and in accordance with this the divine authority here limits its meaning to the daylight.\" 3 This is very puzzling to the Biblical student, for the nature of the context clearly shows that the natural day from sunrise to sunset is expressly excluded. ISTow, the period of duration for a canopy was a time of glowing and of warmth ; it is therefore quite evident that the seven days of creation were seven ages of canopy light. The diurnal period was divided into a time of light and of shade. The light of the sun shining through, and on, the overhanging canopy of water-vapors produced the greater 3 Job xxxvii: 16, 18. *\"The Origin of the World,\" p. 126. 158 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. \" Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art very great ; Thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment : Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain : Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters : Who maketh the clouds his chariot : Who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.\" 4 During the period of shade the light from below illu- minated the vapor arc or crescent (moon of the ancients) with a pale refulgence, weird, cold, and uncanny. The witness of the shadow of the earth on the canopy is the Pyramid of Cheops (Isa. xix: 19-20; Jer. xxxii: 17-20). The time of shade or shadow, associated with death by the Egyptians, was the night-time. A shadow-cone, or pyramid, was projected into the canopy from the sunlight shining up from the under-world. A sparkling canopy diffused its light on an awakening earth. After man was created (evolved), this was to him the \" shiner,\" or his sun. In Joshua's day this sun stood still. \" The sun and moon stood still in their habitation : at the light of Thine arrows they went, and at the shining of Thy glittering spear.\" 5 At night-time the canopy was the lesser light or moon. \" Fontenelle, who was always so ingenious in determining the conditions of existence in the planetary worlds, expresses himself thus in regard to Saturn : ( We would be much aston- ished to see over our heads at night that great ring, which would extend as a half-circle from one end of the horizon to the other, and which, reflecting the light to us, would 4 Ps. civ: 1-6. Hab. iii: 11. GENESIS 159 produce the effect of a continuous moon.' \" 6 Kawlinson tells us in his History of Ancient Egypt that \" under Necherophes (Nebka?) the Libyans, who had revolted, made their submission on account of a sudden increase in the moon's size, which terrified them.\" 7 This increase in size stamps the phenomenon as belonging to an inf ailing canopy. It has been shown that the great precipitation accompany- ing the disintegration of these belts was in the higher lati- tudes, beyond the region of the greenhouse-roof. Job tells us that here were stored the treasures of snow and hail (Chap, xxxviii: 19-23). Under the canopy evaporation went on at a great rate. ~No doubt, however, the atmosphere was of a moist and misty character, hence the dews were intensely copious. The Scriptures say, the dew or mist rose from the ground (Gen. ii: 5-6). Who would have had the hardihood to make such a statement, so utterly in con- flict with the established laws of nature, were the hand of revelation not in this record? Science and the Bible do not disagree. One is God's created record and the other is God's written record. The works of His hand cannot contradict the works of His heart ; in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of old He laid the foundations of the earth: and the heavens are the work$ of His hands (Ps. cii:25). The works of His heart are love, and the object of His love is to draw all men unto Himself. He so loved the world that He gave us the written word (John i: 1-14; iii: 16). Science and the Bible do not disagree, but the interpre- tations which man has evolved need to be either adjusted or rejected. When a proper understanding is arrived at, harmony is at once evident and the two testimonies become essentially one. Now, the Bible is full of the same kind 8 Scientific American Supplement) No. 192. 7 Vol. ii, chap, xii, p. 18. 160 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS of tales as the ancients have left us in their varied literature, commonly called myths, but it is offensive to a certain type of mind to say that the Bible contains these myths. The reason for this is that a lack of knowledge of the mental horizon of the ancients exists. The common understanding of a myth is that it is purely a fabulous or imaginary tale, and the fact is lost sight of that it generally conveys an important truth of an allegorical and religious nature. In the light of this present hypothesis the nature myths of these so-called heathen were essentially religious, and they were not so far from the true religion either, inasmuch as the nature-types were pointing the way to God. Before taking exceptions to the existence of these myths in the Bible, then, their meaning should first be ascertained. The trouble is this: The truths taught by the so-called myths have been forgotten, the Bible is a book of the past as well as a book of to-day, and therefore to understand it we must understand the past. Our Saviour spoke a parable of a sower that went forth to sow, that he might impress thereby a spiritual teaching. Now, the solar myth of Samson, which we will investigate later, it is evident was introduced into the Old Testament not by spontaneous growth nor by popular origin, but as in the case of the parable by divine direction, and for the same purpose, namely, to set forth a spiritual truth. All the saints living in those days were as familiar with the illustration as we are to-day with the settings of our Saviour's parable. In the beginning, as in our Saviour's day, the hand of God was visible. He planned it all before He began its ful- filment. His love brooded over this earth, giving to man an Eden paradise. Man, tempted by the beauty of this creation, fell into the serpent's clutch, worshiping the crea- tion or creature instead of the Great Creator. God in His infinite love then revealed Himself, casting man out from the garden world wherein he had dwelt, that he might learn GENESIS 161 the lesson, that first things must perish and that in the second state alone there is life. In other words, matter always has been and always must be subject to change. The spiritual essence alone is unchangeable. This explains many of the mooted questions of the theologians the cause of the fall; the mystery of iniquity ; God's love reconciled with the admis- sion of sin into the world, etc., etc. Briefly, the drama of sin, and of death, and of resur- rection, was all revealed in the type, and the type was the physical canopy and the vapor-belt which hung under the canopy in the atmosphere. Natural phenomena were used by God to convey the spiritual truth. The ordinary myth missed this revelation, the Biblical always emphasized it. The Adamite saw the works of creation, that they were good, and forthwith worshiped the creature (serpent), leaving out the Creator. This was the act of partaking of the tree of knowledge. 8 Man as a free agent thus brought on his own fall, for God in His infinite goodness and justice of neces- sity had to disclose the nature of creation. This left man with the knowledge of good and evil, with knowledge of the Creator and the creature, and it also left him the heritage of original sin, for the fallen serpent or vapor skies allowed the actinic rays to enter, and these produced fermentation, violence, and a quickened life. The first drunkenness mentioned in the Bible is that of Noah's. It is postulated that a remnant of the Edenic canopy caused the deluge of the Scriptures. In the world that was before this flood, Noah never knew the fruit of the vine to produce such results, but with the passing of the canopy new conditions of sun-fire were introduced, to which he was not accustomed. His sin was, therefore, the result of ignorance; immediately afterwards he preached a sermon. In this age we do not listen to men recovering from 8 The tree in mythology will be shown in subsequent chapters to be the canopy. 11 162 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS a spree, but Noah's voice has sounded on down through the ages. The longevity of the ancients was a direct result of the more healthful conditions, though undoubtedly the canopy prevented their keeping track of the years. Hence the great age of Methuselah and the rest of the antediluvians was due to the two causes. When sun-fire broke in, the quickened life brought a swifter death. In this connection it is interesting to note that at a certain early period the \" Egyptians neither employed nor knew any years of longer term than four months. The proof of this, admits one of the most ardent champions of the high antiquity of Egypt, is that, later, when the year consisted of twelve months, three seasons were designated, each com- prising four months, which were indicated hieroglyphically by the word ier, and by a sign that may mean a season or a year, indifferently.\" 9 But to return to the heritage of sin : With the removal of the Edenic canopy evil conditions came upon the earth. \" Cursed is the ground,\" says the Lord God, \" for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.\" 10 The protecting canopy which was cast down was the serpent. \" And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle (behemah), and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\" 11 The Bible myths, then, portray the story of the conflict, and present both the good and evil sides thereof.

Then began strife and long wanderings.\" 12 Primitive man began to go astray in his religion by tak- ing the natural phenomena of the canopy and attributing to them life; then he deified the creations of his mind. He passed from the worship of God to the worship of the works and forces which God had made, from reverence for the creator to reverence for the created. Thus canopy worship became simply a form of animism. It follows that a just God had to remove the cause of this error. He had to dethrone the gods of the heathen. The first step in dethronement was the revealing of the true sun through the equatorial slit or opening between the northern and southern halves of the divided canopy. In Genesis this event, which follows immediately after the fall of man into the error of serpent worship, is described as the introduction of \" a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\" 13 To keep the way open for man to see the Creator through whom there is life. The tree, the eating of which caused them to know good and evil, perished. The two halves of the canopy, as we have already seen, were the pillars of Hercules. Job speaks of them as the \" pillars of heaven,\" and the opening as the \" chambers of the south.\" The mountains of the cloud-belt were removed. 14 Verily these mountains have a new significance. Mount Olympus, the home of the gods. Ossa heaped on Pelion. Jacob's ladder, etc. Under the name of Hercules the Romans, Greeks, and Phoenicians worshiped the sun. The story of Samson is the 12 D. G.

The Hebrew form of his name is, Shimshon, which is a variant form of Shamash the name of the sun in Babylonian and Hebrew. 15 Like Hercules, Samson performed twelve labors in order to free himself. First, he rent the lion as Hercules did the Nemean sky monster, the skin of which he then used as a cloak. The meaning of this is that the conquering sun was obscured or hidden by the enveloping cloud. Second, he extracted honey. Third, he slew thirty men. Fourth, he caught some foxes. Fifth, with hip and thigh he made a slaughter. Sixth, he broke certain cords. Seventh, he slew a thousand men. Eighth, he carried off the gates, posts, bar and all. Ninth, he broke green withes. Tenth, he broke the new ropes. Eleventh, he carried off the pin and beam of the sky temple (Latin, templum, expanse, open place), the original sky home of the gods. Twelfth, he pulled down this temple on his own head. 16 But though related to the Greek, Eoman, and Phoanician, this solar myth also bears a close analogy to the Babylonian. Jastrow says : \" The Biblical Samson appears to be mod- elled upon the character of Gilgamesh. Both are heroes, both conquerors, both strangle a lion, and both are wooed by a woman, the one by Delilah, the other by Ishtar, and both through a woman are shorn of their strength. The historical traits are of course different.\" 17 The Bible tells us of these things because they are part of the error of the ages, and the Bible presents both sides, and it is written for all Eternity, and God's purposes must be true, though every man be a liar. 18 \" Nay, but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing \"Morris Jastrow, \"The Religions of Babylonia and Assyria,\" chap, xxiii, p. 515. 16 Judges xiv-xvi. 1T \" Religions of Babylonia and Assyria,\" pp. 515-516. \"Roffi. iii: 3-4. GENESIS 165 formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou made me thus ? \" 19 \" He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the Lord shall have them in derision.\" 20 Nay, but, O man, surely it may be said of you that ye have questioned the very record of the flood itself (II Pet. iii : 5-6), and, what makes it worse, this is not a myth which you have put the interrogation mark against, but a matter of scientific and Biblical fact. The Noachian flood probably extended over a vast terri- tory in Central Asia and perhaps portions of Europe. Many similar catastrophes of a like character occurred at about the same time. The submergence was connected with the Glacial period. The Ice-king held in his grip four million square miles of the American continent and two million square miles of western Europe. These immense areas were buried under a mile or more of glacial ice. The shifting of this vast weight brought about, as we have seen in our scientific chapters, a number of secondary results, amongst which may be included the great inundations recorded by prehistoric man. \" The principal countries in which these Flood-stories are found are Greece (Deucalion's deluge), Lithuania, Austra- lia, Hawaii and other Polynesian islands, Cashmir, Thibet, Kamchatka, different parts of India, and America (where such stories are particularly numerous) ; they are not found (according to Andree) in northern and central Asia; they are also absent in Egypt, China, and Japan, and almost absent in other parts of Africa (except where they are due to Christian influence). 21 \" It was maintained by the late Professor Prestwich, on the ground of certain geological indications (especially the so-called ' Rubble Drift'), that long after the appearance 19 Rom. ix:20. ^Ps. ii:4. a Westminster Commentaries, Gen. The Deluge, pp. 101-102. 166 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS of paleolithic man, there was a submergence of the crust of the earth, chiefly in W. Europe, but also in N. W. Africa, though extending doubtfully as far E. as Palestine, causing a great inundation of the sea, which, though of short dura- tion, destroyed a vast amount of animal and some human life, so that some species of animals {e.g.., the hippopotamus in Sicily) became extinct in regions which they formerly inhabited; and he suggests that this inundation may have' accounted for the above-mentioned traditions.\" 22 The Commentator thinks that it mitigates against the truth of Prestwich's theory that in Europe itself Elood stories are comparatively scarce and that they are more fre- quent in countries such as North and Central America. On the other hand, where flood, and fire (volcanic), and earth- quake, turned the earth into a cemetery, where was there a man left to preserve the record? Dead men tell no tales. It is not necessary to suppose that Europe was inundated at the time of the Noachian submergence. The cataclysm simply overwhelmed the known earth of the Adamite (Cau- casian) race. The whole area of northern Asia is still said to be slowly rising, which may be taken as an indication that the figure of the continent has not yet regained its normal condition. Scattered lakes over this part of Asia are inhabited by the same animals. How did they get from one to the other? Intervening stretches of desert contain semi-fossil shells of the species still living in the lakes. 23 Of Central Asia and southern Siberia G. Frederick Wright says : \" The geological conditions are such as can only be explained by an extensive submergence of the region where the Scriptures and tradition locate the Elood which destroyed the whole human race, excepting Noah and his family. The evidences of such a deluge are not one, but Hid., p. 102. * American Geologist, vol. v, No. 3, p. 182. GENESIS 167 several, and extend from Mongolia to the western borders of Kussia.\" 24 With the close of the Glacial period it is not to be sup- posed that all remnants of the canopy and vapor-belt at once disappeared. The Babel Builders (Gen. xi:4-9) sought to reach this canopy or heaven. Its ever-changing appearance caused great confusion of tongues and of thought as the various peoples described different scenes to each other, and converted the natural phenomena into heroes and demi- gods; and, furthermore, they worshiped these ever-changing appearances as gods and devils, adding confusion to the already existing chaotic discord and disorder. Berosus records the Chaldean version of this event in complete agreement with the Biblical account, as follows: \" They say that the first inhabitants of the earth, glorying in their own strength and size and despising the gods, under- took to raise a tower whose top should reach the sky, in the place in which Babylon now stands ; but when it approached the heaven the wind assisted the gods and overthrew the work upon its contrivers, and its ruins are said to be still at Babylon; and the gods introduced a diversity of tongues among men, who till that time had all spoken the same language ; and a war arose between Cronus and Titan. The place in which they built the tower is now called Babylon, on account of the confusion of tongues, for confusion is by the Hebrews called Babel.\" It will be seen from this that the gods were afraid that man would reach their abode. Elsewhere this version clearly states that they were building \" in order that they might mount up into heaven.\" 25 Of the confusion of tongues we have this to say: The \"McClure's, June, 1901, vol. xvii, No. 2, p. 134. 25 Rawlinson, \" Seven Great Monarchies,\" vol. i, Chaldea, Assyria. Note 141 to chap, vii of \" First Monarchy,\" p. 526. 168 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS changing aspects of the sky caused the words which the peoples used in describing what they saw to change with the same rapidity as the scenes themselves. While all this was but a phase of inanimate nature, yet it seemed ever to be producing new forms, hence in describing it the ancients confused its various phenomena with the idea of sex. Gen- der-terminations are a part of the bacillus which was thus injected into the tongues of the nations. 26 E^ut though this gave rise to a great many different languages, the fact remains that there were old root languages from which these new languages were descended, and they of course did not originate in this way. Andrew Lang says : \" After taking my degree in 1868, I had leisure to read a good deal of mythology in the legends of all races, and found my distrust of Mr. Max Miiller's reasoning increase upon me. The main cause was that whereas Mr. Max Miiller explained Greek myths by etymologies of words in the Aryan languages, chiefly Greek, Latin, Slavonic, and Sanskrit, I kept finding myths very closely resembling those of Greece among Red Indians, Kaffirs, Eskimo, Samoyeds, Kamilaroi, Maoris, and Cahrocs. Now, if Aryan myths arose from a 6 disease ' of Aryan languages, it certainly did seem an odd thing that myths so similar to these abounded where non- Aryan languages alone prevailed. Did a kind of linguistic measles affect all tongues alike, from Sanskrit to Choctaw, and everywhere produce the same ugly scars in religion and myth ? \" 27 In reply to Lang's query we would say that it 26 \"In ancient languages every one of these words (sky, earth, sea, rain) had necessarily a termination expressive of gender, and this naturally produced in the mind the corresponding idea of sex, so that these names received not only an individual but a sexual character.\" Max Miiller, Chips, iv, 62. We explain this matter by the theory that man called the lifeless things and phenomena of the canopy male or female by using gender-terminations as a result of his habit of regarding the lifeless things, etc., as personal beings and as gods. 27 \" Modern Mythology,\" p. 4. GENESIS 169 is quite evident that the germ which scattered the linguistic measles in all the root languages was the ever-changing sky phenomena. Max Miiller should not have confined this infectious disease to the Aryan language alone. But we have had enough about languages, so let us return to the sky scenes themselves. At a time when the Pillars of Hercules spanned the equatorial heavens there was an open spot or egg hole in the distant northern sky. The Bible calls this spot \" Baal-peor \" : Baal, \" the lord,\" Peor, \" the open- ing.\" Israel fell into the worship of this dreadful nature cult and was accordingly punished (Num. xxv:3-5). Nature or creature worship always dies hard. In Ezekiel's time this evil thing had not yet been extirpated (Ezek. viii : Y-10). In the winter the sun, being in southern latitudes, was of course far away from this hole which was the only place in the heavens where he could be seen, hence Tammuz was lost. In the prophet's vision every man saw this \"in the chambers of his imagery\" (v. 12). In other words, like Ptolemy's rings, this cult was only an echo. Bel worship was indeed a terrible thing. Confusion's place was at this sky-hole or ' gate of God.' It is recorded that the prophet came to \" the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz\" (v. 14). Tammuz means \"the hidden lost one.\" Tammuz, it will plainly be seen, was originally the hidden sun, and even at this time it was known that this weeping was for the sun. Sun worship was then in full possession of the Lord's house itself (v. 16). It is recorded of Tammuz that he was seen bleeding. This is easily accounted for, as the great sky-hole must have often been decked out in ruddy or sunset hues. This door or opening into the Jieavens proved like the serpent a snare. It is more than likely that our Saviour referred to it when he said, \" I am the door,\" the way,\" \" the truth,\" \" the life.\" The door of the shining hole produced a stupendous error, but 170 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS now we know that first (natural) things must perish that the last (spiritual) may live. The Indians of northern California have a legend which localizes this sky-hole over Mount Shasta. They say that the Creator made it first. The account is as follows : \" Bor- ing a hole in the sky, using a large stone as an auger, he pushed down snow and ice until they reached the desired height; then he stepped from cloud to cloud down to the great icy pile, and from it to the earth, where he planted the first trees by merely putting his finger into the soil here and there. The sun began to melt the snow; the snow pro- duced water ; the water ran down the sides of the mountains, refreshed the trees, and made rivers. The Creator gathered the leaves that fell from the trees, blew upon them, and they became birds, etc.\" 28 The story of Odysseus in the cave of Calypso (Greek Kalupto, to cover) is but one of the many myths which have arisen from this same scene. In Calypso's grotto-cave, located in the Isle of Ogygia, in the hub of the sky sea, were stars or nails that were fixed in the wondrous azure blue. This was the egg-land, or beginning place where man first learned astronomy. Man in those early days not only knew God through the gospel of the stars, but also through the beauties of the canopy, which were to them who were of a true heart a guide and type to things celestial. One of the most glorious types was that of the cherubim. When the flaming sword, the bright shaft of sunlight, first pierced the Edenic canopy, the sun itself floated as in a vapor arc or shell accompanied by four mock suns surrounded with halos. These were the cherubim, types of the redeemed in future glory, true consorts of the living Son of God. The first like a lion, the demean beast which Hercules the sun was sent to slay. The second, \" like a calf,\" the solar bull Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 90. GENESIS 171 famed in the mythology of the ancients. The third had a face as a man, made in the image of the solar orb. The fourth, a flying eagle the winged disk being Assyria's old emblem of the sun. In Genesis iii, the cherubim appear as guardians of God's abode and of the spiritual treasures reserved therein. The passage which should on all grounds be compared is Ezek. xxviii : 13-17. Ezekiel states that he was by the river of Chebar (chap, i: 3) when he received this word. This river was a large, navigable canal, not far from Mppur, southeast of Babylon. 29 But we are not concerned with the site; it is not where the prophet had the vision that interests us, but it is the substance, the mythological fact. It does not follow that he actually saw the wheels; what the text tells us is that he saw a vision. In his mind's eye he saw what even then probably was a remote occurrence. \" In Ezekiel xxviii : 13-17 there is a description where the e prince of Tyre ' is represented as a glorious being bedecked with gold and precious stones, who had been placed ' in Eden, the garden of God,' had there ( walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire ' (i.e., flashing gems), but had forfeited his high estate by pride, and had been expelled from the holy ' mountain of God ' by a cherub. Ezekiel, it is probable, had access to traditions about Para- dise more ample than those preserved in Genesis, and per- haps in some respects different from them ; and he makes use of them here for the purpose of representing pictorially the fall of the King of Tyre.\" 30 \" And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly ; yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind.\" The same authority says of the passage just cited : \" Ps. xviii : 10 would suggest that the conception arose in a personification of the thunder-cloud 29 University of Pennsylvania texts, vol. ix, p. 28. 80 Westminster Commentaries, Gen. The Cherubim, p. 61. 172 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS (upon, or within, which, as the context of the verse plainly shews, the Hebrews believed Jehovah to be borne along).\" 31 From the ' prince of Tyre ' to Satan, or ' the prince of the power of the air/ is only a step. Satan in Arabic means a serpent. The apostle was sent, To open certain eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan or the serpent unto God (Acts xxvi: 18). In other words, His commission was to turn men from the material to the spiritual, from the darkness, the seed of which was planted by the canopy, to the light. And this light we find is bearing fruit abundantly in the scientific revelations of this present age. The prince of the power of the air (Eph. ii: 2) is the prince of this world, and he is cast out (John xii: 31). The serpent was a vapor-belt. Moses lifted up a figure still known to all the people in that day as a memorial of a creation that had passed away, and they were to look by faith for a new order in a coming Saviour. The barber's pole is still a survival of serpent symbolism amongst us. The ribbon painted spirally around their sign represented originally the serpent. Formerly the barbers were doctors, thus naturally they adopted the sign and symbol of the healer. The old creation that had passed was an Eden, but because the people worshiped the creature instead of the Great Creator, the God of Nature was forced to reveal Him- self and to cast down the serpent upon the ground. The Eden conditions passed, and man has had to earn his liveli- hood by the sweat of his brow ever since. Jer. x: 11-12; Isa. xix: 1; Rev. xii: 9, 15. This last quotation shows how the error of the ages has lived on down to our time. Ps. xix: 1; Job xxvi: 8-13; Gen. iii: 1, 14; Isa. xxvii: 1; Ps. Ixxiv: 13-15.

CHAPTER XIV HINDU MYTHS \" THE gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.\" * Vedic literature contains the record of five elements, fire, water, earth, air, and nature, the latter containing Agni, the ' Golden Germ/ which is evidently the creative power seen in the fire ring or belt. Edward Washburn Hopkins says : \" The world was at first water ; thereon floated a cosmic golden egg (the principle of fire). Out of this came Spirit that desired ; and by desire he begat the worlds and all things. It is improbable that in this somewhat Orphic mystery there lies any pre- Vedic myth. The notion comes up first in the golden germ and egg-born bird (sun) of the Rik. It is not specially Aryan, and is found even among the American Indians.\" 2 From the canopy continually came new sky-scenes which the ancients thought were manifestations of their gods, hence according to their records \" Agni is Varuna and is Indra.\" Plainly Agni, the reflected light of the sun, was seen in Varuna and in Indra. All fire was seen emerging from the upper dome of gauze. Hopkins describes the attributes of Indra as follows : \" Indra has been identified with f storm/ with the ' sky/ with the ' year ' ; also with ' sun ' and with e fire ' in general. But if he be taken as he is found in the hymns, it will be noticed at once that he is too stormy to be the sun; too luminous to be the storm; too near to the phenomena of the monsoon to be the year or the sky ; too rainy to be fire ; too alien from every one thing to be any one thing. He is too celestial to be wholly atmospheric; too atmospheric to be celestial ; too earthly to be either. A most tempting solution 1 Tennyson. 2 \"The Religions of India,\" chap, ix, p. 208. 174 HINDU MYTHS 175 is that offered by Bergaigne, who sees in Indra sun or light- ning. Yet does this explanation not explain all, and it is more satisfactory than others only because it is broader; while it is not yet broad enough. Indra, in Bergaigne's opinion, stands, however, nearer to fire than to sun.\" 3 Indra was the clear sky or sun. Dyaus also was the true sky. His name is derived from Dyu \" to shine.\" Zeus comes from the same root. O Agni, give us eyes that we may see The mighty Indra, in his shining car, Ride o'er the canopy, the great enfolder! His golden whip, the ray of penciled light, In his strong arms. His ruddy cheeks aglow The clear-sky of the heavens towards the poles All reddened by prismatic rays of light. The golden helmet of the crowned sun, Like a lamp flaming in a heavy mist All nature proving that the gods are one. O Agni! Thou art terrible. We fear! \"Yea, when the waters covered everywhere \" They held the germ, they generated light \"Then came from the one spirit, breath of gods. \" May he not hurt us, he the Lord of beings.\" May he not hurt us. Agni, hurt us not! 4 Indra the clear sky conquered all the Asura, including Varuna Asura, the dragon serpent, whose eyes were magni- fied additions or haloes of the sun. She grew up over and covered all the other Asuras, as a canopy drifting towards the poles always did. Zenaide A. Eagozin says : \" Now, Sanskrit has a root vri, ' to cover ' a prolific one, which can be traced in many words of kindred meanings and one of its most direct for- mations is this very name of Yaruna. It is as though we called the sky ' the coverer, the enfolder/ * * * All ancient peoples used to say that ' the heavens cover or 3 Ibid., ch. iv, pp. 91-92. 4 Adapted to the present interpretation. After a famous hymn, etc., from the Rig Veda. 176 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS encompass the earth and all it contains/ sometimes adding ' like a tent ? or ' like a roof ' and meant it literally, not metaphorically.\" 5 \" I will sing forth unto the universal king a high, deep prayer, dear to renowned Varuna, who, as a butcher a hide, has struck earth apart (from the sky) for the sun. Varuna has extended air in trees, strength in horses, milk in cows, and has laid wisdom in hearts ; fire in water ; the sun in the sky; soma in the stone. Varuna has inverted his water- barrel and let the two worlds with the space between flow with. With this (heavenly water-barrel) he, the king of every created thing, wets the whole world, as a rain does a meadow. He wets the world, both earth and heaven, when he, Varuna, chooses to milk out (water).\" 6 Varuna is the universal encompasser, the canopy. He stands in mid-air like Parjanya and upsets a water-barrel. Agni is the light or fire in the water-sky; afterwards he is earthly fire. To place on the altar that which was seen in the sky was a natural sequence. Fire worship is the logical result of seeing fire in heaven. Indra is the true sun seen floating above Varuna in a boat or vapor-arc. In the Egyp- tian myth, Nu-t is depicted as a water-sky with stars above her. The hymns and prayers to these Vedic gods are naturally much confused, for the reason that the ever-chang- ing features of the zonal cloud system resulted in the votaries of one age emphasizing a feature known as a god which the peoples of a following generation perhaps could not distin- guish. Thus Indra might be obscured by Varuna Asura growing up over and covering him from view. \" He, men, is Indra,\" as the Vedas say, and Agni is Varuna and is Indra. This confusion was caused by the ever-changing appearance of the sky-scene. It reminds us of the confusion of tongues at Babel. He slew the snake 6 \"The Story of Vedic India,\" ch. v, fl 8, pp. 140, 141, 6 \" Religions of India,\" pp. 65-66. Rig Veda T, 85, HINDU MYTHS 177 that lay upon the hills. He Vritra slew. Watched by the snake, the waters stood on high. What time the water-cov- ered cave he opened, the waters freed. Like bellowing kine they swiftly flowed to earth. 7 The text says : \" He men is Indra of the long red beard.\" There are several features about Indra that reminds us of Thor, the Scandinavian thunder god, Jove the thunderer, and of Samson. Both Indra and Thor had lightning or fire beards. Samson's hair also figured as a cause of his strength. He set fire to the corn of the Philistines (Judges xv: 45). In Indra's fight with Vritra, the former's thunderbolt is all- powerful. 8 \" He men is Indra of the long red beard \" is plainly the same as Hercules. The Acvins were the two pillars of light seen in the canopy at night. The canopy that is, the north and south belts caught the rays of the sun from the under- world, making two pillars. These* were the Pillars of Her- cules. They were the < Horsemen,' twin sons of Dyaus. Their steeds, the whirling belts, were ever in motion. The Maruts, whose name means the shining, gleaming ones, always accompanied the storm bringer, Indra. Their mother was the variegated cow, Pricni, the mother cloud. 9 These warlike Maruts thus spoke to Indra bragging what they had done : \" Thou hast indeed done great things, O mighty one, with us for thy helpers, through our equal valor. But we Maruts, O strong Indra, can perform many great deeds by our power when we so desire.\" Indra retorts : \" By my own inborn might, O Maruts, I slew Vritra. Through my own wrath I grew so strong. It was I who, wielding the lightning, opened the way for the shining waters to run down for men.\" 10 T Rig Veda i, 32.2 and v. 11. 8 Hopkins, \" The Religions of India,\" chap, xiv, p. 357. IUd., p. 97. 10 Rig Veda i, 165. Ragozin, \" Vedic India,\" p. 211. 12 178 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS The Maruts knuckled and admitted that Indra had \" no equal among the gods.\" Yet they too were immortal. The whole story is that of Hercules and the many-headed Hydra. One of these heads proved immortal, which signifies that the storm winds cannot be subjugated by the- sun ; those heads which Hercules killed being the violent personifications of the Ice age. The Maoris of New Zealand have a story entitled i The Legend of the Children of Heaven and Earth/ It was taken down by Sir George Grey many years ago, and though it is somewhat lengthy, it will bear perusal in this connection. We would have the reader note especially the character of Tawhiri-ma-tea (the immortal storm-head). \" Men had but one pair of primitive ancestors ; they sprang from the vast heaven that exists above us, and from the earth which lies beneath us. According to the traditions of our race, Rangi and Papa, or Heaven and Earth, were the source from which, in the beginning, all things origi- nated. Darkness then rested upon the heaven and upon the earth, and they still both clave together, for they had not yet been rent apart ; and the children they had begotten were ever thinking amongst themselves what might be the differ- ence between darkness and light ; they knew that beings had multiplied and increased, and yet light had never broken upon them, but it ever continued dark. Hence those sayings are found in our ancient religious services : ( There was darkness from the first division of time unto the tenth, to the hundredth, to the thousandth,' that is, for a vast space of time; and these divisions of time were considered as beings, and were each termed a Po. \" At last the beings who had been begotten by Heaven and the Earth, worn out by the continued darkness, consulted amongst themselves, saying, Let us now determine what we should do with Rangi and Papa, whether it would be better to slay them, or to rend them apart. Then spoke Tu-ma- HINDU MYTHS 179 tauenga, the fiercest of the children of Heaven and Earth, ' It is well, let us slay them/ \" Then spake Tane-mahuta, the father of forests and of all things that inhabit them or that are constructed from trees, ' Nay, not so. It is better to rend them apart, and to let the heaven stand far above us, and the earth lie under our feet. Let the sky become as a stranger to us, but the earth remain close to us as our nourishing mother.' The brothers all consented to this proposal, with the exception of Tawhiri-ma-tea, the father of winds and storms, and he, fearing that his kingdom was about to be overthrown, grieved greatly at the thought of his parents' being torn apart. Five of the brothers willingly consented to the separation of their parents, but one of them would not agree to it. \" The brothers all tried, in vain. The god and father of the cultivated food of man, god and father of fish and rep- tiles, etc. every one failed. Then at last slowly uprises Tane-mahuta, the god and father of forests, of birds, and of insects, and he struggles with his parents ; in vain he strives to rend them apart with his hands and arms. Lo, he pauses, his head is now firmly planted on his mother, the earth, his feet he raises up and rests against his father, the skies; he strains his back and limbs with mighty effort. Now are rent apart Rangi and Papa, and with cries and groans of woe they shriek aloud. c Wherefore slay you thus your parents? Why commit you so dreadful a crime as to slay us, as to rend your parents apart ? ' But Tane-mahuta pauses not, he regards not their shrieks and cries ; far beneath him he presses down the earth, far, far above him he thrusts up the sky. \" Hence these sayings of olden time : ' It was the fierce thrusting of Tane which tore the heaven from the earth so that they were rent apart, and darkness was made manifest, and so was light.' \" No sooner was heaven rent from the earth than the mul- 180 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS titiide of human beings were discovered whom they had begotten, and who had hitherto lain concealed between the bodies of Rangi and Papa. \" The legend next describes how Tawhiri-ma-tea, god and father of winds and storms, arose and followed his father to the realms above, hurrying to the sheltered hollows of the boundless skies, to hide and cling and nestle there. Fierce desire came to him to wage war against his brethren who had done such unhandsome deed to their parents. ' Then came forth his progeny, the mighty winds, the fierce squalls, the clouds, dense, dark, fiery, wildly bursting ; and in their midst their father rushed upon his foe.' Tane-mahuta and his giant forests were taken unawares, unsuspecting, when the raging hurricane burst upon them, the mighty trees were snapped in twain, prostrated, trunks and branches left torn upon the ground for insect and grub to prey on. The sea was swept and tossed with wild surgings and mountain waves till Tangaroa, god of the ocean and father of all that dwell therein, became affrighted and fled. His children, the parents of fish on the one hand and of reptiles on the other, fled, the one into the depths of the sea, the other into the recesses of the shore, amid the forests and the scrubs. \" The storm-god attacked his brothers, the gods and pro- genitors of the tilled food and the wild, but Papa, the Earth, caught them up and hid them, and he searched and swept to find them, in vain. He fell upon the last of his brothers, the father of fierce men, but him he could not even move. Man stood erect, unshaken upon the bosom of his mother earth. e At last the hearts of the Heaven and the Storm became tran- quil, and their passion was assuaged.' \" But now Tu-ma-tauenga, father of fierce men, became stirred to attack. He was minded to avenge himself upon his brethren who had left him unaided to stand against the god of storms. He twisted nooses of the leaves of the whanake tree, and the birds and beasts, children of the forest-god, HINDU MYTHS 181 fell before him; netted nets of the flax plant and dragged ashore the fish; he digged in the ground and brought up the sweet potato and all cultivated food, the fern root and all wild growing food. He overcame every one of the brothers, all but the storm-god, who still ever attacks him in tempest and hurricane, seeking to destroy him both by sea and by land. It was in one of these attacks that the dry land was made to disappear beneath the waters. \" The beings of ancient days who thus submerged the land were Terrible-rain, Long-continued-rain, Fierce-hail- storms ; and their progeny were Mist, Heavy-dew, and Light- dew, and thus but little of the dry land was left standing above the sea. \" From that time clear light increased upon the earth, and all the beings which were hidden between Rangi and Papa before they were separated now multiplied upon the earth. The first beings begotten by Rangi and Papa were not like human beings; but Tu-ma-tauenga bore the likeness of a man, as did all his brothers. \" Up to this time the vast Heaven has still ever remained separate from his spouse, the Earth. Yet their mutual love still continues, the soft warm sighs of her loving bosom still ever rise up to him, ascending from the woody mountains and valleys, and men call these mists; and the vast Heaven, as he mourns through the long nights his separation from his beloved, drops frequent tears upon her bosom, and men, see- ing these, term them dew-drops.\" 11 This long citation shows the similarity of the many- headed storm-king myth throughout the world. The lifting of the canopy was invariably followed by a season of tem- pestuous violence. But let us return to the Hindu legends. The Eig Veda, which is the oldest Hindu authority, is a compiled work, containing many additions of a later day; u Grey's Polynesian Mythology, pp. 1-5, 14, 15, as quoted by Charles De B. Mills, \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 269-274. 182 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS thus hymns that first expressed the scenes of a water sky were afterwards in part rearranged to adapt them to the changed conditions. But this will become clearer to us as we peruse the following selections taken from the Second Series of Auld Lang Syne. It will be noted that these mostly record the scenes of the vapor-belt and canopy period. HYMN TO SAVITRI SUN. (RIG- VEDA i, 35, 2.) (6) Three skies are there of SavitH, two places, And one in Yama's realm that holds our heroes, Immortals mounted on the chariot's axle, Let him speak out who understands this saying. (7) The glorious bird (the sun) has lighted-up the heaven, The guide divine, whose wings are deeply sounding j Where is the sun? Who knows it now, to tell us, Which of the heavens his ray may have illumined? Naturally, the sun was first addressed when seen through the vapor-sky, where in the imagination he appeared as a spirit riding in a golden chariot, drawn by brilliant horses. The next step noted is that the figurative speech remained after the canopy and vapor-belt had passed away and the sun was seen in its true glory. Thus we read, Rig- Veda i, 27, 10 : The stars fixed high in heaven and shining brightly By night, say, where have they gone by day-time? The laws of Varuwa are everlasting, The moon moves on by night in brilliant splendor. It does not follow from this that because the stars were seen the last canopy or ring had dissipated. This evidence is simply to be classed with the records which the ancient Chinese, Egyptians, and Chaldeans kept of the eclipses. These records, together with the other astronomical data of the ancients, merely show that the true sky was seen at times. Yea, even if we are forced to grant that the skies were com- pletely cleared from all belted-cloud phenomena at the time of these recorded astronomical events, it only removes the actual appearances of the cloud phenomena into a more HINDU MYTHS 183 remote past. Who can gainsay such evidence as is found in the following (hymn X, 129) : Nor aught nor naught existed: yon bright sky Was not, nor heaven's broad woof outstretched above; What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed? Was it the waters' fathomless abyss? Again we quote from the same hymn: Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled In gloom profound, an ocean without light j The germ that still lay covered in the husk Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat. Here is another selection taken from the Hymn, To Katri, Night. (1) The Night comes near and looks about, The goddess with her many eyes, She has put on her glories all. (2) Immortal, she has filled the space, Both far and wide, both low and high, She conquers darkness with her light. (3) She has undone her sister, Dawn, The goddess Night, as she approached, And utter darkness flies away. Max Miiller says : \" We must remember that the night to the Yedic poet was not the same as darkness, but that, on the contrary, when the night had driven away the day, she was supposed to lighten the darkness, and even to rival her sister, the bright day, with her starlight beauty. The night, no doubt, gives peace and rest, yet the Dawn is looked upon as the kindlier light, and is implored to free mortals from the dangers of the night, as debtors are freed from a debt. Many conjectural alterations have been proposed in this hymn, but it seems to me to be intelligible as it stands.\" 12 From the standpoint of the additional light shed by the \"\"Auld Lang Syne/' Second Series, p. 255. 184 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS present hypothesis, this hymn becomes still more intelli- gible. At night the sunlight from below illuminated the canopy ; in the words of the hymn, \" She conquered darkness with her light.\" In connection with the lesson of the pyra- mids, this hymn becomes clearer, and the midnight hour of the \" shade \" and of \" Death \" is indeed a revelation. (8) Like cows, I brought this hymn to thee, As to a conqueror, child of Dyaus. Accept it graciously, O Night! The \" cows \" mentioned in the text refers without ques- tion to the clouds, and brings at once to our attention all the solar bulls of mythology. Sarama had cloud-cattle stolen by the Pani-robbers. Sarama went after them, and the fol- lowing conversation took place: \" The Panis: ' With what intention did Sarama reach this pla.ce? for the way is far and leads tortuously away. What is thy wish with us ? Didst travel safely ? (or, ' how was the night?') How didst thou cross the waters of the Easa ? ' ff Sarama : ' I came sent as the messenger of Indra, desiring, O Panis, your great treasures. This preserved me from the fear of crossing, and thus I crossed the waters of the Rasa.' \" The Panis: e Who is he ? what looks he like, this Indra, whose herald you have hastened from afar? Let him come here, we will make friends with him, then he may be the herdsman of our cows.' \"Sarama: ( Ye cannot injure him, but he can injure, whose herald I have hastened from afar. Deep rivers cannot overwhelm him ; you, Panis, soon shall be cut down by Indra.' ff The Panis: ' Those cows, O Sarama, which thou cam'st to seek, are flying round the ends of the sky. O darling, who would give up to thee without a fight? for, in truth, our weapons too are sharp.' \" 13 18 Rig- Veda x, 108. Eagozin, \"Vedic India,\" p. 257. HINDU MYTHS 185 We have already sketched some of the attributes of Indra, the conquering sun. He was also a cow or cloud disperser. He slew the awful \" demon-cloud \" ; also Yal or Vritra, him of speed, the great snake, the great restrainer. He, men, was Indra, the cloud compeller. \" He who fixed firm the moving earth ; who tranquillized the incensed mountains ; who spread the spacious firmament ; who consolidated the heavens: he, men, is Indra. \" He who, having destroyed Ahi, set free the seven rivers; who recovered the cows retained by Bal; who gen- erated fire in the clouds ; who is invincible in battle ; he, men, is Indra.\" 14 It is an interesting fact that England's patron, Saint George, is borrowed from this scene. The battle of Indra and Ahi is analogous and equivalent to that between Saint George and the Dragon. Other prototypes are Hercules and the Hydra, Perseus and the sea-monster, Sigurd and Eafnir, Beowulf and Grendel. \" All this is descriptive of the deliv- erance of the earth,\" says Charles De B. Mills, \" from the fangs of a monster, either the storm-cloud in the case of Herakles the throttling serpents of night or the icy prison of cold, of winter.\" Nay, but we know that it is all summed up in one monster the overhanging snake-belt under the canopy. Mr. Mills goes on to say : \" What causes surprise is the universality of this speech. It is everywhere, certainly wherever any of the Aryan race are found. Nay, there are traces of the same essential story in the literatures of the Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Babylonians. In Saint George we have the myth Christianized, touched afresh with new colors, and the hero thus presented has become one of the most venerated and popular of all the saints in the calendar. The patron saint of England now since early in the fifteenth century, he has been also that of Aragon and Portugal, and \"Murray's Manual of Mythology, 20th ed., p. 372. 186 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the order of the knights of Saint George has been widely instituted. In the time of the crusades he appeared once in light on the walls of Jerusalem, waving his sword, and led the victorious assault on the Holy City. Is it not wonder- ful that he has been so long and gratefully remembered ? \" 15 Sky-scenes were essentially ephemeral, thus all through Vedic literature the changing of names and of the meanings of words is in evidence, and so just as we have seen the English saint, originally a sun-god, become a being leading armies of men to victory, so also the Hindus, like all the other peoples of their day (and of the days that have since passed), endeavored to keep abreast of the times. Deva Surya, ' shining one/ is an illustration of this truth. Surya means the red ball of the sun ; afterwards he became Savitar, ' enlivener.' He proved to be the burner death. 16 This burning one was the racing canopy. Max Miiller says of it: \" One of the most intelligible names given to the sun was Asva, the racer, or Dadhikravan or V&gm (horse). And while at one time the sun was a racer, at another the sun was conceived as approaching men and standing on a chariot which was drawn by horses, as in Greek mythology. Thus we read, Kig-Veda i, 35, 2 : ' The god Savit (the sun), approaching on the dark-blue sky, sustaining mortals and immortals, comes on his golden chariot, beholding all the worlds.' \" 17 Hopkins gives the hymn as follows: Through space of darkness wending comes he hither, Who puts to rest th' immortal and the mortal, On golden car existent things beholding, The god that rouses, Savitar, the shining; Comes he, the shining one, comes forward, upward, Comes with two yellow steeds, the god revered, Comes shining Savitar from out the distance, All difficulties far away compelling. His pearl-adorned, high, variegated chariot, \"\"The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 76-77. 16 Rig- Veda, liv, 2. \"\"Auld Lang Syne,\" Second Series, p. 194. HINDU MYTHS 187 Of which the pole is golden, he, reverSd, Hath mounted, Savitar, whose beams are brilliant, Against the darksome spaces strength assuming. Among the people gaze the brown white-footed (Steeds) that the chariot drag whose pole is golden. All peoples stand, and all things made, forever, Within the lap of Savitar, the heavenly. (There are three heavens of Savitar, two low ones, One, men-restraining, in the realm of Yama. As on (his) chariot-pole stand all immortals, Let him declare it who has understood it ! ) Across air-spaces gazes he, the eagle, Who moves in secret, th' Asura, well-guiding, Where is (bright) Surya now? who understands it? And through which sky is now his ray extending ? 18 It has already been pointed out that the Acvins were the two halves of the divided canopy. They were like two great mountains, the one to the north, the other in the south. Warren says of them: \" A striking parallel to the Egyptian and Akkadian idea of two opposed polar mountains, an arctic and an antarctic the one celestial and the other infernal is found among the ancient inhabitants of India. The celestial mountain they called Su-Meru, the infernal one Ku-Meru. In the Hindu Puranas the size and splendors of the former are presented in the wildest exaggerations of Oriental fancy. Its height, according to some accounts, is not less than eight hundred and forty thousand miles, its diameter at the summit three hundred and twenty thousand. Four enormous buttress mountains, situated at mutually opposite points of the hori- zon, surround it. One account makes the eastern side of Meru of the color of the ruby, its southern that of the lotus, its western that of gold, its northern that of coral. On its summit is the vast city of Brahma, fourteen thousand leagues in extent. Around it, in the cardinal points and the inter- 18 \"Religions of India,\" p. 49, Rig- Veda i, 35. 188 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS mediate quarters, are situated the magnificent cities of Indra and the other regents of >he spheres. The city of Brahma, in the centre of the eight, is surrounded by a moat of sweet flowing celestial waters, a kind of river of the water of life (Ganga), which, after encircling the city, divides into four mighty rivers flowing towards four opposite points of the horizon, and descending into the equatorial ocean which engirdles the earth. \" Sometimes Mount Meru is represented as planted so firmly and deeply in the globe that the antarctic or infernal mountain is only a projection of its lower end. Thus the Surya Siddhanta says : f A collection of manifold jewels, a mountain of gold, is Meru, passing through the middle of the earth-globe (bhugola), and protruding on either side. At its upper end are stationed along with Indra the gods and the great sages (maJiarishis) ; at its lower end, in like manner, the demons have their abode each (class) the enemy of the other. Surrounding it on every side is fixed, next, this great ocean, like a girdle about the earth, separating the two hemispheres of the gods and of the demons.\" 19 The four mighty rivers above referred to as flowing down- wards towards the four opposite points of the horizon were four snakes. At an early date in the mythology of the Hindus the great snakes and the little snakes are said to have taken sides. Divine snakes grouped with other celestial powers disputed for victory over earthly combatants. This is a record of the fact that as time wore on the cult which owed its origin to the original sky-scenes was becoming con- taminated. The scenes that gave birth to the myths had passed away and the people were prone to forget. In a footnote on these times Hopkins says: \" The snakes belong to Yaruna and his region, as de- scribed in v. 98. It is on the head of the earth-upholding snake Cesha that Vishnu muses, iii, 203, 12. The reverence \"\"Paradise Found,\" pp. 129-130. HINDU MYTHS 189 paid to serpents begins to be ritual in the Atharva Veda. Even in the Kig Veda there is the deification of the cloud- snake. In later times they answered to the Nymphs, being tutelary guardians of streams and rivers (Buhler). In i, 36, Cesha Ananta supports earth, and it is told why he does so. 99 20 Vishnu means \" knowledge.\" Avatar means \" Descent from somewheres to this earth.\" The gods descended when the canopy fell and brought knowledge to men. The duration of the time of the gods' own lives and of the divine heavens, unlike the Greeks' notion of the four ages which include all time, in India embraces only a fraction of time. \" Starting at any one point of eternity, there is, accord- ing to the Hindu belief,\" says Hopkins, \" a preliminary ' dawn ' of a new cycle of ages. This dawn lasts four hun- dred years, and is then followed by the real age (the first of ' four), which last four thousand years, and has again a twi- light ending of four hundred years in addition. This first is the Krita age, corresponding to the classical Golden Age. Its characteristics are that in it everything is perfect ; right eternal now exists in full power.\" 21 These ages are a long-drawn-out affair. \"No doubt the epoch-making events of canopy decline through which primi- tive man passed moulded his thoughts in this direction and gave birth to the idea of dividing time up into ages. In Hindu expression, this cycle of the ages always repeats itself anew. The four horses of Eevelations (ch. vi) are another in- stance of the fourfold division of early time. In all parts of the world the same divisions seem to have been observed, and the inference is that there actually was something in canopy time which caused these ages to be noted. 20 \"The Religions of India,\" chap, xiv, p. 376. 81 \"Religions of India,\" ch. xv, p. 419. 190 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" The ' Popul Vuh,' the national book of the Quiches, tells us of four ages of the world. The man of the first age was made of clay ; he was i strengthless, inept, watery ; he could not move his head, his face looked but one way; his sight was restricted, he could not look behind him ' (that is, he had no knowledge of the past) ; ' he had been endowed with language, but he had no intelligence, so he was con- sumed in the water.' \" Then followed a higher race of men ; they filled the world with their progeny ; they had intelligence but no moral sense; ' they forgot the Heart of Heaven.' They were de- stroyed by fire and pitch from heaven, accompanied by tre- mendous earthquakes, from which only a few escaped. \" Then followed a period when all was dark, save the white light as yet of the primeval world. \" Once more are the gods in council, in the darkness, in the night of a desolated universe. \" Then the people prayed to God for light, evidently for the return of the sun. \"'Hail! O Creator!' they cried. 'O Former! Thou that hearest and understandest us ! abandon us not ! forsake us not ! O God, thou art in heaven and on earth ; O Heart of Heaven ! O Heart of Earth ! give us descendants, and a pos- terity as long as the light endure.' \" It was thus they spake, living tranquilly, invoking the return of the light ; waiting the rising of the sun ; watching the star of the morning, precursor of the sun. But no sun came, and the four men and their descendants grew uneasy. * We have no person to watch over us,' they said ; ' nothing to guard our symbols ! ' Then they adopted gods of their own, and waited. They kindled fires, for the climate was colder; then there fell great rains and hail-storms, and put out their fires. Several times they made fires, and several times the rains and storms extinguished them. Many other trials also they underwent in Tulan, famines and such things, HINDU MYTHS 191 and a general dampness and cold for the earth was moist, there being no sun. * * * \"Many generations seem to have grown up and perished under the sunless skies, ' waiting for the return of the light ' ; for the ' Popul Vuh ' tells us that l here also the language of all the families was confused, so that no one of the first .four men could any longer understand the speech of the others.' * * * \" This shows that many, many years it may he cen- turies must have elapsed before that vast volume of mois- ture, carried up by evaporation, was able to fall back in snow and rain to the land and sea, and allow the sun to shine through ' the blanket of the dark/ Starvation encoun- tered the scattered fragments of mankind. \" And in these same Quiche legends of Central America we are told : ' The persons of the godhead were enveloped in the darkness which enshrouded a desolated world/ \" 22 \" The Aztecs,\" says Prescott, \" felt the curiosity, common to man in almost every stage of civilization, to lift the veil which covers the mysterious past and the more awful future. They sought relief, like the nations of the Old Continent, from the oppressive idea of eternity, by breaking it up into distinct cycles, or periods of time, each of several thousand years' duration. There were four of these cycles, and at the end of each, by the agency of one of the elements, the human family was swept from the earth, and the sun blotted out from the heavens, to be again rekindled.\" 23 Quetzalcoatl was the god of the air, the good canopy. \" Under him,\" says Prescott, \" the earth teemed with fruits and flowers, without the pains of culture. An ear of Indian corn was as much as a single man could carry. The cotton, as it grew, took, of its own accord, the rich dyes of human 22 Bancroft's \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 46, as quoted by Donnelly in \" Ragnarok,\" pp. 216-218. 23 \"History of the Conquest of Mexico,\" vol. i, ch. iii, p. 64. 192 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS art. The air was filled with intoxicating perfumes and the sweet melody of birds. In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place in the mythic systems of so many nations in the Old World. It was the golden ag& of Anahuac.\" 24 \" The reader has already been made acquainted with the Aztec system of four great cycles,\" says the famous historian, \" at the end of each of which the world was destroyed, to be . again regenerated. The belief in these periodical convulsions of nature, through the agency of some one or other of the ele- ments, was familiar to many countries in the Eastern hemi- sphere; and, though varying in detail, the general resem- blance of outline furnishes an argument in favor of a common origin. \" No tradition has been more widely spread among nations than that of a Deluge. Independently of tradition, indeed, it would seem to be naturally suggested by the inte- rior structure of the earth, and by the elevated places on which marine substances are found to be deposited. It was the received notion, under some form or other, of the most civilized people in the Old World, and of the barbarians of the New. The Aztecs combined with this some particular circumstances of a more arbitrary character, resembling the accounts of the East. They believed that two persons sur- vived the Deluge a man, named Coxcox, and his wife. Their heads are represented in ancient paintings, together with a boat floating on the waters, at the foot of a mountain. A dove is also depicted, with the hieroglyphical emblem of languages in his mouth, which he is distributing to the chil- dren of Coxcox, who were born dumb. The neighboring people of Michoacan, inhabiting the same high plains of the Andes, had a still further tradition, that the boat in which Tezpi, their Noah, escaped, was filled with various kinds of animals and birds. After some time, a vulture was sent out from it, but remained feeding on the dead bodies of \"Ibid., p. 61. HINDU MYTHS 193 the giants, which had been left on the earth, as the waters subsided. The little humming-bird, huitzitzilin, was then sent forth, and returned with a twig in its mouth. The coin- cidence of both these accounts with the Hebrew and Chaldean narratives is obvious. It were to be wished that the authority for the Michoacan version were more satisfactory.\" 25 This account of the Deluge, though evidently grafted from the Old World, brings us back to our Hindu legends. Manu was the Hindu Noah. The human race, according to this legend, was preserved through a compact which was made between him and the god, Vishnu, who was incarnate in many strange forms and things, each one of which was an avatar. The account of the famous flood avatar is as follows : \" In the morning they brought water to Manu to wash with, even as they bring it to-day to wash hands with. While he was washing a fish came into his hands. The fish said, ' Keep me, and I will save thee.' f What wilt thou save me from ? ' ' A flood will sweep away all creatures on earth. I will save thee from that/ ' How am I to keep thee ? ' ' As long as we are small/ said he (the fish), e we are sub- ject to much destruction ; fish eats fish. Thou shalt keep me first in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou shalt dig a hole, and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou shalt take me down to the sea, for there I shall be beyond destruction.' \" It soon became a (great horned fish called a) jhasha, for this grows the largest, and then it said : ' The flood will come this summer (or in such a year). Look out for (or worship) me, and build a ship. When the flood rises, enter into the ship, and I will save thee.' After he had kept it he took it down to the sea. And the same summer (year) as the fish had told him he looked out for (or worshiped) the fish ; and built a ship. And when the flood rose he entered into the ship. Then up swam the fish, and Manu tied the ship's *Ilnd.f vol. iii, appendix, part i, pp. 362-364. 13 194 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS rope to the horn of the fish; and thus he sailed swiftly up toward the mountain of the north. ' I have saved thee,' said he (the fish). ' Fasten the ship to a tree. But let not the water leave thee stranded while thou art on the mountain (top). Descend slowly as the water goes down.' So he descended slowly, and that descent of the mountain of the north is called the ( Descent of Manu.' The flood then swept off all the creatures of the earth, and Manu here remained alone.\" 26 This avatar speaks plainly of the descent of both gods and water to this earth. Vishnu is said to have lain on a bed of snakes, so the unknown source, the somewheres of the myth, is clearly the vapor-belt on high. First Yishnu took the form of a fish. In a later avatar he became a strong tortoise, upholding the sky-rim-disk. Another avatar is thus described by Maurice : \" By the power of God there issued from the essence of Brahma a being shaped like a boar, white and exceeding small; this being, in the space of an hour, grew to the size of an elephant of the largest size, and remained in the air. \" Brahma was astonished on beholding this figure, and discovered, by the force of internal penetration, that it could be nothing but the power of the Omnipotent which had assumed a body and become visible. He now felt that God is all in all, and all is from him, and all in him; and said to Mareechee and his sons (the attendant genii) : ' A won- derful animal has emanated from my essence ; at first of the smallest size, it has in one hour increased to this enormous bulk, and, without doubt, it is a portion of the almighty power.' \" They were engaged in this conversation when that vara, or ( boar-form/ suddenly uttered a sound like the loud- est thunder, and the echo reverberated and shook all the quarters of the universe. 26 Hopkins, \"The Religions of India,\" ch. ix, pp. 214-215. HINDU MYTHS 195 \" But still, under this dreadful awe of heaven, a certain wonderful divine confidence secretly animated the hearts of Brahma, Mareechee, and the other genii, who immediately began praises and thanksgiving. That vara (boar-form) figure, hearing the power of the Yedas and Mantras from their mouths, again made a loud noise, and became a dread- ful spectacle. Shaking the full flowing mane which hung down his neck on both sides, and erecting the humid hairs of his body, he proudly displayed his two most exceedingly white tusks ; then, rolling about his wine-colored (red) eyes and erecting his tail, he descended from the region of the air, and plunged headforemost into the water. The whole body of water was convulsed by the motion, and began to rise in waves, while the guardian spirit of the sea, being terrified, began to tremble for his domain and cry for mercy.\" 27 The avatars that follow are nothing but husks built up to sustain the priestly cult. But we must not omit mention- ing Vasuka, the King of Serpents, who was made into a rope to twirl the churn of heaven. It is said that he churned the foaming waters of the sea until the milky waves arose, lashed to whiteness, and in the midst of these mighty convulsions he caused the storm to bring the things of beauty out from the heaving bosom of the deep to their birth. 27 \"Ancient History of Hindustan,\" vol. i, p. 304. CHAPTER XV BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS THE fourth avatar of Vishnu, as we have just seen in our last chapter, was that of the great mountain, \" Mandara the lofty,\" which acted as a churning stick to stir the foam- ing waters of the vapor-belt, the King snake being used as a rope to twirl the stick around. Now, the cloud-mountain always was the home of the gods. The Greeks had their Olympia, the North American Indians had their sky-moun- tain, and the Mohammedan mythology records the fact that Mount Caf, which encircled the earth, was the home of giants. It was said to rest upon the sacred emerald-colored stone, sakhral, whose reflected light was the cause of the tints of the sky. The Scandinavian myths also mention the moun- tain giants, and the Egyptians had their pyramids. That the Babylonian gods lived above or on top of the world- mountain therefore seems quite natural. \" The mountain of the world is also called ' the mountain of the nether world ' (shad Aralu) in the cuneiform inscriptions.\" The gods, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Nebo, Adad, Ninib, and their sublime consorts, were all born in a house situated on top of this mountain. 1 In some form or other, nearly all the peoples of antiquity have left a record of this sky-mountain phenomena, but per- haps the Babylonians and Assyrians have excelled them all. Their zikkurats, or staged towers, were imitations of this mountain, 2 and they were the temples of their gods. \" The 1 \" Explorations in Bible Lands During the Nineteenth Century,\" pp. 464-465. 2 \"To produce the mountain effect, a mound of earth was piled up, and on this mound a terrace was formed that served as the foundation plane for the temple proper, but it was perfectly natural also that 196 BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 197 temple in so far as it was erected to serve as a habitation for the god/' says Jastrow, \" was to be the reproduction of the cosmic E-Kur ' a mountain house ' on a small scale, a miniature Kharsag-kurkura.\" * * * \"In Assyria we find one of the oldest temples bearing the name E-kharsag- kurkura, that stamps the edifice as the reproduction of the ' mountain of all lands.' \" 3 Some of the mountain titles of these deities and their temples were as follows : The name ( zikkurat' itself means ' mountain peak.' Bel's temple at Mppur was ' E-Kur,' the mountain house of Bel. Belit, his consort, was called ' Nin-Khar-Sag,' or the ' lady of the great high mountain.' Bel was often addressed as if he himself were the mountain : ( the great mountain,' ' the lofty Bel,' ' the mighty Bel.' Originally he was the mountain mass in the sky. His deifi- cation did not rob him of his name. In Ur was ' the house of the great mountain,' ' the glo- rious mountain house,' ' the lofty house,' ' the heavenly house,' 'the link of heaven and earth,' ' the summit house.' In Asshur there was ' the house of all the lands ' or ' the house of mountains,' ' the house of the mountain of countries.' At Babylon ' the great house ' was an abode of the same nature. Here the mountain-god was called Marduk, from Maru ('the sun') Duk (u) ('the glorious chamber') 4 : the glorious chamber of the hidden sun. The gods lived in chambers. Jastrow says: \" As the zikkurat represented the mountain on which the gods were born and where they were once supposed to dwell, so the sacred room was regarded as the reproduction of a instead of making the edifice consist of one story, a second was super- imposed on the first, so as to heighten the resemblance to a mountain. The outcome of this ideal was the so-called staged tower, known as the zikkurat. The name signifies simply a ' high ' edifice, and embodies the same idea that led the Canaanites and Hebrews to call their tem- ples ' high places/ Jastrow, \" Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxvi, p. 615. *IUd., pp. 614, 615. *IUd., ch. viii, p. 116. 198 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS portion of the great mountain where the gods assembled in solemn council. This council chamber was situated at the eastern end of the great mountain, and was known as Du-azagga, that is, ' brilliant chamber.' The chamber itself constituted the innermost recess of the eastern limit of the mountain, and the special part of the mountain in which it lay was known as Ubshu-kenna, written with the ideographic equivalents to ' assembly room.' \" 5 Bel of Nippur became associated with Marduk of Baby- lon. The union of the governments of the two cities blended the one god into the other until finally they became united as one deity. Both were solar characters. Probably they rep- resented the same aspect of abstract nature, and since their affinities were the same their union was the logical result when the peoples of the two cities came to realize that they were worshiping the same nature-being. In both places they were worshiping the same god-like mountain. 6 The union of Bel-Mar duk is only one instance of an innumerable host of similar occurrences. Take the leviathan which we read about in Job. He is the crooked serpent (Job xxvi: 13; Ps. xxxiii: 6-7; Isa. xxvii: 1). The swift Acvin or northern canopy of the Hindus, etc., etc. And yet how quickly he becomes associated with our present scene. It is written of him : \" He beholdeth all high things ; he is a king over all the children of pride.\" Chaldaic: \"of all the sons of the mountains \" (Job xli: 34) 6 Ibid., ch. xxvi, p. 629. 6 Marduk was the bright glowing, shining canopy-mountain. He was not the sun itself; only the shiner which was lit by reflection, even at night. Those who believe that his temple, E-Sagili, was a sun- temple will have some difficulty to explain the night prayers that formed a part of his worship. Sayce (Hibbert Lectures, p. 101) says: \" Two hours after nightfall the priest must come and take of the waters of the river; must enter into the presence of Bil, and, putting on a stole in the presence of Bil, must say this prayer, etc.\" BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 199 Ishtar was originally a good canopy. Personified, she was known as * the mother/ for the reason that she seemed to give birth to all, the sky phenomena. 7 She was also known as the ' brilliant goddess/ and as ' the mistress of the moun- tains.' Afterwards she became violent, and the verdant earth under her greenhouse roof trembled. Thus she lost her good character, and the Assyrians, seeing her transformation, henceforth considered her the goddess of battle and war. Her character is like that of the good cherub of Ezekiel (chap, xxviii), who afterwards became a menace and terror. Of this canopy it is written that he was set like Ishtar on the holy mountain. The passage reads as follows : \" Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. \" Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. \" By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned : there- fore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire \" (vs. 1416). In the cosmology of the Chaldeans the mountain of the canopy is very prominent. They imagined that the earth was shaped like an inverted round boat or bowl. A. H. Sayce is authority for the following: \" Heaven itself had not always been e the land of the silver sky ' of later Assyrian belief. The Babylonians once believed that the gods inhabited the snow-clad peak of Eowandiz, 'the mountain of the world ' and ' the mountain of the East/ as it was also termed, which supported the 7 \"The mother\" was a common appellation given to the canopy in all ancient systems of religion. 200 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS starry vault of heaven. It is to this old Babylonian belief that allusion is made in Isaiah xiv: 13, 14, where the Baby- lonian monarch is represented as saying, in his heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will sit also on the mount of the assembly (of the gods) in the extremities of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.' \" 8 \" Above the convex surface of the earth,\" Eagozin says, \"spread the sky (ana), itself divided into two regions: the highest heaven or firmament, which, with the fixed stars immovably attached to it, revolved, as round an axis or pivot, around an immensely high mountain, which joined it to the earth as a pillar. * * * \" Between the lower heaven and the surface of the earth is the atmospheric region, the realm of Im or Mermer, the Wind, where he drives the clouds, rouses the storms, and whence he pours down the rain, which is stored in the great reservoir of Ana, in the heavenly Ocean. As to the earthly Ocean, it is fancied as a broad river, or watery rim, flowing all round the edge of the imaginary inverted bowl; in its waters dwells Ea (whose name means ' the House of Waters '), the great Spirit of the Earth and Waters (Ziki-a), either in the form of a fish, whence he is frequently called ' Ea the fish/ or f the Exalted Fish,' or on a magnificent ship, with which he travels round the earth, guarding and protecting it.\" 9 The people of those early days naturally speculated on the question as to what held the hollow hemisphere of the stretched-out heaven in place. It appeared to them as a solid dome or covering. The Assyriologist of the British Museum, L. W. King, gives us some account of their ideas on this subject. He tells us that they thought that \" both earth and heaven rested upon a great body of water called Apsu, i.e., the Deep.\" Again, some say: 8 \"By-Paths of Bible Knowledge,\" vii; \"Assyria,\" ch. iii, p. 77. 9 \"The Story of Chaldea,\" pp. 153, 154. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 201 \" It is not quite certain how the solid dome of heaven was supported; that is to say, it is not clear whether it was supported by the earth or was held up, independently of the earth, by the waters. According to one view, the edge of the earth was turned up and formed around it a solid wall, like a steep range of hills, upon which the dome of heaven rested ; and in the hollow between the mountain of the earth and this outer wall of hills the sea collected in the form of a narrow stream. 10 This conception coincides with some of the phases in the Legend of Etana, but against it may be urged the fact that the sea is frequently identified with Apsu, or the primeval Deep upon which the earth rested. But if the edges of the earth supported the dome of heaven, all communication between the sea and Apsu would be cut off. It is more probable, therefore, that the earth did not support the heavens, and that the foundations of the heavens, like those of the earth, rested on Apsu.\" This confusion 10 The original stream of the Eden World is here portrayed. It is written: \"A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold ; and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\" (Gen. ii: 10-14.) William F. Warren says: \"Finally, pursuing these curious investigations further, our plain reader finds mention in Pausanias, ii, 5, of a strange belief of the ancients, according to which the Euphrates, after disappearing in a marsh and flowing a long distance underground, rises again beyond Ethiopia, and flows through Egypt as the Nile. This reminds him of the language of Josephus, according to which the Ganges, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Nile are all but parts of 'one river which ran round about the whole earth' the Okeanos-river of the Greeks. And he wonders whether the old Shemitic term from which the modern Euphrates is derived was not originally a name of that Ocean-river which Aristotle describes as rising in the upper heavens, descending in rain upon the earth, feeding, as Homer tells us, all fountains and 202 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS arises from the fact that the Chaldeans themselves did not understand the workings of the laws which upheld the dome. They therefore felt certain that it must rest on some founda- tion, for they saw 'it descending, as it were, both on the right hand and on the left, both to the East and to the West. Our author describes the origin of the dome as follows: \" According to a version of the creation story, the god Bel or Marduk formed the heavens and the earth out of the body of a great female monster that dwelt in the Deep which he had slain. Splitting her body into two halves, he fashioned from one half the dome of heaven, and from the other the earth.\" \" Above the dome of heaven, according to the ancient belief, was another mass of water, supported by the lower dome which kept it from breaking through and drowning the earth. The interpretation of this is that the dome of heaven was a canopy in its last stages, hence so thin that the sun, moon, rivers and every sea, flowing through all these water-courses down into the great and 'broad' equatorial ocean-current which girdles the world in its embrace, thence branching out from the further shore into the rivers of the Underworld, to be at last fire-purged and sublimated, and returned in purity to the upper heavens to recommence its round. And just as he is wondering over the question, he finds that some of the Assyriologists, in their investigation of pre-Babylonian Akkadian mythology, have found reason to believe this surmise correct, and to say that in that mythology the term Euphrates was applied to * the rope of the world,' 'the encircling river of the snake god of the tree of life,' ' the heavenly river which surrounds the earth.' Furthermore, as he turns back to the pages of Hyginus, and Manilius, and Lucius Ampelius, and reads of the fall of the ' world-egg ' at the beginning ' into the river Euphrates,' he perceives that he is in a mythologic, and not a historic, region. And when he lights upon a mutilated fragment of an ancient Assyrian inscription, in which descriptions of the visible and invisible 1 world are mixed up together, and in which the river 'of the life of the world ' is designated by the name ' Euphrates,' he quickly concludes that it will not do to take the term Phrath, or Eu-frata, as always and everywhere referring to the historic river of Mesopotamia.\" (\"Paradise Found,\" pp. 30, 31.) \"\"Babylonian Religion and Mythology,\" vol. iv, pp. 28, 30, 31. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 203 and stars were seen as gods drifting through its substance in halos or boats. Herodotus says, the boats of the Baby- lonians and Assyrians were circular, like a shield, and no distinction was made between the head and the stern. 12 In this way the mythological idea of the gods journeying in boats had its beginning. From the parent conception it was only a step to introduce the boat-procession into the various priestly cults as practised in Egypt and elsewhere. 13 There is splendid poetry in the following hymn : \" O Sun ! thou hast stepped forth from the background of heaven, thou hast pushed back the bolts of the brilliant heaven, yea, the gate of heaven. O Sun ! above the land thou hast raised thy head ! O Sun ! thou hast covered the immeasurable space of heaven and countries ! \" 14 But besides seeing the daily procession of the gods, headed by the Sun, stepping out from behind the Mountain of the Sunrise and drifting in his boat towards the Mountain of the Sunset, these Babylonians also saw the true canopy soar- ing above the vapor dome. This they naturally supposed was supported by the lower cloud belt or mountain. 12 Bk. i, ch. 194. 13 \"A sacred object in the construction of which much care was taken was the ship in which the deity was carried in solemn procession. It is again in the inscriptions of Gudea that we come across the first mention of this ship. This ruler tells us that he built the 'beloved ship ' for Nin-girsu, and gave it the name Kar-mma-ta-uddua, the ship of ' the one that rises up out of the dam of the deep.' The ship of Nabu is of considerable size, and is fitted out with a captain and crew, has masts and compartments. The ship resembled a moon's crescent, not differing much, therefore, from the ordinary fiat-bottomed Baby- lonian boat with upturned edges. Through Nebuchadnezzar we learn that these ships were brilliantly studded with precious stones, their compartments handsomely fitted out, and that in them the gods were carried in solemn procession on the festivals celebrated in their honor. A long list of such ships shows that it was a symbol that belonged to all the great gods. The ships of Nin-lil, Ea, Marduk, Sin, Shamash, Nabu, Ninib, Bau, Nin-gal, and of others are especially mentioned.\" Jastrow, \" Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxvi, pp. 653-655. 14 Ragozin, \"Story of Chaldea,\" ch. iii, p. 172. 204 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Ornoroka was the name of the woman which Bel cleft in twain, from one half of which he made the dome of heaven, and from the other half the earth. In Chaldee her name is Thamte, i.e.., tamtu, the Babylonian for i sea ' or ' ocean/ which in the Greek is Thalassa. 15 This Tiamat or sea, according to the myth, took the form of a huge serpent, she and Apsu, her consort, revolted against the gods, that is against the sun, moon, and stars, by creating a brood of monsters which destroyed them. In other words, the serpent- belt became a sun-obscuring, star-devouring pall, a spreading canopy. According to the beautiful Babylonian poem, the creation- epic, written upon seven tablets, this scene is depicted as fol- lows : \" At the very beginning of all things, a dark, chaotic, primeval water, called Tiamat, existed in a state of agitation and tumult. But as soon as the gods made preparations for the formation of an ordered universe, Tiamat, generally represented as a dragon, but also as a seven-headed serpent, arose in bitter enmity, gave birth to monsters filled with venom and with these as her allies, prepared, roaring and snorting, to do battle with the gods. All the gods tremble with fear when they perceive their terrible adversary; only the god Marduk, the god of light, * * * volunteered to do battle. * * * A splendid scene follows. The god Marduk fastens a mighty net to the east and south, north and west, in order that nothing of Tiamat may escape; then, clad in the gleaming armor, and in majestic splendor, he mounts his chariot drawn by four fiery steeds (a reference to the four halos or mock suns which accompanied the true sun on his diurnal journey over the canopy), the gods around gazing with admiration. Straight he drives to meet the dragon and her army. * * * Then her ground quaked 15 The Hebrew and Babylonian cosmogonies both present to us in the beginning a watery chaos. The Hebrew word tehom, translated 'the deep' (Gen. i:2), corresponds with the Babylonian Tiamat. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 205 asunder from the bottom. She opened her jaws to their utmost, but before she could close her lips the god Marduk bade the evil wind enter within her. * * * Then Marduk clave Tiamat clean asunder like a fish; out of the one half he formed heaven, out of the other, earth, at the same time dividing the upper waters from the lower by means of the firmament. He decked the heavens with moon, sun, and stars (which implies that they were not seen before), the earth with plants and animals.\" 16 She created a brood of uncouth beings, the same as we find in the giant myths of the Greeks and Scandinavians. The Babylonian version reads: They have joined their forces and are making war, Ummu-Khubur (i.e., Tiamat), who formed all things, Has made in addition weapons invincible, she has spawned monster- serpents, Sharp of tooth and cruel of fang; With poison instead of blood she has filled their bodies. Fierce monster-vipers she has clothed with terror, With splendor she has decked them, and she has caused them to mount on high. Whoever beholds them is overcome by dread. Their bodies rear up and none can withstand their attack. She has set up the viper, and the dragon, and the monster Lakkamu.\" Attention is called to the second line quoted; there, it will be noted, Tiamat is said to have created all things, hence this revolt against the gods was against her own offspring, which fact is sustained by various other Babylonian texts as well as by the myths of other lands. The interpretation is clear. When the first canopy known by tradition to the Babylonians became thin it gave birth to the gods ; in other words, the sun, moon, and stars were seen through it. Then, as time went on, Marduk, i.e., Bel, the solar deity, split up 16 Translated by C. H. W. Johns, \" Babel and the Bible,\" pp. 47-49. \"From the Tablets of the Creation epic; see Jastrow, \"Religion of Babylon and Assyria,\" ch. xxi, p. 409 ff., and L. W. King, \"Babylon Religion and Mythology,\" vol. iv, p. 63 ff. 206 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS another canopy which had formed and which was called the body of his mother. Out of half of her body he formed the dome of heaven and the waters which were seen above it, and out of the other half he formed the earth. Tiamat then created other serpents from the sky-water or canopy above the firmament, a fearful brood of sun-obscuring, star-devour- ing, venomous serpents, annular forms, and lowering canopies. The majority of scholars say that Marduk divided Tiamat in half and from one half formed the earth. From the stand- point of the present hypothesis, this is in perfect harmony with the appearance of things, for to all intents and pur- poses, when the sun, Marduk, conquered the water-sky, half of it did seem to be cast upon the earth. Certain other scholars, however, say that the word, E-shara, translated earth, is incorrectly interpreted, and if this be true our hypothesis gains even more prestige, for the word they would substitute for earth means ' heaven.' L. W. King would have us \" consider E-shara to be a name for heaven, or for a part of it,\" and he further adds in support of this assertion that \" the last two lines of the Fourth Tablet of the poem certainly favor this view. The most natural meaning of the passage is that Marduk made the mansion of E-shara to be heaven, which he then divided between the three gods Anu, Bel, and Ea.\" That we may have a better understanding of the argu- ment we quote from the last twelve lines of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Epic. It reads thus : Then the lord rested, and gazed on her dead body. He divided the flesh of the body, having devised a cunning plan. He split her up like a flat fish into two halves. One half of her he set in place as a covering for the heavens. He fixed a bolt, he stationed watchmen, And bade them not to let her waters come forth. He passed through the heavens, he surveyed the regions (thereof), Over against the Deep he set the dwelling of Nudimmud. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 207 And the lord measured the structure of the Deep, And he founded E-shara, a mansion like unto it. The mansion E-shara, which he created as heaven, He caused Ami, Bel, and Ea in their districts to inhabit.\" M Our interpretation is that Marduk, i.e., Bel, conquered Tiamat, the serpent-belt or ring; that is, she was not a canopy in its last stages, but she was a serpent. Now, a serpent had to progress through the various stages of decline before it could be dissipated. Marduk divided the serpent- ring into two parts, the one resting towards the north and the other towards the south. This divided the heavens into three sections, one for each of the three gods, Bel giving to Anu the middle alley in the equatorial sky, where he had split the serpent in twain, and where of course the clear-sky could be seen. Anu was the god of the clear open sky. Naturally, in time the two halves, drifting towards the north and towards the south, became canopies. Bel dwelt in the northernmost one himself, and through it he could be seen crossing daily in his halo-boat. Hence we read that he caused these gods \" their districts to inhabit.\" It is an interesting probability that these tablets were not a new composition when written. They were found in Ashur-bani-pal's library and date from the seventh century before Christ. But this does not indicate their age, for Ashur-bani-pal was very fond of literature, and he collected his material from all over the country ; therefore it is almost certain that these tablets were copied from older sources. Another tablet, found in the same library, gives quite a variation in the portrayal of the combat. Were the legend a brand-new literary effort of the seventh century B. C. we should not expect to find such variations in the same library. It takes time to produce variant forms, especially when the matter is set forth in writing. All this goes to show that this mythological evidence may date from a very remote \"\"Babylonian Religion and Mythology,\" pp. 77, 78. 208 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS period. It is well to keep this fact ever in mind, for as we go on to consider the evidence from other and newer lands, we must remember that the people themselves never saw their own gods. Greece, for instance, retained, and in a measure beautified, the legends, but that is all they were to her. The natural phenomena had slipped so far away in the remote past that all that was left was legend. This literary mist which has grown up and spread over and beautified the stern reality of nature is the soul of poetry. The Lord asks Job: \" Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? tell it, if thou hast any understanding (of it). \" Who fixed her measurements, if thou knowest it or who stretched the measuring-line over her ? \" Upon what are her foundation-pillars placed at rest ? or who laid her corner-stone? \" When altogether sang the morning stars in gladness, and shouted for joy all the sons of God ? \" 19 But in considering the question of time we are likely also to err in the other direction; we are likely to assign these myths to a dust-mirky age entirely too far back. Knowledge of celestial phenomena on the part of the ancients does not always mean that the belted canopy phenomena had entirely disappeared. For instance, there can be no question but that the Babylonians were great astronomers. On a tablet found in the Temple Library, Nippur, astronomical calcula- tions of the most minute character as to the constellation Scorpion show how proficient were the astronomers of 2300 B. C. But such evidence must not be understood to indicate that the annular system was a thing of the past in that age. It only indicates that the heavens were clear from canopies, and that the rings, if such were then in the sky, were probably seen edgewise, and so took up little space in Isaac Lesser s Version, Job xxxviii:4-7. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 209 the equatorial heavens, being altogether an unconspicuous feature. 20 Professor H. V. Hilprecht's discoveries show amongst other things that these Babylonians were aware that the earth was round. They had the rings to guide them to the dis- covery of this truth, and the fact that the peoples which lived after them lost this knowledge shows us that the rings which acted as interpreters of nature must have passed into the canopy stage or have been dissipated altogether. With their disappearance the gods are said to have fled to the celestial heavens, where they ultimately became identified with the planets. Marduk is thus associated with Jupiter, Ishtar with Venus, RTergal with Mars, Nabu with Mercury, and Mnib with Saturn. 21 The very act of thus connecting them 20 The record of eclipses forms a very considerable portion of the astronomical data of the ancients. \" Among the Chinese they were long calculated, and, in fact, it is thought by some that they have pretended to a greater antiquity by calculating backwards, and record- ing as observed eclipses those which happened before they understood or noticed them. It seems, however, authenticated that they did in the year 2169 B.C. observe an eclipse of the sun, and that at that date they were in the habit of predicting them. For this particular eclipse is said to have cost several of the astronomers their lives, as they had not calculated it rightly. As the lives of princes were supposed to be dependent on these eclipses, it became high treason to expose them to such a danger without forewarning them. They paid more attention to the eclipses of the sun than of the moon. \"Among the Babylonians the eclipses of the moon were observed from a very early date, and numerous records of them are contained in the Observations of Bel in Sargon's library, the tablets of which have lately been discovered. In the older portion they only record that on the 14th day of such and such a (lunar) month an eclipse takes place, and state in what watch it begins, and when it ends. In a later portion the observations were more precise, and the descriptions of the eclipse more accurate. Long before 1700 B.C. the discovery of the lunar cycle of 223 lunar months had been made, and by means of it they were able to state of each lunar eclipse that it was either ' according to calculation ' or ' contrary to calculation/ \" Flammarion, \" Astronomical Myths,\" ch. xii, pp. 337-338. '\"Jastrow, \"The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" pp. 370, 371, 459. 14 210 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS with the star-roofed heavens points to the fact that they were originally sky-scenes. It would have violated the religious feelings of the people too much to restrict them to an earthly home, and yet their old cloud-mountain home had passed away, so where else in the whole universe could the priests say they had gone ? In connection with the old cloud-moun- tain, the second month of the Babylonian year was desig- nated as the month of the resplendent mound. 22 The origin of the signs of the zodiac was due to the same causes which led the Chaldean mind to assign planets to the gods, in which they might make their home after the moun- tain canopy had dissolved. \" Eleven constellations, that is to say, the entire zodiac with the exception of the bull the sign of Marduk were identified with the- eleven monsters forming the host of Tiamat.\" 23 The fantastic shape of the animals chosen for this purpose bears unmistakable evidence of their origin as vapor forms. But to return to the earlier days. It was Bel, as we have seen, that caused the gods, Anu, Bel, and Ea, their districts to inhabit, A tablet of the ' Creation Epic,' so far as decipherable, reads : There was a time when above the heaven was not named. Below the earth bore no name. Apsu was there from the first the source of both, And raging Tiamat, the mother of both. But their waters were gathered together in a mass. No field was marked off, no soil seen. When none of the gods was as yet produced, No name mentioned, no fate determined, Then were created the gods in their totality. Lakhmu and Lakhamu were created. Days went by. 24 22 IUd., p. 464. ^Ibid., p. 456. \"Delitzsch supplies a parallel phrase which in the light of our hypothesis makes the reading clearer. It is : ' periods elapsed/ BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 211 Anshar and Kishar were created. Many days elapsed * * * Ann (Bel and Ea were created). Anshar, Anu (?)*** 25 The portion of the heavens given to Ea was Apsu, the deep. Ea means ' the House of waters/ He was an ' Exalted Fish. 7 This is parallel to that avatar of Vishnu where he assumed the form of a great fish protecting Manu from the flood. (The canopy was a protector, bringing greenhouse conditions into the world.) Ea fought against Tiamat, the dragon, serpent snake, and with Marduk's and Anu's help conquered the dark one. Ea thus figures as the great hero of the flood, which parallels the account of the Noachian deluge, but as this incident is described in the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh epic, it will be best to defer its consideration until after we have become acquainted with some of the records from the first tablets. This epic of Gilgamesh is known to many by the name of ' Izdubar.' \" Gisdhubar,\" says Sayce, \" himself was a solar hero.\" * * * \" His twelve labors or adventures answer to the twelve months of the year through which the sun moves, like the twelve labors of the Greek Herakles.\" 26 E\"ow, in the sixth tablet, to secure the love of Gilgamesh, the solar orb, the exalted Ishtar, the one-time good canopy, ' brilliant goddess/ and ' mother of the gods,' raises her eyes. She offers him her love, her home, her all. She offers him the products of the mountain and the land, for she, the goddess of fertility, produced wonderful agricultural fruits under her protecting roof. She offers him full control of her herds and cow-like clouds. She offers him a chariot of lapis lazuli and gold, with wheels and horns of sapphire, drawn by great steeds the swift horse being an emblem of the flying ring or vapor-belt driven by centrifugal force.

In the woods he stands and laments, \" my pinions ! \" Thou didst love a lion of perfect strength; Seven and seven times thou didst bury him in corners ( ? ) . Thou didst love a horse superior in the fray; With whip and spur thou didst urge him on. Thou didst force him on for seven double hours. 27 She could not stand this insult, so, flying to her father, Anu, the true sky, he creates for her a divine bull, a storm deity; apparently in this case a kind of demon. 28 The seal cylinders of Babylon frequently picture the battle that fol- lowed between this strong or supreme one and Gilgamesh and his friend Eabani. Since Gilgamesh is the sun, he of course conquered. The bull was killed and the carcass was thrown full into the face of the canopy (Ishtar). Briefly this whole scene may be thus interpreted : Ishtar with her peace-like clouds was but a canopy in its last stages. Unveiled, it then displayed its violent character (Her). Its brilliant smiles produced a bitter chill, and Anu, heaven's ocean, her own father, was covered with the clouds of rain and storm. Gilgamesh, the sun, conquered these. See the sun himself! on wings Of glory up the east he springs. Angel of light! who from the time* Those heavens began their march sublime, Hath first of all the starry choir Trod in His Maker's steps of fire! \" On many seal cylinders and on the monuments Gil- gamesh is pictured in the act of fighting with or strangling a lion. In the preserved portions of the epic no reference 87 \"Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxiii, p. 482. 28 Ibid., p. 483. ^Lalla Rookh. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 213 to this contest has been found.\" * * * \" After escaping from the danger occasioned by the lions, Gilgamesh comes to the mountain Mashu, which is described as a place of terrors, the entrance to which is guarded by ' scorpion-men.' \" He reached the mountain Mashu, Whose exit is daily guarded, Whose back extends to the dam of heaven. 80 It will be recalled that the cloud-belt is pictured by the Babylonians as a mountain. The description of Mashu is dependent upon this conception. Ragozin says of the ( scor- pion-men ' they were \" gigantic monstrous beings, half men, half scorpions: their feet were below the earth, while their heads touched the gates of heaven ; they were the wardens of the sun.\" 31 They were the Pillars of Hercules. In the Greek, Hercules strangles the serpents sent to destroy him in the cradle. In the Hebrew it is the house of the Philistines, whose pillars Samson Shemesh, the Sun destroyed and thereby slew his enemies. In fact, there is no end to the figures under which canopy darkness is represented in the myths and legends of the world. Often it is a sphinx, a dragon, or a witch. In the Egyptian symbolism it is a scorpion, conceived as stinging the sun to death, and after that sitting as guard over it. The same appears to have been the conception in the Akkadian myth of ' scorpion-men 9 which we have just perused. \"At the appearing of the sun, and the disappearing of the sun, they guard the sun.\" 32 Plainly they stand at the imaginary boundary between firm land and the watery region of the upper world. In the epic (60, 9) one version reads that the \" Scorpion man and his wife guard the gate leading to the great cloud mountain, Mashu.\" As they watched the sun rise and set in the slit 30 Ibid., pp. 488, 489. \"Story of Chaldea,\" ch. vii, p. 311. 32 Substance of the above culled from Charles De B. Mills' \" The Tree of Mythology,\" p. 162. 214 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS between them, i.e., between the two pillars, verily they were its guardians. Their upper part, as the text says, reaches to the sky, and their irtu (breast?) to the lower regions. This lower or hidden part, which seemed to the ancients to go down below the horizon, was the scorpion part. The scorpion-men bring us back to the story of Ea, for Gilgamesh was on his way to find Parnapishtim when he came across these strange beings. Parnapishtim was the Noah of the epic, though in some of the details he bears a closer resemblance to Lot than to the patriarch of the deluge. Gilgamesh speaks to Sabitum: \" (Now) Sabitum, which is the way to Parnapishtim? If it is possible, let me cross the ocean. If it is not possible, let me stretch myself on the ground.\" Sabitum speaks to Gilgamesh: \" Gilgamesh ! there has never been a ferry, And no one has ever crossed the ocean. Shamash, the hero, has crossed it, but except Shamash, who can cross it? Difficult is the passage, very difficult the path. Impassable ( ? ) the waters of death that are guarded by a bolt. How canst thou, O Gilgamesh, traverse the ocean? And after thou hast crossed the waters of death, what wilt thou do? \" As we have not yet become acquainted with Shamash, a digression from the epic will be in order, so that we may come to know the sun and moon gods. Shamash was the original or older Sun-god and it is a significant fact of the early Babylonian or Sumerian religion, that his cult was subordinate to the worship of Sin, the Moon-god. Indeed, according to one tradition, Shamash was regarded as the son of the Moon-god, and verily this tradition is founded on fact, for it will be remembered that it was an actual neces- sity of nature that caused the sun first to be seen in the vapor arch or moon where he was born, as it were, in the water and out of the water. Sin was originally the moon-like arch, but later he is represented on some of the tablets accompanied by 83 Jastrow, \" Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxiii, pp. 490-491. BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 215 the lunar disk. 34 Undoubtedly this was a later development of the cult. In the beginning Sin was the vapor-arc, simply a crescent arc. After the deluge, when the gods fled to the clear vault of heaven, Sin naturally became identified again with the only crescent form in the clear sky, the new moon, j^annar means ' the illuminator ' ; it is one of the names of Sin. The following extracts from the moon hymn illus- trate the conceptions current about this deity: Father Nannar, moon-god, chief of the gods. Father Nannar, lord of the brilliant crescent, chief of the gods. O strong bull, great of horns, perfect in form, with long flowing beard of the color of lapus-lazuli. Powerful one, self-created, a product ( ?) beautiful to look upon, whose fulness has not yet been brought forth. Father, begetter of the gods and of men, establishing dwellings and granting gifts. 35 The statement that the gods were born of the moon stamps it as the beginning place of the sky-scenes, the canopy. When the moon came to be conceived as a female divinity, Ishtar became also the goddess of the moon. This ' shiner ' or moon was likewise the sun of the ancients. The winged sun of Assyria is one of the most familiar emblems in the architectural adornment of the east. The attribute of flight indicates that the original sun was the ' shiner/ the swift moving canopy itself. Another statement that proves that the sun was originally the canopy is that Mnib the major solar deity swallowed up Mn-girsu, !N^in-gish-zidu, another solar deity, and Nin-shakh. E\"in- shaka-kuddu was ' the mistress of Uruk/ ' the lady of shining waters.' But to return to the epic of Gilgamesh: Ea warned Parnapishtim of the approach of the flood. Now, Ea lived in the sky-stream above, and no doubt the aspect of the stream conveyed the warning. Notably on the cylinder-seal No. 89126, British Museum. Jastrow, \"Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xvii, p. 303. 216 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Doomed to destruction 'neath the dank dark cloud with nothing to indemnify The earth was doomed 'neath the great black thing which hung in the parted sky. Parnapishtim told the story to Gilgamesh as follows : Parnapishtim spoke to Gilgamesh: \" I will tell thee, Gilgamesh, the marvelous story, And the decision of the gods I will tell thee. The city Shurippak, a city which, as thou knowest, Lies on the Euphrates, That city was corrupt, so that the gods thereof Decided to bring a rainstorm upon it. All of the great gods, Anu, their father; Their counsellor, the warrior Bel; The bearer of destruction, Ninib; Their leader, En-nugi; The lord of unsearchable wisdom, Ea, was with them, To proclaim their resolve to the reed-huts. 'Reed-hut, reed-hut, clay structures, clay structures, Reed-hut, hear! Clay structure, give ear! ' ****** O man of Shurippak, son of Kidin-Marduk ! Erect a structure, build a ship.\" \" Parnapishtim declares his readiness to obey the orders of Ea, but, like Moses upon receiving the command of Yahwe, he asks what he should say when people questioned him. \"What shall I answer the city, the people, and the elders?\" Ea replies : \" Thus answer and speak to them : ' Bel has cast me out in his hatred, So that I can no longer dwell in your city. On Bel's territory I dare no longer show my face; Therefore, I go to the \" deep \" to dwell with Ea, my lord. ***** Over you a rainstorm will come, Men, birds, and beasts will perish. ***** When Shamash will bring on the time, then the lord of the whirlstorm Will cause destruction to rain upon you in the evening.\" BABYLONIAN AND ASSYRIAN MYTHS 217 Parnapishtim now proceeds to take his family and chattels on board. \" All that I had, I loaded on the ship. With all the silver that I had, I loaded it, With all the gold that I had, I loaded it, With living creatures of all kinds I loaded it. I brought on board my whole family and household, Cattle of the field, beasts of the field, workmen all this I took on board.\" - / Parnapishtim is ready to enter the ship, but he waits until the time fixed for the storm arrives. \" When the time came For the lord of the whirlstorm to rain down destruction, 1 gazed on the earth; I was terrified at its sight, I entered the ship, and closed the door. To the captain of the ship, to Puzur-Shadurabu, M the sailor, I entrusted the structure with all its contents. ***** Upon the first appearance of dawn There arose from the horizon dark clouds, Within which Ramman caused his thunder to resound. Nabu and Sharru marched at the front. The destroyers passed across mountains and land. Dibbarra lets loose the (mischievous forces?), Ninib advances in furious hostility. The Anunnaki raise torches Whose sheen illumines the universe, As Ramman's whirlwind sweeps the heavens, And all light is changed to darkness. ***** Brother does not look after brother, Men care not for another. In the heavens, Even the gods are terrified at the storm. They take refuge in the heaven of Anu. The gods cowered like dogs at the edge of the heavens.\" The significance of this language is remarkable : the gods \"Puzur\" signifies \"hidden,\" \"protected.\" \"Shadu rabu,\" i.e., \"great mountain,\" is a title of Bel. 218 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS had to cower on the edge of heaven because the canopy which had been their home had passed away. \" Ishtar groans like a women in throes, The lofty goddess cries with loud voice, The world of old has become a mass of clay. * * * * * That I should have assented to this evil among the gods! That when I assented to this evil, I was for the destruction of my own creatures! What I created, where is it? Like so many fish, it fills the sea.\" 8T 87 Jastrow, \" Religion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxiii, p. 495 ff. CHAPTER XVI EGYPTIAN MYTHS IN Egypt, the dead grave-yard of the past, the present hypothesis finds a living record which begins with the memo- rials of the old sky scenes, followed by the introduction of pure and simple sun worship (disk- worship) in the eigh- teenth dynasty. 1 This change of cult was too radical, how- ever, for the people of that day, so they reverted to their old gods, whose memory was probably still kept before them by lingering remnants of the dethroned system. 2 The critical or turning event in this history is the change of cult to disk-worship. In Assyria we have the winged disk, emblem of Ashur. The interpretation of which is that the head of the Assyrian pantheon was some phase of the personified sun. Frequently a tail was attached to the *In the twentieth dynasty (1100 B.C.) a series of star tables have been found recorded in several manuscripts recovered from the tombs. 2 It is said of Solon the Greek law-giver, that when he visited Egypt, six hundred years before Christ, he had a talk with the priests of Sais about the Deluge of Deucalion. The following is Plato's account: \"Thereupon, one of the priests, who was of very great age, said, 'O Solon, Solon, you Hellenes are but children, and there is never an old man who is an Hellene/ Solon, hearing this, said, ' What do you mean? ' ' I mean to say,' he replied, * that in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age. And I will tell you the reason of this: there have been, and there will be again, many destruc- tions of mankind arising out of many causes. There is a story which even you have preserved, that once upon a time Phaeton, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now, this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving around the earth and in the heavens, and a great con- flagration of things upon the earth recurring at long intervals of time.\" \"Dialogues,\" xi, 517, Timseus. 219 220 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS wings, the meaning of which was that the bird or sun was seen moving over the canopy. This same symbol, without the tail, strikingly resembles the Egyptian emblem; the wings of the latter, however, are those of the sparrow-hawk, their sacred bird. As time passed on, the wings were dropped. The sun came clearer and clearer into view, until finally the vapor appendages dissi- pated forever; naturally the symbolic representations were altered in order to conform to the new conditions, hence the wings were dropped. Rawlinson says : \" Aten, in Egyptian theology, had hitherto represented a particular aspect or character of Ha, 'the sun' that aspect which is expressed by the phrase, ' the solar disk.' How it was possible to keep Aten distinct from the other sun-gods, Ra, Khepra, Turn, Shu, Mentu, Osiris, and Horus or Harmachis, is a puzzle to moderns; but it seems to have been a difficulty practically overcome by the Egyptians, to whom it did not perhaps even present itself as a difficulty at all. Disk-worship consisted then, primarily, in an undue exaltation of this god, who was made to take the place of Ammon-Ra in the Pantheon, and was ordinarily represented by a circle with rays proceeding from it, the rays mostly terminating in hands, which frequently presented the symbols of life and health and strength to the worshiper.\" 3 From the viewpoint of the present hypothesis the diffi- culty which Rawlinson mentions relative to the fact that the ancients kept distinct the various aspects of the sun, naming them as different gods, fizzles away. We moderns cannot find enough phases in the existing sun to go around amongst the gods. Had we lived under the canopy skies, everything would have been different; for instance, Ammon or Amen means ' concealer/ and this god is often coupled with another as Amen-Ra, the solar deity covered. 4 1 \" The story of Ancient Egypt,\" ch. xiv, p. 224. *E. A. Wallis Budge, \"The Dwellers on the Nile,\" 4th ed., p. 142. EGYPTIAN MYTHS\nis probably the same as ' Adon,' the root of Adonis; thus we see how the Greeks also worshiped this feature of the glorious sun, but their story has mellowed with age. Adonis was a youth who died from a wound received from a boar during the chase plainly the youthful sun was swallowed up by the remnant of a floating vapor-form. Orig- inally he was six months behind the canopy and six months in the open space. Later the worship of Adonis appears to have had reference to the death of nature in winter and to its revival in spring, hence Adonis spent six months in the lower world and six months in the upper. But to return to Egypt : \" In the matter of religion,\" says Kawlinson, \" the most noticeable changes which occurred are connected with the disk-worship, with the alternate ele- vation and depression of the god Set. The cult of the disk, favored by Amenophis III, and fully established by his son, Amenophis IV, or Khuenaten, is chiefly remarkable on account of its exclusive character, the disk-worshipers oppos- ing and disallowing all other cults and religious usages. Had Khuenaten been able to effect the religious revolution at which he aimed, the old Egyptian religion would have been destroyed, and its place would have 'been taken by a species of monotheism, in which the material Sun would have been recognized as the One and only Lord, and Ruler of the Uni- verse. Ammon, Khem, Kneph, Phthah, Maut, Khonsu, Osiris, Horus, Isis, Thoth would have disappeared, and the sun-worship, pure and simple, would have replaced the old complicated polytheism. But Egypt was not prepared for this change.\" 5 Egypt was not ready to overturn her gods, so let us look behind the doors of the vapor belt, at the scenes which im- pressed themselves so strongly on their minds as to cause them to believe that they saw into the chambers of higher 5 \" History of Ancient Egypt,\" vol. ii, ch. xxi, p. 188. 222 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS beings than themselves. Their eyes revealed to them the 'Hall of the Two Truths' (i.e., the Pillars of Hercules), the double abode of the sun in the heavens, through which, according to the teachings of their theology, their dead had to pass and where they themselves would have to stand in judgment before Osiris, the sun-god, ' Lord of Life,' before they could enter to the fields of eternity beyond. It is recorded of Osiris that in the Hall of Two Truths he sat beneath a canopy. When he disappeared behind it he was ' lost ' and all Egypt mourned for him. When he returned he was said to be ' found,' and then all Egypt rejoiced. The myth of ' Osiris Lost,' when all Egypt mourned, represents the annual journey of the sun behind the northern or falling cloud bank. The important point is that the myth does not deal with the daily conflict between day and night, but in its full expansion it covers the whole year. The echo of this event sounded down through the ages long afterwards. Rawlinson says: \" Other feasts were held in honor of Osiris on the sev- enteenth day of Athyr and the nineteenth of Pashons ; in the former of which the ' loss of Osiris,' and in the latter his recovery, were commemorated. A cow, emblematic of Isis, was veiled in black and led about for four successive days, accompanied by a crowd of men and women, who beat their breasts in memory of the supposed disappearance of Osiris from earth and his sister's search for him ; while, in memory of his recovery, a procession was made to the seaside, the priests carrying a sacred chest, and, an image or emblem of Osiris fashioned out of earth and water having been placed in it, the declaration was made, ' Osiris is found ! Osiris is found ! ' amid general festivity and rejoicing.\" 6 The Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg gives a legend from the Quiche Indians of Central America which depicts this same scene : \" Now, behold, our ancients and our fathers were 6 \" History of Ancient Egypt,\" vol. i, ch. x, p. 199. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 223 made lords, and had their dawn. Behold, we will relate also the rising of the sun, the moon, and the stars! Great was their joy when they saw the morning-star, which came out first, with its resplendent face before the sun. At last the sun itself began to come forth ; the animals, small and great, were in joy; they rose from the water-courses and ravines, and stood on the mountain-tops, with their heads toward where the sun was coming. An innumerable crowd of people were there, and the dawn cast light on all these people at once. At last the face of the ground was dried by the sun ; like a man the sun showed himself, and his presence warmed and dried the surface of the ground. Before the sun ap- peared, muddy and wet was the surface of the ground, and it was before the sun appeared, and then only the sun rose like a man. But his heat had no strength, and he did but show himself when he rose ; he only remained like a mirror ; and it is not, indeed, the same sun that appears now, they say, in the stories.\" 7 The death of Osiris has many like parallels in ancient thought. Both annular, and also astronomical. For instance, Epictetus favors the opinion that at the solstices of the great year not only all human beings, but even the gods, are annihilated, and speculates whether at such time Jove feels lonely. 8 The bank behind which Osiris disappeared was one of the Halls of Two Truths, to which the deceased were directed by the ' Ritual, or Book of the Dead.' A passage in this book which contains instructions for the deceased reads : \" Retreat unto the eastern heavens. Unto the dwellings which support the mount. That great mys- terious mountain that spreads light among the gods.\" The reason for this direction to the dead was probably due to the fact that the cloud-mountain in its daily revolution kept ever turning towards the east. In the third part of the 7 Tylor, \" Early History of Mankind,\" p. 308. 8 \" Discourses,\" book iii, ch. xiii. 224 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Ritual, the deceased in company with the sun himself tra- verse the various houses of heaven. In the cosmologies of the ancients these great black halls or chambers (hiding places) are associated with the abode of the damned and lost souls. In the Homeric conception, they are called Hades and Tartarus. It is not credible, as some scholars would have it, that the early Greeks, unschooled in the exercise of the scientific imagination and unacquainted with Newton's law of gravitation, could have pictured a pendent under-surface of the earth, around which flopped topsy-turvy ghosts, and also that infernal rivers and infernal palaces could have clung to this under-hemisphere. The myth of Osiris and his consort Isis, whose image is crowned with the sun disk, is as follows : \"Osiris and Isis were at one time induced to descend to the earth to bestow gifts and blessings on its inhabitants. Isis showed them first the use of wheat and barley, and Osiris made the instruments of agriculture and taught men the use of them, as well as how to harness the ox to the plough. He then gave men laws, the institution of marriage, a civil organization, and taught them how to worship the gods. After he had thus made the valley of the Nile a happy country, he assembled a host with which he went to bestow his blessing upon the rest of the world. He conquered the nations everywhere only with music and eloquence. His brother Typhon saw this, and sought during his absence to usurp his throne. But Isis, who held the reins of govern- ment, frustrated his plans. Still more embittered, he now resolved to kill his brother. Having organized a conspiracy of seventy-two members, he went with them to the feast which was celebrated in honor of the king's return. He then caused a box or chest to be brought in, which had been made to fit exactly the size of Osiris, and declared that he would give that chest of precious wood to whosoever could get into it. The rest tried in vain, but no sooner was Osiris in it than EGYPTIAN MYTHS 225 Typhon and his companions closed the lid and flung the chest into the Nile. When Isis heard of the cruel murder she wept and mourned ; and then, with her hair shorn, clothed in black, and beating her breast, she sought diligently for the body of her husband. In this search she was materially assisted by Anubis, the son of Osiris and Nephthys. They sought in vain for some time; for when the chest, carried by the waves to the shores of Byblos, had become entangled in the reeds that grew at the edge of the water, the divine power that dwelt in the body of Osiris imparted such strength to the shrub that it grew into a mighty tree, enclosing in its trunk the coffin of the god. This tree, with its sacred deposit, was shortly after felled, and erected as a column in the palace of the king of Phoenicia. But at length, by the aid of Anubis and the sacred birds, Isis ascertained these facts, and then went to the royal city. There she offered herself at the palace as a servant, and, being admitted, threw off her disguise and appeared as the goddess, surrounded with thun- der and lightning. Striking the column with her wand, she caused it to split open and give up the sacred coffin.\" 9 Interpreted, this means that sunlight brought gifts to man in the shape of agricultural plenty. Then an enemy called Typhon, the personified canopy, trapped him in his folds or coffin. Typhon's name is the same as the Hebrew word for north, ' Tsaphon.' He stretched out the canopy we read across the empty space in the north sky (Job xxvi: 7). The pillars of heaven trembled (verse 11), and the heavens were garnished by the crooked serpent (verse 13). Apophis was the Egyptian serpent of darkness. \" He is portrayed,\" says Rawlinson, \" either as a huge serpent disposed in many folds, or as a water-snake with a human head. He was sup- posed to have sided with Set against Osiris, and to have thereby provoked the anger of Horus, who is frequently rep- 9 \" Bulfinch's Age of Fable,\" Revised edit, of Rev. J. Loughran Scott, pp. 369-370. 15 326 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS resented as piercing his head with a spear.\" 10 He is a sky- scene that seems to have impeded the progress of souls on their journey to the ' Hall of Two Truths.' Subsequently he gave way, in the mythic system, to Set or Typhon, which is logical, as he was practically the same personified natural phenomenon. F. De Lanoye says : \" In the Egyptian mythology, Apophis, the serpent, is the great enemy of the Sun ; in several hypogees he is repre- sented as struggling against the gods of the Amenti, who succeed in capturing and chaining him.\" n Typhon and the companions who were with him, after they had trapped the sun, closed the lid of the chest and flung him into a river which the myth designates as the Nile, but which older sources clearly indicates was heaven's river. The tree in which the coffin became incased is the same as Ygdrasil, the world tree of the Scandinavians. This great ash is supposed to have supported the whole universe, but suffice it for the present, with lightning and thunder, the goddess of sunlight made the mighty column or tree to split open and surrender the sun himself. Horus, the new sun god, is said to have despatched Typhon with a sun-dart, which pierced his watery head through and through. This again is nothing but the tale of Apophis. Many details of this wonderful myth could be dwelt on. Thus in the Isle of Philse, in the temple dedicated to Osiris and his wife and their son Horus, sculptured on the walls is a complete record of this legend. The last shrine represents Osiris rising from a couch which is supported by two legs and is arched just like the body of Nu-t. It could not be more suggestive of the sun resting on the arched canopy. It is depicted as it appeared to the Egyptians. \" History of Ancient Egypt,\" vol. i, ch. x, p. 186. 11 \" Wonders of Art and Archaeology in Egypt 3300 Years Ago,\" p. 146. See \" Champollion's Letters from Egypt.\" EGYPTIAN MYTHS 227 Typhon, or Set, as lie is often called, 12 like all the per- sonifications of the canopy, was at first a good deity. He afterwards became the principle of evil, and, rapidly running down the scale, he finally became the very synonym of death itself. Set or Seb was the son of Ra, the ancient sun. This luminary was nothing but the shiner or canopy. So, also, the ancient moon was not our present satellite, but only a crescent form of the ring. The mutilation of the sun's body by Typhon is one of many similar descriptions found else- wheres. The earth was covered with sun-fragments every time a canopy broke up its light. The Ute philosopher has strangely mixed the matter of the mutilation of this old sun or shining canopy with the occasional disappearance of the sun itself. Ta-vi, the sun- god, must have originally been the blazing canopy, and then like Osiris he became the true sun. The legend is as follows : \"In that long ago, the time to which all mythology refers, the sun roamed the earth at will. When he came too near with his fierce heat the people were scorched, and when he hid away in his cave for a long time, too idle to come forth, the night was long and the earth cold. Once upon a time Ta-wats, the hare-god, was sitting with his family by the camp-fire in the solemn woods, anxiously waiting for the return of Ta-vi, the wayward sun-god. Wearied with long watching, the hare-god fell asleep, and the sun-god came so near that he scorched the naked shoulder of Ta-wats. Fore- seeing the vengeance which would be thus provoked, he fled back to his cave beneath the earth. Ta-wats awoke in great anger, and speedily determined to go and fight the sun-god. After a long journey of many adventures, the hare-god came to the brink of the earth, and there watched long and 12 Egyptologists admit that Set, Sit, Typhon, Bes, and Sutekh are identical. To this list possibly Ombo and Nubi should be added. Apophis also was a form of Typhon. Sutekh was a god of the Canaan- ites. Maspero, \" Histoire Ancienne\" p. 165. 228 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS patiently, till at last, the sun-god coming out, lie shot an arrow at his face, but the fierce heat consumed the arrow ere it had finished its intended course; then another arrow was sped, but that also was consumed; and another, and still another, till only one remained in his quiver. But this was the magical arrow that had never failed its mark. Ta-wats, holding it in his hand, lifted the barb to his eye and baptized it in a divine tear ; then the arrow was sped and struck the sun-god full in the face, and the sun was shivered into a thousand fragments, which fell to the earth, causing a gen- eral conflagration. Then Ta-wats, the hare-god, fled before the destruction he had wrought, and as he fled the burning earth consumed his feet, consumed his legs, consumed his body, consumed his hands and his arms all were consumed but the head alone, which bowled across valleys and over mountains, fleeing destruction from the burning earth, until at last, swollen with heat, the eyes of the god burst and the tears gushed forth in a flood which spread over the earth and extinguished the fire. The sun-god was now conquered, and he appeared before a council of the gods to await sentence. In that long council were established the days and nights, the seasons and the years, with the length thereof, and the sun was condemned to travel across the firmament by the same trail day after day till the end of time.\" 13 The Greeks have portrayed certain features of this tale in the legend of Phaeton. This god was a son of Sol. Anxious to display his skill in horsemanship, he was allowed to drive the chariot of his father for one day. The horses of the sun soon found out the incapacity of the charioteer, became unmanageable, and overturned the chariot. There was such fear of injury to heaven and earth, that Jove, to stop the destruction, killed Phaeton with a thunderbolt. \" Even the ruler of vast Olympus, who hurls the ruthless Popular Science Monthly,\" October, 1879, p. 799. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 229 bolts with his terrific right hand, cannot guide this chariot; and yet what have we greater than Jupiter ? The first part of the road is steep, and such as the horses, though fresh in the morning, can hardly climb. In the middle of the heaven it is high aloft, whence it is often a source of fear, even to myself, to look down upon the sea and the earth, and my breast trembles with fearful apprehensions. The last stage is a steep descent, and requires a sure command of the horses. * * * Besides, the heavens are carried round with a constant rotation, and carry with them the lofty stars, and whirl them with rapid revolution. Against this I have to contend; and that force which overcomes all other things does not overcome me, and I am carried in a contrary direc- tion to the rapid world.\" 14 Be it noted that Ovid supposes the rapid world-cloud to move or revolve in one direction, while the sun appears to move in the other. William F. Warren is authority for the following : \" Now, it is difficult to believe it a mere accident that in various ancient authors we find allusion both to an ex- tremely ancient displacement of the sky and its supposed original state. None of these allusions have ever been explained by writers on the subject. One of them occurs in Plato's Timseus, where, in language ascribed to an Egyptian priest of Solon's time, ' a declination of the bodies revolving round the earth ' is spoken of, and this declination is offered as the true explanation of the partial destruction of the world commemorated in the myth of Phaeton. As this destruction was by fire, there would at first sight seem to be no connection between it and the destruction at the time of the Deluge; nor is there in the context anything to suggest such a con- nection. Fortunately, however, we have in Hyginus a fuller version of the myth, from which it appears that the Greeks \"Ovid, \"The Metamorphoses,\" book xi, fable 1. 230 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS supposed Deucalion's universal flood to have been providen- tially sent to extinguish the fearful conflagration which Phaeton's unskilful driving of the steeds of the sun had occa- sioned. This makes the connection clear and direct. The Flood and the ( declination of the heavenly bodies revolving round the earth' are at once brought into a true historic relation. \" In like manner, in the Bundahish, in the first five chapters, and in the Zad Sparam's paraphrase of the same, it is stated that during the first three thousand years, before the incoming of the Evil One, { the sun, moon, and stars stood still,' but as soon as the Destroyer of the good creation came he assaulted and deranged the sky, as well as the earth and sea. And, remarkably enough, it is stated that as a result of this assault the Evil One mastered as much as f one third of the sky ' and overspread it with darkness. Moreover, in the thirtieth chapter, in giving a prophetic account to the final restoration of the material world to its primeval state, there seems to be an allusion in verse thirty-two to a neces- sary resetting or readjustment of the celestial vault by the hand of its Creator.\" 15 The sum and substance of this matter is that the winged sun was worshiped practically everywhere. F. Max Miiller says in the Second Series of Auld Lang Syne : \" One of the most intelligible names given to the sun was Asva, the racer, or Dadhikravan or Ya^'n, horse. And while at one time the sun was a racer, at another the sun was conceived as ap- proaching men and standing on a golden chariot which was drawn by horses, as in Greek mythology. Thus we read, Kig-Veda i, 35, 2: ' The god Savitn (the sun), approaching on the dark-blue sky, sustaining mortals and immortals, comes on his golden chariot, beholding all the worlds.' \" To us this quotation from the Veda is a description of the \"\"Paradise Found,\" pp. 195-196; West, \" Pahlavi Texts,\" pt. i, p. 129. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 231 solar orb shining through the dark-blue vault, the abode of gods and demigods. Miiller catches the echo from the older thought, which called the shining canopy the sun or racer. Both Hesiod and Homer testify that the solar-car was drawn by winged steeds. The Hindus say that their sun was en- dowed with horses that were very fast. The people of the olden times saw these flying steeds, such as Pegasus, and so came to worship the swift or winged one (sometimes plural), praising heaven for their wondrous deeds. The wings attached to the glowing golden sun of Assyria and Egypt were for rapid flight In North America the sun was called a hare; afterwards, as the swift became slow, the lame hare became the sun emblem. Rapid suns or horses were flying canopies and were also called chariots; when they reflected the sunlight they appeared to be on fire. So Phrebus lashed his steeds of fire and rushed upon the very wings of the wind. Again, Phaeton drove the coursers of the sun, but as he drove them a fearful change seemed to be impending. The atmos- phere became sultry and almost unbearable as a result of the settling down of the sweltering vapor belt. This made the world below seem as though it were lost in fire. The lower- ing heavens also caught a fire-glow from the true sun, and heaven and earth appeared to be in one blaze. The Storm- King, roused by these conditions, brought to his aid Jove the ' Thunderer,' who hurled his bolts at the luckless Phaeton, and the whole war of the vapors was fought o'er again: Then headlong falling, with his hair on fire, Poor Phaeton marked the heavens as a star. It is further recorded that all the gods were frightened, and that the rivers shrank. All the world felt that a change was coming. Yet through this terror wisdom was brought down to man, the Delphic oracle had spoken, and in the sight of all the end was evidently near at hand, for though Apollo, Phaeton's own father, regained possession of his steeds and 232 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS by accelerating the speed 16 seemed to be driving the chariot of the sun along its proper course, yet, as we have said, it was only for a time. The Delphic oracle had spoken. These remarks on the slowing up of the speed with which the canopy revolved brings to our attention once more Typhon, the Egyptian canopy. Typhon personified was also a character in Grecian mythology. He and Echidna, who 16 The substance of the ring-belt possessed energy on account of its situation, for the attraction of the earth was capable of doing work. The further the ring-belt was from the earth the larger was the quantity of energy that it possessed from this cause. But it also possessed another kind of energy, which was due to its velocity. The further the ring was from the earth the smaller was this velocity and the smaller was the quantity of energy possessed from this cause. If we -unite the two forces we find that the result may be expressed in the following manner: When the ring-belt revolved round the earth the total energy of the system when added to the reciprocal of the distance between the two bodies measured by a proper unit of length was the same for all distances between them. This shows the connection between the energy and the distance. Thus we see that when the orbit of the ring-belt decreased, the energy of the system decreased also. The moment of momentum of any such system is proportional to the square root of the distance of the two bodies. When the distance between the ring and the earth lessened the moment of momentum remained constant. In other words, the more the system contracted the faster it revolved. This acceleration was the result of what is known to us as the law of the conservation of moment of momentum. \" The apparent anomaly of accounting for an accelerative effect by a retarding cause disappears when it is considered that any check to the motion of bodies revolving round a centre of attraction causes them to draw closer to it, thus shortening their periods and quickening their circulation.\" Agnes M. Clerke, \"History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century,\" 3d ed., pp. 115-116. The late James E. Keeler, Director of the Lick Observatory, proved by his observations with the spectroscope in 1895, that Saturn's rings rotate. According to the undulatory theory, light consists of a series of waves; the spectroscope enables us to measure and count these, and if we find on counting them that there are too many, we know that the source from which the light comes is approaching, but on the other hand, if the number is too few, then we know that it is receding. Keeler proved that one side of Saturn's rings were approaching and the other receding. He also proved that the inner edge of each ring rotates faster than the outer. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 233 was half a maid and half a serpent, and withal a bloodthirsty- wench, had a child, the Sphinx, who was also half woman and half lion, mild jet fierce. The Grecian beast, unlike the Egyptian Sphinx, had wings. This shows that it was a flying canopy. The Thebans suffered in its dreadful maw and asked the question, Will it ever die ? They saw a change coming over it, hence it seemed a riddle. What would be the end ? The mild conditions were passing away. (Edipus, or swollen-foot, the whirling cloud-belt, was seen to drop and go slower and slower. As youth needs another prop in old age, so the canopy needed something. Longevity, which had been man's portion under the greenhouse roof, now ended, and the ancients said the cause was that the Sphinx, or canopy, had cast herself upon a rock. (Edipus thus killed his father; that is, he stopped the upper or revolving ring; also his mother and his wife, who were also sky-forms. Tragic as this ending was, the story is full of beautiful vapor-belt canopy lore. For instance, in his old age, (Edipus was comforted by the presence of his daughter, Antigone, she who was born opposite, the pale light that appears over against the darkening canopy gone blind. His sons are said to have disputed for the throne of Thebes, which was origi- nally a walled city of the canopy. Undoubtedly the Egyptian and Grecian cities were named for it. 17 Seven heroes warred \"Nothing can be plainer than that the names attached to regions and personified appearances in the sky were transferred by the ancients to terrestrial localities. For instance, to locate the original Olympus as a many-peaked earthly mountain would simply embarrass the imag- ination. How could the following vivid picture be explained? evil-minded Juno, full of guile! Thy arts have made the noble Hector leave The combat, and have forced his troops to flee. 1 know not whether 't were not well that thou Shouldst taste the fruit of thy pernicious wiles, Chastised by me with stripes. Dost thou forget When thou didst swing suspended, and I tied Two anvils to thy feet, and bound a chain 234, THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS against its mighty gate, but the battle ended without their taking it. However, there soon after came a day when the great city fell and perished as all sky scenes had to in those strenuous days. The change arrived and slow-foot was the cause. For the same reason that (Edipus was called swollen- foot, Vulcan was made lame, and as the canopy of vapor dissipated its fire went out; thus he also, as the story goes, fell from heaven. The slowing of the speed of the canopy made it appear on earth that it was actually going backwards, which fact is recorded in many myths; thus it is said that Cacus, when he stole the oxen of Geryon, dragged them backward by their tails to his cave. \"Achilles was invulnerable in all parts save the heel. This hero seems indubitably to have been the solar deity, and, as in the case of Baldur, Siegfried, Eustam, etc., could be wounded only in one place. The heel here is symbolic, indicating that he is vulnerable only from behind. So Baldur falls struck by a dart from his blind brother Hb'dur (the dark- ness). Siegfried is wounded by Hagene (the thorn) in the spot between his shoulders where the broad linden leaf had stuck when he was bathing himself in the dragon's blood, by which he was made in all other points invulnerable. \" So in the Algonquin myth of the Summer-maker who had broken through the sky into the heaven-land beyond, and brought down to earth the warm winds, the birds, and the Of gold that none could break around thy wrists? Then didst thou hang in air amid the clouds, And all the gods of high Olympus saw With pity. They stood near, but none of them Were able to release thee. Whoso came Within my reach I seized, and hurled him o'er Heaven's threshold, and he fell upon the earth Scarce breathing. Bryant's Homer's Iliad, bk. xv, 19 ff. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 235 summer, it is said that, pursued by the dwellers in heaven, he was at last wounded by their arrows in his one vulnerable spot, viz., in the tip of the tail. The shining Manitu and Kwasind also could be wounded only in one place, in the scalp or the crown of the head.\" 18 Ovid tells us that a day was lost. The standing still of the sun (Joshua x) is a like reminiscence: the shiner actually did appear to stand still. It is significant that the record is accompanied by a description of the falling stones, for of necessity a canopy reaching this stage must begin to break up. This is the record: \" And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. * * * \" And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. \" And there was no day like that before it or after it.\" 19 Jasher was probably another Zeus; a great dim memory of a terrible time was no doubt bound up in this lost volume. Another account of falling material is found in Deut. xxviii : 23-24, 29, as follows : \" Thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron. The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. * * * And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness.\" M Charles De B. Mills, \" The Tree of Mythology,\" p. 55. 19 Joshua x:ll, 12, 14. 236 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS We have now seen that the hope of the Egyptians was stayed upon ' Osiris Found.' When he was dead Typhon ruled the sky, and the Grecian myth has shown us that his child was the Sphinx. Yea, Egypt is the grave-yard of the past, And here 's the Sphinx with his cold stony lips Touched by the finger of Dame Silence, who Rules o'er this land of ruin and of dust. Plainly a sphinx-temple was a place wherein to worship the cold spirit of the falling vapor-sky. The great sphinx at Ghizeh faces to the east, as though to catch the first glimpse of the day : In eagerness he gazes like to one That's guessing of the future and expects An end that's coming, and a new-born sun. Her head a woman, for she was quite mild, His tail a lion, for he turned out fierce As nearer to the earth he flew in death. And by him stands the three great pyramids, Memorials of the day of stablished things The shadow of the turning earth upon, 20 A canopy which seemed forever fixed. A cloudy mountain which received its light At night-time from beneath; where dwell the shades; From the dead sun, from the great under-world. At midnight this division of the rays By the earth's shadow cast a cone-like form, A pyramid athwart the darkened sky. \" The Hellenic and Eoman myths concerning the ' World- mountain ' were numerous, but in later times not a little confused, as Ideler has learnedly shown. By some, as for example Aristotle, it was identified with the Caucasus, and it was asserted that its height was so prodigious that after sunset its head was illuminated a third part of the night, and again a third part before the rising of the sun in the morning. This identification explains the later legend, according to which, in order to prove his rightful lordship of the world, 80 James i:17. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 237 Alexander the Great plucked 'the shadowless lance' (the earth's axis) out of the topmost peak of the Taurus Moun- tains. More commonly the mount is called Atlas, or the Atlantic mountain. Proclus, quoting Heraclitus, says of it: * Its magnitude is such that it touches the ether and casts a shadow of five thousand stadia in length. From the ninth hour of the day the sun is concealed by it, even to his perfect demersion under the earth.\" 21 This shadow-mountain, which only appeared at night, seemed to stand in the inverted heavens; to the right and left of its cone were two great wings of light, with their apexes downward. \"Draw me (the nocturnal sun), infernal ones! . . . \" Retreat towards the eastern heavens, towards the dwell- ings which support Sar, that mysterious mountain that spreads light among the gods (or, that I may spread light among the gods?), who receive me when I go forth from amongst you, from the retreat.\" \" To the inverted infernal mountain seem to apply the expressions in chapter one hundred and fifty of the e Book of the Dead:' \" We have said that it is not likely that the ancients, unac- quainted with Newton's law of gravitation, could have pic- tured a pendent under-surf ace to the earth, so it follows that the midnight appearance of the mountain is here referred to. \" Oh, the very tall Hill in Hades ! The heaven rests upon it. There is a snake or dragon upon it: Sati is his name,\" etc. The presence of the snake and the fact that heaven rests on the Hill of Hades confirms our supposition that a world under the horizon was not dreamt of. \" In another chapter of the same book a place is spoken of as ' the inverted precinct, which place is Hades.' \" As heaven, according to the text cited above, rests on Hades, the locality of this precinct is fixed in the inverted night-sky. 21 William F. Warren, \"Paradise Found,\" pp. 135-136. 238 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS The translator of another text, called the ' Book of Hades/ describes a ( pendent mountain/ which can hardly be any- thing other than Ap-en-to, the inverted mountain of Hades. On the other hand, the expression ' underworld ' is con- tinually used in the writings and lore of the ancients, so that beyond question the great inverted wings of light shin- ing up from below gave the peoples of those days an inkling of a region lying beneath. Our contention is that this place is not the mythological abode of the shades. The following shows the confused notions relative these two regions, the night-mountain, Hades, and the true underworld. \" The god advancing in a reversed position \" (in a certain New Zealand legend) \" is the sun in the Underworld. The image exactly accords with an Egyptian scene of the sun passing through Hades, where we see the twelve gods of the earth, or the lower domain of night, marching towards a mountain turned upside down, and two typical personages are also turned upside down. This is an illustration of the passage of the sun through the Underworld. The reversed on the same monument are the dead. Thus the Osirified deceased, who had attained the second life, in the Ritual, says exultingly, ' I do not walk upon my head.' The dead, as the Akhu, are the spirits, and the Atua (of the New Zealand legend) is a spirit who comes walking upside down. Massey elsewhere states that the earth 'was considered flat by the first myth-makers,' who in his scheme appear to have been Egyptians.\" 22 A flat world does not bring any support to those who believe Hades was located in the nether hemi- sphere. In the ' Eitual ' the Osirified dead says, \" I do not walk upon my head.\" Had a pendent world been dreamt of, everything would have been considered upside down. In Genesis i : 16 there are two great lights mentioned ; the greater ruled the day and the lesser the night. Egyptian IUd., pp. 124, 125, 126. \"Records of the Past,\" vol. x, p. 88. \" The Natural Genesis,\" London, 1883, vol. i, p. 529. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 239 mythology is full of references to the night-time as a time of shade: A weird a fearful time, those hours of night, With spook-like spectres shivering in the sky, The canopy a sheeted envelope, Ghosts and hobgoblins drifting in mid-air, The ka or double visiting the tomb. The shadow, or dark mountain, seemed much higher at night, and as its mass seemed to rise out of the realm of shades, it was only a step for the ancients to associate it with the dead, hence when they made patterns of it, these pyra- mids or likenesses naturally became tombs. The chambers, built into them, wherein the withered mummies awaited the coming back of their ka, were simply imitations of the halls wherein the dead sun hid himself in the dismal mountain. We erect memorials in our graveyards to-day in the shape of broken columns or shafts, which signify to us a life cut short by death. The pyramids suggested to the ancients pretty much the same thought, hence they built them over the chambers of their dead. The same rectangular arrangement of temples which pre- vailed in Egypt held also in Chaldea. They lifted their eyes to the mountain in the sky ' the Father of Countries/ and imagined it the abode of the gods, the future home of every great and good man, ' a land with a silver sky.' The story of the building of the tower of Babel is the story of an effort on the part of the people to get into this home, as it were, surreptitiously. In the New World there were similar tales. Donnelly says: \" There is also a clearly established legend which singu- larly resembles the Bible record of the Tower of Babel. \"Father Duran, in his MS. ' Historia Antiqua de la Nueva Espanaf A. D. 1585, quotes from the lips of a native of Oholula, over one hundred years old, a version of the legend as to the building of the great pyramid of Cholula. It is as follows : 240 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" In the beginning, before the light of the sun had been created, this land (Cholula) was in obscurity and darkness, and void of any created thing; all was a plain, without hill or elevation, encircled in every part by water, without trees or created thing; and immediately after the light and the sun arose in the east there appeared gigantic men of deformed stature and possessed the land, and, desiring to see the nativ- ity of the sun, as well as his Occident, proposed to go and seek them. Dividing themselves into two parties, some jour- neyed to the west and others toward the east ; these travelled until the sea cut their road, whereupon they determined to return to the place from which they started, and, arriving at this place (Cholula), not finding the means of reaching the sun, enamoured of his light and beauty, they determined to build a tower so high that its summit should reach the sky. Having collected materials for the purpose, they found a very adhesive clay and bitumen, with which they speedily commenced to build the tower; and, having reared it to the greatest possible altitude, so that they say it reached to the sky, the Lord of the Heavens, enraged, said to the inhabitants of the sky, ' Have you observed how they of the earth have built a high and haughty tower to mount hither, being enamoured of the light of the sun and his beauty? Come and confound them, because it is not right that they of the earth, living in the flesh, should mingle with us.' Imme- diately the inhabitants of the sky sallied forth like flashes of lightning; they destroyed the edifice, and divided and scat- tered its builders to all parts of the earth.\" 23 Another enigma of the pyramids is the fact that they are usually orientated roughly according to the cardinal points. However, when we consider the evidence that their builders naturally followed the design in the heavens, this result is logical. 28 Ignatius Donnelly, \"Atlantis/' 21st ed., pp. 200-201. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 241 The fact that the four faces do not exactly conform to the cardinal points has been set down as bad management or neglect on the part of the builders, but when it is remem- bered that they built according to the pattern in the sky, and that they viewed this pattern from various angles and at various stages of its collapse, it will be seen that this accusa- tion is unjust. The oldest of the pyramids, as shown by the texts, is located north of Abydos. It belonged to Sneferu and was erected in the Fourth Dynasty; the latest belonged to the princes of the Twelfth Dynasty. 24 The construction of these monuments was therefore a continuous work, lasting some thirteen or fourteen centuries. During this long period the orientation of the cloud-mountain, which was ever drift- ing northwards, must have varied considerable. Tombs known as mastabas, which conveyed the same idea as the pyramids, were built before the Fourth Dynasty. Their angle is 75 and the pyramid angle from 50 to 55. Piazza Smyth contended that the angles of the* Great Pyramid of Cheops contain factors from which can be cal- culated the distance of the sun from our earth. Unwittingly, if the ancient builders built true, to their model, this- data has been handed down to us. Another remarkable piece of testimony from this ancient pile at Ghizeh is found in the fact that if one should go down the entrance passageway and then turn around and look out he would find himself gazing into the northern sky, which was probably the only spot of the clear blue visible at the time of the erection of this great monument. Perhaps Alpha Draconis, which was then (2170 B. 0.) the North Star, and which was a very distinguished feature of the polar-egg or opening, may have shone right down this passageway when M G. Maspero, \"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology,\" trans. Amelia B. Edwards, 1895, p. 132, see also p. 140. 16 243 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the pyramid was built. Be this as it may, this egg-shaped opening is recorded in the myths of nearly all the ancients. It is called by the Greeks \" Isles of the Blessed.\" The poets have mistaken the locality of this sky-hole, owing to the fact that they naturally associated it with the sunset glory. We say naturally, for after the fall of the canopy it was the only sky-scene that could be compared to the original ruddy isle of Erytheia, on which the bright oxen (clouds) of Geryon were pastured. It was the isle of the Hesperides, and the apples were the stars seen in its clear expanse. Job draws a distinction between ' The Island of the Innocent ? and the other countries of the world (xxii : 30). Ovid draws one between ' The Earth ' and the rest of the globe. Plainly the ancients had an idea that terra firma was in some way united with the canopy. \" On the- western margin, of the- earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a happy place named the E-lysi-an Plain, whither mortals favored by the gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an immortality of bliss. This happy region was also called ' Fortunate Fields ' and the ' Isles of the Blessed.' \" 25 They need not the moon in that land of delight, They need not the pale, pale star; The sun is bright, by day and night, Where the souls of the blessed are. They till not the ground, they plow not the wave, They labor not, never! oh, never! Not a tear do they shed, not a sigh do- they heave ; They are happy for ever and ever ! * Wherever pyramid worship is found, one or more of these features is in evidence. The teocalli of Cholula covers more than twice the ground-space of Cheops. It is orientated, and in a vast hollow chamber under the structure- was found two skeletons. The Mexican pyramids at Cholula and at Tula are said to resemble marvelously certain Assyrian and Chal- Bulfinch, \" Age of Fable,\" Scott, p. 3. * Pindar. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 343 dean temples. 27 One of these teocalli glorified Quetzalcoatl the good canopy who as a god was reputed to have made flowers grow profusely. Originally Mexicans offered fruits and flowers to him, but afterwards his nature changed, so to propitiate him they offered human sacrifices. Quetzalcoatl reminds the investigator of the prince of Tyrus, the covering cherub. The Spaniards also found two pyramids at San Juan Teotihuacan, one of which was dedicated to the sun and the other to the moon, but evidence was found that an older cult had been superseded. In one of these a passageway ter- minated in two small pits or wells, showing that they were used as tombs. Nearby are many smaller mounds. The two great ones are orientated east and west. The great pyramid mound of the Incas on the banks of the Moche River is 800 feet long and 150 feet high, and has preserved up to this time the secret of its erection. The Mound Builders have left similar relics in the North Ameri- can Continent. In western Illinois, at about the centre of the river flats known as the American Bottom, are a number of mound-groups. Cahokia, a truncated pyramid, is the largest individual mound; it covers over fourteen acres, or more than is covered by the largest Egyptian Pyramid. \" The great mound at Seltzertown, Mississippi, is of such dimensions as almost to preclude the belief of its artificial origin. It is a truncated pyramid, about 600 feet long and 400 broad at its base, and covering nearly six acres of ground. It is placed very nearly in reference to the cardinal points, its greater length being east and west. Its height is forty feet, accessible by a graded way which leads to a platform of four acres on the summit. From this platform rise three conical mounds, one at each end and one in the centre. Both \"Prescott, \"Conquest of Mexico,\" book iii, ch. vi. Scientific American Supplement, No. 645. Foster, \" Prehistoric Races of the United States of America,\" 6th ed., p. 345. 244 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS of the extreme mounds are truncated, the westernmost ris- ing to the height of forty feet, and the easternmost is some- what less.\" 28 Our author goes on to show that certain of these mounds were used as burial places. He says : \" The temple-mounds were also used as sepulchres. In that at Seltzertown, Dr. Dickeson found ' vast quantities of human skeletons/ and Mr. Hill, the former owner of the Cahokia Mound, in sink- ing a well on its platform, encountered charcoal at the depth of twenty-five feet. The Grave Creek Mound, which is in the form of a truncated cone the flattened area on top being fifty feet in diameter, and therefore coming under the classi- fication of temple-mounds was found to enclose two vaults originally constructed of wood, which contained human skele- tons.\" 29 \" The Grave Creek Mound, twelve miles below Wheeling, in West Virginia, is the most notable of all those in the Ohio Valley. \" It is seventy feet in height by nine hundred in circum- ference, and is destitute of lines of circumvallation. In 1838 Mr. A. B. Tomlinson, the owner of the premises, carried a drift along the original surface of the ground to the centre of the mound, and sank a shaft from the summit to intercept it. ' At the distance of one hundred and eleven feet/ he states, in a pamphlet published after the completion of the exploration, ' we came to a vault, which had been excavated before the mound was commenced, eight by twelve feet and seven in depth. Along each side and across the ends, upright timbers had been placed, which supported timbers thrown across the vault as a ceiling. These timbers were covered with loose unhewn stone, common to the neighborhood. The timbers had rotted and had tumbled into the vault. * J. W. Foster, \" Prehistoric Races of the United States of America,\" 6th ed., p. 112. \"Hid., pp. 186-187. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 245 In this vault were two human skeletons, one of which had no ornaments; the other was surrounded by six hundred and fifty ivory (shell) beads, and an ivory (bone) ornament, six inches long. \" In sinking the shaft, at thirty-four feet above the first or bottom vault a similar one was found, enclosing a skeleton which had been decorated with a profusion of shell-beads, copper-rings, and plates of mica.' 7 30 All this goes to show that the same idea of death was associated with the dismal cloud-mountain by the Mexicans, Peruvians, Mound Builders, and Egyptians. So it was also in Babylonia, the colossal zikkurats lifting their lofty sum- mits in honor of the same cloud-mountain. Herman Y. Hilprecht says : \" I have recently found evidence that, like the Egyptian pyramid, the Babylonian stage-tower (or step-pyramid) without doubt was viewed in the light of a sepulchral mound erected in honor of a god.\" Our author adds : \" I am also inclined to see a last remi- niscence of the Babylonian zikkurat in the meftul, the char- acteristic watch-tower and defensive bulwark of the present Ma 7 dan tribes of Central Babylonia.\" 31 Daniel G. Brinton tells of a like tower built by the lord of Tezcuco, which to our minds also reflects the old source of inspiration. Brinton says : \" Nezahutal erected a temple nine stories high to represent the nine heavens, which he dedicated ' to the Unknown God, the Cause of Causes. 7 This temple, he ordained, should never be polluted by blood, nor should any graven image ever be set up within its precincts. 77 32 The type of the holy cloud-mountain was reproduced in 80 IUd., pp. 190-191. 81 \" Explorations in Bible Lands During the Nineteenth Century/ p. 287. 82 \" The Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., p. 73. 246 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS every palace and temple of Babylonia, 33 sometimes by build- ing it as an artificial mound with trees and plants watered from above; again, on a larger scale by the zikkurat or ' Mountain Peak/ the later device being a sort of pyramid of three, five, or seven stages. \" One of these is the zikkurat to Nin-girsu at Lagash, which Gudea describes as ' the house of seven divisions of the world ' ; the other, the tower at Uruk, which bore the name ' house of seven zones.' The reference in both cases is, as Jensen has shown, to the seven concentric zones into which the earth was divided by the Babylonians. It is a conception that we encounter in India and Persia, and that survives in the seven ' climates ? into which the world was divided by Greek and Arabic geographers. It seems clear that this interpretation of the number seven is older than the one which identified each story with one of the planets.\" 34 This leads us into another field of research, and in pass- ing it may be well to glance at the significance of this mys- tical number. Jastrow adds : \" The suggestion is worthy of consideration whether the name ' seven directions of heaven and earth ' may not also point to a conception of seven zones dividing the heavens as well as the earth. One is reminded of the f seven ' heavens of Arabic theology.\" 35 One is also reminded of the seven ropes that twirled the sky- mountain of the Hindus. Heaped were the mountains in heaps. The serpents began to twine There were seven of these ' Fiery Phantoms/ that twirled away at the line, Over them rushed heaven's ocean, Anu a river broad Which flowed round this world of ours, around where the monster clawed. 83 The palaces were veritable terrestrial paradises. The name shows the origin, for paradise (in Sanskrit, para desa) means literally high land. 84 Jastrow, \"Keligion of Babylonia and Assyria,\" ch. xxvi, pp. 619-620. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 247 Ea, alias the ' House of the Waters,' lived in this ocean vast, An * Exalted Fish ' they called him, in the story of Vishnu cast. The fact that this great mountain always turned upon its axis in an easterly course is probably the reason why the following strange passage occurs in the Book of the Dead. It's written in the ' Ritual ' \" Retreat, Retreat,\" it says, \" Unto the eastern heavens, Unto the dwellings which support the mount That great mysterious mountain that spreads light Among the gods,\" high in the northern sky. Such was the substance of the direction given to the dead to guide them on their skyward journey to the ' Blessed Land.' In the pyramid built for King Teta (about 3300 B. C.) the following text occurs: \" Teta comes to the two heavens, Teta arrives at the two earths, Teta treads upon the herbage growing under the feet of Seb, he traverses the road of Nu-t.\" 36 The mountain chambers, the Hall of Two Truths, and Set or Seb, the verdant earth, are all depicted before the departed Teta, and he is told that he must traverse the road of ISTu-t; that is, the sky-road. This sky, according to some, extended overhead like an immense iron ceiling, and, according to others, like a huge shallow vault. For this reason \" iron, like many other things in Egypt, was pure or impure according to circumstances. If some traditions held it up to odium as an evil thing, and stigmatized it as the ( bones of Typhon,' other traditions, equally venerable, affirmed that it was the very substance of the canopy of heaven. So authoritative was this view, that iron was cur- rently known as ' Ba-en-pet/ or the celestial metal.\" 37 It was plain even to the ancients that such a sky could not remain unsupported in space, therefore Nu-t was supposed \"Scientific American Supplement No. 1075. 87 G. Maspero, \"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology,\" trans. Amelia B. Edwards, 1895, p. 196. 248 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS to be sustained in her lofty position by her arms and legs. These made four pillars; accordingly their temples were planned to illustrate this idea. \" The columns, and if need- ful the four corners of the chambers, stood for the pillars. The roofj vaulted at Abydos, flat elsewhere, corresponded exactly with the Egyptian idea of the sky. Each of these parts was, therefore, decorated in consonance with its mean- ing. Those next to the ground were clothed with vegetation. The bases of the columns were surrounded by leaves.\" 38 The vaulted roof sometimes contained stars. At others ser- pents, the various names of which are ' Fire Face/ ' Flaming Eye/ < Evil Eye/ etc. 39 The Egyptians kept a festival to commemorate the sus- pension of the sky by the ancient god Ptah, ' the Opener/ who was venerated as creator of the world. J. Norman Lockyer says: \" About 5300 B. C. we seem almost in the time of the divine dynasties, and begin to understand how it is that in the old traditions Ptah precedes Ka and is called ' the father of the beginnings, and the creator of the egg of the Sun and Moon.' \" 40 After Ptah came the great Sun-god Ka, whose father was Nu or E\"u-t. Ka waged war against the demon of darkness called Apap or Apapi, who was a serpent. He journeyed over Nu-t's back, traversed over the road of Nu-t. This Nu-t is represented in her drawings as a female figure spanning the heavens, her finger-tips touching the one horizon and her toes the other. !N\"u-t, like all the canopies, was the ( mother of the gods. 7 In the Hindu and Babylonian myths we have seen that the vapor-belt was credited with being the source of life both in the heavens and in the earth. The canopy diffused the solar rays and diffusion seems to 38 Ibid., p. 90. m llid., p. 164. 40 \"The Dawn of Astronomy,\" ch. xxxi, p. 318. Brugsch, \"Religion und Mythologie,\" p. 111. Pierret, \" Salle Historique de la Galerie Egyptiewne\" (du Louvre), p. 199. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 249 have made confusion, for with each new aspect of light a new god was born. Thus the list was ever being increased, and yet, after all, how many gods were there? Many were closely related and many more may be proved to be actually identical. For instance, Hathor, the cow-headed (i.e., cloud- headed) was worshiped at Denderah. She was born out from and in the cloud, and is certainly only another aspect of the arched Nu-t. She also, like Nu-t, is said to have been the i mother of all living/ but what is of more importance is that she is identified with Aphrodite and corresponds to Jshtar, and some enthusiasts have even gone so far as to say that her cult can be traced in the worship of the aborigines of North America, but this similarity is only a witness of the common phenomenon personified and deified both in the east and in the west. As Aphrodite was the goddess of eternal light, it is probable that Hathor was that aspect of perpetual illumination seen in Nu-t and which the Hindus recorded by saying that \" Agni was Yaruna and was Indra too.\" Sometimes Nu-t is represented double, a larger stretching over a smaller one. The outer one is studded with stars. The inner one, however, is plainly a band of water. These wheels within wheels suggest a firmament above and below, and they show us the evolutionary process by which it came about that the vapor-belt was looked upon as the ' mother.' Ascending and descending on E\"u-t's curved back, athwart the vaulted sky, are boats containing the gods. These, of course, were shells of light (halos) surrounding the heavenly orbs. These boats or halos seen ascending and descending on Nu-t's body were the origin of many customs and myths. At first baris or barks sustained on the priest's shoulders were carried in procession. In these, \" hidden from the sight of every profane eye, were supposed to be stationed those renowned gods descended from the Yedic Aria upon the land of Kemi at successive and 250 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS unknown epochs: Ph-t-ah, or Agny, meaning fire; Ph-Ra, an equivalent of Re, Ra, Ri, La, El, the sun (i.e., shiner) ; Jom, an equivalent of Om, Aom, and Homa; Sevek, i.e., Siva; and Asiri, the equivalent of Asura. These were the Indian deities and titles with which the analogy of the Egyp- tian gods and goddesses is thus indicated.\" 41 These baris also contained the local conceptions of the gods, many of them half monster, half woman. Menes, according to the historical record, is the first king of the first dynasty. He was reputed to be \" the successor of Asiri, the son and god of the dead ; he belongs to the first Vedic tradition, like the Sanskrit Manu, son of the Sun and brother of the Asura Yama, the god of the dead; like the Manes of Lydia, son of Cronus ; like the Cretan Menos, son of Zeus; the Minyas of lolcus, son of Titan, and the Manus of Germany, son of Chaos.\" 42 But to return to the custom of taking the gods around in boats. In Egypt the display naturally sought the waters of the Nile, and as the whole procedure was associated with death, it was not long before funeral rites began to develop along the same lines. Thus sacred barks were built, after the model of the bari, in which the mummy was conveyed to its last resting place, the idea being that as the gods floated in boats over the canopy-sea, so also their sacred dead were required to journey. \" In their effort to restore the dead men to the happy island-home, the heavenly land beyond the water, the Norsemen actually set their dead heroes afloat in boats on the open ocean.\" 43 The world wide conception being that the canopy-sea was connected with the terrestrial ocean. The island-home refers to the Isles of the Blessed, the egg-hole of the north. 41 F. De Lanoye, \"Wonders of Art and Archaeology in Egypt 3300 Years Ago,\" p. 78. \"Ibid., p. 287. 48 Poor, \"Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures,\" pp. 371, 372. EGYPTIAN MYTHS 251 In the boat in which the sun-god of Egypt took his daily ride on the Nile, a shrine was placed amidships, which was covered with a veil to conceal him from the eyes of the spectators. Looking at the original diurnal journey of the sun across the canopy, the record shows that he was at one time lost, as it were, in the folds of Apapi. G. Maspero says : \" After the fifth hour, the heavenly ocean became a vast battle-field. The gods of light pursued, captured, and bound the serpent Apapi, and at the twelfth hour they strangled him. But this triumph was not of long duration. Scarcely had the sun achieved this victory when his bark was borne by the tide into the realm of the night hours.\" 44 It is interesting to find that this custom has continued down to the present day, and it is instructive, for it shows us with what tenacity an idea is passed from one generation to another. We may well surmise that any such relics sur- viving the last thousand years may have come down through indefinite ages. Two illustrations of the present-day sur- vivals will suffice. The khedive of Egypt still sends to Mecca as an annual gift a tabernacle, known as Mahmal, that pre- sents the outline of a ship. We find the other illustration in India. Frank S. Dobbins says: \" As of almost all the gods, Ganesha (the elephant god) has his festivals, when the people come together in great crowds to do him honor. At one of these annual festivals they bring forth the god Ganesha, place him in a boat, and, accompanied with other boats containing priests and musi- cians, they row up and down the Ganges. The great crowds of people lining the shore fill the air with their shouts and songs, and the occasion is one of exuberant joy.\" 4a Modified by art, beautiful stories have grown from the 44 \"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology,\" trans. Amelia B. Edwards, p. 164. \"\"Gods and Deyils of Mankind,\" p. 269. 252 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS same myth. ' Lohengrin ' is one of these. With a few alter- ations, we give it as told by Charles De B. Mills. He tells us that: \" Lohengrin is one of those heroes, half unearthly, who come, men know not whence, and are first seen sleeping in a boat upon a river. Lohengrin was son of Percival, and he heard once the peal of a bell far away, untouched by human hands, in the temple of the Grail at Montsalvatch. That peal was a signal that help was needed. He arose and was starting, not knowing whither he should go. Foot in stirrup, ready to mount his horse, he saw a swan on the river, drawing a ship along. ' Take back the horse to its stable/ said he. ' I will go with the bird, whither it shall lead.' Five days he was on the water, drawn in his boat not only, but supplied with nourishment by the faithful bird. At the end of this time, they came where the lists were opened by Frederick Von Telramund, a brave knight, who would fight against any champion she might bring forward for possession of Elsa of Brabant, who had refused his suit. Lohengrin undertook the defense of the Lady, fought, prevailed, slew Frederick, and in return was offered her hand and the duchy. He accepted it on condition : she must never ask his race. Hap- pily they lived together for a time, but one night, piqued with curiosity and stung with insinuations and reproaches she had heard, she did put the fatal question. \" Lohengrin sorrowfully called his children together, kissed them, and said : e Here are my horn and my sword, keep them carefully; and here, my wife, is the ring my mother gave me ; never part with it.' At break of day, the swan reappeared, drawing the boat, Lohengrin reentered and disappeared, nevermore to return. \" This story ought to be transparent enough. It is the reproduction of the old, old tale, the prince wedded to the dawn (or, rather, the sun wedded to the canopy, for it seems that the original myth dealt not with the daily occurrence EGYPTIAN MYTHS 253 but with the yearly phenomenon). He had rescued the maiden, marries her, but cannot remain with her; he comes in a boat (a shell of light, a halo), and he also goes in a boat, drawn by the faithful swan that swims the cerulean seas. There is a close relation of this tale with those of Melusina, of Undine, of Pururavas and Urvasi, Eros and Psyche, etc. ' Lohengrin ' is one of a family of stories cele- brating Knights of the Swan.\" 46 46 \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 91-93.

Was their slumber deep? Not this our dreamless rest that knows no waking, But that to which the years are as a day? What! are they coming back, their prison breaking, These gods of Homer's chant, of Pindar's lay? Olympia? Yes, strange tidings from the city Which pious mortals builded, stone by stone, For those old gods of Hellas, half in pity Of their storm-mantled height and dwelling lone, Their seat upon the mountain overhanging Where Zeus withdrew behind the rolling cloud, Where crowned Apollo sang, the phorminx twanging, And at Poseidon's word the forests bowed. Ay, but that fated day When from the plain Olympia passed awayj When ceased the oracles, and long unwept Amid their fanes the gods deserted fell, While sacerdotal ages, as they slept, The ruin covered well ! 1 JUST as in the case with the other nations, the beings called gods by the Greeks are only personifications of the powers and objects of nature, and the legends likewise are only representations of the courses of nature and its operations. The farther back the myths are traced, the more closely the gods become associated with the scenes of the canopy. Thus the Greek sky-god, Zeus, corresponds to the Hindu sky- god, Dyaus. The word is derived from the root ' dyu/ which 'Stedman's \"News From Olympia.' 254 MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 255 means ' to shine.' He was the ' Heaven father ' called by the Hindus Dyaus-pitar, by the Romans Diovis-pater or Jupiter, by the Greeks Zeus-pater. Uranus means i the coverer.' His name is derived from the root ' var.' He is identified with the Hindu Varuna, the vault of heaven. 2 Hera comes from the Sanskrit root ' svar ' the bright sky. Cannes, half man, half fish, was an Eastern god, the Lord of Darkness. His name is derived from the Hindu Anu. Apollo may be derived from a Sanskrit form, Apa-var-yan or Apa-val-yan, and may mean ( one who opens the gate of the sky.' 3 At some remote period, probably, the ancestors of the Greeks said : \" The one who opens the gate of the sky pursues the burning one (Dahana).\" This soon assumed the form, Apollo courted Daphne and she fled from him and was turned into a laurel tree. The significance of the tree in mythology will be enlarged upon later when we come to consider the World-ash of Scandinavia. Some other scholars Schroder, for instance- think that Apollo is derived from the Yedic Saparagenya, an epithet of Agni. This again brings us to the canopy, as Agni was the light seen in the great world-blanket. It is strange, but the theft of fire seems to be the theme-root in both cases. Herodotus says : \" Whence each of the gods sprung, whether they existed always, and of what form they were, was, so to speak, unknown till yesterday. For I am of opinion that Hesiod and Homer lived four hundred years before my time, and not more, and these were they who framed a theogony for the Greeks, and gave names to the gods, and assigned to them honors and arts, and declared their several forms.\" * * * \" Indeed, the names of almost all the gods came from Egypt into Greece; for that they came from barbarians I find on inquiry to be the case ; and I think they chiefly proceeded from Egypt.\" 4 'Hopkins, \"Religions of India,\" pp. 166, 167. 3 Max Mtiller, ii, 692-697. 4 B. ii, 50, 53, Gary's translation. 256 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS The astronomical systems of the Egyptians and the Greeks also show clearly the effects of a common origin, the original sky-canopy ring system. \" F. A. Paley aids the imagination of his readers as follows : ' We might familiarly illustrate the Hesiodic notion of the flat circular earth and the convex overarching sky by a circular plate with a hemi- spherical dish-cover of metal placed over it and concealing it. Above the cover (which is supposed to rotate on an axis) live the gods. Bound the inner concavity is the path of the sun, giving light to the earth below.\" 5 Aristotle tells plainly that the sky was solid. The great philosopher of Stagia said : \" The universe is a fixed point ; the central point is earth, and above it is a bounding field.\" \" Stars,\" he added, \" are fixed to it like studs.\" Euclid and Cicero also taught that the stars were fixed in a solid sphere. The astral note from Egypt comes from Claudius Ptolemseus. His ' Heavens of the Spheres ' were composed of nine con- centric circles, including the fire ring. All of which were of glass. This latter, or fire-ring, seems to have been a remi- niscence of the fire or sunlight seen in the old canopy when Agni was Yaruna and was Indra too. It was located nearer to the earth than any of the other spheres. This whole peculiar astronomical conception undoubtedly grew out of the old method of thought, and it was not until the time of Seneca that the question was raised against it. How heret- ical the following must have sounded : \" Is the sky solid and of a firm and compact substance ? \" They had always been taught that it was. In connection with the idea of concentric rings, it is interesting to find that the Finn cosmogonists actually be- lieved that the world was one huge egg, the sky the shell, and the yolk the earth. The Norsemen contended that the sky was Ymer's skull, the earth his flesh, and the rocks his bones. 8 \"The Epics of Hesiod, with an English Commentary,\" London, 1861, p. 172. MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 257 It is significant that Ymer seems originally to have meant the sea the word being akin to the Latin mare. 6 The Hindus supposed that the world stood on a turtle's back. Ruskin says : \" The tortoise shell, the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy sky.\" Cooper says : \" With reference to the turtle, there is probability in the view that the name of this animal was first given as a symbol of the world, the upper shell representing the sky, the under shell the earth, and the body between the two the atmosphere.\" 7 Between the shells of the turtle we can imagine that Chaos ~Nox and Darkness reigned. Erebus, or blackness, was a veritable existence. All the cosmogonies begin with this ' Age of Darkness.' Orpheus says : \" From the begin- ning the gloomy night enveloped and obscured all things that were under the ether. The earth was invisible on account of the darkness, but the light broke through the ether and illuminated the earth.\" Sanchoniathon was a Phosnician and only fragments of his writings survive. He tells us that \" the beginning of all things was a condensed, windy air, or a breeze of thick air, and a chaos turbid and black as Erebus. Out of this chaos was generated Mot, which some call Ilus, but others the putrefaction of a watery mixture. And from this sprang all the seed of the creation, and the generation of the universe. * * * And when the air began to send forth light, winds were produced and clouds, and very great defluxions and torrents of the heavenly waters.\" Berosus, the Babylonian whose records have been pre- served in the temple of Belus, says : \" There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were pro- duced of a twofold principle.\" 8 Cooper, \" Serpent Myths,\" p. 17. 7 Charles De B. Mills, \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 34, 35. 17 258 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" From the ' Laws of Menu/ of the Hindus, we learn that the universe existed at first in darkness.\" The following text is taken from the Vedas : \" The Supreme Being alone ex- isted; afterward there was universal darkness; next the watery ocean was produced by the diffusion of virtue.\" The Thlinkeets of British Columbia say : \" Very dark, damp, and chaotic was the world in the beginning; nothing with breath or body moved there except Yehl ; in the likeness of a raven he brooded over the mist; his black winds beat down the vast confusion; the waters went back before him and the dry land appeared. The Thlinkeets were placed on the earth though how or when does not exactly appear while the world was still in darkness, and without sun, moon, or stars.\" 8 Pythias, in the early times, before the mariner's compass was invented, coasted from Marseilles to the Shetland Isles. On one occasion, when he returned, he declared that his progress was stopped by an immense black clam or oyster, which was suspended in the air. And he further declared that if any ship advanced toward it it would be swallowed up in its gigantic shell. In the Greek cosmogony Chaos gave way to Uranus, the shining canopy or coverer, and to Pontus, the sky-ocean. It is recorded of Uranus that he hated all his children, and directly after their birth he placed them under the Tartarian pall; that is, he hid them in darkness. Cronus then dethroned him, the new forms supplanting the old. But in turn he did even worse by his offspring, for it is said that he devoured the first five. In order to save the sixth, Rhea, his wife, \" succeeded in duping her husband by giving him a stone (perhaps rudely hewn into the figure of an infant) wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which he swallowed, believing he had got rid of another danger. 'Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 98. Ignatius Donnelly, \" Ragnarok,\" pp. 208, 209, 213. MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 259 \" While the husband was being deceived in this fashion, Zeus, the newly-born child (the true sky), was conveyed to the island of Crete, and there concealed in a cave on Mount Ida. The nymphs Adrastea and Ida tended and nursed him, the goat Amalthea supplied him with milk, bees gathered honey for him, and in the meantime, lest his infantile cries should reach the ears of Cronus, Jlhea's servants, the Curetes, were appointed to keep up a continual noise and din in the neighborhood by dancing and clashing their swords and shields. \" When Zeus (the true sky) had grown to manhood he succeeded by the aid of Gaea, or perhaps of Metis, in per- suading Cronus to bring back into the light the sons whom he had swallowed and the stone which had been given him in deceit. The stone was placed at Delphi as a memorial for all time. The liberated gods joined their brethren in a league to drive their father from the throne and set Zeus in his place.\" 9 The age of Cronus is called the ' Golden/ for he was the protecting god, blanketing the earth as under a greenhouse roof. His name means the ' Dark One.' But as this signi- fies nothing in this age, it being unintelligible to modern thought, confusion has naturally followed. Thus, Max Miiller says he is Time ( ?) ; Kuhn, Midnight-sky; Sayce, the sun ; Canon Taylor, Star-swallowing sky ; Tiel, Midnight- sky, Under-world, etc. ; Hartung, Sun scorching spring. Thus the authorities are set in confusion. Now, in the light of the present hypothesis all is clear: the new-born scenes were smothered by the dark one, and thus hidden from the earth. Bright Zeus (Jupiter), the true sky, alone escaped this fate. As we have seen, the liberated gods, according to the legend, now decided to enthrone Zeus in his rightful place, but the Titans, the elder gods, did not acquiesce to this \"Murray, \"Manual of Mythology,\" 20th ed., pp. 45-46. 260 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS change of government. These giants sprang from the blood of Uranus, the old ring; they were of such monstrous size, being closer to the eye than the other sky-forms, and they were of such fearful appearance, that it is no wonder that the people of Greece thought that they were swallowing up all the other gods. They were twelve in number. Amongst them were Oceanus, whose very name suggests water, and whose children were all mythological rivers, Alphesu, Peneus, etc.; his daughters were called the Oceanides. Hyperion was another one of the twelve. He seems to have been the light in the canopy, for he is credited with being the father of Helios, the sun; Selene, the moon; and Eos, or Aurora, the dawn. Of course all these lights were first seen in the canopy. lapetos, or Japetus, was the father of Atlas, whom all know so well because of his bearing the vapor globe on his back. lapetus was imprisoned with Cronus, the old vapor sky in Tartarus, the black canopy. Cronus is also one of the Titans. His wife, Ehea, whose Latin name is Cybele, like all the canopies was called ' the mother ? because she was the mother of the gods, the Magna Mater. She is of the same nature as !N~u-t, with whom she may be identified. We have mentioned the fact that the Titans did not acquiesce in the change of government brought about by the gods liberated from the maw of Cronus, hence war broke out. In other words, though the clear sky had appeared, remnants of the old canopies still lingered, and these vapor-forms were said to be warring with the new gods, who time and again slew them. Yet, nothing fearing, these great giants of the fallen canopy ever returned to the attack. It is said that they took up Ossa (a cloud mountain) and piled it on the top of Mount Pelion (another cloud moun- tain), and from this great height they sprang upon Olympus, the home mountain of the new race of gods. 10 It is then said 10 The cloud-mountains, of which Olympus was the mightiest, were permanent features in the upper atmosphere, and are not to be con- MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 261 that these giants drove the gods and heroes down into Egypt, that is, into the southern sky, which alone remained clear and open from their black, gigantic forms. Apollo, the sun, was changed into a crow, a ka, or kaw, a soul separated from its body; that is, an outcast hidden in the vapor. Zeus (Jupiter, Jove), the pure sky, was changed into a raven; that is, black cloudlets floated athwart his fair face. Disguised thus, he was sacrificed unto the spirit of the watery waste. Hera (Juno) was turned into a red-cow, which recalls to our mind the fact that in the Hindu myths lowing kine were clouds. Venus, like Ea, was changed into a fish. The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills Like lambs, or young sons of the flock, the clouds. No wonder that the Psalmist asked the sea What ailed it, that it fled away and fell. The Giants falling covered the pure sky, And solid flint was changed into a stream. 11 After many days Pallas Athene (Minerva), who was the offspring of Zeus, without a mother, and whom the records tell us sprang from his head completely armed, invented for her father thunderbolts. With these he hurried back to the war. The open sky brought our modern storm with it, thus thunder was a newly invented thing, and it is further re- corded that with its might he subdued the giants one and all. O Thunderer! O mighty Thunderer! O wondrous blue sky that hast come to stay! We scarce may think of thee when thou didst dwell Above Olympus, when the mind of man Knew not and saw not save by sound in ear. He heard thy infant voice as thunder speak, And, hearing, knew a change was coming soon. It seems so strange, O Zeus, that once there was A curtain hanging o'er thy face, a veil, fused with the fleeting storm forms. These mountains held their position under the uplifting influence of a zonal canopy-belt which prevented the radiation of their heat, and thus the lighter than air vapors were drawn to immense heights. 11 Ps. cxiv:4-8. 262 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS And man, so puny, knew, but saw you not! To see a god was death to mortals then. Behold thy glory filled his troubled dreams! A nightmare grand, and yet perchance he waked, And, waking, found thy dreamy vapors real! Clouds piled on clouds on top of other clouds, As mountains heaped on mountains reaching high A ladder which the hosts of heaven used. So dreaming of a daily sight to him Young Jacob felt the God of Nature near. Unveiled, uncloaked the Titans all have gone, But thou, Thunderer, hast come to stay! Personified. Hie! Storm King, rule each shower! Pallas Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, it will be remem- bered, sprang from her father's head fully equipped for the fray. Wisdom burst upon man when the clear sky caused their gods to evaporate. 12 She was ' Queen of the Air/ as Ruskin says : Full many arrows did she turn aside, And many heroes by her arrows fell. Thus waged the war of falling canopies, Thus waged the battle of the changing sea, And changes brought with them the light of wisdom. Minerva-like, thought after thought sprang up From the true sky in burning eloquence The visions of the past were now no more. Perhaps the greatest event in this last battlefield of the gods is Apollo's (the sun's) victory over the serpent-ring, Python. In honor of his victory Byron sings: \"The lord of the unerring bow The God of life, and poesy, and light The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow All radiant from his triumph in the fight, The shaft hath just been shot the arrow bright 12 In our chapter on \" Genesis \" it will be remembered that the cause of the removal of the Eden Canopy was to bring wisdom to man. He had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Natural things had therefore to pass away, that he might be led to see the spiritual; that he might be led to worship the Creator instead of his works.

This open place is of such mythological interest that our readers will pardon us if we digress from our subject in order to investigate some of its beauties. \" In ancient cos- mology the ' door of heaven ' was situated at the North Pole of the sky.' 7 14 Job refers to the open place as the \" Island of the Inno- cent. \" 15 The Tacullies say, God first created an island. Greek traditions fix the Upa-Merou as the birthplace of the human race, and the Egyptians claim that their ancestors came from the Island of Mero. Among the Hindus Meru was the land of the gods, the place where deity was shrouded in darkness and mystery. Phaeton, whose story was told in our last chapter, was a scorching canopy. He was the son of Merops, and Theopompus tells us that the people who inhabited Atlantis were the Meropes, the people of Merou. In the Hindu legends the great battle between Kama and Havana, the sun and the canopy, took place on the island of u \" Childe Harold,\" iv, 161.

Kama built a stone bridge which reminds us of the Bif rost bridge of the Scandinavians. It was sixty miles long and reached to the island. This island again carries us to the North Land. It reminds us of Asgard, which lay to the west of Europe and was reached by the Bridge. It was to the east and west that the pillars of the canopy were seen dipping, or, we should say, rising and setting, against the horizon. In the Arabian legends we have the scene of the world catastrophe described as an island. Here the gods of Scandinavia met their doomsday. It was the place where the three cloud-mountain chains went out as three roots of the great tree Ygdrasil. It was the place of the sacred tree of the ' world-mountain ' that the Hindu legends refer to. And its top we see was Olympus, below it was hell, and in between was the open-eye, Ymer, where Odin left his precious eye in pawn. It was the Island of Meru or Merou. The Ojibways cross to paradise on a great snake, which serves as a bridge. The Choctaw bridge is a slippery pine- log. The South American Manacicas cross on a wooden bridge. \" Among some of the North American tribes ' the souls come to a great lake ' (the eye-hole or cave) c where there is a beautiful island, toward which they paddle in a canoe of white stone.

MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 265 Ovid's earth was surrounded by the ocean. \" And along the outer strand of that sea they gave lands for the giant- races to dwell in, and against the attack of restless giants they built a burg within the sea and around the earth.\" This is the spot where Apollo, or the sun, first appeared, hence it was said that he was born there (Isle of Delos). His father was Zeus, the pure sky, and his mother Latona, or the shade, from whence he was seen to emerge. Latona was the concealing hiding thing, the canopy. This eye-hole spot where Apollo was born is also the Diktaian cave in which the infant Zeus, his father, the clear sky, was born. The Lake and the Cave in our nursery tale the Lady descending into the Lake and rising from the Cave, etc., etc. are in every sense the far-north land, the country of the Hyperboreans, from whose caverns the piercing blasts of the north wind are said to have issued. Many of the myths we have just cited referred to this lake as an island. We would now point out that it was like- wise of necessity a cave. The Greeks and Egyptians con- sidered it the birthplace of their respective races. The fol- lowing legends throws some light on the reason why this clear-spot was regarded as the beginning place. The Choc- taws say that in Nanih waiga, the sloping hill \" was a cave, the house of the Master of Breath. Here he made the first men from the clay around him, and, as at that time the waters covered the earth, he raised the wall to dry them on. When the soft mud had hardened into elastic flesh and firm bone, he banished the waters to their channels and beds, and gave the dry land to his creatures.\" 17 The Indians, along with the rest of the inhabitants of the earth that then was, saw new conditions continually arising in the egg-hole. They saw hordes of animals and even strange races of their fellow beings coming down from the far north, driven forward by some last advance of the departing Ice \"Brinton, \"Myths of the New World,\" p. 247. 266 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS age. They saw all this and imagined that these creatures, like the sky scenes, had all originated up there in that cave- hole region, hence it was to them the beginning place. \" A parallel to the legend just cited occurs among the Six Nations of the North. They with one consent looked to a mountain near the falls of the Oswego River, in the State of New York, as the locality where their forefathers saw the light of day ; and their name, Oneida, signifies ' the people of the stone.' \" The cave of Pacarin-Tampu, the Lodgings of the Dawn, or the Place of Birth of the Peruvians, was five leagues dis- tant from Cuzco, surrounded by a sacred grove, and inclosed with temples of great antiquity. \" From its hallowed recesses,\" says Balboa, \" the mythical civilizers of Peru, the first men, emerged, and in it, during the time of the flood, the remnants of the race escaped the fury of the waves.\" 18 Though the Place of Birth in the above myths has been assigned to specific geographical localities, yet it is evident from the context that originally the place of beginning had a mythological horizon. The egg-hole of the Peruvians may have been in the Southern sky. Donnelly also gives the following : \" The philosopher of Oraibi tells us that the people climbed a ladder or magical tree from the cave-hole to this world. The firmament, the ceiling of this world, was low down upon the earth the floor of this world. This was an age of cold and darkness and there was as yet no sun or moon.\" Naturally darkness is associated with this cave-hole, Latona; the shade kept drawing in closer and closer until at last the inner edge was precipitated. During this stage, as the Oraibis say, \" it was an age of cold and darkness.\" The ancient Britons tell us of the same conditions. They say that: M \" Ragnarok,\" pp. 201, 202. MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 267 \" The profligacy of mankind provoked the great Supreme to send a pestilential wind upon the earth A pure poison descended, every blast was death. At this time the patriarch, distinguished for his integrity, was shut up, together with his select company, in the inclosure with the strong door. Here the just ones were safe from injury. Presently a tempest of fire arose. It split the earth asunder to the great deep. The lake Llion burst its bounds, and the waves of the sea lifted themselves on high around the borders of Britain, the rain poured down from heaven, and the waters covered the earth.\" 19 The blast of poisonous vapor indicates the dispersion of the gaseous canopy, which in our scientific chapters was figured as floating above the atmosphere. It may have con- sisted in part of carbon dioxide, but be this as it may, its rupture meant the fall of the cloud-vapors and belts, which had attained great heights in the atmosphere, carried upward by their own buoyancy. Water-vapor being lighter than air, and radiation, and hence condensation, being prevented by the overruling blanket, these phenomena of raised moun- tain-clouds, and an open lake space in the north, were inevitable. When the canopy itself was ruptured, the above myth goes on to tell us, Lake Llion, the sky-hole, burst its bounds. Many other tribes and tongues and peoples have recorded this same break-up. \" The Algonquins believed in a world, an earth, anterior to this of ours, but one without light or human inhabitants. A lake burst its bounds and submerged it wholly.\" 20 The Aztecs prayed to Tezcatlipoca, who was represented as a flying serpent that is, they prayed to the canopy, to the god of the black waters and their cry was : \" Is it possible that this lash and chastisement are not given for our cor- rection and amendment, but only for our total destruction 18 <( Mythology of the British Druids,\" p. 226. \"Ragnarok,\" p. 222. 268 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS and overthrow; that the sun will never more shine upon us, but that we must remain in perpetual darkness ? * * * It is a sore thing to tell how we are all in darkness. * * * O Lord, * * * make an end of this smoke and fog. Quench also the burning and destroying fire of thine anger ; let serenity come and clearness, let the small birds of the people begin to sing and approach the sun.\" 21 The Chinese historians say that \" P'an-ku came forth in the midst of the great chaotic void, and we know not his origin ; that he knew the rationale of heaven and earth, and comprehended the changes of the darkness and the light.\" These annals tell us further of the \" Ten Stems \" or stages of canopy development : \" At Wu the Sixth Stem the Dark- ness and the Light unite with injurious effects; all things become solid (frozen), and the Darkness destroys the growth of all things. At Kung the Seventh Stem the Darkness nips all things. At Jin the Ninth Stem the Light begins to nourish all things in the recesses below. Lastly, at Tsze, all things begin to germinate.\" 22 This last myth hints at the coming birth of the sun. The edges of the cave-hole began to grow bright, so, naturally, when the sun did appear they said (in Greece) \" Latona or the shade was his mother.\" This part of the development is beautifully set forth in the Oraibi legend, some portions of which we have already quoted, but, after all, it will be seen that the Indians departed further from the ways of nature than did the Greeks. We will now cite that portion which pertains to the creation of the sun and moon : \" Machito, one of their gods, raised the firmament on his shoulders to where it is now seen. Still the world was dark, as there was no sun, no moon, and no stars. So the people murmured because of the darkness and the cold. Machito said, \" Bring me 21 Bancroft, \" Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 204. ** \" Compendium of Wong-shi-Shing,\" as quoted in \" Ragnarok/ pp. 210-211. MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 269 seven maidens ; \" and they brought him seven maidens ; and he said, \" Bring me seven baskets of cotton-bolls ; \" and they brought him seven baskets of cotton-bolls; and he taught the seven maidens to weave a magical fabric from the cotton, and when they had finished it he held it aloft, and the breeze carried it away toward the firmament, and in the twinkling of an eye it was transformed into a beautiful and full-orbed moon ; and the same breeze caught the remnants of fluctuant cotton, which the maidens had scattered during their work, and carried them aloft, and they were transformed into bright stars. But still it was cold ; and the people murmured again, and Machito said, \" Bring me seven buffalo-robes,\" and from the densely matted hair of the robes he wove another fabric, which the storm carried away into the sky, and it was transformed into the full-orbed sun. Then Machito appointed times and seasons, and ways for the heavenly bodies ; and the gods of the firmament have obeyed the injunctions of Machito from the day of their creation to the present.\" 23 The Thlinkeets of British Columbia say that their hero- god, Yehl, opened three mysterious boxes, letting out the sun, moon, and stars. \" When he set up the blazing light (the sun) in heaven, the people that saw it were at first afraid. Many hid themselves in the mountains, and in the forests, and even in the water, and were changed into the various kinds of animals that frequent these places.\" 24 \" The Gallinomeros of Central California also recollect the day of darkness and the return of the sun. ' In the beginning, they say, there was no light, but a thick darkness covered all the earth. Man stumbled blindly against man and against the animals, the birds clashed together in the air, and confusion reigned everywhere. The Hawk, happen- ing by chance to fly into the face of the Coyote, there fol- 28 Popula/r Science Monthly, October, 1879, p. 800. 84 Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 100. 270 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS lowed mutual apologies, and afterward a long discussion on the emergency of the situation. Determined to make some effort toward abating the public evil, the two set about a remedy. The Coyote gathered a great heap of tules (rushes), rolled them into a ball, and gave it to the Hawk, together with some pieces of flint. Gathering all together as well as he could, the Hawk flew straight up into the sky, where he struck fire with the flints, lit his ball of reeds, and left it there whirling along all in a fierce red glow, as it continues to the present ; for it is the sun. In the same way the moon was made, but as the tules of which it was constructed were rather damp, its light has always been somewhat uncertain and feeble.\" 25 Naturally, the next stage in these nature-myths sets forth the complete triumph of the sun. Innumerable legends cover this point, from which we select the following: Cacus was a huge giant which inhabited the cave with which we have become so familiar. By profession he was a robber, and, as the records show, he stole certain swift cows, the oxen of Geryon (clouds). His true character is revealed as the fall- ing cloud obscuring belt. It is said that he vomited smoke and flame when Hercules attacked him. The whole scene simply depicts a falling canopy drawing nearer and nearer to the eye of the beholder, and so eclipsing the other sky forms which floated higher up. He stole them away, hid them under his wing, carried them into his cave, etc. Hercules, the conquering sun, dispelled all this gloom, killing Cacus with his unerring arrows (shafts of sun-light), and so releas- ing the cows or canopy forms, which floated higher up. The < Popul Yuh/ the book of the Quiches, has a very full description of this whole panorama. The final scene is as follows: \" And the sun and the moon and the stars were now all established ; that is, they now become visible, moving in their orbits. Yet was not the sun then in the beginning * Power's Porno MS., Bancroft, \" Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 86. MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 271 the same as now ; his heat wanted force, and he was but as a reflection in a mirror; verily, say the historians, not at all the same sun as that of to-day. Nevertheless, he dried up and warmed the surface of the earth, and answered many good ends.\" Artemis (Diana), the silver moon, Apollo's sister, waa born at the same time that her brother was. And seven days the sacred swans flew around, encircling the island and the lake seven times. It is recorded also that a sacred light was diffused over the lake a golden blaze from the holy flaming torch or sun itself. The Oraibi legend introduced the thought of the seven maidens weaving the seven cotton-bolls, and here we have the seven sacred swans guarding the open place, or, as it is called, ' the lake/ and we know also, from the myths quoted, that this lake was in the sky. Hera (Juno) was the jealous spouse of Zeus (Jupiter), and it is recorded that she drove Leto (Latona), the mother canopy, from the twins. Hera, like Pallas Athene, was a goddess of the air, and, to all appearances, the air did drive the vapor shadow away, but before her departure the mother entrusted her children to the care of Themis, whose name signifies ' Justice.' In other words, she placed them under the care of inevitable law. It was from this spot, where the sacred light of the new born sun was first seen burning, that Prometheus stole fire which he gave to man, a Titan's gift of love caught from the bright sun itself; yet for the act Yulcan chained him to the rock-like canopy, and one of the evil birds connected therewith daily fed upon his liver. Man, however, in this case was not ungrateful. In honor of his deed, each year they sent a ship to Lemnos to bring back new fire. This ship sailed to Delos to fetch the gift, and meanwhile for nine days all the fires in the country were extinguished, so that they could be rekindled by the new- born flame. 272 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS One of the early adventures of Apollo occurred when he was only one year old. Python, a great snake, was coiled in nine folds around Parnassus, where the Muses dwelt. The bright sun killed him with his arrows, but as Juno had created him, this deed only increased her anger against the new-born infant. Time passed and the ' templum ' or wide expanse in the space marked out, the egg-hole or the eye, was cleared. Phoebus Apollo, or the ' golden-haired/ came from the sum- mit of Olympus and dwelt in this creation of his hand, the temple of the sky, the open way, and there as an oracle he spoke to man, telling him of the true astronomy and the way of creation. Following this pattern, man established the Delphic oracle, and many such in imitation of the heavenly. Connected with the thought that the old sky was a laby- rinth, or puzzle, which the clearing away of the ' templum/ or wide expanse, solved to the satisfaction of the early in- quirer into the ways of nature, is the great labyrinth which was constructed by Daedalus. It was like the lost sky river, Mseander, for which the Grecian river is named, which flows back on its course, returning to itself. It was a ring or spiral vapor-belt, and Daedalus built it for a certain king named Minos, a sky-king, though called a Creton. Somehow the builder lost the king's esteem, and the evil monarch forthwith imprisoned him in a high tower. From this he escaped, only to find that he could not leave the island, as Minos was keeping a strict watch on all departing vessels. Now, Daedalus said of the king that though he might control the land and sea, yet he could not rule the regions of the crystal air. With that he set himself to fabricate wings for himself and his young son, Icarus, that they might fly away. When these contrivances were finished, he said unto his son : \" Now follow me, my Icarus, and you will be quite safe. I warn thee, fly along the middle track ; nor low, nor high ; if low thy plumes may flag with ocean's spray ; if high the sun MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 273 may dart his fiery ray.\" 26 But Icarus, like all the old sky phenomena, fell. It is recorded that he flew overly high, and that the sun melted the wax which attached his wings to his body. Minos confined in his labyrinth a fearful sky-monster which was reputed to be half a bull and half a man that is, half a cloud and half a halo. This bloody creature, known as the Minotaur, as the story goes, was fed by his master with human victims. For this purpose Minos made the Athenians furnish him each year with seven youths and seven maids. The poor Athenians submitted to this yearly tribute for a long time, until Theseus, a sky-revolving hero of the vapors, decided to put an end to the infamous practice. He sailed away, promising to return with white sails set in token of victory. Arrived at his journey's end, he killed the bull and found his way back again through the labyrinthian mists by means of a thread given him by the good Ariadne, the daughter of the old king. This child of Minos was the light, and when once outside the walls of the great sky prison or labyrinth he took her with him. Landing on an isle, he abandoned her, and in doing so made a great mistake. He had promised to return with white sails set, but when he left the light behind, all was darkness. Seeing this blackness while the ship was yet afar, his father, thinking him dead, killed himself. There is not much difference between the flying ship that conveyed Theseus and the boats that carried Ha and Osiris across Nu-t's back. Celestial cattle like the bull, Miotaur, are common in the myths of all the ancients. We have already seen how the swift flying vapor-belt was compared to a stag, a hare, and to flying horses. Pegasus was one of this kind. By a turn of speech, we now say of the camel that he is the ' ship of the desert/ therefore it does not seem 86 Ovid (Elton's tr.), slightly altered. 18 274 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS strange, after all, that in the olden time the flying cloud ships were called 'ships of the canopy ' or ' racing steeds.' Pegasus, the winged horse, was one of the most beautiful and bright of these. We can picture him in our minds as he stood with nostril smoking in disdain of man, for, be it remembered, he never allowed any but the gods to ride on his back. Yet because Pallas Athene commanded him so to do, he departed from his custom and allowed Bellerophon to mount. Forthwith they went to battle with the bloody dragon of the fiery tail, known as Chimsera. From her pitchy throat issued flame smoke and sulphurous mist. Pegasus seemed willing to enter this battle for Athene's sake, for these mists were working havoc with her sky. It will be recalled that she was the blue-eyed goddess of the free breeze, the air of heaven itself, and naturally she could not endure this polluting Chimsera any longer. Chimsera was nothing but a vile, fire- breathing lion, dragon, or goat vapor-form, any way. Beller- ophon and the bright sun-horse of course conquered her. Of the ancestry of this horrid creature which we have just seen despatched, Hesiod says: \" And she brought forth another monster, irresistible, nowise like to mortal men or immortal gods, in a hollow cavern; the divine, stubborn-hearted Echidna (half nymph, with dark eyes and fair cheeks ; and half, on the other hand, a serpent huge and terrible and vast), speckled, and flesh- devouring, 'neath caves of sacred Earth. For there is her cavern, deep under a hollow rock, afar from immortal gods as well as mortal men : there, I ween, have the gods assigned to her famous mansions to inhabit. But she, the destructive Echidna, was confined in Arima beneath the earth, a nymph immortal, and all her days insensible to age. With her they say that Typhaon associated in love, a terrible and lawless ravisher for the dark-eyed maid. And she, having con- ceived, bare fierce-hearted children. The dog Orthus first she bare for Geryon, and next, in the second place, she MYTHS OF GREECE AND ROME 275 brought forth the irresistible and ineffable flesh-devourer Cerberus, dog of hell, with brazen voice and fifty heads, a bold and strong beast. Thirdly, again, she gave birth to the Lernsean Hydra, subtle in destruction, whom Juno, white- armed goddess, reared implacably, hating the mighty Her- cules. And it Jove's son, Hercules, named of Amphitryon, along with warlike lolaus, and by the counsels of Pallas the despoiler, slaughtered with ruthless sword. But she (Echidna) bare Chimsera, breathing resistless fire, fierce and huge, fleet-footed as well as strong: this monster had three heads : one indeed of a grim-visaged lion, one of a goat, and another of a serpent, a fierce dragon ; in front a lion, a dragon behind, and in the midst a goat; breathing forth the dread strength of burning fire. Her Pegasus slew the brave Bellerophon.\" 27 ^\"The Theogony,\" 285-325, Bank's tr. CHAPTER XVIII HERCULES HEECULES, like Apollo, was simply another sun deity. The myths being derived from two different sources, thus to one tribe or people the sun was Apollo and to another Hercules. The former people seem to have lived far to the north, where they first saw Apollo and Diana born in the egg-hole land. The latter people seems to have lived to the south, for Hercules was born in the equatorial canopy slit, the two pillars of the canopy extending on either side. Ovid describes the palace of the sun, which he says was \" raised high on stately columns, bright with radiant gold and car- buncle that rivaled the flames. Polished ivory chested its highest top, and double folding doors shone with the brightest of silver.\" 1 The reference to the doors is to the slit in the canopy. The fact that the myth of Hercules comes from a southern source is also borne out by etymology. The origin of the word Hercules is said to be the Phoenician word ' rakal/ the root ' Ra ' being common to the sun-god through- out the east and the south. Ra was the Egyptian god of the sun. Again, in the Hindu legends, Ra-ma, the sun-god, had a terrible fight with Ra-vana, a giant accompanied by the Ra-kshaas or cloud demons, who had stolen away his wife. B-ra-hma the Hindu creator also contains this root in his name. The Hebrews likewise were once sun-worshipers, as would appear from their names. Thus we find the root ' ra ? in Ab-ra-ham, and his father Te-ra-h, and in his wife, Sa-ra-h, or Sa-ra-i. Also in Ra-chel the daughter of E\"ahor, the brother of Abraham. This root is also found in the name J \"The Metamorphoses,\" bk. ii, fable i. 276 HERCULES 277 Ha-ra-n, where Terah died, and in Padan-ra-m, where Jacob dwelt. After the introduction of the worship of the true God, this root was dropped and does not appear again, except in the name of Eph-ra-im, who was an adopted son from Egypt, the land of Miz-ra-im. The Druids carried the sun worship with them to Ire- land, where it is incorporated into the name of the famous hall of Ta-ra. But to return to the history of our Grecian hero. The adventures of his ancestors also show that the myth of Her- cules came from a southern source. Perseus, who was his great-grandfather, like Osiris was thrust into a chest. But, unlike Osiris, the lad had the company of his good mother, Danae, who was entombed with him. They were carried by the box to the island of Seri- phus, where a fisherman, not unlike Ea, the fish-god of Babylonian and Bel-Dagon 2 of the Philistines, rescued them. But though rescued, their troubles' were not ended, and the account of these adventures woven together makes one of the most beautiful of the: many romances of the vapor-ring which have come down to us from the Greeks. Briefly, Polydectes, king of the island and brother of Dictys the fisherman, fell in love with Danae. Eesisting this love, she was closed up by the disappointed king in a brazen tower, but as Zeus, the clear-sky, could look in over the top of this tower, he also fell in love, and, changing him- self into a shower of pure gold, successfully wooed her with his sunshine. But let us return to the family tree of Hercules. Perseus had a son whose name was Electryon. Alcmene, daughter of the latter, was the mother of Hercules. Thus we see that he had illustrious annular ancestry. When he was a babe scarcely two months old, he showed his solar character and the blood that was in him by strangling the two serpents or 2 \"Dag\" in Hebrew means \"a fish.\" 278 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS pillars between which he was born. It is said correctly that the jealous Juno (Cybele, the Magna Mater of the gods, hence a canopy) sent these harmful snakes into the chamber of the sleeping child, but thfe awakening sun was equal to the emergency. Defeated in her vengeful deed, Juno then made him subject to Eurystheus, who was the owner of the sky. Thus it came about that to free himself he had to perform twelve labors. He was in subordination to the power of annular and vapor-canopy conditions. Before considering the labors, it will be well to look between the pillars into the slit or opening where the sun first appeared in the equatorial sky. In the Babylonian Genesis tablets we have an account of this southern slit. It is as follows : The positions of the gods Bel and Hea he fixed with him, And he opened the great gates in the darkness shrouded. The fastenings were strong on the left and right. In its mass (that is in the canopy) he made a boiling. The god Uru (the moon) he caused to rise out of the night he over- shadowed, To fix it also for the light of the night until the shining of the day. That the month might not be broken, and in its amount be regular, At the beginning of the month, at the rising of the night, His (the sun's) horns are breaking through to shine on the heavens. On the seventh day to circle he begins to swell, And stretches toward the dawn further, When the god Shamas (the sun), in the horizon of heaven, in the east, * * * formed beautifully and * * * * * * to the orbit Shamas was perfected. 8 At this point the tablet becomes illegible; however, the meaning seems plain, the great gods opened the slit or gate in the darkness of the canopy, and through this Shamas, the sun, appeared; his beams in horns at first broke through imperfectly, then he swelled to a circle or halo, but from this on he advanced more rapidly, approaching nearer and 8 \" The Fifth Tablet,\" as translated in Proctor's \" Pleasant Ways,' p. 393. HERCULES 279 nearer to his perfect estate. The movements of the moon were also seen, and once more man was able to count time. In the line that reads, \" When the god, Shamas, in the horizon of heaven, in the east,\" we see that the separating process of the two halves of the canopy has progressed so far that the sun's orbit can be traced continuously through the clearing heavens, all the way from the east, where he had at last appeared on the horizon ; that is, they could trace him from the early morning until the sunset. In the Eussian skazaks the same scene is depicted. Many of them tell of a healing and vivifying water. One of the stories is as follows: \" A prince is exposed to various dangers by his sister, who is induced to plot against his life by her demon lover, the Snake. The hero is sent in search of ' a healing and a vivifying water/ preserved between two lofty mountains which cleave closely together, except during ' two or three minutes ' of each day. He follows his instructions, rides to a certain spot, and there awaits the hour at which the moun- tains fly apart. ' Suddenly a terrible hurricane arose, a mighty thunder smote, and the two mountains were torn asunder. Prince Ivan 4 spurred his heroic steed, flew like a dart between the mountains, dipped two flasks in the waters, and instantly turned back.' He himself escapes safe and sound, but the hind legs of his horse are caught between the closing cliffs and smashed to pieces. The magic waters, of course, soon remedy this temporary inconvenience. \" In a Slovak version of this story, a murderous mother sends her son to two mountains, each of which is cleft open once in every twenty-four hours, the one opening at midday and the other at midnight ; the former disclosing the Water of Life, the latter the Water of Death. In a similar story from the Ukraine, mention is made of two springs of healing *Ivan was the sun, as we shall see later in chapter xxi, on the Russian Myths. 280 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS and life-giving water, which are guarded by iron-beaked ravens, and the way to which lies between grinding hills. The Fox and the Hare are sent in quest of the magic fluid. The Fox goes and returns in safety, but the Hare, on her way back, is not in time quite to clear the meeting cliffs, and her tail is jammed between them. Since that time hares have had no tails.\" 5 Hercules first appeared in this opening between the snakes, but afterwards, as we have seen, he was made subject to Eurystheus. Under him, his first task was to slay the Nemean Lion of the skies. This cloud-lion was so thick that no solar arrows could penetrate through him, and as he did not live on earth no iron could pierce him. Hercules, after his victory, wore his skin as a trophy. It was a sun-obscuring veil, and, though conquered, was still in evidence. The shirt given him by his wife, Dejanira, was of the same char- acter, but as it fitted more closely its venomed poison is said to have caused his death, the canopy burning as a funeral pile. The lurid storm-cloud in Finnish poetry is somewhat similar to this conception. It is Ukk's fiery shirt. Again, in Homer, Ino is given by Odysseus a scarf veil, which line of light* was afterwards seen issuing from her bright face across the waters; it guided the hero to land. \" Zas, i.e., Zeus,\" says Pherekydes of Skyros, \" makes a 6 W.

The death was like the departure of Quetzal- coatl on Mount Orizaba, like that of the hero in Beowulf, who, as the historians say, burnt by the seashore ' wand to wolcum/ curled to the clouds.\" 6 A similar myth to that of Hercules, which also begins with wrapping the infant sun up in a lion skin, has been pre- served by the North American Indians in the account of ' Tulchuherris ' (sun-child), whose name \" etymologically,\" says Curtin, \"means a person or thing that has been dug up.\" 7 That is, he was brought forth out of the canopy and was found by an old woman, Pom Pokaila, who immediately \" took the buckskin apron (lion skin) from her back, laid it on the ground, put the little boy in it, and wrapped him up carefully.\" When found, \" the baby's head, as she raised him to the surface, was to the east, his feet to the west; underground his head was to the south, and his feet to the north.\" 8 Tak- ing some liberties with the word ' underground,' we under- stand the passage as follows: Before he was dug out from under the canopy his light or head was daily seen; first in the south, where naturally the cloud-blanket was first illu- minated by the hidden sun shining from the under world, 6 Charles De B. Mills, \"The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 54, 172. 7 \"Creation Myths of Primitive America,\" p. 122. *IUd., p. 122. 2S2 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS and this light as day advanced spread towards the north (his feet). After he was dug up, of course, he was seen to rise in the east and set in the west (his feet). Tulchuherris also accomplished certain wonderful labors. We will enumerate thirteen of them. First, he came to a place where there was a great rock standing straight up in front of him in his road. He looked everywhere for a pas- sage, but could see none. He looked on the left side all was dark; on the right all was dark. Clearly this is a description of the equatorial canopy split. Many were killed here, the danger being that the rock would sway to and crunch the adventurer. \" In one flash,\" the myth says, \" you will be thrown into a dark place, at the side where you cannot see bottom.\" Tulchuherris kicked the rock over. 9 In the second labor he wounded a man in the big river. 10 In the third he jumped between the crunching tree, which is another simile for the equatorial opening. The legend says : \" When any one was passing, and half-way through the cleft, the pine closed and crushed him.\" n Fourth, his dogs killed grizzly bears and rattlers (cloud-forms). 12 Fifth, he killed spiders and smoked with Sas, the old canopy shiner or original sun. Sas could not stand Tulchuherris's pipe; the smoke choked him a veritable reality. 13 Sixth, he killed Sas's old woman. 14 Seventh, he dodged knives, i.e., shafts of bright light. 15 In the myths of a great many other lands we have this same scene depicted. The shafts of light being called arrows, swords, etc. Special reference may be made to the magic sword. \" Perseus is armed with it, Tiarpe, the gift to him of Hermes, and it slays whatsoever it falls upon. Theseus has it welded of the same metal with the spear of Achilles, the arrows of Phoibos, the good sword Gram, buried to its hilt in the tree 9 Ibid., pp. 130, 131.

HERCULES 283 trunk and waiting for Volsung to draw it out ; it is Arthur's brand Excalibur, and Roland's Durandal, and the enchanted sword with which Beowulf kills Grendel. And we find it again in the sword Tirfing in the fairy tale. It is the ( Glaive of Light ' in the Scotch story, obtained for the giant by the young king Easaidh Ruadh. In the case of Excalibur, the weapon was thrown by command of Arthur about to die, into the lake; a hand and arm were seen to rise from the water, flourish it thrice, and then sink into the lake, where it was seen no more.\" 16 But it is not necessary to go outside of the Indian legend for illustrations of the bright sun-shafts. Tulchuherris's weapons include a sky spear-pole, a sky spear-head, a sky- strap, a spear-pole, his quiver, and his bow. 17 In connection with the quiver Curtin says: \" In Indian myths from ISTew York to California the porcupine is ever connected with light; in some cases it is the sun himself. In ' Tulchuherris ' * * * Sas (the sun) carries a porcupine quiver, and is advised never to lay it aside, for as long as he keeps it on his shoulder he is safe from his children, the grizzlies, (the clouds), who wish to kill him.\" 18 In the eighth labor Tulchuherris escaped from the sweat- house. \" I swim in the river every morning. We will sweat, and then swim,\" said Sas. 19 Ninth : He killed more rattlers (' pets ') in a tree. After this act he got down from the tree by using a e sky-strap.' In the legend the scene is depicted as follows : \" Tulchuherris stretched his hand toward the west, where his grandmother was, and immediately something came with a whirr and a flutter, and settled on his arm like a bird. It was a sky-strap, blue like the sky, narrow and very strong. \"Charles De B. Mills, \"The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 162-163. 17 \" Creation Myths of Primitive America,\" p. 28. 18 Ibid., p. 500. u Ibid. 9 p. 139. 984 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS He fastened one end of it to the limb, knotting it in such a way that he could untie it with a jerk at the other end. He slipped down on it, and when on the ground jerked it loose. He strung the snakes on the long bone, they were all dead, and carried them to Sas's house.\" 20 Tenth : He killed grizzly bears (clouds) in a narrow pass, which may be identified with the canopy slit. 21 Eleventh: He killed bears (clouds) and snakes (vapor-belts or annular ultra atmospheric arcs) at a spring, evidently located in the sky land. All these doings seem to be associated with water, but as water did not exist in the sky except as vapor belts at great altitudes, held in suspension under the canopy, and also as at present in the form of ordinary clouds, it follows that the appearance alone is the real reason why the ancients believed that they were covered by a firmament of water. In this labor Tulchuherris opened the spring, bringing forth a clear, cold stream. 22 Twelfth: He killed Supchit, Sas's son, who was a fish like Ea, of the Babylonian pantheon. \" i Very well/ answered Tulchuherris, who put his foot on the end of the bridge and crossed with one spring. On the other side he went to the fishing-hut, fixed so that a man could look up and down the river while fishing. Tulchuherris had his own spear-shaft, a sky-pole ; the string was a sky-strap. He had his own point, too. He waited for fish, and at last saw something come slowly from the south.\" * * * \" I am sorry for you, my brother-in-law,\" said Tulchuherris. \" I hate to kill you, but I must, for my father-in-law sent me to kill you.\" 23 Like Hercules, Tulchuherris had to obey his master, so he speared Supchit. Thirteenth: He played with the springing tree and divided old Sas, the false and vain (canopy shiner) chief of Saskewil, into his present form of sun and moon. 24 \"JfttU, pp. 142-145. n n>id., 145-146. Ibid., p. 148. 28 Ibid., p. 150. \"*/&*&, pp. 152-157. HERCULES 285 Another legend which resembles the Hercules myth is found amongst the Yamas. It is entitled, \" The Dream of Juiwaiyu, and His Journey to Damhauja's Country/' 25 but we cannot take the space for its proper analysis. It is wonderful how many details of canopy-decline our Amerinds have retained. These same Yamas tell us in the myth of \" The Winning of Halai Auna \" that \" the great sweat-house of the sun is the dome of heaven.\" It is a description of the canopy drifting slowly northwards, and again, had we space, its analysis would be very profitable. In this legend says Curtin : \" The shooting of Wakara into the sky is a curious variant of the tree-bending by Tulchu- herris and Sas in the Wintu myth. 26 Upturning to the myth of our Grecian Hero, we find that in his second labor he had to fight against the Hydra, the many-headed serpent of the clouds. This monster was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, with whom we have already become acquainted. 27 The fight began by Hercules cutting off the heads of some of these serpents, but he soon found that for every head cut off two fresh heads started up, and to increase his difficulties a huge crab (emblem of the backward motion of the canopy) fastened on his heel. Changing his form of attack, Hercules now took sun-fire with which he seared each head as he cut it off, thus pre- venting its regrowth. When he came to the last head he found it invulnerable (our present storm clouds cannot be conquered), so he took this last head and cast it down from 25 Hid., p. 425 if. /&?., p. 520. 27 It will be remembered that Echidna was not only the reputed mother of the Hydra, but also of Chimera, and of the many-headed dog Orthos, of the three hundred-headed dragon, of the Hesperides, of the Colchian dragon, of the Sphinx, of Cerberus, of Scylla, of the Gorgons, of the vulture that gnawed away the liver of Prometheus, and of the Nemean lion; in fact, the mother of all adversity and tribulation. In one word, she was the canopy, and, like Ishtar of Chaldea, was the mother of all evil. 286 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS its high position, burying it under a rock by the road-side, whence it waters all the regions of the earth. This last storm-head is vividly pictured by the Shoshone Indians, who conceive the domed firmament to be ice : \" It has the color of ice, and from time to time, as they have it, a monster serpent-god coils his immense back up against the firmament, and with his scales scratches and wears off its face. The ice-dust that falls we see in the winter as snow; in the summer season, melting during its descent, it comes as rain.\" 28 It was natural for the succeeding generations to attempt to find the old canopy scenes still in the sky, for all their legends told them so plainly of the past. Our heroes' third labor was to bring back alive a certain wild boar. The furrowed sky was called in those times a boar. In the Hindu legend we read of a similar exploit. Rama, the sun-god, lost his wife, whose name was Sita, which signifies ' a furrow.' The demon who stole her away bore her struggling through the air. 29 Hercules in the same manner carried his boar to Eurystheus, the master of the sky (and his master also), but the wild nature of the thing so alarmed him that he, the timid Eurystheus, hid himself behind the brazen clouds. Some say he placed himself inside a large bronze vessel. This brazen receptacle of the canopy was also called a hogshead. In the case where Danae was shut up by her father, it was called a tower of brass. Into this hogshead Hercules then threw the porcus plowed land of celestial scenes. 28 Charles De B. Mills, \"The Tree of Mythology,\" p. 23. 29 The battle was a terrible one. The details show clearly that the legend is derived from the same source as the Hercules myth. It is the battle of our Grecian hero with Hydra over again. The terrible monster's name who thus stole Sita away was Havana. He had ten heads, and as fast as Rama, the sun-god, cut them off, another grew in its place. Finally it was necessary to consume his body by fire, and Sita, the furrowed sky, had to undergo this ordeal also, but she came out of it purified and redeemed from all taint. HERCULES 287 On his way back from this labor a story is told of how he visited a Centaur named Phohis. While they were dining in his cave home the strong aroma of the wine attracted the other Centaurs, who forthwith collected together and offered Hercules battle. Their mothers, who are plainly called the clouds, helped them by sending a flood of water. 30 In the fourth labor the stag which belonged to Diana, vapor-moon, goddess of the silver-crescent ring, 31 was chased for one whole year by our hero. The stag who was ' fleet of foot ' was the hurried skies, and yet he was tamed and in the end brought into subjection by Hercules, who, like (Edipus, was ' slow of foot.' In the next labor the Stymphalides birds were driven away by sun-darts. Their character as vapor monsters of the sky is shown by the statement that \" their great wide wings 30 Hellas has two versions of a flood, one associated with Ogyges, the other, of a far more elaborate form, with Deucalion. This latter name is only another name for Noah. Jupiter summoned the gods to council and told them that he had resolved to drown the earth. \" The north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; the south was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with a cloak of pitchy darkness.\" * * * \" Jupiter, not satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother Neptune to aid him with his. He lets loose the rivers, and pours them over the ' land. At the same time he heaves the land with an earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the shores.\" (Bulfinch, \"The Age of Fable,\" tr., Scott, pp. 24-25.) This all recalls to mind the secondary causes mentioned in our scientific chapters. The story goes on to say that this flood swept away the whole human race except one pair, Deucalion and Pyrrha, who, as the waters abated, landed on Mount Parnassus. It is interesting to note that in India also there are accounts of two different floods. \" In the Varaha, or third avatar, Vishnu appeared as a boar to save the earth when it had been drowned a second time. The boar went into the sea and fished the earth out on his tusks.\" (Murray, \"Manual of Mythology,\" 20th ed., p. 380.) 81 Originally the moon, so-called, was a crescent form of the canopy. After the precipitation of the vapor the only crescent form left in the sky was our satellite. 288 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS stretched across the heavens and obscured the sun.\" When the cloud winds blew every line became a flying spear sun- darts. The sixth labor describes the clearing out of the Augean Stables. Augeus means \" a being of pure streaming light.\" At one time the canopy was the only source of light ; it was known to the ancients as the sun and at night was their moon. The cattle were clouds. To clean out their stable Hercules simply opened the wall of the canopy (stable) and let a rushing sky-stream flow through which quickly washed away the filth, dark clouds and all. Hesiod says: \"Poseidon (Neptune) was a bull/' and we have found out that bulls were guardians or haloes accom- panying the glowing sun. In the seventh labor Hercules was required to bring the Cretan Bull bound into Mycenne. He forced the beast, who was the offspring of Neptune, to leave the herd of celestial cattle sacred to Helios (Sol), and then made it swim across the canopy, the great sea of waters ; thus he performed his task. The eighth labor was similar: our hero conquered the swift horses of Diomedes, which were fleeting vapors of the canopy. Terrific grandeur and destructive power Marked their career as rushing on they went, Fire breathing, plunging, dashing, snorting loud The soul of the great deep was in their might, As sound of many waters, hoof on hoof. The ninth task was to procure the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. This girdle was a present from Ares (Mars), god of war and of the storm. Eurystheus, owner of the sky, wanted it for his daughter, Admeta. No doubt he thought she would look very fine girdled with the world-ring or, as it is often called, ' the serpent coil of cloud/ She was the goddess of the lower air, and when Hercules brought it to her she put it on and has worn it ever since, signifying that the storm-fiend had descended into the lower regions, where now the tempest raves. HERCULES 289 Admeta or the deadly shade has passed The girdles gone, and yet it still remains, For, like the Hydra's one immortal head, It waters, yea, still waters, all the earth. To conquer the flesh-eating oxen (clouds) of Geryon, Eurystheus sent our hero to the Western Isle. This locality is the cave-hole of northern mythology, the egg-hole, the place of the one eye, the Cyclops, etc. The mighty and brave Hercules took a ship (halo-boat) in order to reach this far-off region, as he had to pass back of the great belt that encircled the middle regions of the earth. When he arrived at his destination he fought against the owner of the strong black cattle with his fire, and it is recorded that a sun-shaft finally killed him. On his way home a gadfly caused his cattle to scatter in the great cloud mountains of the canopy (the great middle belt). Zeus was the clear-sky, and the record says they ran to him. In the eleventh labor we have another adventure con- nected with the egg-hole land of the north. Here the golden apples of the Hesperides were seen to glitter on the world- tree. These were the stars seen in their purity in the blue sky. This incident is no doubt derived from the same phenomena as those which gave rise to the Babylonian myth. In the Ninth Tablet of Gilgamesh, that hero is represented as going on a long journey to see his ancestor, Tsit-napishtim. It was a very difficult excursion, and he was forced at one time to march onwards for the space of twenty-four hours through a region of thick darkness, which we understand as portraying a country darkened by a falling vapor-belt (the great middle belt, that is, of middle latitudes). But at the end of this long, dreadful journey he came out once more into the light of the sun, and, behold, there was a beautiful tree, the top of which was lapis lazuli, and it was laden with fruit which dazzled the eye. These stars are connected with a great many myths. Ignatius Donnelly says : \" This is the same legend which 19 290 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS we see appearing in so many places and in so many forms. The apple of Paradise was one of the apples of the Greek legends, intrusted to the Hesperides, but which they could not resist the temptation to pluck and eat. The serpent Ladon watched the tree. \" It was one of the apples of Idun, in the Norse legends, the wife of Brage, the god of poetry and eloquence. She keeps them in a box, and when the gods feel the approach of old age they have only to taste them and become young again. Loke, the evil-one, the Norse devil, tempted Idun to come into a forest with her apples, to compare them with some others, whereupon a giant called Thjasse, in the appearance of an enormous eagle, flew down, seized Idun and her apples, and carried them away, like Havana, into the air. The gods compelled Loke to bring her back, for they were the apples of the tree of life to them ; without them they were perishing. Loke stole Idun from Thjasse, changed her into a nut, and fled with her, pursued by Thjasse. The gods kindled a great fire, the eagle plumage of Thjasse caught the flames, he fell to the earth, and was slain by the gods.\" 32 But the consideration of these legends is leading us away from the eleventh labor. Eurystheus demanded that our hero should procure these apples (stars) for him. Before Hercules could accomplish this feat he found it necessary to kill a great dragon snake which guarded the tree whereon the apples grew. Some say that Atlas plucked the fruit for him while he upheld the great hill of the middle canopy. How- ever this may be, when the apples were procured Hercules presented them to his master, the first fruits from the great real world beyond. The twelfth and last labor was to bring from Hades (which, it will be remembered, is located in the canopy) Cerberus, the three-headed dog, with the tail of a serpent and with bristling snakes round his neck. This description 82 \" Ragnarok,\" p. 324. HERCULES 291 shows what manner of sky-dog he was. As he brought this monster forth, the shades of darkness fled in terror, never- theless Hercules kept straight on through a chasm which he rent right through the canopy. This done and all vapor-forms conquered, of course our hero, the sun, came forth free from the enthralling belts. It is recorded that he joined the Argonauts and sailed in their ship, the Argo, which was a vapor-arc, arch or ark. He brought back with him the golden fleece, the bright sunshine like sky-gem, and was free indeed. And yet the story of his captivity has lived on down through the ages. In Persian literature the great hero Eustam accomplishes the same series of victories that marked the career of Her- cules. Poor says of him: \" He is a compound of Herakles the Greek and Eoland of the Middle Ages, as we shall see later. His infancy is protected by a marvelous bird the Simurgh. He is like the bird Garuda in Sanskrit, and develops into the roc of the Arabian ISTights. When an infant only he performs prodigies of valor, like Herakles; when a child, he kills an elephant. When grown up, the king and his army being shut up in the demon country by the king of Turan and his Divs, Eustam, all alone, performs seven labors and frees the king. This is again like Herakles. But Eustam is as pious as he is brave. He prays to his god before every encounter, and gives thanks after every victory. He has a marvelous horse, whom he loves more than wife or child. These traits suggest Eoland. He is, in fact, a perfect type of the mediaeval hero, except in one thing, his indifference to women: he leaves his young wife, the daughter of a king, to look for his horse, which had strayed away, and never goes back to her, although he kindly sends once to inquire for her. !N\"ow, many of these traits identify him at once as a solar myth. If he is so much more pious than the Greek hero, it is that he expresses the simple faith of the noble Persian character. His marvelous strength 292 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS when an infant is the power of the sun, resistless even at its rising; the seven labors which he performs for the good of others, the demons which he slays, are the dark clouds which obstruct his path. When in the middle of his life, Rustam feels that his labors for others have not been appreciated, and he sits apart, gloomy and sullen, in his tent, while the war goes on. This will at once suggest the wrath of Achilles. It is the dark cloud again obscuring the beneficent sun.\" * # * a ^ n( j a f. la^ wnen Rustam dies, he is not killed in fair fight, but in ambush like Siegfried, slain from behind.\" 33 Poor goes on to say : \" There is another hero in the Shah Nameh, named Isfendiyar also a solar myth, because he can be slain only by an arrow from a particular tree, the thorn; this is the same thorn which killed Siegfried in German, the mistletoe which killed Balder in Norse, the thorn which pricks the sleeping beauty.\" 34 It is interesting to see how the legend of Roland has been handed down to the Middle Ages. It illustrates the process by which these myths have survived and been embellished up to our own time. Poor tells us that: \" Roland has the characteristics of the solar myth. True, he may have really lived ; but no real man, no real weapon, could ever have performed the prodigies of valor which Roland and his good sword did. The sword, too, was brought to him in a miraculous way. It is not the pagan way in which Perseus and Sigurd got their swords. It is the Chris- tian way, which performed all the other miracles of the Middle Ages. And the Song of Roland is so delightful because it has this new tone, and because it sustains this tone so perfectly throughout ; all the prodigies are impressed with it. Still, they are prodigies, not natural acts. ~No hero could, single-handed, kill four hundred men at a stroke, 88 \"Sanskrit and its Kindred Literatures/' pp. 159-160. p. 161. HERCULES 293 after his skull was split open. But if you look at Roland as a solar hero, the work would be easy indeed for the irre- sistible power of the sun. Roland's death, too, is super- natural. He has not one scratch on his body, though his armor is pierced with a thousand darts. His skull splits open from excessive toil; his brains ooze slowly out. With his death his sword must go too. No other can wield it. With the death of the sun, its rays no longer shoot across the sky.\" 35 We will be pardoned if we again quote from Poor. Our author says : \" Another hero of the Charlemagne cycle is Olger the Dane, the national hero of Denmark; and he rep- resents many other features of the solar myth.\" * * * \" Olger grows up beautiful and strong, but is sent as a hostage to the court of Charlemagne. Here he labors for others, like the other solar heroes, and fights for beings meaner than himself.\" * * * \" A Saracen giant appears, and Olger kills him. Then the. emperor does him a wrong ; and his anger, like the wrath of Achilles and Rustam, makes itself felt. He goes out into the world as a wanderer, and travels far and wide, like Odysseus. Finally, he longs to see his land again, and sets sail ; but the ship is wrecked. The waves bear him to a strange land, where a stately palace stands ; this like the palace on Kirke's isle. At morning he finds a flowery vale ; and Morgan le Fay comes to him, and welcomes him to Avalon, and takes him to the palace, where he finds Arthur healed of his wound. Then Morgan gives him a wreath of forgetfulness for his forehead, and an enchanted ring for his hand ; while he wears these, he never grows old. By and by the wreath slips from his forehead, and he remembers Charlemagne, and longs to go back and fight the Saracen. So he reappears, like Rip Van Winkle. That is, the sun comes back, after being carried away by the ''Hid., pp. 356-357. 294 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS darkness. Morgan le Fay had given him a torch, which is the measure of his days, like the firebrand of Meleagros in Greek. While it burns, he can never die. He fights as bravely as before, though the world has changed; for hun- dreds of years have gone by while he was gone in Avalon. When he is about to wed the Empress of France, Morgan le Fay appears and bears him away. But the torch is still burning in an abbey crypt, and therefore he is expected to return; like Sebastian of Portugal, and Frederick Bar- barossa, and Arthur of Brittany. When Denmark is in danger, then the Danish peasants are sure that Holger Danske will return. \" This is substantially the story told in Germany, later, of Tannhauser. Venus carries him away into the middle of a hill, called Horselberg. There he lives in f orgetf ulness ; but he longs at length to return to a life of virtue, and goes out of the hill. He meets a priest and confesses his sin; but the horror-stricken priest tells him that his own oaken staff may as soon bud and blossom into roses as his sin be absolved. So the poor Tannhauser goes back to the enchant- ress. Eight days after, the staff does bud and blossom into roses ; and all the people expect Tannhauser to reappear.\" 36 It is interesting to note what Poor has to say about Arthur, so we select the following: \" Arthur, the Christian knight, the blameless king, was first a Keltic hero, sung by the Druid bards. Shall I say more, or is it already guessed that Arthur, like so many other Aryan heroes, is only the sun and its course personified in a human form ? It is beyond doubt that Arthur lived, a date is even fixed for him at 542 ; but the mind of his race could not invent new facts about him. Those very circumstances which happen to each Aryan hero fasten themselves upon him, with a monotony which would become wearisome had ., pp. 357-359. HERCULES 295 it not a great principle lying underneath it. Certainly, if the Kelts had imagined a hero, they would have found some new thing for him to do. That they did not proves that they simply formulated the thoughts which lie dormant in each branch of the race, brought from its home.\" * * * \" We will therefore separate Arthur from the knights who surround him, and look at his story. His birth was supernatural : as soon as he was born he was wrapped in gold- colored glittering raiment, and taken away from his mother.\" * * * The supernatural manner in which he procured his bright sun-shaft sword was as follows : \" The lords came into a church-yard, and there stood an anvil of stone, and stuck therein a fair sword, naked at the point, and letters of gold were written about the stone, that said : \" Whoso pulleth out this sword out of this stone and anvil is rightwise born king of England.' All the great lords try, but of course none can pull out the sword but Arthur. This is exactly the story of the sword in the Volsung Saga, and somewhat like that of the sword of Theseus in Greek. The beard and hair of Arthur shine like gold, and the nobles are forced to make the beautiful youth their king. Then enemies attack the land, but Arthur draws the f sword that flashed in the eyes of his enemies like thirty torches,' and kills them all. Finally, in battle, this sword snaps, like the sword in the Yolsung Saga. Then a maiden out of the water, like Thetis in Greek, like Hiordis in Norse, brings him another sword. While she keeps the scabbard, his life is safe ; he can neither bleed nor die ; Arthur thus becomes another of the invulnerable heroes. He has miraculous powers over nature ; an owl, a blackbird, and a stag talk to him, and do his bidding; these are the same talking animals which we meet in other Aryan litera- tures.\" * * * \" Merlin warns him that he will be destroyed by his sister's son, who will be born on May-day; and he orders all 296 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the children born on May-day to be drowned. But Mordred escapes, and grows up to kill his father. This brings Arthur still more closely within the mythical framework.\" * * * It is the old story of the sun marrying the canopy of one canopy-light day or period destroying the day which preceded it ; and shows \" very clearly that Arthur was a pagan demigod before he became a Christian king.\" * Arthur, according to the tale, weds. \" The invading kings ravage the land again, scarce one month after Arthur is married : and he cries out like the wanderer, ( Never have I had one month's rest since I became king of the land/ So Arthur's life goes on in fighting; finally Lancelot plays the part of Paris in the Iliad. He makes Gwennivar untrue to her husband, and a last great battle comes between the forces of the two. Here the myth brings in the snake. There was to be no fighting until a sword should be raised; but a snake bit one of the knights ; he raised his sword to slay it, and the two armies, supposing it to be the signal, came to battle. His son, the traitor Sir Mordred, wounded the bright king, because the scabbard of his sword had been stolen. Yet Arthur cannot die till the sword has been thrown into the water, for the sun must set in the waters (behind the canopy- bank). But Arthur is one of those heroes who do not die. The three mystic queens, like the three fates or three furies, bear him away in the ship of the dead (the canopy ship), but he will return. All Wales and Brittany look for his coming. He has only gone to the land of Avalon to be healed of his grievous wound. Now, the word Avalon means the island of apple-trees. The paradise of the Kelts was always an island far over the blue seas.\" 37 The fact will be recognized that he went to the egg-hole land, and that the apples are the stars in the open place of the sky where he was to be healed. , pp. 245-248. CHAPTER XIX PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION THE Platonic Drama consists mainly of argumentative conversation, however the element of the myth is frequently introduced, and in some of the Dialogues it becomes so strik- ing that a just consideration of Plato's philosophical style is impossible without taking it into account. To understand this philosophy in its fullness, then, it is all-important to catch the true notes of the echo from the forgotten past. The Belted Canopy Hypothesis does this ; it brings the vibrations of the past down to the present. Let us make a connection with this long-distance telephone and place our ear at the receiver. Here and there we catch a sound that seems to have pierced right through the whole gap of history. The Phsedo Myth vibrates with the rush of many waters. Channels are bored under the Earth, forming bowls, and measureless floods of perennial rivers, some broad, some shallower, also much fire floweth, and there are great rivers of fire (rivers illu- minated by sun-fire) , and many rivers of running mud, some clearer, some thicker. Plato naturally compares them to the rivers of Sicily. Then note the significant language that follows : \" With these floods therefore each place is filled according as at each time the stream floweth round unto each.\" The ebb and the flow of the tides resounds through the whole passage, but the beat of the waves still has the sound of the storm of canopy decline. And they flow < afar off, where deepest underground the Pit is digged' (the Tartarus of the poets). Now, from this cavern the rivers 1 The translation quoted in the text is from J. A. Stewart's \" The Myths of Plato.\" 297 298 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS flow in, and from it they flow out. \" The cause of all streams flowing out and flowing in is that this flood hath no bottom or foundation. Wherefore it swingeth and surgeth up and down, and the air and the wind surge with it.\" \" Some waters there be that, coming forth out of the Earth at one side thereof, flow in at the contrary side; and some that go in and come out on the same side ; and some there be that go round the whole Earth and are wound about it once yea, perchance, many times like serpents. These rivers pour their waters back into Tartarus as low down as water can fall. Now, it can fall as far as the centre in each way, but no further: each half of the Earth is a hill against the stream that floweth from the side of the other half.\" The four rivers are called ' Ocean/ ' Acheron/ which floweth the contrary way (a very significant statement, as the canopy belts, owing to their different positions in the heavens, ap- peared to flow or move at different rates of speed; to an observer in the south the belts in the north must have even appeared to have a retrograde movement), Pyriphlegethon of the fiery floods, and the Styx, whose waters hath wholly the color of blue steel, and which issues forth first into a fearful, savage place. Another sound comes over the ' phone ' from the Myth of Er. Here we have the Spindle of Necessity, a pillar of light in the sky. The souls after sojourning a thousand years in Tartarus and Heaven journey aboveground from the Meadow till they come to a \" Rainbow-colored light, straight like a pillar, extended from on high throughout the Heaven and the Earth.\" There seems to be a great system revolving above, and the Earth remains fixed in the centre. The des- tination of the Pilgrim Souls appears to be that part of the surface of the globe which supports the hemisphere of fire, and the Spindle of Necessity. \" Now, when both companies had been seven days in the Meadow, Er said that they were constrained on the eighth day to arise and journey thence, PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION 299 and came on the fourth day to a place whence they could behold a Straight Light extended from above through the whole Heaven and Earth, as it were a pillar, for color most like unto the rainbow, but brighter and purer. Unto which they came when they had gone forward a day's journey, and there, at the middle part of the Light, beheld extended from the Heaven the ends of the bonds thereof; for this Light is that which bindeth the Heavens together ; as the under-girths hold together ships, so doth it hold together the whole round of Heaven ; and from the ends extendeth the Spindle of Neces- sity, which causeth all the heavenly revolutions, whereof the shaft and hook are of adamant, and the whorl is of adamant and of other substances therewith.\" \" Now, the whorl is after this fashion. In shape it is as one of our whorls, but from what he said we must conceive of it as a great whorl, carved hollow through and through, wherein is set, fitting it, a smaller whorl of like kind, as caskets are set fitting into one another; and then in this a third whorl is set, and then a fourth, and then four others; for the whorls are together eight, set one within another, showing their lips as circles above. * * * And the whole spindle goeth round in the lap of Necessity.\" The whole matter resolves itself into a natural law. Still another vibration comes down the thread of time from the Politicus Myth. The cosmic periods, come, and the cosmic periods go. When the controlling agency of some all powerful sky-god lets go the helm, then the Cosmos begins of itself to revolve backwards. The Golden Age of Cronus was brought about by a good god, an all-protecting canopy, under which the children of men basked in security and plenty. But when this god was dethroned, the Cosmos changed the direction of its revolution, the- change being accompanied by great earthquakes, which destroyed all but a few men and animals. This was no doubt the ending of the cataclysm which is known to science as the Ice age. Then 300 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS the Cosmos calmed down, but it is said that it revolved in its own direction, which evidently means that it did not revolve with the same movement that it did under the good god Cronus. It went from bad to worse, till the god of the great expanse of heaven, in his goodness, saved struggling men by means of the fire of Prometheus. Zeus triumphant let the light of the new-born sun shine in on the darkened earth. The doctrine of periodical terrestrial ' catastrophies/ as set forth in this myth, was a part of the ' science ' and ' philosophy' of Plato's day. The reason for this bent of mind is accounted for by the closer association of his age with that which went before, but it must be kept constantly in view that when Plato lived he only caught, as we do, these echoes from a distance; the distance of course was meas- urably shorter, but the interpretation of the vibrations was in some ways more difficult than it is with us, owing to the fact that his general knowledge was much more limited than ours of to-day. Thus in the Myth of the Golden Age he puts into the mouth of the Athenian Stranger these words: \"It is told that there was a Government and Settlement when Cronus was King; whereof the blessedness was great.\" Plato goes on to state that \" this, then, is the tale which we have received concerning the blessed life of the men who lived in those days : It telleth that they had all things, without stint, spontaneously.\" Let us hear more of what this Stranger has to say ; he is speaking in the Politicus Myth. \" Hearken ! This Universe, for a certain space of time, God himself doth help to guide and propel in the circular motion thereof; and then, when the cycles of the time appointed unto it have accomplished their measure, he letteth it go. Then doth it begin to go round in the contrary direction, of itself, being a living creature which hath gotten understanding from him who fashioned it in the beginning. This circuit in the contrary PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION 301 direction belongeth of necessity to the nature of the Universe. Now, that which we call Heaven and Universe hath been made, through him who begat it, partaker of many blessed possessions. * * * Whereof it is not possible that it should be wholly set free from change, albeit, as far as possible, it revolveth in the same place, with one uniform motion: for this reason, when it changed, it took unto itself circular motion in the contrary direction, which is the smallest pos- sible alteration of the motion which belongeth unto it.\" Then follows a philosophical deduction that shows how this con- dition of the heavens naturally gave rise to the supposition that there was more than one god. In Plato's time the true significance was already lost, so the Stranger did not think the argument in favor of there being two gods was strong. The philosophical remarks are as follows : \" From all this it followeth that we must not say that the Universe either of itself moveth itself alway, or again is alway wholly moved by God to revolve now in one direction and then in the con- trary direction; nor must we say that there be two Gods which, being contrariously minded, do cause it so to revolve ; but we must hold by that which was just now said and alone remaineth, to wit, that at one time it is holpen and guided by the power of God supervening, and hath more life added unto it, and receiveth immortality from the Creator afresh; and then, at another time, when it is let go, it moveth of itself, having been so opportunely released that thereafter it journey eth in the contrary direction throughout ages innu- merable, being so great of bulk, and so evenly balanced, and turned on so fine a point.\" \" Now have I told thee, Socrates, of the life which was when Cronus reigned; as for the life which now is, which they say is under the rule of Zeus, thou art here thyself and knowest what it is.\" The subject of the Timseus Myth is the Creation of the Universe. Over the * phone ' comes the question : \" Have we rightly called the Heaven One ? Or were it more right to 302 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS say that there are Heavens many nay, infinite in number ? \" The discussion goes on to prove that there is only one. But why was the question asked ? In Plato's time, just as in our own time, sane men knew there was only one Heaven. Were there ever conditions that gave rise to this question, or were Plato's ancestors insane? The Atlantis Myth is perhaps the most germane to the present hypothesis of any of the Platonic Myths. It is recorded in the Critias, which, though it is only a fragment, is a very bulky fragment of the Timseus Myth. It is so long and so well known that we omit it. Another version of the story is given by Theopompos, who wrote in the fourth cen- tury before Christ. According to him, the information con- cerning Atlantis was given by Silenus to the ancient king of Midas. 2 Herodotus mentions the matter and in connection with the cloud-mountain he says: \" The inhabitants say that it is the Pillar of Heaven. From this mountain these men derive their appellation, for they are called Atlantes. They are said neither to eat the flesh of any animal nor to see visions. As far, then, as these Atlantes, I am able to mention the names of the nations that inhabit this ridge, but not beyond them. This ridge, how- ever, extends as far as the pillars of Hercules.\" 3 But to return to the Platonic exposition. The shape given to the Living Creature, our Earth, as described in the Timaeus Myth, makes it appear \" like a ball, round with boundary at every point equally distant from the centre.\" And furthermore, there was nothing outside this boundary or canopy, because man in the early ages could not see beyond it. \" Wherefore He turned it round and round, with the 8 See Aristotle, cited by Plutarch, Consolatio ad Apollonium, 27, ed. Didot-Diibner, p. 137. Compare Preller, Griechische Mythologie, 1st ed., vol. i, p. 453. B. iv, c. 184, Gary's tr. PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION 303 same quickness, in the same place, about itself.\" At this point in the myth the idea of a later age intrudes itself upon the circular motion. When the canopies fell the true heaven was revealed, but the idea of circular motion was retained; however, to fit it to the new conditions, it was subdivided into the seven concentric circles, representing the seven planets, the fire-ring and the primum mobile. Of Earth and Heaven, the myth goes on to say, the various gods were born \" both gods visible in their heavenly courses, and gods which make themselves visible as it pleaseth them then spake unto them the Begetter of this Universe, saying : Gods of gods whose Maker and Father I am, ye are the creatures of my handiwork, and without me are ye not loosed asunder, for verily that which is bound together can alway be loosed; but none save an evil one would desire to loose asunder that whereof the parts are well joined together and the whole state is goodly. Wherefore, being creatures, ye are not altogether set apart from death so that ye cannot be loosed asunder.\" Then follows a description of the crea- tion of soul, and a mixed idea that the Immortal partakes of the nature of the Universe. \" !N\"ow, the circuits of the Soul, having been bound within the Eiver of the Body which floweth mightily, neither had the mastery over it, nor were they mastered, but were pushed about, and did push with violence, so that the whole creature was moved, and went hither and thither disorderly, by chance, without forethought, having all the six motions; for forward and backward, and to the right and to the left, and down and up, did the creatures go, wandering towards all the six points; because that the flood was great which did swell up over them, supplying their nourishment, and then again did flow away from them; and yet greater was the commotion that was made in them by the blows of those things which did strike against them.\" \"The Young Gods, taking for a pattern the shape of the 304 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Universe which is a globe, bound the Divine Circles, which are twain, within this corporeal ball which we call Head. * * * For they perceived that unto the Head belonged all the motions which should be. Wherefore, that it might not go rolling upon the earth, which hath heights and depths of every sort, finding no way of getting over those or out of these, to this end gave they unto it the Body for a carriage, to make the way easy for it. Wherefore the Body got length, and put forth limbs which were able to be stretched out and to be bent, four in number; for thus the Gods devise means of going about, so that the Body, therewith taking hold and pushing off, could go through all places, bearing aloft the temple of that which in use is the most divine and the most holy.\" This same comparison of the soul to the old-time canopy, the universe, which was known of yore, occurs in the Phsedrus Myth. 4 \" Let it then be said of the Soul, that she is like unto a Power composite of two Winged Horses harnessed, and a Charioteer. All the Horses and Charioteers of the Gods are themselves good, and of good stock.\" The chariots of the gods were the vapor shells or halos (in mythology these are often called boats) which accompanied the sun, moon, and stars in their courses. The myth goes on to state that \" the nature of wings consisteth in the power of lifting that which is heavy up into the height where the generation of the Gods dwelleth; and unto wings, amongst the bodily parts belongeth the largest portion of that which is of God. \" Zeus, the great Captain of the Host of Heaven, mounted upon his winged chariot, rideth first and disposeth and over- * \" There can be no doubt, I think,\" says J. A. Stewart in his observations on the Phaedo Myth (\"The Myths of Plato,\" p. 107), that the lofty terrestrial Paradise of the Phaedo Myth answers to the ' Island of the Blessed ' in the Gorgian Myth, to ( these ) heights of the Phsedrus Myth, and to the 'heaven* of the Myth of Er.\" Dante's Mount of Purgatory is founded on the same echo. PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION 305 seeth all things. Him followeth the army of Gods and Daemons in eleven orders for Hestia alone abideth in the House of Gods; but all the other Gods which are of the number of the Twelve go forth and lead each one the order whereof he is appointed to be captain. \" Many holy sights there be for eye to behold of blessed Gods in their courses passing to and fro within the firmament of Heaven, each one doing his own business : and whosoever willeth, and is able, followeth ; for Envy standeth afar from the Heavenly Choir. \" Now, as often as they go to eat at the banquet, their path is ever up by the steep way close under the roof of the Heaven. The Chariots of the Gods, going evenly and being alway obedient to the hand of the Charioteer, accomplish their journey easily; but the other Chariots hardly, with great labor, for the Horse, which is by nature froward, is as a weight, and ever inclineth towards the Earth, and, except the Charioteer hath brought him into subjection, draweth the Chariot down. * * * The Souls which are called immortal, when they are come to the top of the Heaven, journey out therefrom and stand upon the Roof thereof without, and, standing, are carried round by the circuit, and behold those things which are without the Heaven.\" These immortal souls reach the place which is above the Heaven, that is, the place above the canopy. Plato states that \"no poet here hath ever praised, nor shall praise worthily, this locality. * * * The Substance which Verily Is, which hath no color and no shape, and hand cannot touch. * * * Round about this Substance, in this Place, dwelleth True Knowledge.\" This fact is indeed true, when the canopy fell the true nature of the universe was revealed and the day of the gods passed forever away. The Phsedrus Myth next depicts the condition of the other classes of souls ; those which could not reach this region above the canopy where all truth was revealed. \" This is the 20 306 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS life of the Gods. Of the other Souls, whichsoever followeth God best, and is made most like unto Him, keepeth the head of her Charioteer lifted up into the Place without the firma- ment, and is carried round with the circuit thereof, heing troubled by the Horses, and hardly beholding the Things Which Are; after her cometh the Soul, which for a space keepeth the head of her Charioteer lifted up, and then again sinketh down, and because of the violence of the Horses, seeth some of the Things Which Are, but some she seeth not. \" Beside these follow other Souls, which all do strive after that which is above, but are not able to reach unto it, and are carried round sunken beneath the face of the Heaven, trampling upon one another, running against one another, and pressing on for to outstrip one another, with mighty great sound of tumult and sweat of the race ; and here, by reason of the unskilfulness of the Charioteers, many Souls are maimed, and many have their wings broken ; and all, greatly travailling, depart uninitiated, not having seen That Which Is, and turn them to the food of Opinion.\" The two Symposium Myths next hold our attention, and we quote the following from the one told by Aristophanes. Describing a sky-born phenomenon, the record says : \" !N\"ow, the genders were three, and of this sort, because the male gender was in the beginning sprung from the Sun, and the female gender from the Earth, and that which partook of both from the Moon for the Moon partaketh of both Sun and Earth (the moon of mythology is the crescent canopy) : so it came to pass that they themselves and their manner of progression were circular after the likeness of their parents : and they were terrible by reason of their strength and valor ; and their hearts were proud, and they made assault upon the Gods, for that which Homer telleth concerning Ephialtes and Otus is told concerning them that they essayed to go up into Heaven for to lay hands on the Gods.\" Attention is directed to the fact that Plato in the above PLATO'S CONTRIBUTION 307 quotation distinctly compares this matter to a Homeric tale. In other words, it has come down to him from the distant past, and he only catches the jangling echo. \" Wherefore Zeus and the other Gods took counsel what they should do (with these sky-forms), and were in doubt; for they were not minded to slay them, as they slew the giants, with thunderbolts.\" Briefly, this myth depicts round people, children of round parents, who are very swift and strong, attacking Zeus and the other gods in their stronghold. Instead of destroying them as they did the giants, Zeus cuts them in two. Then follows philosophical deductions, etc. Plainly, the idea pre- vailed of old that the vapor heavens and the earth were one body, and that this body had life made up of other life. Human life was compared to the body-life of the universe, hence the analogy in the myth. The other Symposium Myth, or the Discourse of Diatima, asks : \" What, then, is Eros ? is he Mortal ? \" The answer is that he is a Daemon, something betwixt God and Mortal. The ephemeral sky scenes were likened to the flitting condi- tions which surround a human soul. The Daemons, Hesiod said, dwell in ' the parts about the Earth/ and more espe- cially ' in the Air.' They were souls of disembodied spirits inhabiting the celestial vault. Some lived on earth in the Golden Age. Some died in the Silver Age. Others were Copper Men of the third age. While others, again, were the Heroes of the fourth age those who had fought at Thebes and Troy. These last battles were primarily encounters between the sky-forces; afterwards they became associated and mixed in with actual history. The fifth age, or that of Iron, is the present. CHAPTER XX MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS THE Indians of the Americas, like the peoples of the Old World, recognized the fact that in times long past some- thing divided up the cycles of duration and separated the one from the other. 1 \" Neither Jews nor Aztecs, nor indeed any American nation,\" says Britton, \" appear to have sup- posed, with some of the old philosophers, that the present was an exact repetition of previous cycles, but rather that each was an improvement on the preceding, a step in endless progress. JSTor did either connect these beliefs with astro- nomical reveries of a great year, defined by the return of the heavenly bodies to one relative position in the heavens. The latter seems characteristic of the realism of Europe, the former of the idealism of the Orient ; both inconsistent with the meagre astronomy and more scanty metaphysics of the red race. \" The expectation of the end of the world is a natural complement to the belief in periodical destructions of our globe. As at certain times past the equipoise of nature was lost, and the elements breaking the chain of laws that bound them ran riot over the universe, involving all life in one 1 As an instance of Old -World thought on these divisions, we would recall the fact mentioned in chapter xvi, that \" Epictetus favors the opinion that at the solstices of the great year not only all human beings, but even the gods, are annihilated; and speculates whether at such times Jove feels lonely (Discourses, b. iii, ch. 13). Macrobius, so far from coinciding with him, explains the great antiquity of Egyptian civilization by the hypothesis that that country is so happily situated between the pole and equator, as to escape both the deluge and con- flagration of the great cycle (Somnium Seipionis, lib. ii, cap. 10). \"The Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., p. 234. By way of comment, we might add that Macrobius has hit the nail on the head. 308 MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 309 mad havoc and desolation, so in the future we have to expect that day of doom.\" 2 The Aztecs believed in four ages. Brinton thinks that \" Doubtless the theory of the Ages of the world was long in vogue among the Aztecs before it received the definite form in which we now have it ; and as this was acquired long after the calendar was fixed, it is every way probable that the latter was used as a guide to the former. Echevarria, a good authority on such matters, says the number of the Suns was agreed upon at a congress of astrologists, within the memory of tradition.\" 3 The Quiches also believed in four ages. The legend of these aborigines is to this effect : \" By the will of the Heart of Heaven the waters were swollen and a great flood came upon the manikins of wood. Tor they did not think nor speak of the Creator who had created them, and who had caused their birth. They were drowned, and a thick resin fell from heaven. \" The bird Xecoteovach tore out their eyes ; the bird Camulatz cut off their heads ; the bird Cotzbalam devoured their flesh; the bird Tecumbalam broke their bones and sinews and ground them into powder.\" 4 These four birds, whose names have lost their signifi- cation, no doubt originally represented four different vapor- belts, or, as Brinton says, \" the four rivers, which, as in so many legends, are the active agents in overwhelming the world in its great crises.\" Probably at a later date, when the canopy-belts were forgotten, these birds came to repre- sent the four winds. In the Iroquois narrative, their ancestor was kicked from the sky by her irate spouse. When she fell there was as yet no land to receive her, but suddenly it began to bubble up under her feet and waxed bigger and bigger. The Algonkin 2 \" The Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., p. 253. Ibid., p. 252. *IUd., p. 242. 310 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS tribes had similar ideas, but their cosmology was of a recon- structive rather than a constructive nature. \" A reconstruc- tion supposes a previous existence. This they felt, and had something to say about an earth anterior to this of ours, but one without light or human inhabitants. A lake burst its bounds and submerged it wholly.\" 5 The thought of a dark world is one of the commonest to mythology. The Egyptians said : \" The heaven rests upon the earth, like a goose brooding over her egg.\" 6 Naturally, among the less enlightened peoples the blackness under the shroud-like canopy must have been appalling. There was indeed something brooding over them. \" Even the Bushmen of South Africa have the strange idea that the sun did not shine on their country in the beginning. Only after the children of the first Bushmen had been sent up to the top of the world and had launched the sun was light procured for this South African region. A similar myth was found among the Australian aborigines.\" 7 \" In the cosmogony of the Hidery Indians, the creator of the world, !N~ekilstluss, in the shape of a raven, existed from all eternity. Before the world came into being, he brooded over the intense darkness that prevailed, until, after aeons of ages, by the continual napping of his wings he beat the darkness down to solid ground. For a long time the only light in the world was a dim, hazy one, given off by the earth. When the earth was in a condition to receive the stronger light from the sun, moon, and stars, he set out to get hold of them. They were in possession of a great chief, who had them in three separate boxes, kept them only for his own use, and refused to part with them. !N\"ekilstluss, having obtained one of the boxes by a ruse, broke it open. It hap- IUd., pp. 231, 232. 6 Tiele, \" History of the Egyptian Religion,\" p. 67. 7 William F. Warren, \" Paradise Found,\" p. 200. \" Bushman Folk- lore,\" by W. H. J. Bleek. \"Parliament Report,\" Cape Town and London, 1875: p. 9. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 311 pened to be the sun that he had got, and this he took in his beak, and, flying up, placed it in the heavens, where it has been ever since. After this he obtained the two other boxes by another ruse, and, having broken them open, let out the moon and stars, which he placed in the heavens, where they have ever since continued to shine.\" 8 The Thlinkeets, an Alaskan tribe, say that Yehl is the maker of wood and of water; undoubtedly he was origi- nally the canopy. The story tells us that \" at that time the sun, moon, and stars were kept by a rich chief in separate boxes, which he allowed no one to touch. Yehl, by strategy, secured and opened these boxes, so that the moon and stars shone in the sky. When the sun-box was opened, the people, astonished at such an unwonted glare, ran off into the mountains.\" 9 Ignatius Donnelly is responsible for the following in- stances of a somewhat opposite nature, where the sun is caught in the canopy-net instead of being liberated. It will be seen they are of the same character as the boxing of Osiris in the coffin, and of Perseus and his mother in the chest. They illustrate the yearly phenomenon of the disappearance of the sun beneath the great black obscuring thing. The first tale says: \" There was once, according to the Ojibway legends, a boy; the sun burned and spoiled his bird-skin coat; and he swore that he would have vengeance. He persuaded his sister to make him a noose of her own hair. He fixed it just where the sun would strike the land as it rose above the earth's disk ; and, sure enough, he caught the sun, and held it fast, so that it did not rise. \" The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great commotion. They had no light. They called a council to debate upon the matter, and to appoint some one 8 Scientific American Supplement, No. 1032. F. S. Dobbins, \"Gods and Devils of Mankind,\" p. 371. 312 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS to go up and cut the cord, for this was a very hazardous enterprise, as the rays of the sun would burn up whoever came so near. At last the dormouse undertook it, for at this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world ; when it stood up it looked like a mountain. (The dormouse undoubtedly was a vapor-form.) When it got to the place where the sun was snared, its back began to smoke and burn with the intensity of the heat, and the top of its carcass was reduced to enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun, but it was reduced to a very small size, and has remained so ever since. * * * \" Among the Wyandots a story was told, in the seven- teenth century, of a boy whose father was killed and eaten by a bear, and his mother by the Great Hare. He was small, but of prodigious strength. He climbed a tree, like Jack of the Bean-Stalk, until he reached heaven. \" He set his snares for game, but when he got up at night to look at them he found everything on fire. His sister told him he had caught the sun unawares, and when the boy, Chakabech, went to see, so it was. But he dared not go near enough to let him out. But by chance he found a little mouse, and blew upon her until she grew so big she could set the sun free, and he went on his way. But while he was held in the snare, day failed down here on earth. (It was the age of darkness, under the canopy.) * * * \" The Dog-Rib Indians, far in the northwest of America, near the Esquimaux, have a similar story. Chakabech be- comes Chapewee. He too climbs a tree, but it is in pursuit of a squirrel, until he reaches heaven. He set a snare made of his sister's hair and caught the sun. f The sky was in- stantly darkened.' Chapewee's family said to him, 'You must have done something wrong when you were aloft, for we no longer enjoy the light of day.' 'I have,' replied he, 'but it was unintentionally.' Chapewee sent a number of MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 313 animals to cut the snare, but the intense heat reduced them all to ashes. At last the ground-mole, working in the earth, cut the snare, but lost its sight, and its nose and teeth have ever since been brown as if burnt.\" The same myth is current in other lands. Thus : \" Maui is the Polynesian god of the ancient days. He concluded, as did Ta-wats, 10 that the days were too short. He wanted the sun to slow up, but it would not. So he pro- ceeded to catch it in a noose, like the O jib way boy and the Wyandot youth. The manufacture of the noose, we are told, led to the discovery of the art of rope-making. He took his brothers with him; he armed himself, like Samson, with a jaw-bone, but instead of the jaw-bone of an ass, he, with much better taste, selected the jaw-bone of his mistress. She may have been a lady of fine conversational powers (the canopy it will be remembered was the source of many terms and root words and also the cause of the confusion of tongues). They traveled far, like Ta-wats, even to the very edge of the place where the sun rises. There he set his noose. The sun came and put his head and fore-paws into it; then the brothers pulled the ropes tight, and Maui gave him a great whipping with the jaw-bone ; he screamed and roared ; they held him there for a long time (the Age of Darkness), and at last they let him go; and, weak from his wounds (obscured by the canopy), he crawls slowly along his path. Here the jaw of the wolf Fern-is, which reached from earth to heaven, in the Scandinavian legends, becomes a veritable jaw-bone which beats and ruins the sun.\" 11 * * * \" It is a curious fact that the sun in this Polynesian legend is Ea, precisely the same as the name of the god of the sun in Egypt, while in Hindustan the sun-god is Ea-ma. 10 See chapter xvi. \"This pendent jaw-sky-bone is similar to the gigantic clam-shell which Pythias declared could have swallowed up his ship. See chapter xvii. 314 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" In another Polynesian legend we read of a character who was satisfied with nothing ' even pudding would not content him ' and this unconscionable fellow worried his family out of all heart with his new ways and ideas. He represents a progressive, inventive race. He was building a great house, but the days were too short; so, like Maui, he determined to catch the sun in nets and ropes ; but the sun went on. At last he succeeded ; he caught him. The- good man then had time to finish his house, but the sun cried and cried ' until the island of Savai was nearly drowned.' * * * \" And these myths of the sun being tied by a cord are, strange to say, found even in Europe. The legends tell us : \" In North Germany the townsmen of Bosum sit up in their* church-tower and hold the sun by a cable all day long ; taking care of it at night, and letting it up again in the morning. In e Reynard the Fox/ the day is bound with a rope, and its bonds only allow it to come slowly on. The Peruvian Inca said the sun is like a tied beast, who goee ever round, in the same track.\" In the days when the ephemeral vapor-forms were ever changing their courses the fact that the sun, seen in his halo-boat, seemed to journey in a fixed or tied-up path must have been especially noticeable. \" Let us change the scene again to the neighborhood of the Aztecs. We are told of two youths, the ancestors of the Miztec chiefs, who separated, each going his own way to conquer lands for himself. \" The- braver of the two, coming to the vicinity of Tilan- tongo, armed with- buckler and bow, was much vexed and oppressed by the ardent rays of the sun, which he took to be the lord of that district, striving to prevent his entrance therein. Then the young man strung his bow, and advanced his buckler before him, and drew shafts from his quiver. He shot these against the great light even till the going down of the same; then he took possession of all that land, seeing that he had grievously wounded the sun and forced him to hide MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 315 behind the mountains (canopy and vapor-belts). Upon this story is founded the lordship of all the caciques of Mizteca, and upon their descent from this mighty archer, their ances- tor. Even to this day, the chiefs of the Miztecs blazon as their arms a plumed chief with bow and arrows and shield, and the sun in front of him setting behind gray clouds.\" 12 Another class of these uncanny, cold-blooded reminis- cences actually portrays primeval man living in a cave under a world-roof; the darkness of the cave is depicted, and the cave is said to be so big that all the animals of the world live in it with man. Bancroft says: \" The Navajos, living north of the Pueblos, say that at one time all the nations, Navajos, Pueblos, Coyoteros, and white people, lived together underground, in the heart of a mountain, near the river San Juan. Their food was meat, which they had in abundance, for all kinds of game were closed up with them in their cave; but their light was dim, and only endured for a few hours each day.\" The Indians were aware that this grotto covering was water (vapor). Bancroft goes on to tell how the Moth-worm (the totemic emblem of a family) \" mounted into the breach, and bored and bored till he found himself suddenly on the outside of the mountain, and surrounded by water.\" The story goes on to relate that \" when these nations lived underground they all spake one tongue ; but, with the light of day and the level of earth, came many languages. The earth was at this time very small, and the light was quite as scanty as it had been down below, for there was as yet no heaven, no sun, nor moon, nor stars. So another council of the ancients was held, and a committee of their number appointed to manu- facture these- luminaries.\" The \" dum fluter \" is said to 18 \" Ragnarok,\" pp. 181-185.

Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 73. 316 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS have been given the final charge of making these orbs. Then we are told that the increasing size of the earth necessitated the putting back of the sun from the earth, by which we understand that the old shiner gave place to the true sun as the atmosphere cleared, thus the source of light appeared to be moved farther away.' 7 13 As the canopy approached its last stage its increased size was apparent to all, the world-mountain seemed to be about to swallow everything in its fearful maw. \" The Karens say that Twa Wya, going to the Sun (shiner) that he might make him grow, was so increased by the Sun (shiner) that his head touched the sky (he was the true sun). He went forth on various adventures over the earth, and was after a time swallowed by a snake. The reptile being cut open, Twa Wya came back to life (like e Osiris Found 7 ). The Basutos tell that Litaolane, their hero, was swallowed by a monster, but that he cut his way out, and set free all the inhabitants of the world. The Zulus say the maw of the monster that devoured the Princess, and men, dogs, etc., has forests, rivers, hills, cattle, and people living there, and when at length he is cut open, out come they all ; the cock appears first, and he cries out in his rapture of joy, ( Kukuluku, I see the world. 7 In the Algonquin, Manabozho, angling for the King of Fishes, was swallowed up, canoe and all; he belabored the monster with his war-club until he would fain have cast him out again, but Manabozho set his canoe across the fish's throat inside and despatched him; the fish drifted ashore and the gulls pecked a place by which the hero could come out. 77 14 It should be remembered that there were at least two caves in the heavens (cavemous-like places) : Calypso 7 s cavern and the equatorial slit. The Peruvians have a legend \"\"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 81. 11 Charles De B. Mills, \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 96-97. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 317 of their god Ataguja sending to the earth the first of mortals, who there seduced the sister of a certain Guachemines, or rayless one, a darkling. The sister proved pregnant, and died in her labor, giving birth to two eggs, the sun and moon. From these emerged the two brothers, Apocatequil and Piguerao. 15 It is significant that this Ataguja came from the east and disappeared in the Western Ocean, four civ- ilizers following him, who emerged from the cave of the House of Birth. \" All the tribes on the Northwest Coast,\" says Brinton, \" attribute the creative act to the original Raven (canopy), who lived before the sun was formed. He found it by one or another accident, and, picking it up, ' placed it in the heavens, where it has been ever since.' With the Kootenays it is either the coyote or the chicken hawk who manufactures the sun out of a ball of grease and sets it in the sky to pursue its course rude fancies, but serving as well as any to show that these tribes did not regard the sun as the visible creator or the highest divinty.\" 1G Donnelly very truly remarks : \" A great solar-myth underlies all the ancient mythologies. It commemorates the death and resurrection of the sun. It signifies the destruc- tion of the light by the clouds, the darkness, and the eventual return of the great luminary of the world. \" The Syrian Adonis, the sun-god, the Hebrew Tamheur, and the Assyrian Du-Zu, all suffered a sudden and violent death, disappeared for a time from the sight of men, and were at last raised from the dead.\" 17 But we would add that these disappearances were due to the zonal vapor-belts in the higher atmosphere and to the canopy that soared above all. Among the Mexicans is the following legend of the return- ing of the sun : \" Now, there had been no sun in existence for many years ; so the gods, being assembled in a place called \"Brinton, \"Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., p. 184. 18 IUd., p. 166. \" \" Kagnarok,\" p. 233. 318 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Teotihuacan, six leagues from Mexico, and gathered at the same time around a great fire, told their devotees that he of them who should first cast himself into that fire should have the honor of being transformed into a sun. So one of them, called Nanahuatzin, * * * flung himself into the fire. Then the gods began to peer through the gloom in all direc- tions for the expected light, and to make bets as to what part of heaven he should first appear in. Some said e Here/ and some said ' There ' ; but when the sun rose they were all proved wrong, for not one of them had fixed upon the east.\" 18 Donnelly, commenting on the myth, says : \" In the long- continued darkness they had lost all knowledge of the car- dinal points.\" 19 The arrival of the bright one, like the advent of Osiris, was no doubt heralded with great joy. Mills says : \" Among the American Indians the term Michabo, lit- erally ' the Great White One,' means also in some connec- tions the Great Hare, and so manifold tales have sprung up in the attempt to explain why this appellation should have been used for the supreme. So a like illusion in Greece was due to the impression that Zeus Lykaios, literally the ' Light One/ was Zeus Lupine, from the resemblance of LuJcaios to Lukos; as Phoibos Lykegenes, literally ' offspring of light/ was supposed wolf -born.\" 20 \" Now, it appears/' remarks Brinton, \" on attentively examining the Algonkin root wab, that it gives rise to words of very diverse meaning, that like many others in all lan- guages, while presenting but one form, it represents ideas of wholly unlike origin and application; that in fact there are two distinct roots having this sound. One is the initial syllable of the word translated hare or rabbit, but the other \"Bancroft, \"Native Races,\" vol. iii, p. 46. 19 \" Ragnarok,\" p. 216. 20 \" The Tree of Mythology,\" pp. 38-39. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 319 means white.\" 21 From the light shed by the present hypothe- sis it is clear that these two roots are from one common source. ' The White One/ or the sun, was also ' The Swift One/ the hare. The dialect forms, according to Brinton in Algonkin, for white are : wabi, wape, wompi, waubish, oppai ; for light: oppung; for hare: wab, etc., etc. When the old sky passed away, words lost their meaning, and the echo that has come down to us is robbed of much of its poetry. \" The California tribes spoke of their chief deity as e the Old Man above.' * * * In the legends of the Aztecs and Quiches such phrases as ' Heart of the Sky/ ' Lord of the Sky/ ' Prince of the Azure Planisphere.' c He above all/ are of frequent occurrence; and by a still bolder metaphor, the Araucanians, according to Molina, entitled their greatest god ' the Soul of the Sky.' \" 22 Let us endeavor to catch the fleeting breath of at least one of these myths before the ( Soul of the Sky ' perishes forever. The one selected is that of the legend of Olelbis. 'T was a light that gleamed on the hilltops, 'T was a light that gleamed afar, Away in the distant purple west Where the Wintu people are. Such light belongs to the cloud-lands, To the regions high above Where heaven's ocean reels around And floats forth as a dove. Like a beacon it seemed to flutter, Like a beacon it seemed to wave, And ever anon it caught new life And flickered forth from the grave, Calling me, in the spirit, with the Hurried sigh of death, \"The Wintu people perish, come Catch their parting breath.\" 21 \" The Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., p. 198. p. 65. THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS And I found upon the hilltops In the spirit that breathes the air A freedom from the earth-chains, A freedom everywhere. And the winds sighed back in sorrow, And the winds sighed back again, Telling in accents softly of The truths that still remain. These whispered of the wondrous past Before the Wintus were When the first people walked the earth; Heaven's amphitheatre. Then like on Mount Olympus, I saw a palace fair O'erhanging and o'ershadowing The world beneath, four-square. 21 To this my soul by Siriwit was Lifted up on high. And the beauty of that marvelous hut Entranced my eager eye. Siriwit the whirlwind whistled And whisked away in a race While I in leisure viewed the scene And entered the holy place. Perfumed were all the breezes Which came from the \" Central Blue,\" From the mansion of Olelbis, Laden with the flower-dew. Olelpanti Hlut was covered all Over within and without With flowers whose roots immortal Bloomed from every sprout; 98 \"In the Olelbis song,\" says Jeremiah Curtin, \"the great one above is the cloud-compeller, as in classic mythology.\" The song of this spirit is, \" I am great above. I tan the black cloud ( there ) .\" In those days there were Kahsuku, cloud dogs, cloud people. \" Creation Myths of Primitive America,\" pp. 36, 516. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 321 Bloomed, and blazed in glory on The living oak-tree frame, As the world-ash of Scandinavia Whose flowers existed in flame, And above and all around it The acorns ripened and fell. Panti Hult with these was covered As all the heroes tell. 24 Breathing this air ethereal I looked from the \"Central Blue\" From the mansion of Olelbis And from there I saw anew: Down on the earth the battle with The water element, And the first people looking up At the troubled firmament. Peace had reigned for ages, but Behold now the end had come, And with terror they beheld the \"Swift\" The sky become quarrelsome. Katkatchila, the racing hunter, Who upheld the ring-world cloud, Who ran in his broidered garment, Who always beat the crowd. Katkatchila now was angry for Red-fox had taken his flint, 25 He had shot at a deer with Dokos And Hau beat him out in the sprint. Hau stuck the stone in his left ear To hide it away from \" Swift's \" sight, But the latter rose in his anger And travelled away in the night. 24 \"That house stood in the morning dawn,\" says Curtin, \"a mountain of beautiful flowers and oak tree branches; all the colors of the world were on it outside and inside. The tree in the middle was far above the top of the house, and filled with acorns; a few of them had fallen on every side.\" Ibid., p. 19. K Flint in Indian Mythology represents fire. In this action we have sun-fire breaking through the sky-roof, which ends the Golden Age. 21 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Hau took the stolen flint-stone To the sweat-house and showed it there, But all of the first people Began to see the snare. Titchelis, the little ground squirrel, Attempted to take it home, But meanwhile Katkatchila had Eaised the sea in a foam. It tossed around in anger. Poharamas, shooting star, And Yonot, his Buckeye sister, Unloosed a sky-prop spar. Then he took Pohila (fire-child) And with pine that was full of pitch He started a flame in the clean swept place ; Which leapt o'er the hill and ditch. Southeast Poharamas went And Tilikus to the southwest rushed Each with a brand of the burning pine, Each by the crimson flushed. And these set fire to the firmament as Phaeton did in Greece The Golden Age was ended And war had succeeded peace. 27 As I watched from Olelphanti I saw all these things below Olelbis looked down on the burning world, On the scene of fire and woe: 26 The \" egg-hole \" of classic mythology, \" the empty place,\" \" Tarn- muz bleeding,\" etc. The ruddy glow diffused over this place gave rise to the belief that the canopy was burning. The Scandinavians saw it and knew that Ragnarok, \" the twilight of the gods,\" was at hand. 27 \" Soon all saw that the fire was coming toward them from the east and the west, like waves of high water, and the line of it was going northward quickly. The fire made a terrible roar as it burned; soon everything was seething.\" \" Creation Myths of Primitive America,\" p. 13. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 323 Nothing but waves of flame we saw, And the sparks mounting up to the skies, Which there became kolchituh, The shining stars (sky-eyes). 28 We watched this fire together with The old women who made his bread: Pakchuso and Pokaila, As one, advised and said: \" Grandson,\" said the old women, \" If you want this wakpohas put out, There's a very old man, Kahit Kiemila, Who lives in the north, thereabout. \"He lives outside of the first sky. He stays there in one little place. Ask him to send us Mem Loimis, For water must red-fire chase.\" Olelbis called Lutchi and Sutunut. \" Go, Lutchi, pry up the sky. \" Go, Sutunut, carry these feathers To Kahit to signify \" That I wish him to send Mem Loimis through The hole which Lutchi pries up. I have given a sky prop to help him. Now, hurry, the world dries up! \" Lutchi took the sky-pole And placed the prop underneath, Mem Loimis rushed through the open place\" And quenched the fire beneath. 28 \" Great rolls, and piles of smoke were rising ; fire flew up toward the sky in flames, in great sparks and brands. Those sparks became kolchituh (sky-eyes), and all the stars that we see now in the sky came from that time when the first world was burned. The sparks stuck fast in the sky, and have remained there ever since the time of the wakpohas (world fire).\" Ibid., p. 15. 29 Of this open place Curtin says : \" There was so much water outside that could not come through that it rose to the top of the sky and rushed on toward Olelpanti.\" Ibid., p. 22. 324 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS She rushed like a crowd of rivers, and Covered all the earth, And naught was left but a wilderness There was nothing left of worth. Then Kahit, the force centrifugal, Quickened the speed of the ring, And she fell backward coming, Which stopped the great sky-spring. So Kahit drove her backward to The cloud-bag from whence she came. (A bag that could carry everything The earth itself, some claim). 30 Thus she retreated backward Into the very north, Where she sought again the region From which she had sallied forth; But when she reached the sun-fish, She divided, east and west, And came to the hut of Olelbis And became his wife which was best. 81 There from their home of flowers, they Looked down on the fleshless earth Down, down on the dreadful barren dust On the scene of fire and dearth. 30 The cloud-bag is borrowed from the myth of Nbrwanchakus and Keriha. In this myth the existence of Puriwa, darkness, and Sanihas, daylight, before the sun was in the world, is very instructive, and the fact that the Polar-star, Waida Werris, was seen in the sky-hole in the north is remarkable. Light and darkness existed outside of the sky, and were stolen from that place. Under the cloud-bag it was very dark. Keriha went beyond the sky on the southeast. 31 In the myth of Olelbis and Mem Loimis, the sons of these mighty parents pass beyond the third horizon in search of their mother (water), who had been stolen away. Wokwuk, their companion, had tied the hair on the top of his head with a young grapevine; he had a bone stuck through it, and with this bone he raised the sky. \" When they had passed the third sky, they could see far east. Everything was nice there and looked clear, just as it does here at daylight, when all is bright and beautiful.\" Hid., p. 60. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 325 \" O ! \" cried out Olelbis, \" we Must start all things afresh.\" So he made the sky into a sieve, A net of the finest mesh. Through this he sifted the sunshine, And then again the rain Throwing down all of his flowers, and The seed of the corn and grain. Transforming all the first people, He made them over anew, And 't was thus the earth was peopled, Wokwuk to the forest flew. Jeremiah Curtin says : \" Olelbis took a great sky net (kolchi koro), and it spread out; it reached to the ends of the sky in every direction; it was full of small, fine holes, like a sieve.\" 32 Beneath this canopy the earth was bare. \" There is nothing on it. What can we do for it ? \" cried Olelbis. Clover, beautiful grasses, and plants of all kinds were growing around his own sweat-house, so at his grand- mother's suggestion he transferred them to earth. 33 \" Next morning Olelbis said : ' Now, my grandmother, what do you think best ? What are we to do with the people here ? Is it best for them to stay in Olelpanti ? ' \" ( Our grandson/ answered the old women, ' send all that are not needed here to the lower world ; turn them into some- thing good for the people who are to come soon those fit for the place up here. The great people, the best ones, you will keep in Olelpanti, and send down only a little part of each of them to turn into something in the world below and be of use to people there.' \" 34 It is also recorded in the myth that \" different bits of Wokwuk came down to the earth and were turned into elk and various valuable creatures.\" 35 The Indians believe 82 Ibid., p. 27. \"Ibid., pp. 33-34. \"Ibid., pp. 43-44. /&*., p. 495. 326 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Wokwuk to be a large bird. But we can see in the legend the great wings of the upper canopy. Bits of this Wokwuk came to the earth. The reclothing and repopulating of the devastated area with new species shows that even the Amerinds have retained some knowledge of the great under- lying principle which is to evolution as the governor is to the steam-engine. The only living being who escaped the destruction was Sedit, the coyote, and he did so by going south. This is in harmony with all that we have said about the distribution of animals. The danger of the conflagration was of course first seen in the pillars of the canopy to the east and to the west. We read in the legend that Olelbis sent his uncle up on the west side of his sweat-house to look, saying, \" We are going to have trouble.\" He also sent his brother up on the east side for the same purpose. Lutchi, however, was watching the north, and it was from this quarter the world-storm finally came. 36 The Yanas, who were especially fond of astronomical myths, have left us a somewhat similar legend to that of Olelbis. It is called \" The First Battle in the World.\" In this myth, the Master of Flint, Kaltsauna, afterwards trans- formed into a lizard or kind of Midgard serpent, prized his weapon so highly that when it was stolen he did not hesitate to set the whole world on fire. 37 Another beautiful myth of the Yanas sets forth a deadly feud between the flint-people, that is, fire, and the grizzlies, lbid., p. 20. 37 From all parts of the world we have like tales. Hesiod says : \" Prometheus stole the far-seen ray of unwearied fire in a hollow 1 stalk of fennel\" (Theogony 566). Some say he stole it from the altar of Zeus, others that he lit his rod at the sun, i.e., the \" canopy shiner.\" The Australians have a\" similar fable: a black fellow climbed by a rope to the \" shiner.\" Birds and animals play the leading roles everywhere. A bird brings fire in the Andaman Isles, and among the Ahts it is said that a fish, which would remind one of Ea, owned fire; other beasts, or canopy-forms, stole it. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 327 that is, the cloud-people, denizens of the canopy. In this myth the sunlight has a series of adventures which resemble the labors of Hercules. Baby Tsawadi Kamshupa, ' young red flint clover fire/ like the infant Hercules, grew very fast. His labors were: First, he broke a great bow, that is, a vapor arch. Second, he broke a great many bows. In fact, he seems to have had quite a fancy for this amusement, as he broke all that there were but one. Third, he wrapped himself in a deerskin, as Hercules did in the skin of the demean lion. This third labor also mentions his arrows, the sun-shafts. Fourth, he killed one Tenna woman, that is, a grizzly, a cloud. Fifth, he killed fifty. Sixth, he killed fifty more. Seventh, he disposed of fifty more, and finally we find that in his next labor, the eighth, he killed all that were left outside of the sweat-house. Ninth, he entered the sweat-house and did his killing inside. Only four Tennas remained alive. Tenth, he showed these how he could jump. Eleventh, he shot three of these creatures with arrows. The fourth Tenna, however, escaped, and from that cloud come all the storms that are in the world in our time. Twelfth, Ilhataina, the thunder, was born. \" Ilhataina began to talk,\" says Curtin, \" and the sweat-house trembled. He shouted ; the whole earth shook. He was thundering.\" 38 Another beautiful allegorical picture represents this boy as trying to break a very ugly old bow whose owner had been killed by Gowila, the terrible and strong lizard. To break this bow Ilhataina took a stone, intending to crush it. The bow flew out of his hand, and the stone fell. One may almost imagine that they hear the sound of the thunder-clap. In the Wintu myths, Walskit, lightning, is the child of Wima Loimis, grizzly-bear, the cloud-maiden and the sun. The Algonquin hero Michabo is also somewhat of a noisy fellow. He slew the shining prince of serpents with a sun- K llid., p. 310. 328 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS dart, and, further, the conqueror then clothed himself with the skin of his foe and drove the rest of the serpents to the south to the land of the lightnings. A like hero-god of the Iroquois destroyed with a thunderbolt the great horned ser- pent. The God of Waters was the Thunder Bird. 39 Innumerable myths are connected with the thought of the waters and a flood. \" The two gods of the universe/' said O-dig-i-ni-ni'-a, the relater of the mythic lore of the Hava- supais (Amerinds of the Southwest), \"are Tochopa and Hokomata. Tochopa he heap good. Hokomata heap han- a-to-op'-o-gi heap bad all same white man's devil. Him Hokomata make big row with Tochopa, and he say he drown the world. \" Tochopa was full of sadness at the news. He had one daughter whom he devotedly loved, and from her he had hoped would descend the whole human race for whom the world had been made. If Hokomata persisted in his wicked determination, she must be saved at all hazard. So, work- ing day and night, he speedily prepared the trunk of a pinion tree by hollowing it out from one end. In this hollow tree he placed food and other necessaries, and also made a lookout window. Then he brought his daughter, and, telling her she must go into this tree and there be sealed up, he took a sad farewell of her, closed up the end of the tree, and then sat down to await the destruction of the world. It was not long before the floods began to descend. Not rain, but cata- racts, rivers, deluges, came, making more noise than a thou- sand Hack-a-tai-as (Colorado Elver) and covering all the earth with water. The pinion log floated, and in safety lay Pu-keh-eh, while the waters surged higher and higher and covered the top of Hue-han-a-patch-a (the San Franciscos), 89 \" These are the same old-world stories elaborated in the struggles of Ormuzd and Ahriman, of Thor and Midgard, of St. George and the Dragon, and a thousand others.\" Brinton, \" The Myths of the New World,\" 3d ed., pp. 139, 140. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 329 Hue-ga-w66l-a (Williams Mountain), and all the other moun- tains of the world. \" But the waters of heaven could not always be pouring down, and soon after they ceased the flood upon the earth found a way to rush into the sea. And as it dashed down it cut through the rocks of the plateaus and made the deep Chic-a-mi-mi (canyon) of the Colorado River (Hack-a-tai-a). Soon all the water was gone. \" Then Pu-keh-eh found her log no longer floating, and she peeped out of the window Tochopa had placed in her boat, and though it was misty and almost dark, she could see in the dim distance the great mountains of the San Francisco range. And near by the canyon of the Little Colorado, and to the north was the Hack-a-tai-a, and to the west was the canyon of the Havasu. \" The flood had lasted so long that she had grown to be a woman, and, seeing the water gone, she came out and began to make pottery and baskets, as her father long ago had taught her. But she was a woman. And what is a woman without a child in her arms or nursing at her breasts ? How she longed to be a mother ! But where was a father for her child ? Alas ! there was no man in the whole universe ! \" Day after day longings for maternity filled her heart, until one morning glorious happy morning for Pu-keh-eh and the Havasu race the darkness began to disappear, and in the far-away east a soft and new brightness appeared. It was the triumphant Sun coming to conquer the long night and bring light into the world. Nearer and nearer he came, and at last, as he peeped over the far-away mesa summits, Pu-keh-eh arose and thanked Tochopa, for here, at last, was a father for her child. She conceived, and in the fulness of time bore a son, whom she delighted in and called In-ya'-a the son of the Sun.\" 40 40 George Wharton James, \"The Indians of the Painted Desert Region,\" pp. 209-211. 330 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Here is another story, told by Shaman of the Havasupais. Note the points of similarity and also the differences. \" In the days of long ago a man and a woman (Hokomata and Pukeheh Panowa) lived here on the earth. By and by a son was born to them, whom they named Tochopa. As he grew up to manhood Pukeheh Panowa fell in love with him and wished to marry him, but he instinctively shrank from such incestuous intercourse. The woman grew angry as he repelled her, and she made a number of frogs, which brought large volumes of water. Soon all the country began to be flooded with water, and Hokomata found out what was the matter. He took Tochopa and a girl and placed them in the trunk of a pinion tree, sealed it up, and set them afloat on the waters. He stored the tree with corn, peaches, pumpkins, and other food, so they would not be hungry, and for many long days the tree floated hither and thither on the face of the waters. Soon the waters began to subside, and the tree grounded near to where the Little Colorado now is. When Tochopa found the tree was no longer floating he knocked on the side, and Hokomata heard him and came and let him out. As he stepped on the ground he saw Huehanapatcha (the San Francisco Mountains), Huegadawiza (Eed Butte), Huegawodla (Williams Mountains), and he said: \"I know these mountains. This is not far from my country.\" And the water ran down the Hack-a-tha-eh-la ('the salty stream,' or the Little Colorado) and made Hack-a-tai-a (the Grand Canyon of the Colorado).\" 41 The Wallapais (Haulapais) of Arizona have the follow- ing Origin Legend : u In the days of the long ago, when the world was young, there emerged from Shi-pa-pu two gods, named To-cho-pa and Ho-ko-ma-ta. When these brothers first stood upon the surface of the earth, they found it impossible to move around, IUd., pp. 213-214. MYTHS OF THE AMERINDS 331 as the sky was pressed down close to the ground. They decided that, as they wished to remain upon the earth, they must push the sky up into place. Accordingly, they pushed it up as high as they could with their hands, and then got long sticks and raised it still higher, after which they cut down trees and pushed it up higher still, and then, climbing the mountains, they forced it up to its present position, where it is out of reach of all human kind, and incapable of doing them any injury.\" 42 IUd., p. 188. CHAPTER XXI RUSSIAN MYTHS IN most of these Kussian stories the orignal idea has been greatly obscured by the process of repetition and the course of travel from one region to another. Yet notwith- standing this smoothing off of the rough edges, the nature myths of this people, and especially their folk-tales, are rich in reminiscences of the forgotten lore of the heavens. Take the legend of \" Yelena the Wise \" as a sample. A hero by the name of Ivan was wrecked on an island, which in the long forgotten past was probably located in the canopy-sea. Here he wandered, whether it was long or short, till he found a passage to the underground kingdom, which also in the long forgotten past was probably located in the canopy. In this kingdom the six-headed serpent lived and reigned in a white walled castle. Ivan represented himself to this being as his son, and was accepted as such. \" Some time passed, and the six-headed serpent said : ' My dear son, here are the keys of all the chambers ; go wherever thy desire may lead thee, but do not dare to look into that chamber which is fastened with two locks, one of gold, the other of silver. I will fly around the world, will look at people, and amuse myself. 7 \" He gave, the keys, and flew away out of the underground kingdom to wander through the white world. Ivan Tsarevich remained all alone. He lived a month, a second and a third month, and the year was coming to an end, when it became dreary for him, and he thought to examine the chambers; he walked and walked till he came straight in front of the forbidden chamber. The good youth could not restrain 332 RUSSIAN MYTHS 333 himself ; he took out the keys, opened both locks, the gold and the silver, opened the oaken door. \" In that chamber were sitting two maidens riveted in chains: one was Tsarevna Yelena the Wise, and the other her maid. The Tsarevna had golden wings, and her maid silver wings. Said Yelena the Wise : ' Hail, good hero ! Do us a service not great : give us each a glass of spring water to drink/ \" Ivan, looking at her unspeakable beauty, forgot all about the serpent, pitied the poor prisoners, poured out two glasses of spring water, and gave them to the beautiful women. They drank, shook themselves ; the iron rings were broken, and the heavy chains fell. The beautiful women clapped their wings and flew through the open window ; then only did Ivan come to his mind. He shut the empty chamber, came out on the porch, sat on the step, hung his stormy head below his mighty shoulders, and grew powerfully, powerfully sad. How was he to give answer ? Suddenly the wind began to whistle, a mighty storm rose up, the six-headed serpent flew home. \" i Hail, my dear son ! ' \" Ivan answered not a word. \" ' Why art thou silent ; or has something happened ? ' \" ' Evil, father, I did not obey thy command. I looked into that chamber where two maidens were -sitting riveted in chains ; I gave them spring water to drink, they drank, shook themselves, clapped their wings, and flew out through the open window.' \" The serpent was terribly enraged ; he began to abuse and curse in every fashion. Then he took an iron rod, heated it red hot, and gave Ivan three blows on the back. ' It is thy luck,' said he, ' that thou art my son ; if thou wert not, I should eat thee alive.' \" 1 1 Jeremiah Curtin, \"Myths and Folk Tales of the Russians, etc./ pp. 220-221. 334 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Ivan then asked the serpent's permission to go in search of Yelena the Wise, whom he wished to marry. He was allowed to go, but learned that whoever would marry her must hide three times, and if found each time, he would then have his stormy head cut off. He accepted the conditions, and the first time he mounted on a blue-winged eagle's back above the third range of clouds which language is very suggestive of the canopy but by the aid of her looking-glass Yelena discovered him. \" Ivan came to the earth, slipped off the eagle, went to the seashore, struck fire, and put it to the blue sea. Suddenly, from wherever he came, a giant pike swam to shore. ' Well, good youth, creep into my mouth ; I '11 hide thee in the bottom of the sea.' He opened his jaws, took in the young man, sank with him in the abyss of the sea, and covered him with sand. \" ' Now,' thought Ivan, ' perhaps it will be all right.' But the point was not there. \" Yelena the Wise barely looked in the mirror, and saw everything at once. ' Stop, cunning fellow ! I see thou hast gone into the giant pike, and thou art sitting now in the abyss of the sea, beneath rolling sands ; it is time to come to shore.' The pike swam to shore, threw out the good youth, and vanished in the sea.\" 2 Ivan now placed himself behind the mirror, which was nothing else than the shining canopy itself. \" A little later Yelena the Wise ran to the chamber, looked and looked in the mirror. She could not see her bridegroom ; the appointed time had passed. She grew angry, and with vexation struck the glass ; it fell into fragments, and before her stood Ivan, the brave youth. \" There was no help for it, she had to yield this time. At the house of Yelena the Wise there was no need of wait- ing to make mead or wine; that day they had a noble feast 3 Ibid., p. 226. RUSSIAN MYTHS 335 and a wedding. They were crowned, and began to live to live on and win wealth.\" 3 There are a great many myths of this character, and closer acquaintance shows that in their primitive form they simply portray Ivan, the sun, conquering the snake, or canopy. Here is another illustrating this point : \" Once there was an old couple who had three sons. Two of them had their wits about them, but the third, Ivan, was a simpleton. K\"ow, in the land in which Ivan lived there was never any day, but always night. This was a snake's doing. Well, Ivan undertook to kill that snake. Then came a third snake with twelve heads. Ivan killed it, and de- stroyed the heads; and immediately there was bright light throughout the whole land. The myth is pushed on, and there is also the monster who devours maidens, called a ' Norka ' ; and Perun takes the work of Indra and Saint George, enters the castle (dark clouds), and rescues her. But the dark power takes a distinctive Russian appearance in the awful figure of Koshchei, the deathless.\" 4 The Russian skazkas describe Perun, the god of light, as sometimes lying for a while veiled in a shroud the fog or floating over dark water in a coffin the cloud. He is the thunder-god, the Thor of the Slavonian tradition. The snake- canopy dies when the sun and moon finally establish them- selves. In the tale of \" Kiss Miklos and the Green Daughter of the Green King,\" a certain kingdom was in unbroken dark- ness, without sun and without moon, by which we know that it was located under the canopy. Three brothers went out to find the missing luminaries. The youngest was Kiss 3 Ibid., p. 227. The Russian title of Afanasyeff's work, from which the above myth and most of those which follow are culled, is \" Naro- diya Russkiya Skazki.\" \" Yelena the Wise \" is found in part vii, p. 304. *L. E. Poor, \"Sanskrit and its Kindred Literatures,\" p. 390. 336 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Miklos, or, as we would say in English, Nicholas Little. This young one was probably one of the least of the new- born little scenes in the vapor-sky. He travelled on a magic six-legged steed which was unquestionably a sun-dog, or halo, for it was said of him that he ate live coals. Nicholas Little carried a sun-sword which when he said to it, \" Cut, my dear sword,\" forthwith cut down whatever he wished. Now, the three brothers moved on their way, beyond the glass mountains, and beyond that, to where were the little short-tailed pig roots (vapor cloud), and farther than that, and still farther, till they came to the silver bridge (upper bright belt). Here Nicholas Little encountered the twelve-headed dragon, conquered him, and gave the liberated moon to one of his brothers to carry. Then they went on to the golden bridge, which was still higher. Here Nicholas Little killed the twenty-four-headed dragon and liberated the sun, which he gave to his other brother to carry. On the way home the two wives of the serpents, and the old woman, their mother, conspired to kill the heroes. The old woman was the canopy. She asks her two daughters-in- law, telling them : \" Just prop up my two eyes with that iron bar, which weighs twelve hundred pounds, so that I may look around.\" The great size of this bar shows us how tenaciously the truth regarding the immensity of the old hag lived on. Her two daughters-in-law then took the twelve-hundred- pound iron bar and opened the old woman's eyes; then she spoke thuswise : ( If that cursed Nicholas Little has killed my two sons, I will turn into a mouth, one jaw of which will be on the earth and the other I will throw to the sky, so as to catch that cursed villain and his two brothers, and grind them as mill-stones grind wheat.' The dragon's wives changed themselves into other objects. The first became a bubbling water, but Nicholas recognized her and killed her; the second became a fruit tree; but Nicholas also recognized her and killed her. RUSSIAN MYTHS 337 Jeremiah Curtin says : \" Now they journeyed and trav- elled through forty-nine kingdoms, till at last Miklos saw from a distance that an unmercifully great mouth, one jaw of which was on earth and the other thrown up to the heavens, was nearing them like the swiftest storm, so that they had barely time left to run into the door of the Lead Friend's house. And a thousandfold was their luck that they got in; for the unmercifully great mouth stood before the threshold of the Lead Friend, so that whoever should go out would fall into it, and be swallowed that minute.\" To make a long story short in the telling, Lead Friend and Nicholas poured eighteen tons of boiling lead into the old witch's mouth and burned out her stomach. But after doing this, Lead-Melting Friend, like Eurystheus in the Hercules myth, kept Nicholas under his power until he should perform the labors connected with bringing the Green Daughter of the Green King to him. The other two sons returned home. Curtin says : \" Then they let out the steed of the bright moon and the steed of the shining sun on the highway of the heavens, but both the moon and the sun shone sadly. For this reason they shone sadly: that he was without merited reward who had really freed them from the dragons, for Kiss Miklos (Nicholas) was now in never-ending slavery to the Lead Friend. \" Once the Lead Friend called Miklos and found this to tell him : ' Well, Miklos, if thou wilt bring me the Green Daughter of the Green King, I will let thee go free, and I will strike from thee the three-hundred-pound ring and the twelve-hundred-pound chain. Therefore, good friend Miklos, I advise thee to start in the morning with the bright shining sun, and bring me my heart's desire.\" After many labors and the use of great magic, Nicholas secured the Green Daughter, but desiring her for himself, they then contrived to find Lead Friend's life, which he did 338 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS not carry in his own person. This they took from him and thus obtained their freedom. The clear sky, the personification of which was our hero, was now freed, so he and his wife immediately started for home. \" Now, the shining sun had shone so sadly, and the bright moon had beamed so sadly, that it could not be more so; but the moment they beheld Miklos and his wife in the chariot of glass and gold, the bright sun shone joyously, and so did the clear moon.\" 5 In the above skazka it is stated that Lead Friend does not carry his life in his own person. Koshchei the Deathless has like immutability. He is merely one of the many incarna- tions of the spirit of the great dark canopy-belt. Sometimes he is described as altogether serpent-like. His life to the ancients seemed to be apart from the manifestation of his being, and therefore from their viewpoint he could not be killed until this hiding-place should be broken into and the true sun should appear. To illustrate that the death of the canopy appeared to be, not in itself, but that it was conquered by Ivan the sun, we give an abridgment and interpretation of the skazka of Koshchei Without-Death as follows: \" Ivan Tsarevich was a precocious infant that would not go to sleep unless rocked by his father the Tsar, who, speak- ing to him, would say : ' Sleep, little son, sleep, and when thou art grown up a man I will get thee Peerless Beauty as bride.' The Tsarevich would then fall asleep and sleep three days and three nights at a time. This happened three times, and then, waking up, he asked his father's blessing, saying: e I am going forth to marry.' The father replied : ' Whither canst thou go ? Thou art but nine days of age in all.' ' Ivan, having been thus cradled and rocked in the canopy, 8 Jeremiah Curtin, \" Myths and Folk Tales of the Russians, Western Slavs, and Magyrs,\" pp. 475-516. Afanasyeff, \" Narodiya Russkiya Skazki,\" part i, p. 1. In the original, \" The Lead Friend.\" RUSSIAN MYTHS 339 was indeed a very active hero. He procured for himself, as all good sun-heroes should, a magic horse, and forthwith sallied out into the white world to find Peerless Beauty as bride. He rode far, far. The day was growing short, night was coming on. A house stood like a town ; each room was a chamber. He tied his horse to a copper ring, went in to a sun-obscuring chamber and spent the night. The next morning he rose early, rode far with distance, the day was shortening. There stood another house like a town, each room a chamber. He tied his horse to a silver ring, went in, spent the night in a sun-obscuring chamber. The third day and night passed in like manner, but at this last cloud mansion 1 he tied his horse to a golden ring. Appar- ently these three rings were three different belts in the vapor cloud homes. Next morning the old grandmother who furnished him the last night's lodging called all the fishes (fish-gods) of the great sea and all the animals of the land (gods-terrestrial) and asked them for information of Peerless Beauty, but the fishes and creatures could give no information. The birds were called and they also gave answer : \" We have not seen her with sight, we have not heard her with hearing.\" They had just spoken when in came the Mogol bird, fell on the ground, and, as the tale says, \" there was no light in the window.\" 6 This great canopy-bird was a light extinguisher and knew all about Peerless Beauty. She took Ivan on her back, and as she flew she fed on the cloud-oxen and vessels of water. In the Norka Skazka (Afanasyeff i, No. 6) a like bird is men- tioned. The text reads, \" Presently there came a bird flying such a big one, that the light was blotted out by it. It had been dark there before, but now it became darker still.\" In the story of Usuinya we have another instance of a great bird. \" The Usuinya Bird is a twelve-headed snake,\" says the text. \" The monster is not so much a bird as a flying dragon.\" He stole the golden apples (stars) from a monarch's garden (the egg-hole of the north), but was killed by Ivan (the sun). Erlenvein No. 41. 340 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS To make a long story short in the telling, he obtained Peerless Beauty, and was returning with her, but, being wearied, he lay down to sleep, and slept exactly nine days and nights. Meanwhile Koshchei Without-Death bore away Peerless Beauty to his own kingdom. It will be noted that the time-periods of the infant sun's slumbers amounts to the same total as this later instance; it is therefore natural to find that when he awoke he had to do his work all over again. The routine of nature repeats itself. He came to the kingdom of the Deathless one, now determined to find out where his death was. He asked Peer- less Beauty to find out. Koshchei fooled her once, fooled her twice, then he said unto her, \" Oh, simple woman, I was joking with thee ! My death is in an egg, the egg is in a duck, and the duck is in a stump floating on the sea.\" When Koshchei went off to war, Peerless Beauty baked cakes for Tvan Tsarevich, and told him where to look for the death of Koshchei. He found it and returned to the canopy-darkened home of the Deathless. Koshchei Without- Death was sitting at the window, cursing. \" ' Oh, Ivan Tsarevich, thou wishest to take Peerless Beauty from me ; and so thou wilt not live.' \" ' Thou didst take her from me thyself,' answered Ivan Tsarevich, took the egg from his bosom, and showed it to Koshchei. ' What is this ? > \" The light grew dim in the eyes of Koshchei ; then he became mild and obedient. Ivan Tsarevich threw the egg from one hand to the other. Koshchei Without-Death stag- gered from corner to corner. This seemed pleasant to the Tsarevich. He threw the egg more quickly from hand to hand, and broke it ; then Koshchei fell and died. \" Ivan Tsarevich attached the horses to his golden car- riage, took whole bags filled with gold and silver, and went to his father.\" 7 7 Cm-tin, \"Myths and Folk-Tales of the Russians, etc.,\" p. 106 ff. Afanasyeff pt. vii, p. 72. RUSSIAN MYTHS 341 It is not a stretch of our imagination that places this skazka in the ranks of the snn myths. Professor A. de Gubernatis sees in the duck the dawn, in the hare (which some of the variants of this story substitute for the log) the moon sacrificed in the morning, and in the egg the sun. 8 This interpretation is in the right direction, but its author lacked the knowledge of the hypothesis under consideration. Ivan, the hidden sun, who rode on the magic-steed, brought into the presence of a darkened world the true sun, the egg, and forthwith Koshchei, the serpent, died. W. E. S. Ealston, of the British Museum, says : \" In one of the descriptions of KoshcheTs death, he is said to be killed by a blow on the forehead inflicted by the mysterious egg that last link in the magic chain by which his life is darkly bound. In another version of the same story, but told of a Snake, the fatal blow is struck by a small stone found in the yolk of an egg, which is inside a duck, which is inside a hare, which is on an island (i.e., the fabulous island Buyan). In another variant Koshchei attempts to deceive his fair captive, pretending that his ' death ? resides in a besom, or in a fence, both of which she adorns with gold in token of her love. Then he confesses that his ( death ' really lies in an egg, inside a duck, inside a log which is floating on the sea. Prince Ivan gets hold of the egg and shifts it from one hand to the other. Koshchei rushes wildly from side to side of the room. At last the prince breaks the egg. Koshchei falls on the floor and dies.\" Our author goes on to say : \" This heart-breaking epi- sode occurs in the folk-tales of many lands. It may not be amiss to trace it through some of its forms. In a !N\"orse story a Giant's heart lies in an egg, inside a duck, which swims in a well, in a church, on an island. With this may be com- pared another Norse tale, in which a Haugebasse, or Troll, who has carried off a princess, informs her that he and all his companions will burst asunder when above them passes 8 \" Zoological Mythology,\" i, 269. 342 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS 6 the grain of sand that lies under the ninth tongue in the ninth head ' of a certain dead dragon. The grain of sand is found and brought, and the result is that the whole of the monstrous brood of Trolls or Haugebasser is instantaneously destroyed. In a Transylvanian- Saxon story a Witch's ' life ' is a light which burns in an egg, inside a duck, which swims on a pond, inside a mountain, and she dies when it is put out. In the Bohemian story of ' The Sun-horse ' a Warlock's ' strength ' lies in an egg, which is within a duck, which is within a stag, which is under a tree. A Seer finds the egg and sucks it. Then the Warlock becomes as weak as a child, ' for all his strength had passed into the Seer/ In the Gaelic story of ' The Sea-Maiden/ the ( great beast with three heads,' which haunts the loch cannot be killed until an egg is broken, which is in the mouth of a trout which springs out of a crow, which flies out of a hind, which lives on an island in the middle of the loch. In a Modern Greek tale the life of a dragon or other baleful being comes to an end simultaneously with the lives of three pigeons which are shut up in an all but inaccessible chamber, or inclosed within a wild boar. Closely connected with the Greek tale is the Servian story of the dragon whose ' strength ' (snaga*) lies in a sparrow, which is inside a dove, inside a hare, inside a boar, inside a dragon (a j day a) which is in a lake, near a royal city. The hero of the story fights the dragon of the lake, and after a long stuggle, being invigorated at the crit- ical moment by a kiss which the heroine imprints on his fore- head, he flings it high in the air. When it falls to the ground it breaks in pieces, and out comes the boar. Eventually the hero seizes the sparrow and wrings its neck, but not before he has obtained from it the charm necessary for the recovery of his missing brothers and a number of other victims of the dragon's cruelty.\" 9 \"Russian Fairy Tales and Muscovite Folk Lore,\" chap, ii, Myth- ological. RUSSIAN MYTHS 343 Another tale telling of a rescue is told of how Mirko, the king's son, went forth to battle with the overpowering enemies of his father's friend, the Hero of the Plain ; succoring him, he brought him to his sire in triumph. The tale is so full of the romance of the sky that we give it as follows: To begin with, like Nicholas Little, Mirko also came into possession of a magic mare. When she had eaten the glowing coals of the sun, she became such a golden-haired steed as the Star of the Dawn. On this creature Mirko passed over the copper, silver, and golden bridges of the sky, beyond this they climbed the summitless, high glass mountain and forth- with they crossed that very mountain. The horse stamped, and said, ( Open thy eyes master ! What dost thou see ? ' \" i I see,' said Mirko, ' when I look behind, something dark, as large as a great plate.' \" ' Oh, my master, that is the round of the earth. But what dost thou see before thee ? ' \" ' I see a narrow glass road, rising like a half circle. On both sides of it is emptiness of bottomless depth.' \" ' My dear master, we must pass over that road ; but the passage is so delicate that if one of my feet slip the least bit to one side or the other, there is an end to our lives. But trust thyself to me, and close thy eyes. Hold fast, I will manage.' \" With that she swept on, and in an instant stamped again. i Open thy eyes ! What dost thou see ? ' \" ' I see behind me,' said Mirko, ' a faint light ; in front of me is darkness so dense that when I hold my finger before my eyes I cannot see it.' \" ' Well, we must go through that also ; shut thy eyes and hold firmly.' \" She sped on anew, and again stamped. ' Open thy eyes ! What dost thou see now ? ' \" ' I see,' said Mirko, i the most glorious, light, beautiful, 344 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS snow-covered mountains, and in the midst of them a silken meadow ; in the centre of the silken meadow something dark/ \" ' This silken meadow/ said the steed, ' belongs to the Hero of the Plain; and the dark object in the middle is his tent, woven from black silk. Now close thy eyes or not as may please thee. We shall go there directly/ Mirko spurred the steed, and they were at the tent in a twinkle.\" The Hero of the Plain said : \" ' This great silken meadow which thou seest is every day filled with enemies, and every day I cut them down; but to-day as thou art with me, we shall not hurry. Come, let us eat and drink ; let them crowd.' Then the two went in, ate and drank till the enemy had so increased that they reached almost to the tent. The Hero of the Plain sprang then to his feet and said : ' Up, my comrade, we '11 soon finish.' Both leaped into their saddles and rushed to the centre of the enemy, crying out, ' Sword from the sheath ! ' The swords hewed off the heads of the countless multitude, so there was scarcely room to move for bodies. Twelve of the opposing warriors now flee from the rear, the Hero of the Plain and Mirko pursuing. They come to a glass mountain where there is a nice, level space; he sees them running upon it. He gallops after them; but all at once they are as if the ground had swallowed them. Mirko springs to the place where they disappear, finds a breach and a deep opening with winding steps. His steed rushes into the opening and down the stairs; they are soon in the lower world (lower canopy region). \" Mirko looks around the lower world and sees a shining diamond castle, which serves instead of the sun down there. The twelve fleeing warriors rush towards the castle, he after them, and, ordering his sword out of the sheath, cuts off their heads in a moment. The next instant Mirko stands before the diamond castle. Within, there is such a clatter and pounding that the whole interior trembles and shivers. He dismounts and enters. Inside is an old witch weaving, RUSSIAN MYTHS 345 and the racket is deafening. The building is full of armed men. The infernal old witch weaves them. When she throws her shuttle to the right, two hussars spring out on horseback; when she throws it to the left, two men on foot jump out armed. \" Meanwhile Sword out of the Sheath cuts down the newly made soldiers, but the old witch weaves more. (She is a canopy ever giving birth to new clouds.) ' Well/ thinks Mirko to himself, ' I shall never get out of here, at this rate ;' but he commands the sword, and it cuts the old witch into small pieces (which shows that it was a good sun-shaft). Then he carries the loom into the yard, where there is a pile. He throws everything on the pile and sets fire to it; but when all is burned one of the old witch's ribs springs out, begins to turn round in the dust, and she rises up again entire. * * * \" ' If I leave the old witch alive, she will put up her loom again, and the Hero of the Plain will never be able to free himself from his enemies.' Again he orders his sword to cut the old witch in pieces; he throws the pieces into the fire, where they are consumed, so that she can never rise again. (This scene is identical with the burning heavens at Ragnarok. ) He mounts his sieed and searches the under- ground world, but nowhere does he find a living soul. \" Then he puts spurs to his steed, springs up the circular stairs, and issues forth into the upper world. Straightway he comes down from the glass mountain, and, passing over the silken meadow, returns to the Hero of the Plain, who thought Mirko had left him. But when he saw his friend returning, he went out to meet him with great joy, and took him into the tent, where they feasted together gloriously. And when the prince rose to go, he offered him his silken meadow and all the royal domains; but Mirko answered: 6 My dear elder brother, I have finished thy enemies ; they will never attack thy kingdom again. I have this now to ask, 346 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS that thou come with me to my father the king, who has long been waiting for thee.' * * * \" At that time the old king was sitting at the window of his palace next the rising sun, and lo ! he beholds two horse- men riding towards him. Straightway he takes his field- glass, and sees that it is his trusty old comrade, the Hero of the Plain, together with his son Mirko. He runs out, and from the tower commands that a twelve-year-old ox be killed ; and when Mirko and the Hero arrive, the great feast is ready. He receives them with joy, kisses and embraces them; this time both his eyes are laughing. Then they sat down to the feast, ate and drank with gladness. Meanwhile the Hero of the Plain spoke of Mirko' s doings, and, among other things, said to the old king : ' Well, comrade, thy son Mirko will be a better hero than we were ; he is already a gallant youth. Thou hast cause to rejoice in him.' \" 10 There is no questioning of the fact that this class of skazkas belong to the sun-myths. One of them even bears the evidence in its title. It is called \" The Witch and the Sun's Sister.\" It begins with an account of Ivan fleeing from his witch-sister (another name for Koshchei, the canopy). Of course she followed him. Before proceeding, it may be well to remark that this incident is common to nearly all the sun-myths; thus in the skazka of Koshchei the Deathless, after Ivan had carried away Peerless Beauty, the Deathless one followed them and carried her away as Ivan slept. Again, in the legend of \" The Green Daughter of the Green King \" the daughter herself on the homeward way plays tricks, some of which are as follows : \" The Green Daughter of the Green King beckoned Miklos to her and asked him : ( Hei ! my heart's beautiful love, renowned Kiss Miklos, tell me, on thy true soul, art thou taking me for thyself or for another ? If thou 10 \"Myths and Folk-Tales of the Russians, etc.,\" pp. 434-448. Afanasyeff's collection, pt. i, p. 436. RUSSIAN MYTHS 347 art not taking me for thyself, I will play tricks with thee.' \" ( I am taking thee for myself ; I am taking thee for another/ answered Kiss Miklos. Well, no more was said. Once, when turning and wind- ing, they look in the coach ; it is empty. The beautiful girl is gone. In a moment they stop, search the coach, but find her nowhere. \" ' Here, good friend Far Seer,' said Kiss Miklos, ' look around ! Whither has our beautiful bird flown ? ' \" Far Seer did n't let that be said twice. In the turn of an eye he surveyed the round earth, but he saw not the beau- tiful maiden. \" e She is not on the dry earth/ said Far Seer. \" ' Look into the sea/ said Kiss Miklos. \" Far Seer surveyed the deep sea, and saw her hiding in the belly of a three-pound whale, near the opposite shore of the sea. \" ' Ah, I see where she is ! ' \" ' Where ? ' asked Miklos. \" ' Hidden in the belly of a three-pound whale.' \" ' Here, good friend Great Drinker/ said Miklos, c come hither, and drink up the water of this deep sea ! ' \" Great Drinker was not slow. He lay face under by the sea, and with three draughts drank up all the water (evapo- ration drinking up the vapor-belt). The three-pound whale was lying then in a bay near the opposite shore. \" ' Now, good brother Swift Runner/ said Kiss Miklos, ' step out and bring me that three-pound whale which is lying near the opposite shore.' \" Swift Runner rushed in a moment across the bottom, of the sea, and brought back the three-pound whale. Miklos opened the whale, took out its stomach, cut it carefully, and out fell the Green Daughter of the Green King. Then he seated her in the coach, and they drove on.\" This was not the only effort put forth by the Green 348 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS Daughter to escape. They looked into the six-horse canopy coach, and she was not there. Far Seer was called and he discovered her in her own home, \" in the very centre of the garden, hidden on the highest top of an apple-tree, in the middle of a ripe red apple. \" Swift Runner was sent and fetched the apple, or star, containing her. Kiss Miklos seated her in the coach, and they fared farther. 11 But to return from this digression to the skazka of \" The Witch and the Sun's Sister \" : \" Prince Ivan heard a loud noise and looked back. There was his sister chasing him. So he waved his handkerchief, and a deep lake lay behind him. While the witch was swimming across the water, Prince Ivan got a long way ahead. But on she came faster than ever; and now she was close at hand! Vertodub (a cloud-giant) guessed that the Prince was trying to escape from his sister, so he began tearing up oaks and strewing them across the road (heaped up the world-tree). A regular mountain did he pile up! There was no passing by for the witch! So she set to work to clear the way. She gnawed, and gnawed, and at length contrived by hard work to bore her way through ; but by this time Prince Ivan was far ahead. \" On she dashed in pursuit, chased and chased. Just a little more and it would be impossible for him to escape. But Yertogor (another cloud-giant) spied the witch, laid hold of the very highest of all the mountains, pitched it down all of a heap on the road, and flung another mountain right on top of it. While the witch was climbing and clambering, Prince Ivan rode, and found himself a long way ahead. At last the witch got across the mountain, and once more set off in pursuit of her brother. By-and-by she caught sight of him, and exclaimed: \" ' You shan't get away from me this time ! ' And now she is close, now she is just going to catch him! \"Curtin, \"Myths and Folk-Tales, etc.,\" pp. 501-504. RUSSIAN MYTHS 349 \" At that very moment Prince Ivan dashed up to the abode of the Sun's Sister and cried: \" ' Sun, Sun! open the window!' (' Old sun canopy- shiner open a hole! '). \" The Sun's sister opened the window, and the Prince bounded through it, horse and all. \" Then the witch began to ask that her brother might be given up to her for punishment. The Sun's Sister would not listen to her, nor would she give him up. Then the witch said: \" ' Let Prince Ivan be weighed against me, to see which is the heavier. If I am, then I will eat him ; but if he is, then let him kill me.' \" This was done. Prince Ivan was the first to get into one of the scales ; then the witch began to get into the other. But no sooner had she set foot in it than up shot Prince Ivan in the air, and that with such force that he flew right up into the sky, and into the chamber of the Sun's Sister. \" But as for the Witch-Snake, she remained down below on earth.\" 12 The Sun's Sister may be identified with a bright upper cloud-belt, and because she is bright she is the true sister of Ivan the sun. In the dawn the Witch-Snake, or false sister, steps into the lower heavens, which are the mythical pair of scales, and forthwith the sun flies up into his true sister's shining abode. In the Russian skazkas these palaces of the canopy fre- quently contain hidden or forbidden chambers from which sky-scenes are released by the sun-heroes. The Tale of \" Yelena the Wise \" is of this character. Usually the hero and heroine are chased by the parent canopy, which is the captor in the cases above cited. Ralston gives a number of instances of a like nature, from which we select the following : 12 W. R. S. Ralston, \"Russian Fairy Tales,\" chap, ii, Mythological. 350 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS \" The story of Immortal Koshchei is one of frequent occurrence, the different versions maintaining a unity of idea, but varying considerably in detail. In one of them, in which Koshchei's part is played by a Snake, the hero's sisters are carried off by their feathered admirers without his leave being asked an omission for which a full apology is afterwards made. In another, the history of i Fedor Tugarin and Anastasia the Fair/ the hero's three sisters are wooed and won, not by the Falcon, the Eagle, and the Raven, but by the Wind, the Hail, and the Thunder. ^Modern storm heroes supplanted the old canopy warriors.) He himself marries the terrible heroine Anastasia the Fair, in the for- bidden chamber of whose palace he finds a snake hung up by one of the ribs. He gives it a lift and it gets free from its hook and flies away, carrying off Anastasia the Fair. Fedor eventually finds her, escapes with her on a magic foal which he obtains, thanks to the aid of grateful wolves, bees, and crayfish, and destroys the snake by striking it i on the forehead ' with the stone which was destined to be its death. In a third version of the story, the hero finds in the forbidden chamber ' Koshchei the Deathless, in a caldron amid flames, boiling in pitch.' There he has been, he declares, for fifteen years, having been lured there by the beauty of Anastasia the Fair. In a fourth, in which the hero's three sisters marry three beggars, who turn out to be snakes with twenty, thirty, and forty heads apiece, Koshchei is found in the for- bidden chamber, seated on a horse which is chained to a caldron. He begs the hero to unloose the horse, promising, in return, to save him from three deaths.\" 13 It has been shown that Koshchei was the personified canopy-belt. In one skazka, he is even called a snake. Now, when the sun first appeared as a dim light in this blanket, no doubt it was thought to be a part of the same cloud-being, the soul or life as it were of Koshchei the Deathless ; then as the 18 Hid. RUSSIAN MYTHS 351 orb of day came into clearer view it was a horse chained to the caldron of flame and heat. Later developments disclosed the fact that the sun was not a part of the old canopy, and the accepted stories had to be recast with the sun as a separate hero, making war on the decrepit serpent. Ralston says : \" All the monstrous forms which figure in the stories we have just been considering appear to be merely different species of the great serpent family. Such names as Koshchei, Chudo, Yudo, Usuinya, and the like, seem to admit of ex- change at the will of the story-teller with that of Zniei Goruinuich, the many-headed Snake, who in Russian story- land is represented as the type of all that is evil.\" 14 An evil canopy was an evil thing indeed! Another name given to such a canopy or snake was ' Baba Yaga.' One of these canopy mothers ordered a servant to swing the cradle of her infant son. The Baba Yaga's children were horrible creatures, but this maid performed her task faithfully, so the old woman sent her home with a blue coffer filled with money. The bright-colored blue canopy brought the greenhouse conditions along with plenty on the earth beneath. Another servant followed, did badly, and was dis- missed with a red-coffer, out of which issued fire. The good canopy had turned evil. Ragnarok, or the day when the canopy had descended into the atmospheric region and ap- peared bloody red, had arrived. The evil Baba Yagas brought 'on the Ice age. One of these individuals is represented in the skazkas as petrifying her victims, 15 which trait connects her with Medusa. There were three sister Baba Yagas that may be likened to the three 'Gorgons. Yasilissa, or \" Golden Tress,\" was visiting one of these creatures, and it appears that she wanted to grow wise. To 14 ibid. 15 KoshcheTs name is said to be derived from ' host,' a bone, whence comes a verb signifying to become ossified, petrified, or frozen. Ibid. 352 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS grow wise one must ask questions. \" Ask away,\" the Baba Yaga said ; \" ' only it is n't every question that brings good. Get much to know, and old soon you '11 grow/ \" ' I only want to ask you, granny, about something I saw. As I was coming here, I was passed by one riding on a white horse; he was white himself, and dressed in white. Who was he ? ' \" ( That was my bright Day ! ' answered the Baba Yaga. \" ' Afterwards there passed me another rider, on a red horse ; red himself, and all in red clothes. Who was he ? ' \" e That was my red Sun ! ? answered the Baba Yaga. \" e And who may be the black rider, granny, who passed by me just at your gate ? ' \" ' That was my dark Night ; they are all trusty servants of mine.\" 16 The following incident connected with a Baba Yaga occurs in the story of Mara-Morenna. Prince Ivan, the sun, went to one of the old women to ask for a heroic steed. This seems natural, for if we put the question ourselves, where else could the sun go to in order to procure a vapor-arc or shell for his steed ? The canopy-vapor, or Baba Yaga, alone could supply them. Ivan had to pass over this world-roof each day; it follows that he could get such a steed as he required only from her. She set him the task of watching her mares for three days, promising him the steed he desired if he brought them back safely to the stable. At the end of the appointed time, though he had performed the task suc- cessfully, a bee told him to steal a certain colt and depart in the night. As the story goes; : \" The Baba Yaga went to sleep. In the dead of the night Prince Ivan stole the sorry colt, saddled it, jumped on its back, and galloped away to the fiery river. When he came to that river he waved the handkerchief three times on the lUd. RUSSIAN MYTHS 353 right hand, and suddenly, springing goodness knows whence, there hung across the river, high in the air, a splendid bridge. The Prince rode across the bridge and waved the handker- chief twice only on the left hand ; there remained across the river a thin ever so thin a bridge ! 1T \" When the Baba Yaga got up in the morning, the sorry colt was not to be seen! Off she set in pursuit. At full speed did she fly in her iron mortar, urging it on with the pestle, sweeping away her traces with the broom. She dashed up to the fiery river, gave a glance, and said, ' A capital bridge ! ' She drove on the bridge, but had got only half- way when the bridge broke in two, and the Baba Yaga went flop into the river. There truly did she meet with a cruel death ! \" 18 The appearance of the sun brought about the cruel death of the canopy. Heaven's bridge fell under her. Of the general character of the Russian snake, Ralston says : \" His outline, like that of the cloud with which he is so frequently associated, and which he is often supposed to typify, is seldom well-defined. \"Now in one form and now in another, he glides a shifting shape, of which it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory view. * * * \"But in most cases he is a serpent which in outward appearance seems to differ from other ophidians only in being winged and polycephalous, the number of his heads gen- erally varying from three to twelve. * * * \" In one story he appears to have stolen, or in some way concealed, the daylight ; in another the bright moon and the many stars come forth from within him after his death.\" 19 One of the skazkas embracing some of the above concep- tions is as follows. It is entitled e Ivan Popyalof .' \" Now, in the land in which Ivan lived there was never \"Irradiation made the annular bridge appear larger as the sun rode over it, just as the filament in the incandescent electric light seems to grow in size when the current is passing. 23 354 THE ZONAL-BELT HYPOTHESIS any day, but always night. This was a Snake's doing. Well, Ivan undertook to kill that Snake, so he said to his father, ' Father make me a mace five poods in weight.' And when he had got the mace he went out into the field and flung it straight up in the air, and then he went home. The next day he went out into the fields to the spot from which he had flung the mace on high, and stood there with his head thrown back. So when the mace fell down again it hit him on the forehead. And the mace broke in two. \" Ivan went home and said to his father, ' Father, make me another mace, a ten-pood one.' And when he had got it he went out into the fields and flung it aloft. And the mace went flying through the air for three days and three nights. On the fourth day Ivan went out to the same spot, and when the mace came tumbling down he put his knee in the way, and the mace broke over it into three pieces. \" Ivan went home and told his father to make him a third mace, one of fifteen poods weight. And when he had got it, he went out into the fields and flung it aloft. And the mace was up in the air six days. On the seventh Ivan went to the same spot as before. Down fell the mace, and when it struck Ivan's forehead, the forehead bowed under it. Thereupon he said, ' This mace will do for the Snake.' 20 * * * \" Presently there rode up a Snake with three heads. His steed stumbled, his hound howled, his falcon clamored. Then cried the Snake: \" ' Wherefore hast thou stumbled, O Steed ? hast thou howled, O Hound ? hast thou clamored, O Falcon ? ' \" ' How can I but stumble,' replied the Steed, ' when under the boarding sits Ivan Popyalof ? ' \" Then said the Snake, c Come forth, Ivanushka ! Let us try our strength together.' Ivan came forth, and they 20 This is the same weapon as the magic cudgel found in so many of the Slavonic folk-tales. It is a kind of degraded form of the myths which tell of the hammer of Thor and the lance of Indra. RUSSIAN MYTHS 355 began to fight. And Ivan killed the Snake, and then sat down again beneath the boarding. \" Presently there came another Snake, a six-headed one, and him, too, Ivan killed. And then there came a third, which had twelve heads. Well, Ivan began to fight with him, and lopped off nine of his heads. The Snake had no strength left in him. Just then a raven came flying by, and it croaked : \"\n"}, {"score": 571.6105, "uuid": "0e0a822c-62ba-50bd-875c-c312d38e1a58", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0906wb-31-28312", "target_hostname": "www.americanwx.com", "target_uri": "http://www.americanwx.com/bb/index.php/topic/32285-is-the-mild-winter-this-year-a-sign-of-global-warming/", "page_rank": 1.3234986e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Is</em> <em>the</em> mild winter this year a sign of Global Warming?", "snippet": "Perhaps <em>the</em> <em>coldest</em> temp <em>ever</em> <em>recorded</em> in <em>the</em> United states just occured <em>the</em> other day. <em>The</em> thermometer broke at -79 <em>and</em> <em>the</em> record <em>is</em> -80. <em>The</em> temp was crashing before <em>the</em> gauge went down.

It was close to me, and it is the centerpiece of a NOAA training manual on how to site weather stations to avoid UHI effects.\nCASE 2: NOAA shows their own measurements that mesh well with mine:\nTo back that up, the NOAA National Weather Service includes the UHI factor in one of it\u2019s training course ( NOAA Professional Competency Unit 6 ) using Reno, NV.\nIn the PCU6 they were also kind enough to provide a photo essay of their own as well as a graph. You can click the aerial photo to get a Google Earth interactive view of the area. The ASOS USHCN station is right between the runways.\nThis is NOAA\u2019s graph showing the changes to the official climate record when they made station moves:\nSource for 24a and 24b: NOAA Internal Training manual, 2004-2007\nOops, moving the station south caused a cooling. Fixed now, all better.\nWhat is striking about this is that here we have NOAA documenting the effects of an \u201curban heat bubble\u201d something that DeSmog Blog says \u201d is dead\u201d, plus we have NOAA documenting a USHCN site with known issues, held up as a bad example for training the operational folks, being used in a case study for the new USHCN2 system.\nSo if NOAA trains for UHI placement, I\u2019m comfortable in saying that DesmogBlog claims of UHI being \u201cdead\u201d are pure rubbish. But let\u2019s not stop there.\nCASE 3: From an embattled scientist.\nA paper in JGR that slipped in 2007 without much notice (but known now thanks to Warwick Hughes ) is one from Phil Jones, the \u201cformer\u201d director of the Hadley Climate Center in the UK. The paper is titled: Urbanization effects in large-scale temperature records, with an emphasis on China\nIn it, Jones identifies an urban warming signal in China of 0.1 degrees C per decade.\u00a0 Or, if you prefer, 1 degree C per century. Not negligible by any means. Here is the abstract:\nGlobal surface temperature trends, based on land and marine data, show warming of about 0.8\u00b0C over the last 100 years. This rate of warming is sometimes questioned because of the existence of well-known Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). We show examples of the UHIs at London and Vienna, where city center sites are warmer than surrounding rural locations. Both of these UHIs however do not contribute to warming trends over the 20th century because the influences of the cities on surface temperatures have not changed over this time. In the main part of the paper, for China, we compare a new homogenized station data set with gridded temperature products and attempt to assess possible urban influences using sea surface temperature (SST) data sets for the area east of the Chinese mainland. We show that all the land-based data sets for China agree exceptionally well and that their residual warming compared to the SST series since 1951 is relatively small compared to the large-scale warming. Urban-related warming over China is shown to be about 0.1\u00b0C decade\u22121 over the period 1951\u20132004, with true climatic warming accounting for 0.81\u00b0C over this period.\nEven though Jones tries to minimize the UHI effect elsewhere, saying the UHI trends don\u2019t contribute to warming in London and Vienna, what is notable about the paper is that Jones has been minimizing the UHI issues for years and now does an about face on China.\nJones may have tried to hide CRU data, but he\u2019s right about China.\nCASE 4: From \u201cThe Dog ate My Data\u201d who writes:\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) blames Melbourne\u2019s equal warmest overnight temperature of 30.6 degrees, on January 12 on the heat island effect. The previous time the city was that hot overnight was February 1, 1902.\nThe Age newspaper cites a meteorologist at the bureau, Harvey Stern,\nMelbourne recorded its equal warmest overnight temperature, 30.6 degrees, on January 12. The previous time the city was that hot overnight was February 1, 1902.\nA meteorologist at the bureau, Harvey Stern, said that Melbourne suffered from a heat island effect, in which a city is warmer than the surrounding countryside.\nThis was the case especially at night, because of heat stored in bricks and concrete and trapped between close-packed buildings.\nI am stunned if that is correct firstly because BOM isn\u2019t blaming Global Warming and secondly that the urban heat island effect directly receives the blame. With faults in the 2007 IPCC\u2019s AR4 now pouring out I guess it is not suprising that attributions of weather events are now, shall we say, possibly becoming more circumspect.\nCASE 5: Heatzilla stomps Tokyo\nFrom the website \u201c science of doom \u201d who writes:\nNew Research from Japan\nDetection of urban warming in recent temperature trends in Japan by Fumiaki Fujibe was published in the International Journal of Climatology (2009). It is a very interesting paper which I\u2019ll comment on in this post.\nThe abstract reads:\nThe contribution of urban effects on recent temperature trends in Japan was analysed using data at 561 stations for 27 years (March 1979\u2013February 2006). Stations were categorized according to the population density of surrounding few kilometres. There is a warming trend of 0.3\u20130.4 \u00b0C/decade even for stations with low population density (<100 people per square kilometre), indicating that the recent temperature increase is largely contributed by background climatic change. On the other hand, anomalous warming trend is detected for stations with larger population density. Even for only weakly populated sites with population density of 100\u2013300/km2, there is an anomalous trend of 0.03\u20130.05 \u00b0C/decade. This fact suggests that urban warming is detectable not only at large cities but also at slightly urbanized sites in Japan. Copyright, 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.\nWhy the last 27 years?\nThe author first compares the temperature over 100 years as measured in Tokyo in the central business district with that in Hachijo Island, 300km south.\nTokyo \u2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.1\u00b0C rise over 100 years (1906-2006)\nHachijo Island \u2013 \u00a00.6\u00b0C over the same period\nThis certainly indicates a problem, but to do a thorough study over the last 100 years is impossible because most temperature stations with a long history are in urban areas.\nHowever, at the end of the 1970\u2019s, the\u00a0Automated Meteorological\u00a0Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) was deployed around Japan providing hourly temperature data at 800 stations. The temperature data from these are the basis for the paper. The 27 years coincides with the large temperature rise (see above) of around 0.3-0.4\u00b0C globally.\nAnd the IPCC (2007) summarized the\u00a0northern hemisphere land-based temperature measurements from 1979- 2005 as 0.3\u00b0C per decade.\nHow was Urbanization measured?\nThe degree\u00a0of urbanization around each site was calculated from grid\u00a0data of population and land use, because city populations\u00a0often used as an index of urban size (Oke, 1973; Karl\u00a0et al., 1988; Fujibe, 1995) might not be representative\u00a0of the thermal environment of a site located outside the\u00a0central area of a city.\nWhat were the Results?\nMean temperature anomaly vs population density, Japan\nThe x-axis, D3, is a measure of population density. T\u2019mean is the change in the mean temperature per decade.\nTmean is the average of all of the hourly temperature measurements, it is not the average of Tmax and Tmin.\nNotice the large scatter \u2013 this shows why having a large sample is necessary. However, in spite of that, there is a clear trend which demonstrates the UHI effect.\nThere is large scatter among stations,\u00a0indicating the dominance of local factors\u2019 characteristic to\u00a0each station. Nevertheless, there is a positive correlation\u00a0of 0.455 (Tmean = 0.071 logD3 + 0.262 \u00b0C), which is\u00a0significant at the 1% level, between logD3 and Tmean.\nHere\u2019s the data summarized with T\u2019mean as well as the T\u2019max and T\u2019min values. Note that D3 is population per km2 around the point of temperature measurement, and remember that the temperature values are changes per decade:\nThe effect of UHI demonstrated in various population densities\nNote that, as observed by many researchers in other regions, especially Roger Pielke Sr , the Tmin values are the most problematic \u2013 demonstrating the largest UHI effect. Average temperatures for land-based stations globally are currently calculated from the average of Tmax and Tmin, and in many areas globally it is the Tmin which has shown the largest anomalies. But back to our topic under discussion..\nAnd for those confused about how the Tmean can be lower than the Tmin value in each population category, it is because we are measuring anomalies from decade to decade.\nAnd the graphs showing the temperature anomalies by category (population density):\nDependence of Tmean, Tmax and Tmin on population density for different regions in Japan\nQuantifying the UHI value\nNow the author carries out an interesting step:\nAs an index of net urban trend, the departure of T\u0002 from\u00a0its average for surrounding non-urban stations was used\u00a0on the assumption that regional warming was locally\u00a0uniform.\nThat is, he calculates the temperature deviation in each station in category 3-6 with the locally relevant category 1 and 2 (rural) stations. (There were not enough category 1 stations to do it with just category 1). The calculation takes into account how far away the \u201crural\u201d stations are, so that more weight is given to closer stations.\nEstimate of actual UHI by referencing the closest rural stations \u2013 again categorized by population density\nAnd the relevant table:\nTemperature delta from nearby rural areas vs population density\nConclusion\nHere\u2019s what the author has to say:\nOn the one hand, it indicates the presence of warming trend over 0.3 \u00b0C/decade in Japan, even at non-urban stations. This fact confirms that recent rapid warming at Japanese cities is largely attributable to background temperature rise on the large scale, rather than the development of urban heat\u00a0islands.\n..However, the analysis has also revealed the presence of significant urban anomaly. The anomalous trend for the category 6, with population density over 3000 km\u22122 or urban surface coverage over 50%, is about 0.1 \u00b0C/decade..\n..This value may be small in comparison to the background warming trend in the last few decades, but they can have substantial magnitude when compared with the centennial global trend, which is estimated to be 0.74\u00b0C/century for 1906\u20132005 (IPCC, 2007). It therefore requires careful analysis to avoid urban influences in evaluating long-term temperature changes.\nSo, in this very thorough study, in Japan at least, the temperature rise that has been measured over the last few decades is a solid result. The temperature increase from 1979 \u2013 2006 has been around 0.3\u00b0C/decade\nHowever, in the larger cities the actual measurement will be overstated by 25%.\nAnd in a time of lower temperature rise, the UHI may be swamping the real signal.\nThe degree\u00a0of urbanization around each site was calculated from grid\u00a0data of population and land use, because city populations\u00a0often used as an index of urban size (Oke, 1973; Karl\u00a0et al., 1988; Fujibe, 1995) might not be representative\u00a0of the thermal environment of a site located outside the\u00a0central area of a city.\nCase 6: California Counties by population show a distinct UHI signature.\nMy friend Jim Goodridge, former California State Climatologist identified the statewide UHI signature issues way back in 1996. This graph had a profound effect on me, becuase it was the one that really made an impact on me, switching my views to being skeptical. Yes, I used to be a warmer, but that\u2019s another story.\nGoodridge, J.D. (1996) Comments on \u201cRegional Simulations of Greenhouse Warming including Natural Variability\u201d . Bull, Amer. Meteorological Society 77:1588-1599.\nGoodrich (1996) showed the importance of urbanization to temperatures in his study of California counties in 1996. He found for counties with a million or more population the warming from 1910 to 1995 was 4F, for counties with 100,000 to 1 million it was 1F and for counties with less than 100,000 there was no change (0.1F).\nHe\u2019s been quietly toiling away in his retirement on his computer for the last 15 years or so making all sort of data comparisons. One plot which he shared with me in 2003\u00a0 is a 104 year plot map of California showing station trends after painstakingly hand entering data into an Excel spreadsheet and plotting slopes of the data to produce trend dots.\nHe used every good continuous piece of data he could get his hands on, no adjusted data like the climate modelers use, only raw from Cooperative Observing Stations, CDF stations, Weather Service Office\u2019s and Municipal stations.\nThe results are quite interesting. Here it is:\nI\u2019ll have more interesting revelations from Jim Goodridge soon.\nCase 7: NASA JPL\u2019s climatologist says UHI is an issue\nThis press release from NASA Jet Propulsion Lab says that most of the increase in temperature has to do with ubanization:\n[NASA's JPL Bill] Patzert says global warming due to increasing greenhouse gases is responsible for some of the overall heating observed in Los Angeles and the rest of California. Most of the increase in heat days and length of heat waves, however, is due to a phenomenon called the \u201curban heat island effect.\u201d\nHeat island-induced heat waves are a growing concern for urban and suburban dwellers worldwide. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, studies around the world have shown that this effect makes urban areas from 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 6 degrees Celsius) warmer than their surrounding rural areas.\nPatzert says this effect is steadily warming Southern California, though more modestly than some larger urban areas around the world. \u201cDramatic urbanization has resulted in an extreme makeover for Southern California, with more homes, lawns, shopping centers, traffic, freeways and agriculture, all absorbing and retaining solar radiation, making our megalopolis warmer,\u201d Patzert said.\nCASE 8: You can see it from space. NASA (not the GISS division) measures it. Here\u2019s a report they presented at the last AGU meeting in December 2009. Gee, that curve below looks like Reno, NV, doesn\u2019t it?\nThe urban heat island effect can raise temperatures within cities as much as 5 C higher than the surrounding countryside. New data suggests that the effect is more or less pronounced depending on the type of landscape \u2014 forest or desert \u2014 the city replaced. Credit: NASA\n\u203a Larger image\nNASA researchers studying urban landscapes have found that the intensity of the \u201cheat island\u201d created by a city depends on the ecosystem it replaced and on the regional climate. Urban areas developed in arid and semi-arid regions show far less heating compared with the surrounding countryside than cities built amid forested and temperate climates.\n\u201cThe placement and structure of cities \u2014 and what was there before \u2014 really does matter,\u201d said Marc Imhoff, biologist and remote sensing specialist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \u201cThe amount of the heat differential between the city and the surrounding environment depends on how much of the ground is covered by trees and vegetation. Understanding urban heating will be important for building new cities and retrofitting existing ones.\u201d\nGoddard researchers including Imhoff, Lahouari Bounoua, Ping Zhang, and Robert Wolfe presented their findings on Dec. 16 in San Francisco at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\nSatellite imagery of suburban (top) and urban Atlanta shows the differences in daytime heating, as caused by the urban heat island effect.

Anybody with an automobile dashboard thermometer who drives a commute from country to city can easily measure UHI, and you don\u2019t have to be a climate scientist to prove it to yourself.\nUPDATE: For a primer on how UHI is not dealt with by NOAA and CRU, have a look at this Climate Audit post:\n"}, {"score": 562.36523, "uuid": "1530b137-5d16-501c-a2e0-b45dde41d595", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0704wb-92-06386", "target_hostname": "wattsupwiththat.com", "target_uri": "http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/04/25/predictions-of-global-mean-temperatures-ipcc-projections/", "page_rank": 1.2439862e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Predictions Of Global Mean <em>Temperatures</em> &amp; IPCC Projections | Watts Up With", "snippet": "<em>And</em> all this just as <em>the</em> US <em>is</em> about ready to get serious <em>on</em> <em>the</em> issue.

In addition to the verification shown in Table 2, Figure 3 shows good agreement for the GMTA trends throughout observed temperature records, so the model may be used for prediction. As a result, Figure 3 includes GMTA predictions until 2100, where the year and the corresponding GMTA values are given in parentheses for all the GMTA turning points.\nAs shown in Figure 3, a slight discrepancy exist between observed and model GMTA values at the end of the 1890s when the observed values were significantly warmer than the model pattern, and in the 1950s when the observed values were significantly colder than the model pattern.\nFigure 3. Comparison of observed Global Yearly Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA) with models.\nFrom the model in Figure 3, during the observed temperature record, there were two global warming phases. The first was from 1910 to 1940 with a warming of 0.13+0.64=0.77 deg C in 30 years. The second was from 1970 to 2000 with a warming of 0.48+0.29=0.77 deg C in 30 years. Note that both warming phases have an identical increase in GMTA of 0.77 deg C in 30 years, which gives an average warming rate of (0.77/30)*10=0.26 deg C per decade.\nFrom the model in Figure 3, during the observed temperature record, there were two global cooling phases. The first was from 1880 to 1910 with a cooling of 0.64-0.22=0.42 deg C in 30 years. The second was from 1940 to 1970 with a cooling of 0.13+0.29=0.42 deg C in 30 years. Note that both cooling phases have an identical decrease in GMTA of 0.42 deg C in 30 years, which gives an average cooling rate of (0.42/30)*10=0.14 deg C per decade.\nThe above results for the normal ranges of GMTA determined from the model can also be calculated using simple geometry in Figure 2. In this figure, almost all observed GMTA values are enveloped by the two parallel lines that are 0.6 deg C apart. Therefore, as a first approximation, the normal range of GMTA is 0.6 deg C. From Figure 2, the period for a global warming or cooling phase is about 30 years. Therefore, as a first approximation, the normal rate of global warming or cooling is (0.6/30)*10=0.2 deg C per decade.\nThe above approximation of 0.6 deg C for the normal range of GMTA should be refined by including the effect of the linear warming anomaly given by Equation 1 of 0.006 deg C per year, which is the slope of the two envelope parallel lines in Figure 2. As the oscillating anomaly changes by 0.6 deg C in 30 years between its turning points, the linear anomaly increases by 0.006*30=0.18 deg C. Due to this persistent warming, instead of the GMTA increasing or decreasing by the same 0.6 deg C, it increases by 0.6+0.18=0.78 deg C during its warming phase, and decreases by 0.6\u20130.18=0.42 deg C during its cooling phase. As a result, the refined normal ranges of GMTA are 0.77 deg C in 30 years during its warming phase, and 0.42 deg C in 30 years during its cooling phase. These results for the normal ranges of GMTA obtained using simple geometry in Figure 2 agree with those obtained from the model in Figure 3.\nCorrelation of Model and Observed Global Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA)\nIn Table 2, data points for only five years were used to verify the validity of Equation 3 to model the observed data. However, it is important to verify how well the observed GMTA is modeled for any year.\nFigure 4. Correlation between model and observed GMTA values. The model GMTA values are from Equation 3, and the observed GMTA values are from the Climate Research Unit shown in Figure 2.\nHow well the observed data is modeled can be established from a scatter plot of the observed and model GMTA values as shown in Figure 4. For example, for year 1998, the observed GMTA was 0.53 deg C and the model GMTA is 0.47 deg C. In Figure 4, for year 1998, the pair (0.47,0.53) is plotted as a dot. In a similar manner, all the paired data for model and observed GMTA values for years from 1880 to 2009 are plotted as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4 shows a strong linear relationship (correlation coefficient, r=0.88) between the model and observed GMTA. With high correlation coefficient of 0.88, Figure 4 shows the important result that the observed GMTA can be modeled by a combination of a linear and sinusoidal pattern given by Equation 3. The positive slope of the trend line indicates a positive relationship between model and observed GMTA. That is, global cooling from the model indicates observed global cooling, and global warming from the model indicates observed global warming.\nGlobal Mean Temperature Prediction Calculations\nThe following patterns may be inferred from the graph of the Global Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA) model shown in Figure 3 for the data from the Climate Research Unit of the Hadley Center [2]:\nYear 1880 was the start of a cooling phase and had a GMTA of \u20130.22 deg C.\nDuring the global cooling phase, the GMTA decreases by 0.42 deg C in 30 years.\nGlobal cooling and warming phases alternate with each other.\nDuring the global warming phase, the GMTA increases by 0.77 deg C in 30 years.\nThe patterns in the list above are sufficient to estimate the GMTA values at all of its turning points since 1880.\nFor example, as year 1880 with GMTA of \u20130.22 deg C was the start of a cooling phase of 0.42 deg C in 30 years, the next GMTA turning point was near 1880+30=1910 with GMTA of \u20130.22\u20130.42=-0.64 deg C. This GMTA value for 1910 is shown as (1910,-0.64) in Figure 3.\nAs year 1910 with GMTA of \u20130.64 deg C was the end of a global cooling phase, it is also the start of a global warming phase of 0.77 deg C in 30 years. As a result, the next GMTA turning point was near 1910+30=1940 with GMTA of 0.77\u20130.64=0.13 deg C. This GMTA value for 1940 is shown as (1940,0.13) in Figure 3.\nAs year 1940 with GMTA of 0.13 deg C was the end of a global warming phase, it is also the start of a global cooling phase of 0.42 deg C in 30 years. As a result, the next GMTA turning point was near 1940+30=1970 with GMTA of 0.13\u20130.42=-0.29 deg C. This GMTA value for 1970 is shown as (1970,-0.29) in Figure 3.\nAs year 1970 with GMTA of -0.29 deg C was the end of a global cooling phase, it is also the start of a global warming phase of 0.77 deg C in 30 years. As a result, the next GMTA turning point was near 1970+30=2000 with GMTA of 0.77\u20130.29=0.48 deg C. This GMTA value for 2000 is shown as (2000,0.48) in Figure 3.\nAs the GMTA values calculated above using the global temperature patterns listed at the beginning of this section give good approximation of observed GMTA values at all GMTA turning points (1880, 1910, 1940, 1970 & 2000), it is reasonable to assume that the patterns may also be used for prediction.\nAs a result, as year 2000 with GMTA of 0.48 deg C was the end of a global warming phase, it is also the start of a global cooling phase of 0.42 deg C in 30 years. As a result, the next GMTA turning point will be near 2000+30=2030 with GMTA of 0.48\u20130.42=0.06 deg C. This GMTA value for 2030 is shown as (2030,0.06) in Figure 3.\nIn a similar manner, the GMTA values for the remaining GMTA turning points for this century can be calculated, and the results are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 shows a very interesting result that for the 20th century, the global warming from 1910 to 2000 was 0.48+0.64=1.12 deg C. In contrast, for the 21st century, the change in GMTA from 2000 to 2090 will be only 0.41\u20130.48=-0.07 deg C. This means that there will be little change in the GMTA for the 21st century! Why?\nWhy Does The Same Model Give A Global Warming Of About 1 deg C For The 20th Century But Nearly None For The 21st Century?\nAccording to the data shown in Figure 3, it is true that the global warming of the 20th century was unprecedented. As a result, it is true that the corresponding sea level rise, melting of sea ice or the corresponding climate change in general were unprecedented. However, this was because the century started when the oscillating anomaly was at its minimum near 1910 with GMTA of \u20130.64 deg C and ended when it was at its maximum near 2000 with GMTA of 0.48 deg C, giving a large global warming of 0.48+0.64=1.12 deg C. This large warming was due to the rare events of two global warming phases of 0.77 deg C each but only one cooling phase of 0.44 deg C occurring in the 20th century, giving a global warming of 2*0.77-0.42=1.12 deg C.\nIn contrast to the 20th century, from Figure 3, there will be nearly no change in GMTA in the 21st century. This is because the century started when the oscillating anomaly was at its maximum near 2000 with GMTA of 0.48 deg C and will end when it is at its minimum near 2090 with GMTA of 0.41 deg C, giving a negligible change in GMTA of 0.41-0.48=-0.07 deg C. This negligible change in GMTA is due to the rare events of two global cooling phases of 0.42 deg C each but only one warming phase of 0.77 deg C occurring in the 21st century, giving the negligible change in GMTA of 0.77-2*0.42=-0.07 deg C. Note that this little change in GMTA for the 21st century is identical to that from 1880 to 1970, which makes the global warming from 1970 to 2000 by 0.77 deg C appear to be abnormally high.\nIf the period for a century had been 120 years, we wouldn\u2019t have this conundrum of nearly 1 deg C warming in the 20th century but nearly none in the next!\nOcean Current Cycles\nOne of the most important variables that affect global mean surface temperature is ocean current cycles. The rising of cold water from the bottom of the sea to its surface results in colder global mean surface temperature; weakening of this movement results in warmer global mean surface temperature. Various ocean cycles have been identified. The most relevant to global mean temperature turning points is the 20 to 30 years long ocean cycle called Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) [6]:\nSeveral independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: \u201ccool\u201d PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and again from 1947-1976, while \u201cwarm\u201d PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990\u2032s (Mantua et al. 1997, Minobe 1997).\nThese cool and warm PDO regimes correlate well with the cooling and warming phases of GMTA shown in Figure 3.\nThe model in Figure 3 predicts global cooling until 2030. This result is also supported by shifts in PDO that occurred at the end of the last century, which is expected to result in global cooling until about 2030 [7].\nEffect Of CO2 Emission On Global Mean Temperature\nExamination of Figure 3 shows that the Global Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA) for 1940 of 0.13 deg C is greater than that for 1880 of \u20130.22 deg C. Also, the GMTA for 2000 of 0.48 deg C is greater than that for 1940 of 0.13 deg C. This means that the GMTA value, when the oscillating anomaly is at its maximum, increases in every new cycle. Is this global warming caused by human emission of CO2?\nThe data required to establish the effect of CO2 emission on global mean temperature already exist. The global mean temperature data are available from the Climate Research Unit of the Hadley Centre shown in Figure 3, and the CO2 emission data are available from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre [8]. For the period from 1880 to 1940, the average emission of CO2 was about 0.8 G-ton, and the increase in the GMTA was 0.13+0.22=0.35 deg C. For the period from 1940 to 2000, the average emission of CO2 was about 4 G-ton, but the increase in GMTA was the same 0.48-0.13=0.35 deg C. This means that an increase in CO2 emission by 4/0.8=5-fold has no effect in the increase in the GMTA. This conclusively proves that the effect of 20th century human emission of CO2 on global mean temperature is nil.\nNote that the increase in GMTA of 0.35 deg C from 1880 to 1940 (or from 1940 to 2000) in a 60 year period has a warming rate of 0.35/60=0.0058 deg per year, which is the slope of the linear anomaly given by Equation 1. As a result, the linear anomaly is not affected by CO2 emission. Obviously, as the oscillating anomaly is cyclic, it is not related to the 5-fold increase in human emission of CO2.\nFigure 4, with high correlation coefficient of 0.88, shows the important result that the observed GMTA can be modeled by a combination of a linear and sinusoidal pattern given by Equation 3. This single GMTA pattern that was valid in the period from 1880 to 1940 was also valid in the period from 1940 to 2000 after about 5-fold increase in human emission of CO2. As a result, the effect of human emission of CO2 on GMTA is nil.\nFurther evidence for the non-existent relationship between CO2 and GMTA is IPCC\u2019s projection of a global warming of 0.2 deg C per decade, while the observed GMTA trend was \u201cquite stable since 2000\u201d [5]. The evidence will be \u201cunequivocal\u201d if global cooling by about 0.42 deg C starts soon and continues until about 2030, as shown by the model in Figure 3. The IPCC projection for the GMTA for 2020 is 0.8 deg C, while the prediction from the model for this value is 0.2 deg C, a large discrepancy of 0.6 deg C. If this global cooling is confirmed, it will then be time to bury the theory that CO2, a plant food, causes catastrophic global warming. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have to wait too long for the burial. Less than ten years. It will be cheering news!\nIPCC Projections\nAccording to the IPCC [1], \u201cFor the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2\u00b0C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emission scenario.\u201d\nIPCC explains this projection as shown in Figure 5 where GMTA trend lines were drawn for four periods from 2005 to 1856, 1906, 1956 & 1981. These trend lines give increasing warming rate from a low value of 0.045 deg C per decade for the RED trend line for the first period from 1856 to 2005, to a greater value of 0.074 deg C per decade for the PURPLE trend line for the second period from 1906 to 2005, to a still greater value of 0.128 deg C per decade for the ORANGE trend line for the third period from 1956 to 2005, and to a maximum value of 0.177 deg C per decade for the YELLOW trend line for the fourth period from 1981 to 2005. IPCC then concludes, \u201cNote that for shorter recent periods, the slope is greater, indicating accelerated warming\u201d [9].\nIf this IPCC interpretation is correct, catastrophic global warming is imminent, and it is justified for the world to be griped by fear of global warming. However, is IPCC\u2019s \u201caccelerated warming\u201d conclusion shown in Figure 5 correct?\nWhat the GMTA pattern in Figure 3 shows is that it has cooling and warming phases. As a result, in Figure 5, comparing the warming rate of one period that has only one warming phase with another period that has a combination of warming and cooling phases will obviously show the maximum warming rate for the first period. This is comparing apples to oranges.\nComparing apples to apples is to compare two periods that have the same number of cooling and/or warming phases.\n.\u201d]\nFigure 5. Accelerated global warming according to the IPCC [9\nOne example of comparing apples to apples is to compare one period that has one warming phase with another that also has one warming phase. From Figure 3, two 30-year periods that have only one warming phase are the periods from 1910 to 1940 and from 1970 to 2000. For the period from 1910 to 1940, the increase in GMTA was 0.13+0.64=0.77 deg C, giving a warming rate of (0.77/30)*10=0.26 deg C per decade. Similarly, for the period from 1970 to 2000, the increase in GMTA was 0.48+0.29=0.77 deg C, giving an identical warming rate of 0.26 deg C per decade. Therefore, there is no \u201caccelerated warming\u201d in the period from 1970 to 2000 compared to the period from 1910 to 1940.\nA second example of comparing apples to apples is to compare one period that has one cooling and warming phases with another that also has one cooling and warming phases. From Figure 3, two 60-year periods that have only one cooling and warming phases are the periods from 1880 to 1940 and from 1940 to 2000. For the period from 1880 to 1940, the increase in GMTA was 0.13+0.22=0.35 deg C, giving a warming rate of (0.35/60)*10=0.06 deg C per decade. Similarly, for the period from 1940 to 2000, the increase in GMTA was 0.48-0.13=0.35 deg C, giving an identical warming rate of 0.06 deg C per decade. Therefore, there is no \u201caccelerated warming\u201d in the period from 1940 to 2000 compared to the period from 1880 to 1940.\nFrom the above analysis, IPCC\u2019s conclusion of \u201caccelerated warming\u201d is incorrect, and its graph shown in Figure 5 is an incorrect interpretation of the data.\nBased on observed GMTA pattern shown in Figure 3, a global warming phase lasts for 30 years, and it is followed by global cooling. As a result, the recent global warming phase that started in the 1970s ended in the 2000s as shown by the current GMTA plateau, and global cooling should follow. Therefore, IPCC\u2019s projection for global warming of 0.2 deg C per decade for the next two decades is incorrect. Also, divergence between IPCC projections and observed values for the GMTA has started to be \u201cdiscernible\u201d since 2005 as shown in Figure 3.\nAccording to the Occam\u2019s Razor principle, given a choice between two explanations, choose the simplest one that requires the fewest assumptions. Instead of applying the Occam\u2019s Razor principle by assuming the cause of GMTA turning points to be natural, the IPCC assumed the cause to be man-made [9]:\nFrom about 1940 to 1970 the increasing industrialisation following World War II increased pollution in the Northern Hemisphere, contributing to cooling, and increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases dominate the observed warming after the mid-1970s.\nLike in the 1880s & 1910s, what if the causes of the GMTA turning points in the 1940s and 1970s were also natural?\nFigure 4, with high correlation coefficient of 0.88, shows the important result that the observed GMTA can be modeled by a combination of a linear and sinusoidal pattern given by Equation 3. This single GMTA pattern that was valid in the period from 1880 to 1940 was also valid in the period from 1940 to 2000 after about 5-fold increase in human emission of CO2. As a result, the effect of human emission of CO2 on GMTA is nil. Also, IPCC\u2019s conclusion of \u201caccelerated warming\u201d shown in Figure 5 is incorrect.\nWhat is the cause of the GMTA turning point from warming to plateau in the 2000s? Here is the suggestion by Mike MacCracken [4]:\nI think we have been too readily explaining the slow changes over past decade as a result of variability\u2013that explanation is wearing thin. I would just suggest, as a backup to your prediction, that you also do some checking on the sulfate issue, just so you might have a quantified explanation in case the prediction is wrong.\nAccording to the IPCC and the above suggestion, the 1940 GMTA turning point from global warming to cooling was caused by sulfates, the 1970 GMTA turning point from cooling to warming was caused by carbon dioxide, and the 2000 GMTA turning point from warming to plateau was caused by sulfates. It is interesting to note that sulfate and carbon dioxide gave the globe a 30-year alternate cooling and warming phases from 1940 to 2000. This is just absurd.\nInstead of saying, \u201cBe awkward if we went through a early 1940s type swing!\u201d in private, but global warming \u201cis accelerating at a much faster pace\u201d in public, please release the world from the fear of climate catastrophe from use of fossil fuels, as this catastrophe is not supported by your own data. It is extremely callous not to do so.\nIs the theory that \u201chuman emission of CO2 causes catastrophic global warming\u201d one of the greatest blunders or something worse of \u201cscience\u201d? We will find the unambiguous answer within the next ten years. Hope they don\u2019t succeed in calling the plant food a pollutant and tax us before then.\nThis document is also available as a PDF file, link below:\nFor any criticism, please leave a comment below, or contact me at orssengo@lycos.com\nGirma J Orssengo\nBachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering, University of Calicut, Calicut, India\nMaster of Applied Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada\nDoctor of Philosophy, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia\nREFERENCES\n[1] IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007\n\u201ca warming of about 0.2\u00b0C per decade is projected\u201d\n"}, {"score": 562.5128, "uuid": "574b74b2-0e98-5adb-a633-6110a9d8f7ad", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401wb-31-26879", "target_hostname": "scienceblogs.com", "target_uri": "http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2012/01/two_incontrovertible_things_an.php", "page_rank": 1.2785415e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Two incontrovertible things: Anthropogenic Global Warming <em>is</em> Real, <em>and</em>", "snippet": "<em>What</em> can be predicted, within <em>ever</em> narrower error margins, <em>is</em> <em>the</em> climate of that year, things like <em>the</em> average <em>temperature</em> <em>and</em> <em>the</em> average precipitation of a day in that year in an area of, I don&#x27;t know, 200 x 200 km or more.", "explanation": null, "document": "C.

The crux of the letter can be found in the following excerpt:\n(i) The planet is warming due to increased concentrations of heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere. A snowy winter in Washington does not alter this fact.\n(ii) Most of the increase in the concentration of these gases over the last century is due to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.\n(iii) Natural causes always play a role in changing Earth's climate, but are now being overwhelmed by human-induced changes.\n(iv) Warming the planet will cause many other climatic patterns to change at speeds unprecedented in modern times, including increasing rates of sea-level rise and alterations in the hydrologic cycle. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide are making the oceans more acidic.\n(v) The combination of these complex climate changes threatens coastal communities and cities, our food and water supplies, marine and freshwater ecosystems, forests, high mountain environments, and far more.\n(\"Climate change and the Integrety of Science in Science Magazine, 7 May, 2010 328:689-691, downloaded January 27th, 2012.)\nPeter Gleick has written a commentary for Forbes that outlines the flaws in the WSJ piece: Remarkable Editorial Bias on Climate Science at the Wall Street Journal .

But as syndicated columnist Georgie Ann Geyer points out, this man has already taken steps that may very well cause your premature death and the premature deaths of loved ones. His behavior shows that he has no regard for your life or mine -- for our souls, perhaps, but not for our lives, and especially not for our children's lives.\nGeyer correctly observes that the pope is a threat to everyone on the planet. He is our enemy. Yet we have this very positive image of Pope John Paul II (the most admired world leader with a favorability rating of 88 percent) 262 and an equally positive image of his institution (the most admired political institution in the U.S. with a favorability rating of 89 percent). How can this be? How can our images be so far removed from reality? The fact is, there is a broad array of images retained by Americans that have been distorted by the Vatican to advance its own interests.\nSince I began my study of the Roman Catholic Church, as it relates to population growth control, some 26 years ago, I have been amazed at the intensity of Vatican activity in the U.S. On numerous occasions, I have observed some activity (usually but not always a political activity) that did not seem reasonable. I would be offered explanations which, upon reflection, would not hold water. When I've explored these things, I would often find the Church deeply involved, seeking some gain or other.\nIn the U.S., the Catholic Church is a $200 billion operation, 263 composed of millions of highly organized workers with an intense sense of mission, a long history of political manipulation, and a superb track record of getting their way. Before I began my study, I had a very different idea of what church and religion meant, having been raised as a Methodist. I was completely unprepared for what I found. Many of the tears in America's social fabric are the result of Vatican attempts to advance its power, control, influence, wealth or security -- at the expense of Americans and American institutions. Rarely was there evidence of Vatican involvement in these activities on the surface, but upon probing, the role of the Vatican became evident. Usually it also became evident that considerable effort had been made to mask the fact that the Vatican was a significant actor. But before presenting specific instances of such activities, a question should be considered.\nHOW FAR WILL THE VATICAN GO? - Index\nHow far is the Vatican willing to go to insure its survival? Some readers may be offended, but this is a valid question. In America, we have the freedom of inquiry and we should exercise it or we are sure to lose it. This is one of the most important unknowns Americans now face. If the Vatican will secretly kill the Rockefeller Commission and NSSM 200 initiatives which definitively showed that overpopulation threatens the security-survival of every American, what will it not do? Will it manipulate the initiation of U.S. warfare with other countries to divert attention from the overpopulation problem? Will it prompt a civil war in the U.S., fulfilling the prediction of President Grant, in order to undermine America's capacity to confront the overpopulation problem? Will it promote disintegration of the American social fabric to save the Papacy?\nThus far, the Vatican has had so much success at shutting down all serious efforts to control population growth that draconian actions have not yet been necessary. But what if the NSSM 200 recommendations had been implemented? Most likely, the Vatican would have done whatever it felt necessary to successfully intervene; perhaps, merely conspiring to force the resignation of a president would have been sufficient. Had they not intervened, self-destruction of the Vatican already might have been complete by now.\nTHE PASTORAL PLAN'S BROAD CONSEQUENCES - Index\nFew Americans appreciate how much the bishops' Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities has changed America. Every community has been changed by it. Every person in America is living his/her life differently from what he/she would have had this plan not been implemented. Many of our elected representatives at all levels of government would have been different. Many positive changes in our lives, that probably would have occurred had the Rockefeller Commission and NSSM 200 recommendations been implemented, did not occur.\nFor example, almost surely there would be less crime, the welfare burden would be reduced and the drug problem would be smaller if the recommendations had been implemented. Why? Because family planning education would be much more widespread and integrated naturally into our pattern of family values; contraception would be encouraged; and safe, legal abortion would be much more readily available to all women. Unplanned births, about 50 percent of all U.S. births since 1975, would have been reduced dramatically. The number of poverty stricken adolescents, and men and women in their early twenties, would be much less than it is today.\nAlso, many negative changes in our lives have resulted from the initiatives undertaken by the bishops as a part of their Plan. The costs to us all have been enormous. Throughout the remainder of this chapter, examples of these changes will be offered. My first two books on this topic contain many more. 264\nAs Byrnes concluded in his study, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) and United States Catholic Conference (USCC) have been consumed by the abortion issue and this Plan since they were created 27 years ago. 265 They have committed an enormous amount of energy, organization, direction and resources to the abortion and other population-related issues. This commitment has brought serious consequences throughout our society.\nOne of the more profound accomplishments of this Plan is the takeover of the Republican Party by the Vatican. In a July 28, 1994 Los Angeles Times wire service story, Jack Nelson describes the maneuvers of the Religious Right so that this takeover is all but an accomplished fact. According to Nelson, \"GOP moderates have remained passive on the sidelines, unwilling to fight...\"\nOn September 11, 1995, author, journalist and broadcaster, Bill Moyers, was given the American Jewish Committee Religious Liberty Award. In his acceptance remarks, \"Echoes of the Crusades: The Radical Religious Right's Holy War on American Freedom,\" Moyers gives his assessment of the influence of the Religious Right: \"They control the Republican Party, the House of Representatives and the Senate...\" 265a\nBut who are the Religious Right? The Spring 1994 issue of Conscience, the journal of Catholics For a Free Choice, exploded the myth that the Religious Right is a Protestant movement. It was designed, created and controlled by Catholics in response to the Pastoral Plan. These Catholics recruited opportunistic Protestants to give the appearance that Protestants were the instigators. The leadership is Catholic but the followers are often Protestant. The development of the Religious Right is described in some detail in the two books noted above, published 12 and 10 years ago, respectively. Also discussed is the Vatican takeover of the Republican Party already well underway at the time of their publication.\nEven when the Pastoral Plan was first approved by the bishops, the National Catholic Reporter recognized that the plan would lead to a Vatican controlled political party in the United States and the newspaper went on record with this prediction. 266 Rather than creating its own political party, the Vatican chose to seize control of the Republican Party.\nTHE CHRISTIAN COALITION TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY - Index\nA survey by Campaigns & Elections magazine reported [in 1994] that the Christian Right exercised complete domination of Republican parties in 13 states and considerable control in 18 others. 266a These facts shocked moderate Republicans and Democrats alike. It was no longer possible for the Coalition to keep its stealth campaign hidden.\nAt the Christian Coalition's 1995 \"Road to Victory\" Conference, Pat Robertson revealed his dream when the Coalition was founded in 1991. Writes Joseph L. Conn for Church & State: \"His wish list was far from modest: a conservative majority in both houses of Congress, 30 state governorships in conservative hands and a conservative in the White House, all by 1996, and working control of one of the major political parties by 1994. During his September 8 speech, Robertson gleefully recalled those goals and boasted that his movement is not only on track, it's ahead of schedule on some points....\" 266b\nA Church & State editorial on the Conference reported: \"Pat Robertson triumphantly recounted the great distance the Christian Coalition has traveled in a short amount of time: `I said we would have a significant voice -- actually I said something else, but Ralph [Reed] said I can't say that because we got press -- I said we would have a significant voice in one of the political parties by 1994 and looks like we made that one.' Robertson reminded the audience of the findings of the poll conducted by Campaigns & Elections, which had shocked so many. What did Coalition Executive Director Reed want Robertson to keep under wraps? Five years ago the TV preacher said, `we want...as soon as possible to see a working majority of the Republican Party in the hands of pro-family Christians by 1996.'\" 266c\n\"Throughout the...conference, organizational leaders, activists and political hangers-on made it clear that the Christian Coalition is not just another interest group in American public life. It is a highly partisan religio-political army wielding a disproportionate influence in U.S. politics.\" 266b\nRob Boston writing for Church & State after attending the September 8-9, 1995 \"Road to Victory\" Conference in Washington, D.C.: \"...once again Reed and Robertson are being less than honest. Christian Coalition activists, in fact, have formed a partisan machine that aims to seize control of the Republican Party and place Coalition allies in public office.\" Deception is openly touted: \"At breakout sessions, conference participants were schooled in the art of concealing their ties to the Christian Coalition, in a continuing pattern of `stealth politics.'\" Boston reports, \"Speaker Cathe Halford, training director for the Texas Christian Coalition, declared: `You all know we're in a war, we're in a spiritual war, a war for our culture, however you want to say it....Don't get intimidated that this is a big political machine you're part of. Just try to focus on those people as your neighbors.'\" 266d\nBoston described one session, \"Building a Neighborhood Organization\": \"In fact, the session had little to do with neighborhood activism; it was devoted to explaining how to get at least one Christian Coalition operative in every county precinct and how to compile information on voters, with an eye toward turning out those who are likely to support Christian Coalition candidates on election day.\" 266d This is the heart of the Coalition strategy.\nThe results thus far: According to a report prepared by Americans United and the Interfaith Alliance Foundation, 198 members of the U.S. Congress vote with the Christian Coalition at least 86 percent of the time. At a press conference, Lynn criticized the \"tangled -- and growing -- links between the Christian Coalition and the Republican Party...the Christian Coalition now calls the shots for a major political party.\" 266b\nArthur Jones of the National Catholic Reporter, concludes: \"Robertson and Reed have emerged as a cunningly dynamic duo that understands the weaknesses of the soft underbelly of the U.S. democratic system...\" 266e The weakness, of course, is that a determined minority can identify voters in great numbers who will vote its way if they get to the polls, then by insuring that all vote, it can sway the majority of elections. However, given the enormous Catholic commitment to the Christian Coalition one must wonder who actually discovered this soft underbelly.\nThe implications of this takeover for American politics at the national, state and local levels are enormous, affecting us all. Thousands of politicians at all levels whose positions have opposed the Vatican have been victims of the plan, significantly changing the American political landscape. No politician has benefited more than Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. This fact is documented elsewhere. 267 - [270]\nAs noted earlier, the ultimate objective of the Vatican's political machine is passage of the Human Life Amendment (HLA). As Jack Nelson pointed out, \"the 1992 GOP platform called for a `human life amendment' to the Constitution, outlawing abortion in all circumstances.\" It should be noted that the HLA need not be enforced to meet the needs of the Vatican. The Vatican requires only that the civil law not conflict with canon law. Then papal authority and civil authority are not pitted against one another. It is only legal abortion that threatens Papal authority.\nWe all have the illusion, carefully crafted by Papal propaganda, that \"lives of the unborn\" and \"morality\" are the issues. This is simply not so. It is survival of the Catholic institution and Papal power that is the issue, not the \"lives of the unborn\" or anything else. All countries in Latin America (all are Catholic) have higher abortion rates than the U.S. Nothing is said by the Church there. If abortion were the real issue, the Church would be speaking out even louder in Latin America than in the U.S. Only in the U.S., where it is legal, is it an important issue for the Church. Of course, few American Protestants are aware of this fact.\nPROTEST DISAPPEARS FROM PROTESTANTS - Index\nAnother major accomplishment of the Pastoral Plan has been its effect on Protestantism in America. The Plan has taken the protest out of the Protestant movement. Until the Pastoral Plan, Protestant denominations had no reservations about protesting or criticizing the Catholic Church. The plan specifically targeted the Protestant Churches to silence them. The bishops succeeded.\nFor example, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) has 14.7 million members and is one of the most powerful Protestant denominations. In the early 1980s, a rift began to develop between fundamentalist and moderate Baptists which did not concern theology as much as it did an authoritarian style of ministry. 271 The Catholic Church has an extremely authoritarian style of ministry. Nothing is left by the Papacy for lay interpretation. At the Baptist Convention's June 1988 meeting in San Antonio, a heated debate took place over an idea profoundly basic to all of Baptist heritage: the freedom of believers to experience God without priests, institutions or creeds acting as intermediaries.\" \"The priesthood of the believer\" is a Protestant doctrine that lay people have direct access to God and need no priestly intermediary to interpret Scripture. This is exactly the opposite of Roman Catholic belief. Baptist Convention delegates voted to invest more authority in pastors. Enraged moderates marched to the Alamo and tore up the resolution in protest. The moderates argued it would make the denomination more Catholic than Baptist. 272\nIn journalist Bill Moyers's public affairs television series, \"God and Politics Part II,\" 273 aired on December 16, 1987, the relationship between the Baptist rift and the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life activities became evident. It is obvious that the victory of the Baptist fundamentalists benefits the Papacy. Any split like that of the Baptists weakens the potential of a Protestant response to challenges to American democracy by the Vatican. However, in this schism, the Vatican benefits in another important way. As the so-called \"conservatives\" gain the upper hand in the SBC, the Baptists then enter the Catholic column on the abortion issue. The Pastoral Plan calls for the recruitment of as many non-Catholics as possible so as to mask the fact that this plan is a Catholic initiative. The bishops can now speak for 14.7 million Baptists on this issue and will wield the additional political power derived from this arrangement.\nDuring Moyers's interview of Paul Pressler, Texas State Appellate Court Judge from Houston who engineered the split in the SBC, the Catholic connection to the Baptist rift became clear. During the interview, Moyers brought to light that Judge Pressler is on the board of directors of the Council on National Policy, along with fanatical Religious Right Catholics -- Richard Viguerie, Phyllis Schlafly and Joseph Coors.\nThe Council on National Policy is one of the many Religious Right organizations created in response to the 1975 Pastoral Plan. By 1979, the Bishops had identified their man to engineer the Baptist rift -- no doubt with a lot of the bishops' help -- Judge Pressler. According to Dr. Daniel Vestal, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Midland, Texas, \"I listened to a tape that Judge Pressler produced, in which he basically recounted the political plan and strategy [for conservative takeover of the SBC] that he set forth back in 1979.\" As Bill Moyers pressed the Judge on his relationship with the Council on National Policy -- which promotes the adoption of Papal policy -- the judge broke off the interview and refused to answer further questions. The Judge had been exposed -- as had been the real actors behind the Baptist rift.\nTHE POPE'S ECUMENICAL MOVEMENT - Index\nThe \"ecumenical movement\" is the pope's most important stratagem to silence Protestant criticism of Vatican interference in American government policy making. How does it work?\nThe extensive fragmentation of the Christian Church has resulted in a heavy burden of guilt for Protestants. The reason? This fragmentation is patently un-Christian. It flies in the face of the religion's fundamental principles, a constant reminder that Christ's followers reject His teachings. Protestants generally believe that unification of all Christians must be achieved if they are to live as true Christians. Guilt motivates them to strive for unity. As one New Orleans Protestant commented, \"If we're going to call ourselves Christians, we have to live like it.\"\nCriticism of one branch of Christianity by another results in disunity. Protestants have been very sensitive to this fact for much of this century. As a result, the ecumenical movement has served to silence any criticism of the Catholic Church by Protestant denominations. The outcome -- complete institutional protection for the Catholic Church -- compliments of well-meaning Protestants.\nThis reality has not been lost on the Vatican. When the Bishops Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities was promulgated, Rome preempted the ecumenical initiative and began making major investments to promote ecumenism. In the last few years, Vatican interests in ecumenism have escalated sharply. \"Evangelicals and Catholics Together,\" issued in March 1994 as an unofficial document, called on these two groups to recognize each other as Christians and to work together on common issues, such as abortion and pornography.\nAdelle M. Banks reports for the Religion News Service: \"The declaration was signed by such prominent evangelical leaders as Prison Fellowship founder Charles Colson and Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright. Catholic signers included Fr. Richard Neuhaus, director of the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York, theologian Michael Novak, a winner of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, Archbishop Francis Stafford of Denver, and Jesuit Fr. Avery Dulles of Fordham University.\"\n\"Introducing the document last March, Neuhaus contended that not since the 16th century have Protestants and Catholics `joined in a declaration so clear in respect to their common faith and common responsibility.' While calling the document unofficial, Neuhaus said he had `been in contact with appropriate parties at the Holy See and they have given their strongest encouragement for the project.\" 273a\nHowever, many key evangelicals, including the Rev. John Ankerberg, R.C. Sproul and the Rev. D. James Kennedy, balked, declaring that the document ought never have been written. 273a Evangelical signers were some of the least influential in the movement while their Catholic counterparts represented the very top of the American hierarchy. This was a major initiative of the Vatican to promote the illusion that ecumenism is advancing in America. But it was only partially successful.\n\"THAT ALL THEY MAY BE ONE\" - Index\nOn May 30, 1995, the pope issued his 12th encyclical, Ut Unum Sint, \"That All They May Be One,\" which is dedicated to the promotion of ecumenism. The message: The pope is eager to bring separated Christians back together. The encyclical was warmly received in the United States by the National Council of Churches, the nation's largest ecumenical organization. Its General Secretary, Rev. Joan B. Campbell responded: \"The encyclical itself is a testament to the very spirit of Christian unity which we seek.\" 273b This is precisely the response the Vatican sought. The encyclical offered the hope that unity was possible, encouraging Protestants to make every effort for its achievement -- including suppressing all criticism of the Catholic Church from Protestant ranks. Encyclicals are major declarations for Catholic clergy and the faithful. However, this one is distinctly different. It is specifically addressed to all Christians 273b for reasons that will become apparent.\nThe National Catholic Register's Jean-Marie Guenois summarizes the encyclical. She quotes the pope: \"Could not the real but imperfect communion existing between us persuade Church leaders and their theologians to engage with me in a patient and fraternal dialogue on this subject, a dialogue in which, leaving useless controversies behind, we could listen to one another, keeping before us only the will of Christ for His Church and allowing ourselves to be deeply moved by His plea `that they may all be one...so that the world may believe that You have sent Me?'\"\nGuenois continues: \"Ut Unum Sint consists of three chapters, the first on the Roman Catholic Church's commitment to ecumenism, the second on the fruits of dialogue and the third on the way to the future.\" The third chapter \"focuses on the importance of Christian unity for the work of evangelization.\" His message: We should not be wasting our energy attacking each other. We should concentrate our efforts on evangelization. Guenois continues: \"While eager to preserve the Magisterium, he does express a sense of urgency about bringing Christians back together. He states bluntly in the encyclical that division among Christians `impedes the very work of Christ.'...The very fact of calling oneself a Christian means desiring to be one with others of the same name, the Pope writes: `To believe in Christ means to desire unity.'\" 273c\nThe pope goes much further. In the encyclical's point #40, the pope writes: \"Relations between Christians are not aimed merely at mutual knowledge, common prayer, and dialogue. They presuppose and from now on call for every possible form of practical cooperation at all levels: pastoral, cultural, and social...Moreover, ecumenical cooperation is a true school of ecumenism, a dynamic road to unity. Unity of action leads to the full unity of faith...In the eyes of the world, cooperation among Christians becomes a form of common witness and a means of evangelization which benefits all involved.\" 273d\nRecalling that the pope prepared this encyclical for all Christians, his intent can only be described as \"thinly veiled.\" He calls not only for Protestants to be silent about Vatican political manipulations in America so they can be the good Christians that God wants them to be, but also to cooperate with the Catholic Church in accomplishing its political agenda.\nNo Protestant leader protested the encyclical, though its intentions must have been clear to many. It received no negative press in the United States whatsoever. The pope's strategy is working. (It should be noted that in this encyclical, just as in Evangelium Vitae, the pope glorifies martyrdom. The message: the most wonderful thing one can do with one's life is to give it up in the defense of the Holy Mother Church: \"This communion is already perfect in what we consider the highest point of the life of grace, `martyria' unto death, the truest communion possible with Christ...\" Why all the emphasis on martyrdom?) 273d\nAn example of changed attitudes appears on the front page of the August 6, 1995 edition of the National Catholic Register in an article: \"Catholic-Baptist ties show signs of new life: Southern Baptists and Catholics show signs of rapprochement.\" At the 1995 Southern Baptist Convention, Father Frank Ruff, a Catholic priest who attended his first Southern Baptist Convention in 1967, was asked to speak. It was a ground-breaking occasion. As a field representative for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Ecumenism and Interreligious Affairs, his request to address the previous year's convention had been politely turned down. 273e\nEcumenism compromises Protestant Americans. The resulting silence has effectively shut down public debate of Vatican interference in American public policy making, gravely jeopardizing the security of all Americans as described in detail in the NSSM 200 report. The Vatican has skillfully advanced the case that an attack on the pope and the Catholic Church is an attack on all Christianity. America is certain to be in deep trouble if Protestant denominations accept this proposition. This would mean that they give the papal interpretation of the defense of Christianity a higher priority than the defense of the United States and its democracy. The outcome would be catastrophic for us all.\nAll of the major Protestant denominations have been affected by the Pastoral Plan and its ecumenical movement in significant ways. The Catholic Church has identified individuals who are anti-abortion, or simply opportunistic, in all of the denominations and has aided these individuals to rise to power within their denominations. The Church has helped create the illusion that the vocal anti-abortion minorities in the various denominations are the spokesmen for the denominations. More important, all criticism of the Catholic Church has been silenced, a vital outcome for the Vatican. The Protestant press which held the Vatican imposition of the Papal agenda in check in this country for 175 years has been neutralized. This arrangement has permitted the Vatican to influence American policy-making to a greater degree than would have been possible otherwise. All of our lives have been significantly affected.\nEROSION OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM - Index\nThe Pastoral Plan has had far-reaching effects on American political institutions, including the executive, legislative and judicial branches, which were specifically identified as targets in the plan. Organized as a result of the plan, there are thousands of Catholics working in national, state and local governments who are responsive to the leadership of the Vatican, some out of religious belief, others simply out of opportunism. Doubtless a majority of the Catholics in our governments are \"Kennedy Catholics.\" However, many are not and serve in the government to advance the interests of the Church. These Catholics have played havoc with American policy-making and the implementation of policy, especially in population growth control related matters. There are also opportunistic non-Catholics in our governments who serve the Vatican for personal gain or are zealots opposed to abortion and contribute to the Vatican effort.\nOur government institutions are intended to protect or advance the interests of Americans. However, we have this highly organized group of Papal loyalists who do everything possible within the institutions that employ them to protect and advance Papal interests, at the expense of American interests. We have patriotic Americans pulling one way in their respective institutions in order to complete the assigned missions of their institutions. Then we have the papists pulling the other way. Some examples from Bernstein's TIME magazine article will be presented later.\nThis constant struggle erodes public confidence and trust in these institutions because most people are unaware of the conflict taking place between papists and patriotic Americans. For 19 years I have personally witnessed this conflict, particularly within institutions that are concerned with family planning, abortion and population growth control, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), the old Department of Health, Education and Welfare (DHEW), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Indeed, the patriots themselves are often not aware that they are involved in a conflict with the Catholic Church, which is represented by one or more of their coworkers. This constant tug-of-war is destroying the effectiveness of these institutions. Very few people recognize this serious problem -- total gridlock on some issues is caused by it.\nSome of the most competent people in America take positions in our government, elected and appointed officials and civil servants alike, only to leave prematurely out of disgust because they find themselves caught up in this tug-of-war, either knowingly or unknowingly, and are unable to efficiently perform the duties they were elected, appointed, or hired to do. Nothing has contributed more to the loss of the best and brightest from public service than the bishops' agenda. Others do not seek public service because of cynicism developed as a result of their own observations of this tug-of-war.\nThe bishops have had no reservations about corrupting these institutions to advance Papal security interests. The intervention described in the Pastoral Plan is massive and far reaching, and efficiency has suffered significantly, affecting us all. From the bishops' perspective, this is a small price to pay to save the Papacy from extinction.\nOne of the best examples is the presidency. When President Clinton was elected, it was clear from routinely reading an array of conservative Catholic periodicals during the course of the following year that conservative Catholics were in a state of shock. They simply could not believe this had happened.\nAlmost immediately, a multitude of stories began to appear in these periodicals which were obviously intended to undermine Clinton's credibility. It soon became evident that conservative Catholics were going to do everything possible to insure that there would be no second term for President Clinton. No concern was shown for potentially lasting damage to the institution of the American presidency itself. Within days of Clinton's election, open warfare was launched against the American presidency.\nAs soon as President Clinton took office, he was hounded by charges that were intended to embarrass him and to serve to weaken his ability to govern effectively. None of these charges, even if they were true, would result in his removal from office. However, they did serve to weaken Clinton's credibility and capability to govern. The charges served to destroy faith in President Clinton and promote cynicism toward him.\nRush Limbaugh appeared out of nowhere. There is a never before witnessed steady attack from every direction -- from the floor of the House, the floor of the Senate, from radio and television talk shows, and newspaper and magazine reporters and columnists. It is an ugly, bitter, brutal, vicious attack such as Americans have seldom if ever seen a sitting president endure before. The conservative Catholic press and conservative Catholic journalists led the charge and have been the most aggressive of all.\nNot surprising, Clinton's disapproval ratings have risen steadily and approximated 50 percent in mid-1994, the highest ever for a sitting president. This assault has been so intense and destructive, it is threatening to undermine the institution of the presidency itself. Cynicism toward our government has grown. Trust in our government has fallen.\nInevitably the President's ability to govern has diminished. If he does not govern well, he will be defeated in the next election. The zealots who want Clinton out of office seem to have no concern about destruction of the institution of the presidency itself. Who are these zealots? Nearly all identify with the Religious Right. Exceptions are ambitious men like Robert Dole who hungers to be the next president. The Religious Right is the design of conservative Catholics who were activated by the Pastoral Plan to advance Papal security-survival interests.\nThe tug-of-war taking place in our governmental institutions remains mostly unseen by the public. When a battle is perceived, such as the highly visible \"Whitewater Affair,\" the underlying motivation is seldom understood. For example, on the August 8, 1994 \"CBS Evening News,\" Dan Rather, in a segment on Whitewater referred to \"the anti-Clinton activists\" and the \"Get Clinton Movement.\" However, no mention was made of the underlying motivation or engine of this movement. He makes no connection with the Religious Right or the Bishops' Pastoral Plan. Though Rather made no attempt to explain what is really driving the anti-Clinton campaign, we are often misled in similar circumstances.\nThese tugs-of-war are occurring also in our private institutions and international organizations -- especially those related to population growth control -- with many of the same negative consequences, undermining organizational commitment and effectiveness.\nDISINFORMATION CREATES WRONG PERCEPTIONS - Index\nWe are all exposed to a flow of information pointing toward the gravely threatening problem of overpopulation. But for over two decades now, surprisingly little concern for the gravity of the problem has been exhibited except by a small group of people in the field, and more recently by a growing number of environmentalists. Since the early 1970s, observers in the field have recognized that there is also a steady flow of disinformation. But they have had little reason to think that this flow is organized in any fashion, or organized and motivated by any particular institution. There are a number of individuals who have excelled in what could be called \"disinformation enrichment.\" Three in particular come to mind: Herman Kahn, Julian Simon and Ben Wattenberg. None of them had gained distinction in the field before suddenly finding themselves at the center of the world stage disputing the work of thousands of scientists who had collectively concluded that the world is in deep trouble because of its unprecedented and uncontrolled population growth.\nHerman Kahn was the first of the three. I remember watching in the 1970s with amazement as he would offer one unsound argument after the other, outrightly ignoring all of the best data available. All along I wondered how it is possible that this man would be given this incredible world platform from which to speak. How could he be taken seriously by the media, when he was scoffed at by the world scientific community? He was almost completely alone. It just did not make sense.\nNext, along came the publication of an article by Julian Simon titled \"Resources, Population, Environment\" in Science in 1980. 274 This article dismissed the idea that the world has a population problem. That this article could appear in the most prestigious scientific journal in America was astounding. This article had nothing to do with science and was based on fiction as much as fact; it was a dishonest attempt to undermine the argument that the world has a population problem. The article was met with disbelief in the scientific community.\nThen, along came Simon with his book, The Ultimate Resource, in 1981. 275 Simon attempts to make the case that it is not possible to have overpopulation; that people are the ultimate resource, and the more the better. Simon is an economist. In this book, Simon intermingles fact with fantasy throughout and misrepresents his material as fact. It was one misrepresentation of reality after the other. Simon was ridiculed by the scientific community. I could not believe that Princeton University Press had published this book. How could Simon have possibly placed this book with this publisher? This was a very serious setback for the population growth control movement. Princeton University had put its prestige behind this intellectually dishonest treatment of the issue of population growth.\nAt this point it became clear to me that there had to be corruption involved in the publication of the Science article and of the book as well. To corrupt these institutions takes a lot of influence. Who has the motivation to corrupt in this way? The institution with the most to gain by publication of these fantasies is the Vatican. Is it capable of such corruption? Certainly, if the stakes are high enough, the history of the institution suggests that they will stop at nothing.\nWith the publication of his article in Science and his book, Simon found himself at the center of the world stage. His articles and his message began to appear everywhere in newspapers and magazines. For example, in June 1981, he published a lengthy article in the Atlantic Monthly magazine, with the theme that nature is boundless. 276 Then in August, 1981, he published another lengthy article in the Atlantic Monthly attempting to make the case: the more people the better. 277a He became a sought after public speaker and appeared often on television and radio.\nNo one had ever done so much to undermine public confidence in the argument advanced by the world's scientists that humanity faces a serious overpopulation problem. Years of scientific education went down the tubes. Of course, we would all like to believe that overpopulation is not a serious problem. Simon's position, the Vatican's position, caught on like wildfire. Simon's work and its apparent widespread acceptance by \"scientists\" caused great confusion which persists today.\nNot enough people realized that Simon's support came almost entirely from the religious right. Simon wrote his book while at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. While he was there, support of his work on his book came from the Heritage Foundation, a Vatican-leaning organization created in line with the bishops' Pastoral Plan.\nSimon was a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation when he headed a 21-member panel of \"scientists\" commissioned by Heritage to re-examine the 1980 Global 2000 report, which President Carter had ordered the State Department and Council on Environmental Quality to prepare, exploring probable changes in the world's population, natural resources and environment through the end of the century. The report, issued after a year-long study, expressed deep concern about continued rapid global population growth and its contribution to the depletion of natural resources and destruction of the environment.\nSimon released the Heritage panel's findings at the 1982 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chalking up another remarkable Vatican accomplishment. In 1984, Simon teamed up with Herman Kahn to place a book with the scientific publisher, Basil Blackwell. 277b This 585-page book was devoted to refuting the Global 2000 report.\nIn March 1985, I received a telling letter from Roger Conner, Executive Director of the American Federation for Immigration Reform. It read:\n\"Maybe the Heritage Foundation has finally gotten rid of Julian Simon after all. He has now started his own group, written up in the enclosed column.\n\"Patrick Burns, our director of research and publications, has called the new group's telephone number and discovered that it is housed in an exclusive girls' finishing school financed by Opus Dei -- an extremely right wing Catholic organization.\n\"I doubt that we've heard the last of Julian.\"\nTo learn of Simon's close ties to the Catholic Church did not surprise me. Let's examine some of his own words. In a September 15, 1986 letter widely distributed to journalists, Simon introduces his new organization, the Committee on Population and Economy: \"Next time you work on a story concerning population, please call Committee on Population and Economy to get our point of view.\" In his \"prospectus\" he states, \"The general purpose of the Committee on Population and Economy is to celebrate human life and its increase. We, plus the appended list of persons who have affiliated with us in some capacity -- intend to promote belief in the value and sanctity of human life. And we hope to increase understanding that an additional human being tends to benefit rather than harm others economically.\"\nHis \"partial list of general goals\" includes: \"Educate the public to the good news that the physical limits of our environment are receding rather than advancing....Publicize such scientific findings as those which indicate that in the long run, on average an additional human being increases the standard of living of other people rather than detracts from it, and that there is no connection between population growth or size or density and the propensity of countries toward war and violence. These findings contradict assertions without supporting evidence by the U.S. State Department and the CIA, assertions apparently made simply because they seem reasonable.\" Perhaps Simon is referring to NSSM 200 here.\nSimon lists \"Some specific tactical objectives: Disseminate writings....Provide an organizational address that the media can turn to when they seek a \"contrasting\" viewpoint to the Population Crisis Committee, Population Institute...and so on. As with other issues, when a population news issue arises, newspaper reporters automatically turn to organizations who make that issue their business. In the absence of an organization that speaks in favor of human life and against a doomsday view of our future, the journalist is likely simply to resort to no one....Offer an alternate source of information to the Population Resource Center which now `briefs' government officials in a supposedly neutral fashion about population issues....Comment...on bills now before the Congress that would mandate U.S. and world \"population stabilization\" and that would create staffs and programs to achieve that end....'Infiltrate' church, environmental, and other groups that currently make pronouncements in favor of population control in order to provide another viewpoint.\"\nApparently, Simon is referring to infiltration of Protestant churches, as such discussion is forbidden in the Catholic Church. He goes on to say, \"The organization will use all available education means to promote its beliefs...\"\nSimon lists specific planned activities: \"Issue a series of articles, written for popular reading at the level of magazine articles or newspaper op-ed pieces, dealing with various aspects of our subject....This series will be sent to our list of newspaper and television journalists who cover population and the environment, many of whom we believe to be interested and who may diffuse our message.\" We must assume that he is referring to the Catholic journalists Pope John II referred to in addressing the International Catholic Press Union and the International Catholic Association for Radio and Television in his message, \"Mass Media Need Catholic Presence,\" referred to earlier.\nHe continues, \"The environmentalist and population-control organizations have developed into an effective tool the letter-to-the-editor, wherever news stories appear. We wish to create a grass-roots organization with this as one of its central tasks, both in communities and on college campuses. The present state of public belief was largely created by a deluge of communications of all sorts over two decades. It will be easier for us than it was for them...\"\nThis statement is most telling. For some who have closely followed letters-to-the-editor and op-ed columns in several different newspapers for the last decade or two, it has been evident that an organized campaign advancing the Papal position on population and abortion has been underway for a long time. Simon refers to that highly successful campaign here. Unfortunately, most readers are occasional readers and have not recognized this fact.\nSimon continues, \"Yet a large volume of material will be necessary to establish the legitimacy of our message...as well as to hammer home our message to the public at large. A speakers' bureau may also be part of such a grass-roots organization....We will also maintain a list of high-level scholarly speakers whom we can recommend to the media when they seek interviews on television and radio for the press.\"\nThe language used by Simon identifies his employer. His repeated use of the term, \"value and sanctity of human life,\" is rather suggestive. However, more conclusive evidence is evident in his list of persons he says \"have indicated their desire to be associated with the project.\" This list includes Judie Brown of the American Life League, as well as representatives of the American Enterprise Institute, The Rockford Institute, The Cato Institute, and The Heritage Foundation -- all of which are identified with the Religious Right and emerged in response to the Pastoral Plan -- and Georgetown University.\nThe highly sophisticated and prolific propaganda machine created by the bishops, which includes Simon's organization, has been effective in creating illusions which serve to counter the realities we all see with our own eyes. These realities would, in the absence of Vatican inspired propaganda, be used to make decisions to support a more effective response to the overpopulation threat to American and world security. Today, the pope is winning this war because the massive propaganda efforts on his behalf have confused the American people. Such propaganda has killed the American political will to confront the population problem. But, given the stakes for the Vatican, we should not be surprised.\nWith propaganda machinery in place, the Vatican set out to create many wrong perceptions, serving to undermine the scientific consensus that world overpopulation is a grave problem for the U.S. These wrong perceptions and illusions, of course, serve as obstacles to a constructive response. Why? The constructive responses almost always include controls on population growth and immigration, threatening Vatican survival.\nWRONG PERCEPTIONS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT LEADS THE LIST - Index\nPerhaps the most threatening consequence of overpopulation to the Vatican is the greenhouse effect. This consequence is terribly hard to ignore. People cannot help but take notice: wild swings in the weather, large intense storms, rising temperatures and droughts.\nIn June 1988, one of the nation's leading climatologists, Dr. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, declared himself \"99 percent certain that the greenhouse effect is upon us.\" At a U.S. Senate hearing, he stated, \"The greenhouse effect has been detected and is changing our climate.\" 278 During 1988, the United States sweltered in a heat wave and drought. News analysts warned, as Newsweek put it, \"This year's weather was merely the foretaste of a warming trend that will, by the next century, cause unprecedented disruption in the environment, not just of the United States but of the world....This decade has seen the four hottest years of the last century and the first five months of 1988 are the warmest on record.\" 279\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by an increase in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other gases, including methane, nitrous oxides, and low-altitude ozone 280 -- all a result of human activity. The more humans, the more activity, naturally. This signals the inexorable links among population growth, energy consumption, and global warming. These increased levels act as a blanket which prevents heat received from the sun from being radiated back into space.\nThe atmospheric carbon dioxide level has risen 27 percent since the early 1800s, and 20 percent since 1960. The level is expected to double by the third quarter of the next century. If the buildup of other greenhouse gases such as methane is considered, the same effects could occur in 50 years or less. 281\n\"Most greenhouse effect forecasts call for rising sea levels, less rainfall in the interiors of continents, and hotter summers,\" journalist Monte Basgall reported in July 1988. \"The most unsettling scenarios include an increase in severe storms, and heat and drought conditions extreme enough to force population migrations.\" 282\nOther science writers made equally dire forecasts: \"Conditions in Southern California will resemble Death Valley.\" 283 \"The central United States will become a desert, if predictions hold true....Three of the big models predict extreme drought to the point there will be no ability to have agricultural production in Oklahoma, Texas and Nebraska.\" 284 These are important food growing regions and their loss, along with other areas certain to be affected, will mean serious food shortages in the United States. It is unlikely that we will be able to feed even our current population. North Carolina State University's James Woodman believes that a climate that includes higher temperatures, elevated levels of ozone, and extreme variations in precipitation could only be bad for agriculture.\nIf the Earth's population, industrialization, and emissions continue to grow at present rates, a six-degree increase in temperature is expected by mid-century -- a temperature level last occurring two million years ago. 285 \"The potential for economic, political and social destruction is extraordinary,\" said biologist George Woodwell. 286 \"Who could have imagined man himself rendering the earth uninhabitable?\" 287\nAs Newsweek`s Jerry Adler and Mary Hager observed, \"Trusting to luck is a risky strategy with the fate of the world at stake....The web of life is unraveling around us....The continuing thread of these environmental threats is the element of irreversibility.\" 288\nNorman D. Newell and Leslie Marcus have studied the positive relationship between population growth and the greenhouse effect for the period 1958-83 and found that the steady increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has closely paralleled the growth of world human population, with an amazing correlation of 0.9985. The authors suggest that this relationship is so precise that carbon dioxide measurements should probably replace inaccurate census taking. 289\nAccording to Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, what he and his colleagues fear the most is rapid change. Without action, they say, the change will happen so swiftly that all forms of life will be seriously disrupted. 290\nThe greenhouse effect clearly has the potential of being lethal to our life-support systems. All of this new information on the greenhouse effect cited above appeared in the American press in 1987 and 1988. A reasonable person would expect that the American people and our government would have reacted to this alarming new information. What has happened instead?\nOn May 6, 1989, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a devout Catholic, rejected a proposal by William Reilly, who was at that time administrator of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), and others who wanted U.S. representatives to call for an international convention on the greenhouse effect. Reilly and the others believed it would be a strong symbolic move for President Bush to urge a convention of nations to develop a framework for agreement on ways to combat the greenhouse effect. This move was killed by the White House. 291\nOn May 8, 1989, the Bush administration admitted that its Office of Management and Budget had changed conclusions about global warming data in the Congressional testimony of Dr. Hansen, over his protests. The budget office edited his text to soften the conclusions and make the prospects of change appear more uncertain. 292\nWhen the information cited above began appearing in 1987 and 1988, immediately we began seeing counterpoint articles to confuse the public, as well as comments from scientists not directly involved with this issue. These counterpoint articles (and numerous letters-to-the-editor) were written by people who had little or no expertise in this field. Credentials were rarely mentioned. However, there was no controversy among the most competent people in the field.\nThe Vatican's vast disinformation effort gave the impression to the public that there was much controversy among the scientists themselves with respect to the need to begin addressing this problem, including international communications in meetings like the one proposed by EPA Administrator, Reilly. There has been no further action on the proposed meeting, which is most certainly opposed by the pope, as it would mean the release of additional convincing evidence that we face a grave threat from overpopulation. The bottom line: nothing at all has happened.\nWe don't hear much about the greenhouse effect anymore. The pope's disinformation campaign is working. The public perception of the greenhouse effect is one of confusion, which has resulted in paralysis, the goal of this disinformation effort.\nColumnist, Molly Ivins describes our predicament: \"Bill McKibben, author of Hope, Human and Wild, wrote in The Los Angeles Times that the most curious part of this phenomenon is not that it's taking place -- global warming is right where it's supposed to be, according to all the predictions by all the scientists who have studied it -- but that no one is paying attention. Denial of global warming is being aided and abetted by those whom McKibben calls `confusionists' -- ideologues and industry flacks who keep trying to discredit the scientists by using inaccurate and misunderstood statistics. Rush Limbaugh, for some bizarre reason, has taken it upon himself to crusade against the idea of global warming as some kind of left-wing plot.\" 292a\nPerhaps the single most remarkable example of succumbing to the opposition is the Clinton Presidency. Vice-President Al Gore's performance has been astounding, but highly instructive a lesson in the struggle for power. Mark Hertsgaard writes in The New York Times: \"To read Vice President Al Gore's 1992 book Earth in the Balance, one would think that from the moment he took the oath of office he would have focused on nothing but grave threats of global warming, overpopulation and runaway consumption. Instead, the Clinton administration has compiled an environmental record of retreats, defeats and half measures.\"\n\"'Even after highly publicized warnings from virtually the entire scientific community...we are doing virtually nothing to address the principal causes of this catastrophe in the making.'\"\n\"Those words were written by Sen. Al Gore in 1991, when George Bush was in the White House. But they are no less true today. The Clinton Administration's plan against global warming relies mainly on voluntary measures that Gore himself concedes fall short of what is needed.\"\n\"Indeed, the administration has failed across the board to live up to the grand vision outlined in `Earth in the Balance' of making `the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization.'...[T]he Republican Congress [is] on the brink of rolling back 25 years of environmental measures.\" 292b\nFor over 50 years, David Brower, one of the founders of the environmental movement, has been active in the struggle. Currently a Sierra Club board member, his assessment of the President is that: \"Clinton has done more to harm the environment and weaken environmental regulations in three years than Presidents Reagan and Bush did in 12 years.\" He characterizes President Clinton as the \"Great Capitulator.\" 292c\nOne thing is certain. Everyone expected the Clinton-Gore team to be a great positive force for the environment and that by the end of their first term, significant steps would have been taken to deal with the \"greenhouse effect.\" Not only has nothing been accomplished, but both men have fallen silent on this vital issue.\nThe power of the Presidency alone has not been sufficient to overcome the strength of the opposition. But where does such power lie? Certainly not with those usually credited. Only the Holy See exerts such control in our nation's capital. The Vatican dominated Republican Congress and numerous bureaucrats throughout the government, both Catholics and opportunistic nonCatholics, have succeeded in aborting the Clinton/Gore environmental effort. The Clinton-Gore team has been no match for the Vatican team on the greenhouse effect issue, despite the convincing evidence that rapidly continues to accumulate.\nGREENHOUSE EFFECT EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO MOUNT - Index\nMuch of the mounting evidence that the greenhouse effect is a reality and already significantly affecting the environment is not communicated to the public. Nothing transpiring in the world today has greater implications for all our lives than the greenhouse effect. In a few decades, it will play a dominant role in what we do every day. The print news media have done a little better in bringing this problem, now only in its infancy, to our attention than their electronic counterparts where the topic is rarely mentioned. Though woefully inadequate, given the magnitude of the greenhouse effect threat to our personal security, the following evidence has appeared in the press during the past 18 months:\nWilliam K. Stevens writing for The New York Times: \"Earth has entered a period of climatic change that is likely to cause widespread economic, social and environmental dislocation over the next century if emissions of heat trapping gases are not reduced...according to...a new assessment of the climate problem by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change...a United Nations Group. The new features of the assessment -- the first in five years by the panel -- is that the experts are now more confident than before: That global climatic change is indeed in progress. And that at least some of the warming is due to human action...A continuing rise in sea level...most of the beaches on the U.S. East Coast would be gone in 25 years...An increase in extremes of temperature, dryness and precipitation in some regions....There is a 90 percent to 95 percent chance that climate change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide is responsible....The panel forecasts an increase in droughts like the current one in the Northeastern United States, heat waves like the one in Chicago this summer, and more fires and floods....A `striking' retreat of mountain glaciers around the world, accompanied in the Northern Hemisphere by a shrinking snow cover in winter....Deserts are expected to expand, and the heartlands of continents to become drier. There would be more rain throughout the world....Forest trees could not migrate northward fast enough to keep up with shifting climatic zones, and some forests would disappear, the panel says.\" 292d\nIn another The New York Times article, Stevens observed that 1995 was the warmest year globally since records first were kept in 1856 according to the British Meteorological Office. \"The average temperature was 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the previous record set in 1990....The British figures reveal the years 1991 through 1995 to be warmer than any similar five-year period, including the two half decades of the 1980s, the warmest decade in the record to date....The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York shows the average 1995 temperature slightly ahead of 1990 as the warmest year since 1866....Dr. James Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute predicted at least a couple more new global records will be set before 2000....The UN panel predicted ...the average global temperature will rise by a further 1.8 to 6.3 degrees, with a best estimate of 3.6 degrees, by the year 2100.\" 292e\nGeorge Moffett reported that the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1980, the two warmest, since 1990. (Christian Science Monitor) 292f\nKathy Sawyer of the Washington Post remarked: \"After years of alarms, an international panel of scientists and government experts agreed in writing that human activities are affecting the global climate....The following language was adopted by consensus: `The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.'\" The delegates at a meeting in Madrid of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represented 75 nations. 292g\nRobert Lee Hotz reported (the Los Angeles Times): \"Spring is arriving earlier every year throughout the Northern Hemisphere -- possibly due to global warming -- with the result that the growing season in many countries today is a week longer than 20 years ago, scientists announced...in the journal Nature.\" 292h\nPhil Mintz for Newsday: \"Ocean waves that towered 100 feet -- the highest ever observed in the North Atlantic -- formed during two East Coast winter storms in recent years, leaving scientists wondering if storms are becoming more intense because of global warming.\" Previously storm records had led them to believe that 100-foot waves should be no higher than 72 feet. 292i\nCarol Kaesuk Yoon warned in The New York Times that: \"Plant species living high in the Alps are climbing farther up their summits to escape the heat of a warming climate, but they risk going extinct when they run out of mountain, a study has found. Surveying 26 summits, Austrian researchers reported species migrating skyward at a rate of about 3 feet a decade in this century, with some moving as fast as 12 feet a decade.\" If temperatures increase as predicted, all of these species will run out of mountain and become extinct. 292j\nWashington Post Columnist Jessica Mathews advised that the National Climatic Data Center has combined five indicators that greenhouse models predict will change in a warming world into a single index of climate change. \"The measures include elevated temperatures, drought in the summer months and the proportion of rainfall that comes in torrential downpours....The results show that since 1980 U.S. weather has become more extreme, with an index 40 percent higher than natural fluctuation should produce. Every one of the five measures showed this trend. The study concludes that the likelihood is 90 percent to 95 percent that `the climate is responding to increases in greenhouse gases.'\" 292k\nFrom the Cox News Service: \"Heavy downpours and howling blizzards are occurring more often than they did in the past, and some of the nation's leading climate experts say the trend is yet another sign that the Earth's climate is changing. Researchers at the National Climatic Data Center reported that `extreme precipitation' events -- the heavy downpours and snowfalls that are most likely to cause flooding, erosion and crop damage -- are on the rise, not only in the United States but elsewhere in the world. `Overall, there isn't any trend in total precipitation; we're just getting more extreme events,' said Thomas Karl, senior scientist at the Center.\" ( 292l )\nThis is not an exhaustive list of the American press coverage over this 18-month period. But we can say with certainty that it was sparse. \"Earthweek: A Diary of the Planet,\" a newspaper column written by Steve Newman for Chronicle Features, offers specific and convincing evidence that, when taken collectively, change is probably underway. Some newspapers carry this column on a weekly basis. From this, we can derive a list, albeit hardly comprehensive, of world events serving as evidence that the effects of global warming are already being felt, events, largely ignored by the press, and listed below by week's ending:\nThe past year produced the warmest weather on record in 220 years across Austria; 1994 was almost four degrees warmer than the last record-warm year of 1775. January 6, 1995 292m\nVast numbers of warm-water sea creatures are migrating farther north each year along the California coast in response to rising ocean temperatures. This Stanford University study begun in the early 1930s, shows that the average shoreline temperature has risen by 1.35 degrees since then. The average summer water temperature has gone up four degrees.\nEven while flood waters steadily receded in rivers across northern Europe, a worsening drought in Spain wilted crops and caused water reserves to fall to dangerous levels. The drought has spread relentlessly over the Iberian Peninsula since the early 1990s and shepherds could not remember a worse drought this century. February 10, 1995 192n\nThe British Antarctic Survey reported that a giant iceberg broke off from the Antarctic Peninsula. While less than 100 feet thick, the massive chunk of ice covers 1,100 square miles of ocean. The British team concluded that the breaking off of the iceberg is due to the gradual warming in the region of 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1940s.\nTibet was battered by its worst snowstorm in half a century. The northern grasslands, with 12-foot snowdrifts, were hardest hit. March 3, 1995 292o\nA surge of subtropical moisture unleashed another round of record flooding in California's Wine Country. Flooding in the Napa Valley was expected to crest at 10 feet above the record flooding of 1986. March 10, 1995 292p\nArgentine scientists warned that Antarctica's ancient ice shelf has begun to break up in warming seas. \"The first thing I did was cry,\" lamented Dr. Rodolfo del Valle, who discovered a 40-mile long crack in the northernmost part of the Larsen Ice Shelf that runs 600 miles up the Antarctic Peninsula. United States scientists predicted in the 1970s that the melting of Antarctica's ice shelf would be one of the first clear signals of accelerating global warming.\nThe eastern Mediterranean Sea has suddenly warmed up far below the surface due to a new current in the Aegean Sea. The seabed has become about one degree Fahrenheit warmer in the last few years which could result in regional climate changes.\nVietnam's central highlands province of Darla is in the grip of its worst drought in several decades with most reservoirs completely dried up. March 31, 1995 292q\nA state of emergency has been declared in four northern states of Mexico, where a severe drought has withered crops and killed hundreds of thousands of cattle.\nUnseasonable frost and snow across the northern half of Spain destroyed a large section of the wine crop and damaged fruits and vegetables. April 28, 1995 292r\nSearing heat and cloudless skies over Bangladesh in recent weeks have sent temperatures rising to deadly levels and helped cause the flow of the Ganges River to shrink to a trickle. May 5, 1995 292s\nSeveral waves of severe thunderstorms rumbling across the American Midwest and Deep South unleashed some of the worst flooding in centuries and triggered deadly tornadoes in several states.\nAsia's only permanently ice-capped tropical mountain is rapidly losing its mantle of glacier ice, another sign of global warming. Ice once covered almost eight square miles of the top of the mountain in Indonesia, but now spans only one square mile at its peak. May 12, 1995 292t\nRelentless storms which have pounded the United States took a more northerly course, allowing record flooding to recede in Louisiana. Now seemingly endless waves of rain have turned the fields in the fertile Great Plains to mud, preventing cultivation.\nThe heat wave and drought in the eastern half of the Indian subcontinent was broken by a monsoonal storm which devastated crops and property. May 19, 1995 292u\nThe southwest monsoon shows no sign of ending the unrelenting spell of high heat in parts of India and Pakistan. This year's monthlong record heat has dried up the wetlands of the Himalayan foothills, threatening endangered species.\nFreakish late-season snow and rain continued to pound western parts of Canada and the United States where swollen rivers and streams swamped large tracts of farmland. Extremely rare June rains threaten a wine crop in California. June 16, 1995 292v\nScientists studying weather patterns over the Amazon are puzzled by the discovery of sudden and violent downward-blowing winds that are destroying parts of the rain forest, causing planes to crash and threatening human life. A single episode of these sinking winds demolished a 10-square-mile jungle area in only 20 minutes. June 30, 1995 292w\nBangladesh called in the Army to help rescue millions of people marooned by the latest floods that have swept northern parts of the country.\nChina continued to battle the massive flooding that has swamped 10 provinces and displaced millions of people since late May. July 14, 1995 292x\nMonsoon floods that have swept across almost half of Bangladesh since early July have killed scores of people, thousands of cattle and damaged approximately 1000 bridges and culverts.\nThe death toll from a brutal five-day heat wave in the American Midwest was expected to surpass 800. Temperatures soared to an all-time record of 106 degrees in Chicago, causing the greatest death toll from one event in that city since the Great Fire of 1871.\nIn the journal, Nature, scientists reported an acceleration in the melting of the Arctic ice cap, possibly signifying a long-term global warming.\nAlso in the journal, Nature, a team of European scientists wrote that Siberia is now warmer than it has been for the past 1,000 years. July 21, 1995 292y\nTass news agency reported that the global warming has stimulated the migration of venomous snakes into the Russian Arctic. July 28, 1995 292z\nCalled the floods of the century, the Chinese Army evacuated almost 1 million people in Liaoning Province where floodwaters covered 1.3 million acres. August 4, 1995 292aa\nExtreme heat and blazing summer sun sparked a new round of wildfires in the western United States, northern Mexico and parts of North Africa. In northern Baja California the mercury soared to 125 degrees. August 11, 1995 292bb\nBarely six months after experiencing some of the worst flooding in Europe this century, Holland now faces a severe shortage of water that threatens farmers with ruin.\nArgentine military and civilian authorities launched a massive relief effort to bring food and supplies to southern parts of the country cut off by three weeks of severe snowstorms.\nAcross southern Chile, the coldest Antarctic chill in 40 years killed 250,000 sheep, cattle and horses. August 18, 1995 292cc\nThe prolonged dry spell throughout northern Europe worsened with high heat and clear skies, is now taking a severe toll on the region's agriculture. Ireland's potato harvest is cooking in the earth under the hottest and driest summer on record that threatens to decimate the crop.\nSavage winter conditions that lashed southern Argentina for a second week killed an estimated 1.5 million sheep and halted transportation in Patagonia.\nEastern Australia broke the record for the longest dry spell since records began 137 years ago with a total of 37 days without rain. August 25, 1995 292dd\nThe luxury British liner QE2 was hit by a 95-foot tidal wave generated by the remnants of Hurricane Luis as the ship crossed the North Atlantic.\nThe spate of severe flash flooding around the Northern Hemisphere during the past few years may be a result of global warming, according to the U.S. Climate Analysis Center. Its findings show that the added warmth can cause clouds that burst suddenly into downpours. September 22, 1995 292ee\nA sudden and unseasonably severe snowstorm sweeping southeastern Mongolia killed nomadic herdsman and sent their 10,000 unattended head of cattle fleeing into neighboring China.\nMetropolitan Denver may not recover from a freak late summer snowstorm for at least two years. Some foresters estimated that four out of every five trees in the city were destroyed or damaged when heavy and wet snow fell on the still foliated branches. September 29, 1995 292ff\nA chunk of ice measuring 82 square miles has broken loose from Antarctica due to warming waters. November 3, 1995 292gg\nBlinding blizzards moved through southern Scandinavia bringing much of the region to a standstill. \"I have been a weatherman for 20 years and have never seen such a long-lasting and forceful snowstorm,\" said Swedish forecaster Lars-Erik Larsson.\nBritain is sending $23 million in aid to southern Africa to combat a worsening drought across the region. Maize harvests have plunged 91 percent. November 24, 1995 292hh\nAn international gathering of scientists and government experts in Madrid formally agreed that global warming is already occurring. The opinion of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that recent temperature rises cannot be explained by natural climatic variations, leaving human influence as the only possible cause. December 1, 1995 292ii\nScientists at the British Meteorological Office announced that the world's average temperature was 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal during 1995. As predicted by computer models, some regions of the world were significantly hotter than average in 1995, like parts of Siberia where it was 5.4 degrees above normal. January 12, 1996 292jj\nBritish scientists reported that Antarctica's ice shelves are melting away as temperatures over the frozen continent rise by about 0.12 degrees Fahrenheit per year. At least five of the thick ice shelves that make up Antarctica have retreated dramatically over the past 50 years, during which temperatures have risen by 4.2 degrees, according to the British Antarctic Survey. January 26, 1996 292kk\nAfter months of fierce blizzards and temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees in western China, the army moved more than 50,000 nomads and millions of head of livestock to safer ground. Bitterly cold arctic weather also descended on much of central Canada and the midwestern United States, breaking many temperature records. February 2, 1996 292ll\nThe worst blizzards of this century continue to plague much of China's Qinghai Province, threatening more than 100,000 people with starvation. March 1, 1996 292mm\nTwo more waves of heavy snow in the northeastern United States put the season's snowfall totals over record levels. The 13th winter snowstorm exceeded New York City's previous record set in 1946-47.\nThis has been the Ukraine's harshest winter in decades. March 8, 1996 292nn\nThe World Meteorological Agency announced that analysis of global weather data from 1995 reveals it to be the hottest year in recorded history. The agency's 11-page \"Statement on the Status of the Global Climate 1995\" also reported that there were more Atlantic hurricanes than in any year since 1933. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane \"greenhouse gases\" are blamed for the continued increase in the average worldwide temperature.\nKenya announced it will build walls around part of two tiny islands to protect them from imminent swamping caused by the rising sea level. It is believed that the changing climate is responsible for the discernible rise in ocean levels during recent years. May 3, 1996 292oo\nBitterly cold snowstorms, artificially-induced by cloud-seeding to put out huge fires raging across the steppes of Mongolia killed at least 5,000 head of cattle.\nThe worst snowstorm to strike China's northwestern Xinjiang region in half a century killed 469 swans. May 17, 1996 292pp\nA second year of severe drought in China's wheat belt has parched 17.5 million acres of crops and caused the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province to dry up five times since January.\nUnrelenting high winds after a nearly snowless winter in southern Alaska fanned huge wildfires that blackened tens of thousands of acres of forest. June 7, 1996 292qq\nResearchers in Canada announced that the permafrost, which covers a vast area of the nation's far north, is retreating. A six year study by the Geological Survey of Canada, found that the permanently frozen ground in the Mackenzie Basin has retreated by 63 to 125 miles over the past 100 years. This retreat is attributed to global warming. June 14, 1996 292rr\nThe United Kingdom Climate Change Impacts Review Board announced that the country will undergo major changes during the next 50 years, with northern England and Scotland becoming wetter still and the south warmer and drier. The board warned that such changes would have a significant impact on wildlife, agriculture and ranching. The climate zones are predicted to shift 125 miles northward. July 5, 1996 292ss\nUnprecedented winter storms raging across South Africa were responsible for a blanket of heavy snow, with drifts as high as 8 feet, across the normally temperate nation. July 12, 1996 292tt\nThis barrage of specific examples of what are probably the results of the greenhouse effects does get one's attention -- but only if you are aware of them. Earthweek is always buried deep in the second or third section of the newspaper, with little visibility. Who cares whether we are only 90 or 95 percent certain that the greenhouse effect is causing these unprecedented events? If it should develop as predicted, the results will be catastrophic. Billions of people will die prematurely in the coming century, including millions of Americans. The ramifications of this catastrophe may well end our form of government as well. Individual security would largely disappear. With the stakes so high, why is the press largely ignoring this mountain of evidence -- which literally grows weekly?\nArticles appearing in the press often contain counter claims, with the result that the reader becomes skeptical of the validity of the greenhouse effect research findings. For example, the first Stevens article cited devotes nearly one-fourth of the text to opposing views and dwells on the controversy among \"the scientists\": \"Climate forecasting is a difficult and often controversial science. One major subject of dissension is the computer models....Skeptics continue to assert, however that models fail to simulate the present climate realistically....But given the natural variability of Earth's climate and the wide fluctuations in temperature known to have occurred in the distant past, climate experts until now have been almost unanimous in saying they could not prove that emission of greenhouse gases related to human activity was playing a part in the warming....The human contribution to global warming could range from highly significant to trivial. The panel scientists say it is not yet possible to measure how much of the warming has been caused by human activity and how much is a result of natural causes.\" 292d\nIn his second article, Stevens diminishes the importance of the findings thus far, referring to the position of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director, Dr. James Hansen: \"Hansen has been one of only a few scientists to maintain steadfastly that a century-long global warming trend is being caused mostly by human influence....Other experts would go no further than the recent findings of a U.N. panel of scientists: the observed warming is `unlikely to be entirely natural in origin' and that the weight of evidence `suggests a discernible human influence on climate.' Previously, few scientists apart from Hansen had been willing to go even that far, contending that the relatively small warming so far could easily be a result of natural climate variability.\" ( 292e ) Obviously, just by reading his own words here, it is apparent that Stevens is underscoring his case that there is much disagreement and confusion among \"the scientists.\"\nIn his cited Los Angeles Times article, Robert Lee Hotz does much to raise doubts in the minds of readers, devoting about one-fourth of it to promoting uncertainty: \"In a key but controversial report last year, a U.N. panel concluded for the first time that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are probably responsible for changing the global climate...Despite the growing scientific evidence, the controversy over global warming and climate change shows no signs of abating. At the Geneva meeting earlier this week, more than 100 European and American scientists issued a joint statement condemning any major steps to reduce global warming....There is, they argue, still no scientific consensus on climate change.\" 292h Who were these 100 people in Geneva? No mention is made that the United Nations panel consists of 2500 carefully selected scientists. How were these 100 people chosen? Who sponsored this meeting in Geneva? Was it arranged by the Vatican? We can be absolutely certain that Rome will make every possible effort to insure that there is never a \"scientific consensus on climate change\" no matter how catastrophic the greenhouse effect becomes.\nOther publications simply reject the greenhouse theory. A Scripps Howard News Service article published this spring, \"Global warming in dispute: Scientist raps theory of greenhouse gases,\" offers no reporter's name. The article begins, \"The scientific squabble over global warming heated up again Wednesday with a Harvard astrophysicist's report that weather records provide `no evidence' of a coming climatic catastrophe.\" ( 292uu ) The article then blatantly misstates the data in which only scientists in the field would be familiar enough to recognize deception.\nGeorge Seldes recognized the use of these very same techniques to deceive Americans about the Spanish War of 1936-1939. And he thoroughly documented the Vatican's role in their use. There is little doubt that we are witnessing a repetition of a successful strategy as the Vatican goes about protecting its security-survival interests at any costs.\nIn his articles, Stevens fails to mention the enormous potential costs in lives, health, personal security and literally everything else of value to us. Why await a 100 percent certainty? A probability of 95 or 90 percent is far more than needed to act responsibly. When we suspect that a dam might break, even if there is only a 10 percent chance, we evacuate all the communities below the dam as quickly as possible. Why aren't we responding as responsibly by addressing the greenhouse effect threat? We all know that population growth control must be at the top of the list of the many solutions to the greenhouse effect problem. So does the Vatican. General acknowledgment of the problem will drive population growth control onto the public agenda as nothing has before. The threatened Vatican would prefer to prevent this realization and has a vested interest in maintaining as much confusion and skepticism as possible regarding the greenhouse effect.\nIf we continue on our current course, it is likely that the greenhouse effect will ultimately bring about a full-blown confrontation between Americans and the Church hierarchy. No one will be able to ignore the full fury of the consequences of the greenhouse effect. As the droughts and floods increase, as our beaches which draw 100 million Americans each year disappear, as our forests begin to die on a massive scale, and our deserts relentlessly expand, as the sea floods our coastal communities, as powerful hurricanes, huge winter storms and sweltering heat waves strike with increasing frequency, the greenhouse effect is certain to get our attention. Americans will begin to demand solutions, as well as explanations for the decades of grossly irresponsible inaction. The Vatican is going to surface as the culprit.\nTHE BOGUS \"DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION\" THEORY - Index\nPerhaps the single most important myth used by the Vatican to undermine concern about world population growth has been the demographic transition theory. The Vatican has promoted this myth through numerous institutions and individuals for decades. By 1975 it had largely fallen into disfavor because it was rather obvious that it was not working. However, it continues to be promoted, mostly by politicians, journalists, and foundation and population organization staffers, many of whom are Catholic. The theory is simple: the increase in well-being derived from economic development leads to a decrease in fertility.\nIn her book, Population Politics: The Choices That Shape Our Future, Virginia D. Abernethy systematically destroys the credibility of this theory. When researchers closely examined the basis for this theory in the early 1970s, they discovered that the early proponents had made assumptions about the industrialized countries that were historically dead wrong. Actually, the fertility transition to small families had occurred in the midst of desperate poverty and very high infant mortality in Europe. 293 In a Wall Street Journal article, \"Experience Teaches Population Control Can Precede Development, and Spur It,\" published just before the Cairo Population Conference in September 1994, Tim Carrington cites compelling evidence that this theory is bogus. He writes that the view \"Development is the best contraceptive\" was widely held 20 years earlier. However, much has changed: \"...there is broad agreement that the old maxim can be fully retired. Its weakness lies in the implicit suggestion that efforts to reduce fertility work only after a nation has lifted itself out of poverty. Reality suggests otherwise.\" 293a\nDiscovery that this theory was not valid has not diminished the use of it to support the Vatican position on population growth control.\nThe Vatican has also promoted the illusion that U.S. foreign aid is good. For the Vatican, U.S. foreign aid is good. It puts tens of millions of dollars into Vatican coffers through grants to the various Catholic relief organizations. But more important, this redistribution of wealth is good for the Vatican because it discourages developing countries from facing up to their overpopulation problems and gives them a false sense of security. Abernethy makes a compelling case that in the intermediate and long run, our foreign aid is certain to result in catastrophic consequences.\nAbernethy reports, \"The scale of the global effort to help the third world (and the deception it fosters) can hardly be overstated. Harper's Index (March, 1989) reports that forty countries rely on foreign aid for at least a quarter of their national budgets....[when all aid is considered, of which AID money is just a small part] the United States dispersed $92 billion to developing countries in 1988 (Harper's Index, December 1989) 294a ...Experts think that, by the year 2000, 64 out of 117 third-world countries will have become dependent on donated food, and the majority of these 64 countries will be unable to support as many as half of their projected numbers.\" 294b\nEgypt, for example , will be dependent on imports for 80 percent of its food in the year 2000. 295 What will become of it? Where will the food imports come from when the greenhouse effect begins to take its toll on U.S. food production in a couple of decades as currently projected? The United States provides the bulk of the world's food exports.\nFood is not the only problem. Abernethy summarizes, \"Three billion people will lack adequate fuel wood or other energy sources. Water demand, spurred by population growth, will exceed rainfall in most of Africa, the Middle East, North Asia, and parts of Mexico, Chile, and Argentina. And, warns environmentalist Cynthia Green, `The growing volume of untreated human wastes and toxic substances could render as much as one-fourth of the world's water supply unsafe for human consumption.'\" 296\nU.S. foreign aid has made it possible for the Vatican to postpone its extinction by delaying serious population growth control efforts. But, what have been the costs to the developing countries? Developing countries have been given the implicit message that they cannot help themselves, eroding self-confidence. Says Abernethy, \"Dependence on others is not a happy adult condition: Failure can be blamed on someone else; energy that could go into work or planning is dissipated in resentment when things go wrong, or in resentment simply at being dependent. Poor countries that count on foreign aid risk losing their resolve to become self-reliant. When dependence undermines self-confidence and stymies both foresight and planning, how can the future get better?\" 297\nChina, on the other hand, kept a firm grip on reality. It adopted self-reliance as a core tenet of national policy. In China, the one-child family is now widely, if not universally, accepted as a patriotic duty. Americans have long understood the importance of self-reliance. How much did the Vatican influence the decision-making of our law-makers in the formulation and implementation of our foreign aid policy?\nAnother myth promoted by the Vatican is that poverty is a distribution problem. It claims that rich countries will always have enough to share if they choose to. It adamantly rejects the idea that there is a problem of absolutely limited resources. Many developing countries buy this myth. Abernethy notes the danger of accepting it, \"The results are sadly counterproductive: Poor countries are encouraged to live beyond their means in the belief that they will be bailed out, and third-world couples go on thinking that large families are affordable.\" 298 The results obviously meet the pope's needs.\nWelfare programs in the U.S. were and continue to be strongly supported by the Vatican. As is the case of foreign aid, the Church derives billions of dollars in income from domestic welfare programs. According to the National Catholic Reporter, Catholic Charities USA, the nation's largest private network of local social service organizations, relies heavily on the government for its financial support: \"In 1993, the latest year for which figures are available, 65 percent of Catholic Charities' income was provided by state, local and federal governments.\" 298a In its March 14, 1996 issue, The Wanderer, a conservative national Catholic weekly, reports: \"The American Church is a principal subcontractor for the government in housing, welfare, child care, health care, and education, and gets billions of dollars for its services, for which it receives very generous administrative overhead fees that keep chanceries running and provide salaries and benefits for thousands of Church bureaucrats. Thus, maintaining the welfare state -- under the guise of `compassion for the poor' -- takes priority over the traditional Catholic social principles espoused by Buchanan.\" 298b\nBut, more importantly, these programs have significantly increased fertility, especially among new immigrant arrivals 299 (most of whom are Catholic). However, these programs have had a devastating effect on the American family and social fabric. The predictions of critics of these programs at the time they were made the law of the land are now reality. The Catholic Church has taken credit for the enactment of this legislation for decades.\nFor years the Vatican has complained that there would be no population problem in Central and South America if the wealthy there simply redistributed their wealth. This cynical act makes the Church look like the good guys to the masses and musters support from the masses for the Church. It allows the masses to blame their problems on the wealthy. It permits the poor to avoid blame for their own conditions which are a result of simply having more children than they can afford. The Vatican wins -- the poor lose.\nAbernethy makes another important point: \"Urging redistribution on policymakers in poor countries is almost certainly inappropriate. Hard thinking and difficult decisions seem in order because, where there is overpopulation, those who are destitute will consume, before they die, the future potential productivity of any part of the environment to which they have access. Witness the Sahel, Ethiopia, the Sudan, Haiti...Nepal, and Bangladesh.\" 300 The land will be denuded and the topsoil stripped away.\nThe Vatican is also responsible for the myth that immigration is a win-win situation when in fact the exact opposite is true. Abernethy summarizes why: \"Perceived opportunities to emigrate may be just as corrosive as large-scale aid. Emigration appeals to many of the most energetic people of a society -- exactly those people who would be most likely to promote constructive reform at home. One quick way to stop dissent is to expel the troublemaker....Driving out the tree-shaker does make for soothing politics. At the same time, emigration creates a safety valve for excess population. The understanding that some people will remove themselves lifts the pressure that would otherwise encourage everyone to confront the limited nature of resources....These aspects of emigration...narrow considerably the options for helping third-world countries to help themselves.\" 301 Thus the developing country loses.\nThe American bishops lead the cry against the national identification card exactly because they know that illegal immigration control will not be possible without it. It is true that this card will infringe upon the privacy rights of citizens. (Those of us who served in the military will find this card nothing new because we were required to carry such a card throughout our service.) However, without limiting immigration through enforcement of our immigration laws, notes Abernethy: \"Citizens go on losing jobs, most people's real income falls, energy security becomes a bitter joke, the environment suffers, the carrying capacity is exceeded, and Americans lose cherished values along with their privacy rights.\" 302 America loses.\nThe Vatican has created the illusion that it is not a major actor in U.S. policy making. Few Americans are aware of the intensive involvement of the Vatican in U.S. immigration policy development, most recently in the 1990 Immigration Reform Act. Abernethy acknowledges that public complacency over the Act can be traced in part to the inaccurate portrayal of future U.S. population by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Bureau's 1989 projections were criticized almost as soon as they appeared. Demographers Dennis Ahlburg and James Vaupel determined that legal and illegal immigration were being grossly underestimated. 303 However, using more accurate data for legal and illegal immigration, it was later discovered that the projected population for the U.S. in the year 2080 was 300 million off! Had this deliberate miscalculation not occurred at the Census Bureau, there is no way that the 1990 Act which further liberalized immigration law would have passed.\nAbernethy does not identify the driving force behind the corruption at the Census Bureau. However, she does identify a driving force for the 1990 Act, The Heritage Foundation \"whose champions are,\" as she says, \"Julian Simon and Ben Wattenberg.\" As noted earlier in this chapter, The Heritage Foundation is a creation of the bishops' Pastoral Plan and is headed by a conservative Catholic, Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.\nOne of the great successes of the bishops' disinformation campaign has been the misleading of America in the identification of the forces encouraging an open borders arrangement for the U.S. If you ask individuals on the street who these driving forces are, they might mention a few but they never mention the Vatican. In that the Vatican is surely the most significant force, this is quite an achievement.\nPerhaps its greatest success has been creation of the illusion in the U.S. that all is well within the Church, and between the Church and American democracy. This illusion is largely owed to the success that the Church has achieved in suppressing virtually all criticism of the Church in the press. A corps of Catholic organizations is committed to this activity. The pit bulls of this corps are found at the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, as described in the previous chapter.\nThe Vatican has no use for the civil rights of American patriots -- freedom of thought, of expression, of the press. Patriots have a moral responsibility to speak out when their country is threatened. This sort of intimidation over the last hundred years has resulted in a populace woefully ignorant of the threat to American democracy and security posed by the Church. This illusion has made it possible for the Church to go unchallenged.\nThe Vatican has also created the illusion that it does not involve itself in international organization policy making. Of course this is not so. In a recent interview, Professor Milton P. Siegel detailed how the Vatican seized control of World Health Organization (WHO) population policy making from the very beginning. 304 Siegel was Assistant Director General of WHO for its first 24 years and is considered among the world's foremost authorities on the development of WHO policy. During the third World Health Assembly (1950), the Vatican threatened to kill WHO and start their own organization if the director general, Dr. Brock Chisholm, did not stand up before the Assembly and specifically state that WHO would not get involved with family planning. He did. WHO did not get involved at all for more than a decade.\nSiegel put his finger on the Vatican's motivation. Without the separation of population dynamics from WHO public health policy, the Vatican subsequently would have found it much more difficult to manipulate governments on family planning and abortion. National leaders would have been able to refer to the international consensus, as demonstrated by WHO policy. WHO, they could have insisted, has determined that family planning and abortion -- like clean water, good nutrition, and immunizations -- are necessary to protect public health. This was deeply threatening to the Vatican. This astounding example is reported on in greater detail in an article based on this interview found in Appendix 3 .\nIn its 45-year history, WHO has had a deplorable record in family planning. Its commitment has been minuscule, and even today, family planning accounts for only a tiny fraction of its budget. The Vatican continues to have considerable influence at WHO. For example, it recently succeeded in having appointed as director of the Human Reproduction Program a professor from a Catholic University in Rome, Dr. Giuseppe Benagiano, the son of Pope John Paul II's dentist. Benagiano promptly set out to kill any further clinical studies of the most important development in fertility control since the birth control pill was developed in 1960 -- the quinacrine pellet method of nonsurgical female sterilization. 305 This permanent method has already been used by more than 100,000 women in 15 developing countries. There have been no deaths or life-threatening injuries and it can be delivered in developing countries for under $1 US, in primitive settings by paramedical personnel. Given the current Vatican influence within WHO, it would be much better for humanity if the organization removed itself from fertility control altogether. Its behavior is similar in its relations with all other international organizations that bear on population growth control. The Vatican has succeeded with its illusion.\nThe Vatican's disinformation campaign has worked hard to create illusions of abundance and prosperity, that wealth is renewable and that nature is inexhaustible. The right-wing Catholic literature is full of these distortions of reality but the Vatican is also responsible for the appearance of these kinds of messages throughout media. These cornucopian fantasies are nurtured and promoted to protect the Vatican position on population growth control and thus its security-survival. The Vatican has discouraged the concept of national self-reliance, including public debate of this concept, because it recognizes that achievement of such self-reliance would be impossible without population growth control.\nAt the same time, the Vatican, through its disinformation efforts, has fiercely attacked the concept of carrying capacity, apparently because it makes so much common sense. But this concept immediately implies the requirement of population growth control. It has also created the illusion that Earth has an infinite capacity to absorb ever growing quantities of wastes and pollution. We get mixed signals as a result and none of us is as concerned as we would be if the Vatican were not so successful in implanting disinformation.\nThe steady stream of \"human interest news\" regarding new arrivals and regarding the plight of would-be immigrants and refugees is intensely promoted by the bishops to advance the Vatican's security interests.\nThe greatest accomplishment of this sophisticated and well-financed disinformation program has been its success in making immigration and population policy almost taboo subjects for public debate. Given the overwhelming importance of these subjects for the security-survival of all Americans, this success is most disheartening. If the Vatican can succeed in this country with these issues in this manner, what else may be in store?\nDISUNITING OF AMERICA - Index\nIn his 1993 national bestseller, The Disuniting of America, 306 Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. never mentions the Catholic Church though he does refer to religious groups. In her book, Population Politics, Abernethy does not mention the Catholic Church in her treatment of the subject of the disuniting of America either. 307 In fact, neither identifies who might be behind this phenomenon. They both indicate that the effort is sophisticated, is widespread, has a lot of resources, and is hell-bent to succeed. But for some reason, they do not identify who the culprits might be.\nWho stands to gain from the disuniting of America? Who is threatened by a united, organized, committed America? Who stands to gain from social disorganization in America? Who has the sophistication, resources, organization and motivation to set about disuniting America?\nCertainly the Vatican is a sophisticated political institution and recognizes that America's bonds of national cohesion are fragile and that factionalism can tear our country apart. Obviously, the Vatican would be gravely threatened by an influential, united, organized America committed to population growth control. It would be hard to deny that the Catholic Church has a vested interest in ethnic identification and that it has repudiated the ideal of assimilation, an American institution.\nSchlesinger recognizes a serious danger relevant to the death of NSSM 200 which I will discuss further at the end of this chapter: \"And when a vocal and visible minority pledges primary allegiance to their groups, whether ethnic, sexual, religious, or...political, it presents a threat to the brittle bonds of national identity that hold this diverse and fractious society together.\" 308 The bishops also recognize this and have used this threat on occasions too numerous to count. They are certainly prepared to use it again and again.\n\"The bicentennial of American independence, the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, the restoration of Ellis Island,\" says Schlesinger, \"all turned from tributes to the melting pot into extravaganzas of ethnic distinctiveness.\" 309 There was a similar outcome with the 500th anniversary celebration of the arrival of Columbus in the West Indies (not America) in 1992. I watched each of these four tributes in disbelief. It looked as if these events were staged by the Catholic Church. Support for this suspicion can be found in a later section on presidents Reagan and Bush.\nSchlesinger identifies an ethnic upsurge today that \"threatens to become a counter-revolution against the original theory of America as `one people,' a common culture, a single nation.\" 310 He goes on to say, \"The cult of ethnicity exaggerates differences, intensifies resentments and antagonisms, drives ever deeper the awful wedges between races and nationalities. The endgame is self-pity and self-ghettoization.\" 311 And further, \"The cult of ethnicity has reversed the movement of American history, producing a nation of minorities -- or at least of minority spokesmen -- less interested in joining with the majority in common endeavor than in declaring their alienation....\" 312 In the end, the cult of ethnicity defines the republic not as a polity of individuals but as a congeries of distinct and inviolable cultures. 313 This set of circumstances has set the stage for the fragmentation and anarchy that we already see in our inner cities today.\nThe Bilingual Education Act of 1968 has not worked out as planned, except if the Catholic bishops were the real planners, an intriguing possibility. In practice, bilingual education retards rather than expedites the movement of Hispanic children into the English-speaking world and it promotes segregation more than it does integration. It nourishes self-ghettoization. Bilingualism encourages concentrations of Hispanics to stay together and not be integrated. 314\nAs a result, Catholic bishops now claim to speak for the millions of Hispanics living in the U.S., a status from which the bishops derive power -- political power. This appears to be the only positive outcome of this Act for anybody and the bishops continue to fiercely protect the Act which has squandered billions of tax dollars. Through this Act, the bishops have made significant progress in transforming the United States into a more segregated society.\nSchlesinger also notes that when a religious group claims a right to approve or veto anything that is taught in public schools, the fateful line is crossed between cultural pluralism and @BULLET = ethnocentrism. 315 The Vatican successfully claimed this right and vetoed in public schools all mention of the anti-democratic and anti-American teachings of the Catholic Church and all \u00a0mention of history which places the Catholic Church in a negative light. As a result, we have an American populace that is blatently ignorant of the true nature of the Catholic Church, the threat posed by the Church to the rights we claim as Americans, as well as the lengths to which the Church has gone in the past to protect its interests.\nThere is scant question that an attack on the common American identity is underway and that this attack has been instigated by the Vatican to promote its own interests which are presently seriously threatened. The bishops have made progress in transforming the United States into a more segregated society. They have succeeded in their efforts to impose ethnocentric, Afrocentric, and bilingual curricula on public schools, designed to hold minority children out of American society and have remarkably advanced the fragmentation of American life.\nThere are several advantages the bishops derive from this arrangement. One obvious advantage depends on acceptance of the bishops' proposition that they speak for these groups. At present, this proposition is thoughtlessly accepted by the media. Fragmentation will make population policies, such as those suggested by the Rockefeller Commission and NSSM 200, far more difficult to agree on and implement, a fact the bishops surely recognize. If the bishops find that anarchy in the U.S. is necessary to protect the Papacy (a likely proposition), this fragmentation sets the stage.\nAccording to Schlesinger, \"The American creed envisages a nation composed of individuals making their own choices and accountable to themselves, not a nation based on inviolable ethnic communities\" 316 -- accountable to their bishops or whomever. He continues, \"The Constitution turns on individual rights, not on group rights\" -- which can leave out the bishops if their faithful choose not to follow, as with family planning and abortion.\nThe American creed, which he defines as the \"the civic culture -- the very assimilating, unifying culture,\" 317 is today under siege because we let the Catholic bishops degrade history -- European, Latin American, North American, and Church -- allowing them to dictate its contents. Unaware of the dangers that we would have learned from a full and truthful history of the Church, we have permitted the bishops and their representatives to run grandly amok in the halls of our government. This has resulted in Papal influence on U.S. public policy making beyond what most Americans can imagine. Due to this interference, we are increasingly threatened with a grave global population problem.\nINTERNATIONAL FEMINIST MOVEMENT HIJACKED BY VATICAN - Index\nCanadian Madeline Weld has taken a serious look at the International Feminist Movement. Her findings are most revealing: \"[T]he Vatican, and various allies,...categorize as racism any arguments for limiting population growth and any reasonable objections to unlimited immigration....[F]ar too many people are intimidated into silence by this form of intellectual terrorism.\n\"The Vatican's campaign of intellectual terrorism is advanced enormously by some feminists....Although feminists ought, theoretically, to be opponents of the pope, because they generally believe in choice on contraception and abortion, they sometimes seem more like the pope's handmaidens. A significant segment of the International Women's Movement denies that population growth is a problem and accuses anyone who disagrees with them of racism. They portray any concern with global population growth as being in inherent opposition to advancing the rights of women. Because there have been abusive population programs in the past, they argue that any program must be inherently abusive. This segment of the International Women's Movement is in danger of hijacking the whole movement.\"\n\"Because the book, Power, Population and the Environment Women Speak, arose from the \"women's tent\" of the Earth Summit, I presume it is indicative of the direction that the intelligentsia of the international women's movement is taking. That is scary, because the book is the work of idealogues, not of analysts or scholars.\"\n\"On June 5, 1995 I attended a public meeting organized by various groups, who are participating in an international effort to discredit the first conceptually new development in contraceptives in 20 years: antifertility vaccines. The development of one of these vaccines has been funded in part by the [Canadian] International Development Research Centre (IDRC]. The meeting was organized by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women...Canada's largest feminist organization and Inter Pares...which has numerous Catholic sponsors. The women at that meeting were anti-science. The comment that there was a scientific consensus that the world was overpopulated was met with a comment that it was scientists who brought us the atomic bomb. Any questions pertaining to how we will solve the problems we now have were attacked with statements laying the blame for everything bad on the west. According to some of the speakers, to be concerned with population was to be genocidal toward people of other races.\"\n\"I later found out that the IDRC had offered to sponsor the Indian scientist who has been directing the research on one of these vaccines for 20 years [Prof. G.P. Talwar] to attend the meeting. The offer was turned down. The women had advertised a demonstration against the vaccine, which was mysteriously canceled...I found out that they had been planning to do a skit, but had been told that IDRC would challenge them if they misrepresented facts....What we heard at the meeting was not an objective analysis of the pros and cons of the vaccines, but a rant against genocide, eugenics and racism. To be concerned with population, we are told, was to be racist, anti-woman and anti-poor.\" 317a\nUnfortunately, anti-fertility vaccines are only the latest target of these feminists. They were instrumental in the near total elimination of the intrauterine device (IUD) option for American women. Today only about one percent of American women use this excellent method, while it remains the most popular one in many countries, including Finland, Norway and Sweden where medical care standards are very high. Those feminists were the storm troopers in the opposition to Depo Provera, which, though now available, was unnecessarily withheld from American women for 20 years. The latest victim is the most promising contraceptive method developed to date for people who want no more children, the quinacrine pellet method for nonsurgical female sterilization. With 26 years of experience in contraceptive development, I can attest to the extraordinary effectiveness of these destructive feminists.\nDr. Weld continues: \"These feminists are very influential, because I have never seen the population issue addressed in any women's organization or publication....Yet the women at the...public disinformation...meeting I attended are impeding a solution to the world's crisis through intimidation and by spreading confusion. What motivates them?...Unfortunately, far too many sensible women are silenced by the intellectual terrorism of the feminist hijackers. To make an analogy with the U.S. civil rights movement, the Martin Luther King types of the women's movement have been shunted aside by the Louis Farrakhan types, with their own agenda of hate.\"\nTo be sure, there are Martin Luther King types. As we noted earlier, Dr. Virginia Abernethy has identified overpopulation as the single most important women's issue. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, has concluded that unchecked population growth demeans the status of women and often ruins their lives. ( 317b ) Fran P. Hosken, Women's International Network, in her comment for the cover of this book, says that nothing is more important than control over reproduction which forms the basis of all democratic institutions and equality.\n\"The pope's handmaidens,\" as Dr. Weld refers to them, must be identified and thoroughly isolated from the international feminist movement -- whatever it takes. If sincere feminists fail to succeed in a complete separation from these women, the credibility of the feminist movement will share the fate suffered by the Roman Catholic Church. It will plummet. Feminist have a vital role to play in population growth control. If we fail to achieve population stabilization in the near future, all investments made in the feminist movement, by women and men alike, will be for naught.\nVATICAN SETTING U.S. POLICY TO PROTECT INTERESTS - Index\nFew Americans, even few Catholics, have any idea of the extent to which the Church has gone to impose its religious dogma on all Americans, including unwilling Catholics, through law-making, judicial decision-making and the administration of government. When you ask most people the question, \"How much influence do Catholic bishops have in the governing of America?\" most likely they will respond: \"None.\" The Catholic Church has successfully created the illusion that this is out of its realm.\nAccording to Alan D. Hertzke, author of Representing God in Washington and a professor at the University of Oklahoma, \"There's pretty good evidence that most Church members have no knowledge of what their national Church leaders are doing....Despite its absolute theological stand on many issues, the Catholic Church has proved to be one of the most effective religious forces in practical politics.\" 318\nDavid Briggs, in a December 1990 series for the Associated Press, stated: \"And the Catholic Church may become the strongest power because it is willing to form coalitions with a wide range of allies.\" 319 These allies sometimes include opportunistic people and institutions with little concern for the well-being of this country or our people. Governments tend to fall in behind public opinion and public opinion is led by the Church on nearly all issues important to its own security. (b) In an August 1990 \"Member Alert,\" Robert Maddox, executive director of the mainstream organization, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, placed in perspective just how powerful the Catholic lobbying effort really is: \"The U.S. Catholic Conference enjoys an unprecedented veto power over all social legislation.\" That's powerful! The Catholic Church's influence is unmatched by any other U.S. institution.\nThe Catholic extremist Paul Weyrich heads the Center for Catholic Policy within his Free Congress Foundation. However, he also heads up the Siena Group, a coalition of 40 Roman Catholic public policy organizations. 320 If the Catholic Church were not deeply involved in the making of U.S. public policy, why would it need so many public policy organizations? Undeniably, the most powerful of all remain the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference, operating out of their imposing office building near the Capitol.\nThe Church's lobbying effort is tens of thousands of people strong on the national, state and local levels. These people are knowledgeable about the workings of government, well financed, highly organized, and deeply committed. And they are successful. For example, in November 1995, a bill prohibiting over 1 million federal employees and their dependents from choosing health insurance that covers abortion, was enacted. That same month a measure that denies abortion services for military women stationed overseas, including women serving in Bosnia, became law. 320a On the state level, for example, in 1989 the Church managed the introduction of 270 bills in 41 state legislatures on the abortion issue alone. 321\nThe costs of policies adopted as a result of the Catholic lobby, in dollar terms alone, are horrendous. For example, the costs of implementing immigration policies (policies which are shaped almost entirely by the extensive Catholic lobbying effort) were estimated by Dr. Donald L. Huddle, Professor of Economics, Rice University, to be $45 billion in 1992 alone. He projects the immigration costs to be $668.5 billion over the next decade. 322 A significant part of this money goes into Vatican coffers as the U.S.'s leading immigration service contractor. American taxpayers are footing this bill with barely a whimper.\nOne of the most important questions facing Americans today is: Should representatives of the Papacy be permitted any access to U.S. policy making whatsoever, given the fact that Papal security-survival interests are diametrically opposed to the security-survival interests of all Americans?\nVATICAN INFLUENCE ON THE U.S. PRESIDENCY - Index\nMany Americans are victims of the illusion, carefully crafted, that the Catholic bishops have no significant influence on American presidents. No doubt the degree of influence differs from one president to the next. But they all feel and respond to this influence.\nThe National Catholic Reporter, a major national Catholic weekly newspaper, published a most revealing report in its December 29, 1989 issue. Doug Wead, special assistant to President Bush, was interviewed and quoted as saying: \"He [President Bush] has been more sensitive and more accessible to the needs of the Catholic Church than any president I know of in American history.\" Wead indicated he felt that Bush's relationship with the American Catholic leadership was much closer than Reagan's had been: \"We want the Church to feel loved and wanted, and we want them to have input.\" This relationship was maintained through five U.S. cardinals: Bernard Law, Joseph Bernardin, Edmund Szoka, John O'Connor, and James Hickey.\nWithin a month after Bush became president, all five of the cardinals had been included in meetings in the Bush family quarters. Both Law and O'Conner spent at least one overnight at the White House as guests of the president. \"This has been a Catholic year,\" said Wead. \"This administration has appointed more Catholic cabinet officers than any other in American history.\"\nI think many Americans would be surprised to learn of this cozy relationship. It was never mentioned in the secular press -- and we were left with another illusion.\nHowever, the relationship between the Catholic Church and President Reagan is much more revealing, as described by Carl Bernstein in the cover story of the February 24, 1992 issue of TIME magazine, with the title: \"Holy Alliance: How Reagan and the Pope Conspired to Assist Poland's Solidarity Movement and Hasten the Demise of Communism.\" The agenda of the Church is far more obvious. In Chapter 7, excerpts appear from Bernstein's article regarding the Reagan Administration's adoption of the Vatican's position on birth control and abortion in U.S. foreign aid programs.\n\"The Catholic Team\" as Bernstein described it, wielded enormous power. Bernstein reports, \"The key administration players were all devout Roman Catholics -- CIA chief William Casey, Allen, Clark, Haig, Walters, and William Wilson, Reagan's first ambassador to the Vatican. They regarded the U.S. -- Vatican relationship as a holy alliance: the moral force of the pope and the teachings of their church combined with...their notion of American democracy.\" Protestants in the Reagan Administration were apparently unaware or unconcerned about this far-reaching maneuver. Or they simply felt there was nothing they could do about it.\nBernstein quotes Protestant Robert McFarlane, who served as a deputy to both Clark and Haig and later as National Security Advisor to the President: \"I knew that they were meeting with [Vatican ambassador to the U.S.] Pio Laghi, and that Laghi had been to see the President, but Clark would never tell me what the substance of the discussions was.\" \"The Catholic Team\" did not include Protestants. If this was truly an American operation with strictly American interests at stake, why weren't Protestant Americans represented too? What was being hidden?\nReagan and the pope undermined and seized control of the Polish government because the Polish government seriously threatened papal security interests in Poland when that country outlawed Solidarity in 1981. Regarding direction of their operation to overthrow the Polish government, Bernstein quotes Laghi: \"But I told Vernon [Vernon Walters, American ambassador to the U.N.], `Listen to the Holy Father. We have 2,000 years of experience at this.'\"\nLaghi seemed to take great pleasure from the fact that the Papacy has had 20 centuries of experience in overthrowing governments. This suggests that the Vatican would stop at nothing to defend its own interests. One must read the lengthy article in TIME to fully appreciate the enormity of what took place, much of it illegal.\nWhat would prevent the Vatican from putting together a team of \"devout Roman Catholics,\" as Bernstein called them, to protect Papal security interests at the expense of U.S. security interests -- if a conflict of security interests did arise? Nothing. Because that is exactly what happened.\nSimple logic suggests that \"The Catholic Team\" was well aware of NSSM 200. Vernon Walters was the deputy director of the CIA and Alexander Haig was President Nixon's Chief of Staff when NSSM 200 was being researched and written. The Catholic Team knew that NSSM 200 had clearly determined that overpopulation gravely threatened U.S. and global security. Yet they chose to protect Papal security interests fully knowing that they were gravely undermining U.S. security. Should this behavior not be considered treasonous? Meanwhile, patriotic Americans assumed that the Reagan Administration was concerned about all aspects of U.S. security.\nBernstein's TIME article shows that the pope overthrew the Polish government to protect Papal security, after putting together a secret Catholic team (which excluded non-Catholics) within our government. Why would he not be prepared to assemble another \"Catholic Team\" to overthrow the U.S. government to further protect Papal security interests? This is a vital question to ponder.\nPATRIOTISM - Index\nWebster defines patriot, \"One who loves his country and zealously supports its authority and interests.\" He defines patriotism, \"Love of country; devotion to the welfare of one's country.\" Webster makes no mention of the Catholic principle: \"primacy of conscience: loyalty to God over loyalty to the state\" discussed in Chapter 13. One must assume that God and pope are used here almost synonymously.\nThe \"Catholic Team\" described by Bernstein are not American patriots. They showed only a warped love of country and certainly did not support its interests.\nIn the quote appearing at the beginning of this chapter, Georgie Anne Geyer says that the pope's teachings and policies on birth control could now lead to the death of all of our countrymen. The pope's insistence on open borders for the U.S. most certainly threatens the welfare of our country and our countrymen. 323 The honest position for a patriot is a position opposed to the pope's teachings and policies on population control.\nGiven the obvious conflict in security-survival interests, Catholic Bishops and priests, who must place the interests of the Papacy above all else, cannot claim they are American patriots. They represent a foreign power -- now rightfully recognized as our enemy. This is also true for the Catholic laymen who made up the \"Catholic Team\" in the Reagan Administration. Catholic Bishops have created the illusion that they are patriotic. They have defined patriotism differently from Webster -- in such a way that Papal security interests are not threatened. At the same time, they have trivialized patriotism when they find it threatening.\nAbernethy sums up what the American position must be: \"Every nation has the sovereign right to pursue a course leading to its own survival and territorial integrity. E pluribus unum means that we, citizens of the United States of America, are morally obligated to act for, and avoid acting against, the best interests of our country and fellow citizens. The many became one. That is patriotism. It means loving and defending one's motherland and its people.\" 324 This is the moral position.\nNone of the illusions that I have discussed in this chapter evolved spontaneously. Given their manifest success, it is apparent that their creation has required dedicated effort and craft. The Vatican is very good at what it does. However, with sufficient effort, these illusions can be shattered, replaced with reality, accelerating the self-destruction of the Papacy.\nI'll conclude this by quoting the whole of the couplet, the first line of which heads this chapter. It's from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera H.M.S. Pinafore:\n\" Things are seldom what they seem --\nskim milk masquerades as cream.\"\nIn this case, Vatican security/survival policy invaded and has been masquerading as U.S. population policy, with almost certain cataclysmic results, unless we act forcefully now.\n"}, {"score": 543.1226, "uuid": "274ea68d-695f-5880-9307-9613c0de268b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-73-23632", "target_hostname": "www.commercialappeal.com", "target_uri": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/sep/02/beat-of-the-heat/", "page_rank": 1.1750014e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Mid-South basks <em>and</em> bastes in second-warmest summer <em>on</em> record \u00bb <em>The</em> Commercial", "snippet": "Another newsflash: <em>The</em> <em>earth</em> really <em>is</em> round !

This translates into about a whopping 40 percent reduction in US energy use from projected levels in 2010.\nMany Americans might agree that such a staggering policy is necessary if the IPCC report is correct. But there's the rub. The IPCC report is not the one originally written by the scientists. Incredibly, after the staff of the IPCC received the report from the scientists, sections were drastically altered-in absolute violation of IPCC rules. All statements indicating the uncertainty about the type and cause of global climate change were removed.\nThese alterations are not small cosmetic changes--they radically change the conclusions of the report. Deletions include hard statements made by the scientists that, \"None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed [of the climate change observed to date] to anthropogenic [man-made] cause.\"\nSuch deletions are designed to create a blatant deception, Dr. Frederick Seitz, president emeritus of Rockefeller University and past president of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society blasted the IPCC staff, \"Whatever the intent was of those who made these significant changes, their effect is to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming\"\nWhen the \"consensus\" conclusion was challenged by reporters at the COP meeting, IPCC staff replied, \"Consensus does not always mean unanimity of agreement, consensus is up to the chairman.\" The staff claimed they had to change the scientist's report to \"make it agree with the chairman's executive summary!\nThe warming in 1998 had nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions. Earth took a series of direct hits from coronal mass ejections given off of the sun during solar flares. Many scientists also believe that El Nino played a large role.\nWhile there is little disagreement over the fact that our climate is changing, what it means is still hotly contested among scientists. For instance, satellite data contradicts the global warming theory. It is telling us something most of us have intuitively known for along time. Some months and years are warmer than normal, while others are cooler. But over the long haul, earth maintains about the same temperature.\nAlthough satellite data show large variations in the earth's, the average for the nearly 18-year period since the measurements were started has actually shown a 0.0210C decline in global temperature!\nIronically, these temperature measuring satellites were put into orbit in 1979 because of fear we were entering the next ice age, not global warming! It was the sharp rise in temperature during the last half of the 1980's that provoked the global warming scares.\nAt the time most scientists tried to tell us that we must not make long range predictions based on short term trends. Many tried to tell us that most of the significant warming in the past 100 years occurred prior to the 1950's and before the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases began to rapidly increase. Greenhouse gases therefore could not be the controlling factor in determining global temperature. So clear is the evidence that 100 of the 150 + climatologists in the world stated in what is known as the Leipzig Proclamation , \"it has become increasingly clear that - contrary to conventional wisdom - there does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, most scientists now accept the fact that actual observations from earth satellites show no climate warming whatsoever.\" (italics added)\nBut these scientists were ignored. Their call to reason has been drowned by the flood of horror stories of what mankind was supposedly doing to earth. Many economists doubt our standard of living can be maintained with the enormous CO2 reductions agreed to by President Clinton by signing the Kyoto Protocol in 1998. The treaty would cause the loss of 2 million American jobs, reduce the gross domestic product by 3 percent, and increase gasoline, electricity and home heating costs by 50 percent or more, and increase food prices by over 20 percent!\nIronically, Europe would experience very few of these penalties. The European Community has negotiated a \"bubble\" coverage for all European nations. Even though the European Community has agreed to an 8 percent reduction below 1990 levels (compared to 7 percent for the U.S.), the comparatively low-cost modernization of the old East Block factories and production facilities will automatically result in huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Since Eastern Europe has to modernize anyway, all of Europe can meet the 8 percent reduction target without any further sacrifice! This is not possible in the U.S. because\u00a0 U.S. industry is already modernized. While the U.S. suffers, Europe will thrive.\nAlthough the UN and Clinton administration are demanding that the\u00a0 Kyoto Protocol be implemented to stop global warming, because the developing nations are exempt from the treaty, manufacturing jobs will merely flee from developed nations (especially the U.S.) to these developing nations, which will not result in any net reduction of CO2 emissions.\nBut that is not the worst of it. While the U.S. economy is being decimated due to forced reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the 136 developing nations are totally exempt from the treaty. The developing nations can and will continue to increase their greenhouse gas emissions--not only negating the reductions made by the 38 developed nations, but making those reductions meaningless! The increased emissions by these developing nations is projected to dwarf any savings gained by the dehabilitating reductions made by the developed nations.\nIn spite of the absurdities and inequities of this treaty, it is full speed ahead for policy makers seeking to slam on the breaks on CO2 emission. They cite the Global Climate Model as evidence that the actual measurements are anomalies caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and other perturbations like La Ni\u00f1a. Once these anomalies are behind us, they claim, the temperature will rise to 1988 levels and continue its relentless increase.\nNo one disagrees that the stratospheric dust spewed out by volcanic eruptions and the La Ni\u00f1a effect can cause cooling. However, a plunge in global temperature occurred in December 1995 of 0.1o C--the greatest single month decline in history. There was no discernable \"cause\" for this plummet in temperature. Likewise, Dr. Robert Balling, Director of the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University notes, \"The satellite-based measurement of planetary temperature showed 1/97 to be the coldest January in the 18-year record. What makes this amazing is the lack of any La Nina or volcanic eruption that can be \"blamed\" for [any of] the observed cooling trend of the past year.\"\u00a0 In fact, there is strong evidence that the earth's temperature is strongly controlled by solar energy output and other solar activities, rather than greenhouse gases.\nIs Man Really Causing Global Warming?\nAfter plummeting by a third of a degree for ten years, the earth\u0092s temperature suddenly turned tail and skyrocketed by a whopping 0.7 degrees to record highs from November, 1997 to March, 1998. Even more important it is likely to stay at these record or near record levels for the next three to four years!\nDoes this prove that all the scare stories about global warming are true after all? Absolutely not. In fact, the warming appears to have nothing at all to do with greenhouse gas emissions and everything to do with solar flares. Solar flares erupt from sun spots for a three to four year period every 10 to 12 years. The last period of solar storm (technically more correct than solar flares) activity started in 1987 and lasted until mid-1991 (see graph). This was described by astronomers as one of the most violent period of solar storms ever recorded. These same astronomers have been warning for years that the next period of solar activity ( called cycle 23 ) could be even worse.\nTheir predictions for violent storms appear to be proven correct. The current round of solar started with a bang in December 1997, and have been escalating since then to record breaking levels. On January 20, 1998, CNN reported a \"Coronal Mass Ejection\" that knocked out Telstar 401 Communications. On April 8, 1998, CNN reported solar flares \"the likes of which scientists have not seen before.\"\nThe affect of one of these storms on Earth is felt within days. Art Poland, senior scientist with the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) at the Goddard Space Center, says the storms send a \"shock-wave\" toward the earth that takes only two days to reach the earth\u0092s atmosphere. NASA reported that the explosions produced plasma temperatures in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million degrees.\nAlthough the astronomers don\u0092t know why or how ( click for more information ), these record breaking solar storms can be seen immediately in the global temperature signature. The January event sent the global temperature skyrocketing to nearly 0.6oC above normal. Just as the earth\u0092s temperature was coming down in March and April, the record-breaking solar storm of April 8th caused the earth\u0092s temperature to shoot back up to 0.7oC above normal (see Figure 1).\nThere is a high correlation between sunspot activity (solar flares, storms, etc.) and the earth's temperature that has been recorded since the mid-1700s.\nAstronomers are only beginning to understand why these solar events cause an increase in the earth\u0092s temperature, but there is no doubt that they do. When the length of solar sun spot activity is plotted over global temperature for the past 300 years, there is over a 70 percent correlation (see graph). Interestingly, during what is known as the \"Little Ice Age\" in 1550 to 1750, there was almost no sun spot activity recorded.\nThe vast majority of scientists agree. Led by Dr. Fredrick Seitz, past president of the National Academy of Sciences, over 16,000 certified scientists have now signed a petition stating, \"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\" The petition also asserts, \"there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.\" These 16,000 scientists even go so far as to claim, \"the proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment....\"\nIn spite of this red flag being waved by the scientific community, doomsayers are ignoring the solar storm connection. Led by Vice President Gore, these global warming advocates are proclaiming that the sudden increase in earth\u0092s temperature provides irrefutable proof that humans are causing horrible global warming. Yet, the scientists behind the petition caution that the recent temperature signature of the earth just does not fit what would be expected for greenhouse gas global warming. The sudden reversal of earth\u0092s decline in temperature to the record breaking temperatures of 1998 is directly correlated to the start of the current cycle of solar storm activity\u0097not the gradual increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\nScientific uncertainty aside, the 1998-2002 years are predicted to be wild. Hang on to your hats, things are going to get hot\u0097in more ways than one! In the meantime, the Global Climate Model fails to account for these complexities thereby yielding a dangerously false picture of global warming. It is time to take global warming out of politics and put it back into the scientific arena where it should have been all along. There is very low risk in waiting for science to define what is really happening before making policy. But the risk of allowing the falsification of scientific reports and continuing the increasingly draconian policy advocated by\u00a0 eco-doomsayers, may be a strangled U.S. economy teetering on bankruptcy. #\nMichael S.

But these are mere symptoms of the greater problem to come\u2014severe climate disruption from overall global warming. To prevent climate change from leading to worldwide catastrophe, both developed and developing nations must take steps to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this effort, it is essential that the United States takes the lead; thus, this article focuses on the role that country should play in addressing its own greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe scope of the problem\nConcerning the prospect of failure to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, NASA\u2019s James Hansen, in a talk delivered at the National Press Club in early 2007, said, \u201cWe will have dramatic climate changes that produce what I would call a different planet\u2014one without sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level; and with regional disruptions due to freshwater shortages and shifting climatic zones.\u201d The vast majority of climatologists and scientists from related disciplines agree.\nClimate change will also affect world security. The Age of Consequences, a report released in 2007 by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes that if current projections are correct and the planet warms by 1.3\u00b0C (2.3\u00b0F) by 2040, there will be \u201cheightened internal and cross-border tensions caused by large-scale migrations; conflict sparked by resource scarcity, particularly in the weak and failing states of Africa; increased disease proliferation, which will have economic consequences; and some geopolitical reordering as nations adjust to shifts in resources and prevalence of disease.\u201d 1\nThe CO2e abatement imperative\nAccording to observations at Mauna Loa observatory, in Hawaii, current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide stand at 387 parts per million (ppm), up almost 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution and the highest levels in 650,000 years. World CO2e emissions^2^ stood at almost 45 gigatons (or billions of tons) in 2007, of which the United States contributed 7.2 gigatons. Under a business-as-usual scenario, world CO2e emissions are forecast to rise significantly by 2050. Staying the course could cause global temperatures to increase by up to 4\u00b0C (CO2 at 450 ppm) by 2030 and runaway global warming (CO2 at more than 550 ppm) by 2050 or earlier.\nPut simply, the world is combusting fossil fuel\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014at an unsustainable rate. At the same time, we are tearing down the natural world, which absorbs and stores carbon. Unless we undertake strong remedial measures in the very near future, greenhouse gases will continue to rise at a rate that puts the world at serious risk.\nSteps to encourage energy-saving initiatives should have been taken 30 years ago. It will take that amount of time, if not more, to control greenhouse gas emissions and thus stabilize global temperatures at 2\u00b0C above current levels, the consensus target to avoid catastrophic outcomes. To accomplish this goal, global emissions of greenhouse gases will have to be reduced by 80 percent by no later than the middle of the century.\nA ballooning global population\nTo put the root cause of climate change in more tangible terms, the average CO2e emissions rate per person in the United States for 2007 was 20 tons; in Europe, 10 tons; and in India, 2.2 tons. If we are to avert climate disaster, the global rate must be reduced to India\u2019s current per capita level. But even if the world accomplishes this feat, the increase in world population alone\u2014from, say, 6.5 billion now to 9.5 billion by 2050\u2014would contribute an additional 7 gigatons of CO2e to the atmosphere.\nIndeed, population growth is overwhelming the earth and shows no signs of stabilizing at a sustainable level. The world population is forecast to add 75 million each year, growing to 11 billion to 12 billion before topping out late in the century. As the population increases, so too will energy demand, satisfied largely by burning fossil fuels. Indeed, world demand is forecast to double by 2050, despite possible improved energy efficiency. As demand in the developed world continues to grow, the developing world will also become rapidly more electrified. Billions of people will be receiving electric power for the first time albeit from old-technology: coal-fired power plants, the leading source of CO2 emissions.\nDeforestation and the carbon sink\nThe problem of the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon sink\u201d (the stock of trees and agricultural acreage, which absorb CO2) must also be addressed. Today, nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are a result of the deforestation of mostly tropical forests. An additional 10 percent or more comes from poor agricultural practices, and their subsequent carbon and methane emissions, on deforested land. World tropical forests are disappearing, and even in the United States the slowing growth of mature forests, together with land-use conversion, has changed the carbon sink from an expanding absorber of CO2 to one that is declining.\nDeveloping countries today hold more than half of the solution to greenhouse gas emissions growth and must be part of any global attack on climate change by both preserving and extending forest land coverage. To do so, they will require financial help from wealthier countries in recognition of the role forests play in providing for the common good. Moreover, once a price on carbon has been established, active investment in tropical forests by the private sector must be encouraged. Without that help, many developing countries will feel they have no choice but to sell their forests into harvest and agricultural after-use in order to free up funds to support urgent economic development.\nThe next global economic boom\nAs the current economic crisis abates, the world is likely to return to a major global economic boom. Such a turn will certainly lift economies worldwide. But this increase in development (and thus carbon)\u2014partnered with the human tendency to focus on the short term rather than worry about tomorrow\u2014will further drive the destruction of our natural habitats. The World Bank expects global GDP to exceed $135 trillion by 2050, nearly four times current world levels. Imagine the consumer economy that will underlie that figure.\nEmerging economies are already exploding with promise and potential. Macroeconomic reforms, in tandem with favorable demographics, are creating a historic and self-fueling boom as billions of \u201chave nots\u201d gain access to the tools needed to build and sustain wealth. The GDP of emerging-market countries as a group has been growing at roughly twice the rate of advanced economies\u2014averaging 7 percent, compared with 2 to 3 percent in developed economies in recent years. And emerging economies today produce more than half of world output (measured at purchasing-power parity). Economic power is indeed shifting strongly to the developing world, and China and India\u2014the two most populous countries in the world\u2014are growing the fastest.\nThe global base of consumers is forecast to double by 2025, with $5,000 per capita income being the threshold of discretionary spending. Demand for consumer goods, including luxuries, will explode. China and India will likely add more than 1.1 billion cars by 2050\u2014countries that three years ago had fewer than 20 million cars in total. Consider the greenhouse gas effect of this expansion.\nThe cap-and-invest solution\nIn 2007, McKinsey examined more than 250 greenhouse gas abatement options in the United States and wove these options into a series of abatement curves showing the cheapest, most effective sequencing of actions.3 The results revealed that nearly 40 percent of abatement efforts in the United States can be accomplished at \u201cnegative cost\u201d (in effect, creating positive economic benefits) to the economy. This amount, achieved largely through energy-efficiency programs, would be sufficient to offset the remaining costs of lowering US greenhouse gas emissions\u2014assuming that a carbon cap is instituted, that investments are made in emerging energy technologies, and that other low-cost investments are made to expand the US carbon sink. The study concluded that the United States (and, by extension, other nations) can bring greenhouse gas emissions down sharply at reasonable cost and with little if any negative effect on GDP.\nTo ensure corporate participation in efforts to reduce carbon emissions, Washington should establish a four-part \u201ccap and invest\u201d strategy by using the revenue generated from selling pollution allowances to fund innovation in the fields of energy efficiency and clean-power generation. This could result in $150 billion to $200 billion of new federal revenue annually (roughly 6 gigatons of allowances initially at a minimum estimated price of $20 or more per ton of CO2) 4 plus more if Congress and the states were to cut back hydrocarbon subsidies costing roughly $300 billion per year (according to the National Defense Council Foundation). Combining these two sources would produce a massive war chest to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe four parts of the US cap-and-invest strategy should include: (1) a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions; (2) a set of hard-hitting energy efficiency programs\u2014for example, imposing minimum federal energy-efficiency standards on appliances and buildings and other inducements, such as a system of \u201cperformance-based federalism,\u201d in which the federal government would reward states that successfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (3) federal support to bring critical technologies to scale (carbon capture and storage for utilities, solar, advanced wind, advanced biofuels); and (4) programs to tap the carbon-reducing potential in sectors of the economy lying outside a cap-and-trade regime\u2014for example, expanding standing forests and improving agricultural practices.\nStrong federal leadership is essential in order to move quickly toward a fair solution. Only federal action can rapidly establish the types of clear economy-wide rules that can unlock least-cost abatement strategies. Where feasible, a federalist approach should be encouraged to allow state-level innovation, and states should remain empowered to push for tougher action going beyond what national politics supports.\nScaling up greenhouse gas abatement solutions in the United States will require clean infrastructure investments totaling roughly $5 trillion over the next two decades, including redirecting $3 trillion currently planned for conventional fossil fuel infrastructure toward clean solutions (this number excludes the cost of energy subsidies).\nOnce the transition to a clean-energy economy is well along, funds from the annual auction of emissions allowances should be redirected back to the nation\u2019s citizens (a \u201ccap-and-dividend\u201d approach), effectively moving toward a revenue-neutral taxation approach. This strategy would allow the United States to move toward a low-carbon economy at a negligible net economic cost.\nPlacing a cap on carbon\nA cap-and-trade system in which carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases become a \u201cfactor cost\u201d of production would ensure that polluters pay for emissions. Such a system would require each emitter to purchase emission allowances equal to their annual emissions through government-sponsored auctions. Those companies able to abate emissions more efficiently could choose to sell their excess allowances to other carbon polluters that have only higher-cost abatement options available to them.\nA well-designed cap-and-trade system should be:\neconomy-wide, including all (or practically all) CO2e emissions, all industrial gases, and all large-source agricultural\u2013landfill sources\nmandated to ensure the emissions cap and the number of allowances decline over time, so pressure on emitters to act is clear and of increasing force\nunlimited by any \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions to loosen the cap if carbon prices rise above a threshold level\nlong term, with inter-year banking and borrowing to minimize investor uncertainty by smoothing price signals\nverifiable, allowing offsets only where emissions reductions from individual projects undertaken outside of capped sectors can be confirmed as real and additional\nstructured to maximize public benefit by using the value created by emissions allowances to ease the transition to a clean-energy economy through support for efficiency, innovation, and non-fossil-fuel abatement.\nSuch an approach would ensure the broadest possible economy-wide response while rewarding emitters who act to reduce their emissions in advance of implementing the emissions cap Anything less would result in windfall profits for emitters who could recover CO2 cost increases twice over, by passing on higher marginal production costs to consumers while at the same time receiving free allowances. In the European Union, for example, utilities received grandfathered CO2 allowances, but they also raised power prices and earned windfall profits on the order of $20 billion per year in 2005 and 2006. Examples of legitimate uses of government revenue from selling emission allowances include federal incentives for new superefficient appliances; increased funding for research, development, and deployment of low-carbon technologies; and open-space acquisition and tree-planting programs to expand carbon sinks.\nPromoting energy efficiency\nNonprice market barriers such as split incentives between landlords who purchase energy equipment and tenants who pay energy bills block energy efficiency investments that are highly cost-effective even without considering CO2 emissions, other environmental costs, or energy security. Thus, policies that overcome these barriers would not only generate large economic benefits for the United States but also limit the effects of climate change.5\nEnergy efficiency measures identified by McKinsey, listed in the bullets below, could potentially provide economic productivity benefits of approximately $160 billion to the US economy by the year 2030. But to unlock this potential, specific policies are needed urgently, both because the benefits are large and because many of the opportunities are time sensitive and will disappear if we continue to construct more energy-inefficient buildings, build more high-carbon power plants, and put more gas guzzlers on the road.\nEfficiency policies come in three flavors.\nInformation measures to help end users make rational investment decisions, thereby strengthening the price responsiveness of efficiency investments\nIncentives and standards to encourage commercialization of advanced energy-efficient devices while pushing inefficient models out of the market\nDirect-procurement programs to encourage utilities and energy service companies to deliver energy efficiency as a service to end users who otherwise might not invest as the result of a combination of split incentives, information shortfalls, and cognitive biases\nOne idea is to adopt a program of \u201cperformance-based federalism,\u201d in which states that make substantial progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (for example, through enforcing stricter building codes, implementing transit-friendly land development, or expanding state and local open-space programs) would be rewarded through federal incentives funded by revenue from auctioning emissions allowances under the cap-and-trade program. The federal government should also establish nationwide gradual, minimum energy-use standards for appliances (while allowing leading states to move ahead to set more stringent standards).\nSupporting innovation\nEnergy innovations, such as bringing solar technology to cost-effective scale, have the potential to reduce total estimated compliance costs by $70 billion in 2030. However, a cap-and-trade program designed to address greenhouse gas externalities will not ensure adequate energy research, development, and deployment funding, because innovation spillovers that benefit competitors and other barriers will continue to slow the emergence of clean-energy technologies. In addition, federal support for energy research and development must be augmented and complemented explicitly by a forceful federal deployment policy. Government support for emerging energy technologies can also provide strong social returns, such as reduced mercury emissions\u2014even without considering global warming benefits.\nEfforts to further innovation are needed for approximately 20 to 30 percent of the abatement solutions identified by McKinsey for the year 2030\u2014and for a larger share of post-2030 abatement. Given the long lead times for developing new energy solutions, comprehensive federal support of innovation is essential and should be ramped up as quickly as possible. The federal government should identify a broad portfolio of such technology classes in order to minimize the risk associated with betting on any one technology. The government should then let the market choose the specific technologies within each broad class that meet specified performance standards.\nCapturing forestry and agriculture opportunities\nBesides capping carbon emissions, US global-warming regulations should encourage the capture of forestry and agriculture-related abatement opportunities (including afforstation, improved forest management, open-space protection programs, tree planting, conservation tillage, and manure management methane capture)\u2014which could constitute more than 500 megatons of incremental abatement per year according to the McKinsey study on reducing US greenhouse gas emissions cited earlier (more if conservation efforts not included in that study are considered). Forestry and agriculture measures in the United States, most of which involve increasing the country\u2019s annual biosequestration sink, are relatively low-cost abatement options and have the potential to reduce year-2030 compliance costs by roughly $20 billion.\nDespite the attractiveness of these options, the abatement opportunities currently available (such as generating electricity off of methane produced from livestock manure) are highly fragmented and diffuse, making it difficult to include these emissions under an emissions cap. Moreover, a cap would do nothing to encourage the capture of the significant offset opportunities available from forestry and land use. Additional government action above and beyond a cap-and-trade system is, therefore, necessary.\nRapid action to cap greenhouse gas emissions would yield strong net benefits for the US economy. The cost of imposing such a carbon cap on the economy, however, will depend largely on the nation\u2019s success in scaling efficiency and commercializing clean-energy technologies. With strong cost-minimization policies, a carbon cap does not have to impose a material economic burden (the average abatement cost should be roughly $0 per ton of CO2e). Even under the very conservative assumption that the average cost of emission reductions were to range up to $50 per ton, the total US economic burden for addressing greenhouse gas emissions would likely reach only 1 percent of GDP by 2030.6\nThe primary benefit of imposing a carbon cap in the United States is the prospect of containing the adverse impact of global warming. Assessments by prominent researchers such as Lord Nicholas Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, suggest that the quantifiable negative GDP impact would range anywhere from 5 percent or less up to 20 percent from unchecked climate change. Moreover, while the basic physics of global warming are well established, profound uncertainties remain regarding the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change.\nIf the United States decides to cap domestic emissions, the hope is that this action would provide the credibility needed to negotiate an international accord, which would help address the problem on a global scale. Even if such an accord proves elusive, by moving early the United States would still reduce the risk of extreme global-warming outcomes while developing the technological edge to roll out solutions quickly to global markets once a serious global emissions containment regime is negotiated.\nEffective solutions to climate change exist, so long as the world chooses to embrace them. The only equitable long-term goal is to equalize emissions rights per capita\u2014whether a country is wealthy or poor\u2014at a much lower level over the coming period when world population is doubling and world incomes are tripling. Global trading schemes and other measures can move the world toward equalization if OECD 7 nations will accept that they must help offset the costs of middle-income and poorer developing countries in the move toward clean-energy infrastructure, while concurrently protecting tropical forest stands. Moving toward equalizing emissions rights per capita over time is fair and can be justified to the world.\nThe key to inspiring a call to action must be found in the priorities set by the Obama Administration. Such a call cannot gloss over dangers intrinsic in human-induced climate disruption as merely an inconvenience. A clear explication of resource limits, the need to innovate and take solutions to scale, a description of what awaits us if we remain unmoved by science and simple observation, and a notion of sacrifice are all vital parts of a call to action, which will require a national mobilization of resolve not seen since the early days of World War II. The call to action should also explain the great opportunities that await those who develop and deploy new energy technologies and more efficient devices\u2014a future of low-carbon prosperity for the entire world. The prospect of catastrophe is real, and the window of opportunity to avoid it is closing rapidly.\n1\nSee Kurt M. Campbell et al., The Age of Consequences: The Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of Global Climate Change, Center for Strategic and International Studies, November 2007.\n2\nCO2e is a measure of all greenhouse gases\u2014such as CO2, methane, and nitrous oxides\u2014on an equivalent basis.\n3\nReducing US Greenhouse Gas Emissions: How Much at What Cost? December 2007\n4\nThis estimate excludes the possibility of benefits from removing current subsidies to fossil power generation. If removed, the net effect would be to increase the funds available for redirection to support the transition to a low-carbon economy or provide additional tax relief to the public. Federal subsidy reform should go hand in hand with a cap-and-trade policy.\n5\nNote that the Environmental Protection Agency already has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2007. For example, the EPA could use the Clean Air Act as an instrument to implement regulations.\n6\nAssumes 5 billion tons of emissions reduction required in 2030 at $50 per ton, or $250 billion in annual economic burden versus US GDP of $24 trillion based on 2.6 percent growth in real GDP (Annual Energy Outlook 2008).\n7\n"}, {"score": 527.83356, "uuid": "30b8cac3-0fd8-558a-afcf-c01540fcd866", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1612wb-87-17232", "target_hostname": "sports.bovada.lv", "target_uri": "http://sports.bovada.lv/sportsdbweatherwww/blog/weather/", "page_rank": 1.4215968e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "weather.com Blog - <em>The</em> Weather Channel <em>on</em> Weather News <em>and</em> Meteorology", "snippet": "<em>on</em> <em>the</em> following items once you get in <em>the</em> site in order to get individual monthly <em>and</em> yearly averages: <em>The</em> site ranks months, seasons <em>and</em> years for <em>the</em> lower 48 states from values of 1 (<em>coldest</em> in <em>recorded</em> history) to 117 (warmest in <em>recorded</em> history).", "explanation": null, "document": "http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_23192.html?from=blog_permalink_month\nWell, I couldn't resist playing the Climate Lottery, so at the last minute I put in some picks, which were: 106/94/68 for DEC/JAN/FEB 2011/2012 with an overall \"Power Ball\" or seasonal pick of 99. Once again, the season, as a whole, was above long term averages with no individual month below average; and thus, having above average rankings. I'll reiterate once more that due to climate change it is unlikely for a land area the size of the contiguous United States to have below average temperatures for an entire season. I'm not going to state that there will NEVER AGAIN be another cold season for the United States, but due to man induced global warming, the chances for an entire season of below average conditions is becoming much less likely. As stated in my third post, only an increase in volcanic activity from what is presently occurring at the moment can significantly slow the overall warming trend of the planet. What happened over the winter is more proof of the climate dice being loaded for warmth in the United States.\nThe reader may site, however, that the Northern Hemisphere did see some below average conditions during the winter...most notably in Alaska and Europe. Some climate scientists do have explanations for why Europe has seen some very cold winters the last few years. Europe's current cold winter pattern fit well with the latest thinking in association with climate change.\n\"The current weather pattern fits earlier predictions of computer models for how the atmosphere responds to the loss of sea ice due to global warming,\" said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \"The ice-free areas of the ocean act like a heater as the water is warmer than the Arctic air above it. This favors the formation of a high-pressure system near the Barents Sea, which steers cold air into Europe.\"\nHere's a breakdown of the National Climatic Center's ranking numbers for each month of the winter:\nIn December the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 84 (out of 117):\nSome of you were a little confused about how NCDC comes up with the overall rankings for the lower 48 states.The ranking for the U.S., as a whole, is not an average of the rankings for each individual state. Rather, the ranking is a comparison of the average temperatures of the entire continental U.S. for the last 117 years through 2011.\nInitially, winter got off to a cold start with a frigid air mass diving southward through the West. I did not take into account the first 10 days of the month in the West; thus, I overestimated how warm the overall ranking for the month would be. The rest of December was very mild for most of the country. Some of the Northeast states had their second or third warmest Decembers in recorded history.\nSo why was the winter, for the most part, very mild? Remember what I referred to in my last post...the positive North Atlantic or Arctic Oscillation. This feature has remained basically intact from the Hudson Bay into Greenland all winter long. Charts from the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration depict what has happened in association with the NAO over the last year. Charts can be found at this link: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.sprd2.gif\nNotice that the graphs on the charts are primarily above 0 indicating that the NAO was in a positive phase.Climatologists have found that during the cold season when the Arctic Oscillation is in mostly a positive phase combined with global warming; most of North America will see a mild winter. Waa-la that is what happened this season. What was somewhat surprising was the persistence of the positive Atlantic Oscillation over the entire season. Usually, if this mild pattern occurs during the winter, there are a few weeks when the pattern becomes negative, but that was not the case during the winter of 2011/2012.\nNot all of North America was above average, however. Alaska saw some of the coldest conditions for that state's history into January. Due to the nature of weather patterns, some areas of the planet will see below average periods; thus, fooling contrarians, but over periods of a season or longer, warmer than average conditions will appear for those same locations in the climate record.\nIn January the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 115 (out of 118).\nJanuary was startlingly mild, just as July and August 2011 were alarmingly hot. January 2012 was the 4th warmest January for the lower 48 states in recorded history. The northern Plains was particularly mild where there was well below average snow cover and over 1250 daily record highs were either tied or set. The climate dice came up very red in December. My \"quick pick\" for January of 94 was 11 points too low.\nMany people across the United States were asking what had happened to winter. The following is a cute cartoon that I will attribute to Nate Johnson that basically sums up what some meteorologists have been thinking about this season:\nDespite the warm January, there was some winter weather. A storm officially dumped seven inches of snow on Seattle during the middle of the month, for instance. All kidding aside though, the winter weather across the United States is probably a precursor of very mild seasons in the future looking at climate trends. I would expect that in the next couple of decades though, there will be wild fluctuations of mild patterns most years with a few more colder and snowier winters depending mostly on what happens with the Arctic Oscillation.\nIn February the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 101 (out of 118).\nThe overall ranking for boreal winter 2011/2012 was 114 (out of 117).\nThe weather pattern that produced the mild weather in February was similar to that of January. The pattern did shift slightly, however, such that the Northeast was particularly warm. Massachusetts had its warmest February in recorded history.\nThe \"Power Ball\" number for the entire U.S. was 114 (out of 117), so the lower 48 states ended up having the 4th warmest winter in recorded history (since 1895). Think about this for a moment: What are the chances in a regular lottery of picking a number from 1 to 117 as high as 114? Again, due to climate change, I think that the game is rigged towards warmth.\nI am getting all of my ranking numbers from the National Climatic Data Center.\nThe link for the National Climatic Data Center's Climate at a Glance Site where the rankings are archived is: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/cag3/cag3.html\nI'm keeping the format on all of my charts the same as on the last two posts.The average ranking for 2012 is 59 since the coldest ranking would be 1 and the hottest would be 118. I have color coded all rankings below 49 blue and all those above 69 red with rankings + or -- 10 from the median value of 59 black.\nThe following are the rankings so far for the 2010's:\nAlso, for reference, the following are \"Power-Ball\" and \"Mega-Ball\" ranking numbers from 1960 to the present. I did not chart seasonal ranking numbers on my last couple of blogs, but will this time. For the sake of discussion I'll define Mega-Ball numbers as NCDC rankings for each year and Power-Ball numbers as NCDC rankings for each season. Seasonal or Power-Ball rankings for winter are those for DEC/JAN/FEB, spring are those for MAR/APR/MAY, summer is JUN/JUL/AUG, and fall is SEP/OCT/NOV. Winter rankings obviously will overlap from one year to the next, but for convenience, the National Climatic Data Center will infer that winter 2012 was for DEC 2011, JAN 2012 and FEB 2012, for example. Also, keep in mind that NCDC rankings for seasons compare temperature averages for individual seasons and are not merely an average of rankings of individual months of a season or year.\nEven though two out of the three of the winter months occurred in 2012, the ranking for winter 2011/2012 was the 117th. Rankings from NCDC start in January 1895. The first full winter that could be ranked did not occur until the data for DEC 1895, JAN 1896 and FEB 1896 were complete ...that's why DEC 2011, JAN 2012 and FEB 2012 would be the 117th winter to be ranked, not the 118th.\nNotice that since the start of 2000 only four out of forty-nine seasons have been below average or \"blue\". Thirty-nine out of the forty-nine seasons since 2000 have been \"red\" or above average. Indeed, the climate dice are very much loaded for above average temperatures for the lower 48 states looking at recent history.\nWell, that's it for this post. I just hope that spring 2012 is not as volatile as that of 2011 despite this first horrendous outbreak of tornadoes this week.\nGuy Walton\nLead Forecaster, The Weather Channel\nPosted at 12:12 am ET\n"}, {"score": 527.7075, "uuid": "2faf4439-8772-563f-80db-e7003d04a80f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400wb-71-20125", "target_hostname": "maps.weather.com", "target_uri": "http://maps.weather.com/blog/weather/?from=wxcenter_subnav", "page_rank": 1.1751388e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "weather.com Blog - <em>The</em> Weather Channel <em>on</em> Weather News <em>and</em> Meteorology", "snippet": "<em>on</em> <em>the</em> following items once you get in <em>the</em> site in order to get individual monthly <em>and</em> yearly averages: <em>The</em> site ranks months, seasons <em>and</em> years for <em>the</em> lower 48 states from values of 1 (<em>coldest</em> in <em>recorded</em> history) to 117 (warmest in <em>recorded</em> history).", "explanation": null, "document": "http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_23192.html?from=blog_permalink_month\nWell, I couldn't resist playing the Climate Lottery, so at the last minute I put in some picks, which were: 106/94/68 for DEC/JAN/FEB 2011/2012 with an overall \"Power Ball\" or seasonal pick of 99.

I have color coded all rankings below 49 blue and all those above 69 red with rankings + or -- 10 from the median value of 59 black.\nThe following are the rankings so far for the 2010's:\nAlso, for reference, the following are \"Power-Ball\" and \"Mega-Ball\" ranking numbers from 1960 to the present. I did not chart seasonal ranking numbers on my last couple of blogs, but will this time. For the sake of discussion I'll define Mega-Ball numbers as NCDC rankings for each year and Power-Ball numbers as NCDC rankings for each season. Seasonal or Power-Ball rankings for winter are those for DEC/JAN/FEB, spring are those for MAR/APR/MAY, summer is JUN/JUL/AUG, and fall is SEP/OCT/NOV. Winter rankings obviously will overlap from one year to the next, but for convenience, the National Climatic Data Center will infer that winter 2012 was for DEC 2011, JAN 2012 and FEB 2012, for example. Also, keep in mind that NCDC rankings for seasons compare temperature averages for individual seasons and are not merely an average of rankings of individual months of a season or year.\nEven though two out of the three of the winter months occurred in 2012, the ranking for winter 2011/2012 was the 117th. Rankings from NCDC start in January 1895. The first full winter that could be ranked did not occur until the data for DEC 1895, JAN 1896 and FEB 1896 were complete ...that's why DEC 2011, JAN 2012 and FEB 2012 would be the 117th winter to be ranked, not the 118th.\nNotice that since the start of 2000 only four out of forty-nine seasons have been below average or \"blue\". Thirty-nine out of the forty-nine seasons since 2000 have been \"red\" or above average. Indeed, the climate dice are very much loaded for above average temperatures for the lower 48 states looking at recent history.\nWell, that's it for this post. I just hope that spring 2012 is not as volatile as that of 2011 despite this first horrendous outbreak of tornadoes this week.\nGuy Walton\nLead Forecaster, The Weather Channel\nPosted at 12:12 am ET\n"}, {"score": 527.7002, "uuid": "7ee56881-01ed-5daa-9e23-891ef4aaa35e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1408wb-32-02378", "target_hostname": "wow.weather.com", "target_uri": "http://wow.weather.com/blog/weather/", "page_rank": 6.3061254e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "weather.com Blog - <em>The</em> Weather Channel <em>on</em> Weather News <em>and</em> Meteorology", "snippet": "<em>on</em> <em>the</em> following items once you get in <em>the</em> site in order to get individual monthly <em>and</em> yearly averages: <em>The</em> site ranks months, seasons <em>and</em> years for <em>the</em> lower 48 states from values of 1 (<em>coldest</em> in <em>recorded</em> history) to 117 (warmest in <em>recorded</em> history).", "explanation": null, "document": "http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_23192.html?from=blog_permalink_month\nWell, I couldn't resist playing the Climate Lottery, so at the last minute I put in some picks, which were: 106/94/68 for DEC/JAN/FEB 2011/2012 with an overall \"Power Ball\" or seasonal pick of 99. Once again, the season, as a whole, was above long term averages with no individual month below average; and thus, having above average rankings. I'll reiterate once more that due to climate change it is unlikely for a land area the size of the contiguous United States to have below average temperatures for an entire season. I'm not going to state that there will NEVER AGAIN be another cold season for the United States, but due to man induced global warming, the chances for an entire season of below average conditions is becoming much less likely. As stated in my third post, only an increase in volcanic activity from what is presently occurring at the moment can significantly slow the overall warming trend of the planet. What happened over the winter is more proof of the climate dice being loaded for warmth in the United States.\nThe reader may site, however, that the Northern Hemisphere did see some below average conditions during the winter...most notably in Alaska and Europe. Some climate scientists do have explanations for why Europe has seen some very cold winters the last few years. Europe's current cold winter pattern fit well with the latest thinking in association with climate change.\n\"The current weather pattern fits earlier predictions of computer models for how the atmosphere responds to the loss of sea ice due to global warming,\" said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \"The ice-free areas of the ocean act like a heater as the water is warmer than the Arctic air above it. This favors the formation of a high-pressure system near the Barents Sea, which steers cold air into Europe.\"\nHere's a breakdown of the National Climatic Center's ranking numbers for each month of the winter:\nIn December the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 84 (out of 117):\nSome of you were a little confused about how NCDC comes up with the overall rankings for the lower 48 states.The ranking for the U.S., as a whole, is not an average of the rankings for each individual state. Rather, the ranking is a comparison of the average temperatures of the entire continental U.S. for the last 117 years through 2011.\nInitially, winter got off to a cold start with a frigid air mass diving southward through the West. I did not take into account the first 10 days of the month in the West; thus, I overestimated how warm the overall ranking for the month would be. The rest of December was very mild for most of the country. Some of the Northeast states had their second or third warmest Decembers in recorded history.\nSo why was the winter, for the most part, very mild? Remember what I referred to in my last post...the positive North Atlantic or Arctic Oscillation. This feature has remained basically intact from the Hudson Bay into Greenland all winter long. Charts from the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration depict what has happened in association with the NAO over the last year. Charts can be found at this link: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.sprd2.gif\nNotice that the graphs on the charts are primarily above 0 indicating that the NAO was in a positive phase.Climatologists have found that during the cold season when the Arctic Oscillation is in mostly a positive phase combined with global warming; most of North America will see a mild winter. Waa-la that is what happened this season. What was somewhat surprising was the persistence of the positive Atlantic Oscillation over the entire season. Usually, if this mild pattern occurs during the winter, there are a few weeks when the pattern becomes negative, but that was not the case during the winter of 2011/2012.\nNot all of North America was above average, however. Alaska saw some of the coldest conditions for that state's history into January. Due to the nature of weather patterns, some areas of the planet will see below average periods; thus, fooling contrarians, but over periods of a season or longer, warmer than average conditions will appear for those same locations in the climate record.\nIn January the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 115 (out of 118).\nJanuary was startlingly mild, just as July and August 2011 were alarmingly hot. January 2012 was the 4th warmest January for the lower 48 states in recorded history. The northern Plains was particularly mild where there was well below average snow cover and over 1250 daily record highs were either tied or set. The climate dice came up very red in December. My \"quick pick\" for January of 94 was 11 points too low.\nMany people across the United States were asking what had happened to winter. The following is a cute cartoon that I will attribute to Nate Johnson that basically sums up what some meteorologists have been thinking about this season:\nDespite the warm January, there was some winter weather. A storm officially dumped seven inches of snow on Seattle during the middle of the month, for instance. All kidding aside though, the winter weather across the United States is probably a precursor of very mild seasons in the future looking at climate trends. I would expect that in the next couple of decades though, there will be wild fluctuations of mild patterns most years with a few more colder and snowier winters depending mostly on what happens with the Arctic Oscillation.\nIn February the overall ranking for the lower 48 states was 101 (out of 118).\nThe overall ranking for boreal winter 2011/2012 was 114 (out of 117).\nThe weather pattern that produced the mild weather in February was similar to that of January. The pattern did shift slightly, however, such that the Northeast was particularly warm. Massachusetts had its warmest February in recorded history.\nThe \"Power Ball\" number for the entire U.S. was 114 (out of 117), so the lower 48 states ended up having the 4th warmest winter in recorded history (since 1895). Think about this for a moment: What are the chances in a regular lottery of picking a number from 1 to 117 as high as 114? Again, due to climate change, I think that the game is rigged towards warmth.\nI am getting all of my ranking numbers from the National Climatic Data Center.\nThe link for the National Climatic Data Center's Climate at a Glance Site where the rankings are archived is: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/cag3/cag3.html\nI'm keeping the format on all of my charts the same as on the last two posts.The average ranking for 2012 is 59 since the coldest ranking would be 1 and the hottest would be 118.

And the greatest secret of history, what you were never taught at school or college, is that our planet had a global catastrophe in living memory, in 535 AD. You won't find this information elsewhere on the internet either. Something happened which caused the light of the sun to be dimmed greatly around the globe for 18 months. During this time, many trees did not grow at all. This event was followed by 30 years of unprecedented droughts and some flooding. This caused the death of a vast percentage of the population through starvation and disease.\nIt is likely that the cause of this catastrophe was the eruption of the super volcano Krakatoa. (Note: The terms \"Super volcano\" is used for a volcano with hundreds of times the power of any that we have visually recorded in the past few hundred years. Use the term \"super volcano\" for further research). We now have two super volcanoes showing signs of getting ready to erupt. Each is bigger than Krakatoa. One is in Naples Italy and the other in Yellowstone USA. The Powers That Be know all this and are keeping this knowledge to themselves. That is probably one reason why they have so many DUMBS (Deep Underground Military Bases). They are planning to turn this knowledge to their own advantage to take control of us. However, with the knowledge of what may come in our life time, you can prepare so that you and your family are not affected.\n\u0093In AD 535/536 mankind was hit by one of the greatest natural disasters ever to occur \u0085. It blotted out much of the light and heat of the sun for 18 months and resulted, directly or indirectly in climatic chaos, famine, migration, war and massive political change on virtually every continent\u0094.\nThis is in the opening page of \u0093Catastrophe\u0094 by David Keys, 1999, a book that should have been on the best seller lists but very few people know of. The book took four years to write and research, and is extremely well researched. One can only assume that the Powers that Be are happy to keep this knowledge from the public. This article is an attempt to summarize that book and discuss some of the implications.\nThe contemporary Roman historian Procopius described the mystery climatic disaster: \u0093The sun gave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year.\u0094\nSixth century historian and prominent church leader John of Ephesus wrote of 535 AD in his \u0091Historiae Ecclesiasicae\u0092 (\u0091Church Histories\u0092), \u0093There was a sign from the sun, the like of which had never been seen and reported before. The sun became dark and its darkness lasted for 18 months. Each day, it shone for about four hours, and still this light was only a feeble shadow. Everyone declared that the sun would never recover its full light again.\u0094\nAnother 6th Century writer Zacharias of Mytilene wrote, \u0093The sun began to be darkened by day and the moon by night.\u0094\nA Roman official known as John the Lydian reported that \u0093the sun became dim for nearly the whole year.\u0094\nIn Italy a Senior local civil servant, Cassiodorus Sentaro wrote in 536, \u0093We marvel to see no shadows of ourselves at noon\u0085.We have had a spring without mildness and a summer without heat.\u0094\nAccording to Keys, this one global disaster directly or indirectly caused the deaths of a huge percentage of the world\u0092s population. It indirectly affected the politics on every continent and contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire. The 100-year period after it occurred is the heart of history\u0092s so-called Dark Ages.\u0094\nIn 536 the Japanese Great King Senka wrote, \u0093Yellow gold and ten thousand strings of cash cannot cure hunger. What avails a thousand boxes of pearls to him who is starving of cold?\u0094\nHere is some more evidence from the book that there was a major global disaster in 535 AD.\n\u0093In the late 1960s an American tree-ring specialist, Valmore La Marche of the University of Arizona, collected a substantial number of high-altitude bristlecone-pine tree-ring samples from Campito Mountain in California. They showed a reduction in tree-ring width (i.e. tree growth), suggesting climatic deterioration, from 535/536 with a much more serious deterioration in 539. Growth did not then return to normality until the late 550s.\u0094\n\u0093In the 1980s, another American academic, Louis Scuderi of the University of Boston, collected a large number of foxtail-pine tree-ring samples from California\u0092s Sierra Nevada Mountains and these told a similar story, although the foxtail-pine data suggested that the period of climatic deterioration lasted even longer \u0085 almost 40 years\u0094.\n(Note: He does mention that low-altitude tree-ring evidence from New Mexico and Arizona shows no evidence of climatic problems in the years following 535).\n\u0093In Yucatan (south-east Mexico) \u0085 painstaking analysis of lake deposits over recent years has revealed evidence of a severe multi-decade (20 to 50 years) drought which seems to have started in the mid sixth century\u0085. The research carried out by scientists from the University of Florida and published in 1996 revealed that the sixth century drought was the first such event for almost 1,000 years and was not repeated for another three centuries.\u0094\n\u0093Tree-ring evidence from Scandinavia and western Europe also reveals a huge reduction in tree growth in the years 536-542, not recovering fully until the 550s.\u0094\n\u0093Tree-ring evidence from the British Isles shows that tree growth slowed down significantly in 535-536 and did not fully recover until 555\u0094.\n\u0093In South America, tree-ring data obtained from ancient Fitzroya conifer timbers have revealed that a dramatic cooling of temperature took place in AD 540\u0085 540 was the coldest summer for the past 1,600 years.\u0094\n\u0093Continuous tree-ring chronologies, going back to the 6th century AD and beyond, exist for Finland, Sweden, the British Isles, central Europe, the Aegean, Siberia, North America, Chile, Argentina and Tasmania. In a substantial percentage \u0085 the period 535 \u0096 550 stands out as a time of unusually low tree-ring growth. In several key chronologies, that 25-35 year period contains many of the narrowest ring sequences known for the past 2,000 years\u0085. From 538 or, in many places, 540, there was an almost universal massive decline lasting between two and eight years\u0085This was particularly marked in the Southern Hemisphere.\u0094\n(This next study is especially interesting because it suggests that the US government has been aware of the 535 disaster for some time and were prepared to spend a lot of money to study it): \u0093Back in 1983 a team of US scientists from Ohio State University\u0092s Institute of Polar Studies climbed onto Peru\u0092s 18,711-foot-high Quelccaya Glacier and succeeded in extracting two roughly 530-foot-long, 3.25\u0094 diameter ice-cores\u0085 Refrigeration equipment could not be flown in\u0085 (The ice-cores) had to be broken up into 6,000 2\u0094 long samples, each of which was packed in its own individual container and allowed to melt.\nThe Ohio team then had to carry the 6,000 samples down from the glacier using mountaineering ropes and crampons\u0085 The material finally arrived in Ohio\u0085The analysis revealed several episodes of dust storms, almost certainly caused by drought. By far the most intense and long-lasting episode, and the one that started most abruptly, was a period of drought which appears to have struck in the mid sixth century and to have lasted around 30 years.\u0094\n\u0093In Columbia\u0085an analysis by Columbian archaeologists Clemencia Plazas and Anna Falcheti revealed that the mid to late sixth century was the driest period in \u0085 3,300 years. From 100 BC to AD 1,000 the climate was almost uniformly wet \u0096 except for the mid to late sixth century.\u0094\n\u0093A recent total reassessment of the evidence has now led archaeologists to redate the collapse of the great Mexican city of Teotihuacan to the Sixth Century A.D\u0085.An American anthropologist, Rebecca Storey of the University of Houston, has analyzed data from more than 150 skeletons \u0085 Her findings reveal that in the years prior to the collapse, 68.3% of the working class population were dying before the age of 25, compared to 38.6% in more normal times.\u0094\nHe argues persuasively that it was this climatic disaster that indirectly caused the many plagues at that time, including the \u0091Great Death\u0092. Normally mice in wild areas in East Africa carry fleas which carry the plague harmlessly among wild animals. Keys believes that unnatural weather following the 535 incident, especially an excessive drought followed by excessive-rainfall, caused the spread of these rodents to other areas. Eventually the rodents met and passed the flea onto the black rat which normally did not have plague. The black rat in turn passed it onto humans. The plague reached Egypt in 1941. Trade in ivory by ships from Egypt to Europe carried the plague with it, killing whole cities. Up to 1/3 of the Roman Empire died horribly in the first massive outbreak of plague. People would get a sore on their body and be dead within 2 or 3 days. More died in subsequent outbreaks. Extrapolating from death rates of the much better recorded plague in the 14th Century, in Britain possibly somewhere between 60% and 90% died of plague, both peasants and members of the elite.\nThe 535 event was associated with some kind of dust / chemical pollution. In 541 the 13th Century British historian Roger of Wendover wrote, \u0093There dropped real blood from the clouds, and a dreadful mortality ensued.\u0094\n\u0093In China in 536 there was drought and famine and \u0093yellow dust rained like snow\u0085 The crops were ruined the following year by snow in August.\u0094\u0094\n\u0093Starting in the 530s, a horrific 32-year long drought devastated parts of South America.\u0094\nThe global catastrophe caused drought and flooding. Climactic extremes continued for roughly 30 years after the event.\n\u0093An analysis of British weather between 480 and 650 confirms that the period 535-555 was abnormally unstable.\u0094\nWhat caused the global cataclysm?\nKeys says that the disaster must have been caused by an asteroid impact of about 2.5 miles wide, a comet impact or a volcanic eruption. He gives a number of reasons why it was not an asteroid or comet. For example, the last time we got hit by a cosmic object of this size was 52 million years ago. Comets are also very rare. Both would have created at least a 25 mile wide crater or have produced such a tidal wave that would have rivaled Noah\u0092s flood. We do not know of either of these things happening so recently. Most importantly, neither would have produced enough dust to have darkened the sun for so long.\nThe most likely culprit is a super volcano, because in order to dim the sun, tons and tons of dust had to be thrown into the sky. A super volcano can do this by forcing huge quantities of sulphur into the stratosphere, which become sulphuric-acid aerosols, capable of staying aloft and directly changing the weather for several years.\nHere is more evidence that the Powers That Be know all about this and how important it is:\n\u0093In 1978, a joint Danish/Swiss/US Scientific team landed on the south-Greenland ice cap in several large freight aircraft specially fitted with giant skis. The planes \u0096 US military C130 Hercules \u0096 carried massive quantities of equipment, including generators, refrigeration units, prefabricated living quarters \u0096 and a huge drill.\nThis later piece of hardware was used to extract \u0096 in 6.5 foot lengths \u0096 some 1.25 miles of ice-core! In temperatures of between around 14 degrees Fahrenheit and minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit, engineers and scientist from Copenhagen University worked in three shifts, 24 hours a day, drilling deeper and deeper into the ice cap at roughly 400 feet per week.\nThen, early in the second year of the operation \u0085 the team extracted some lengths of core covering the second quarter of the sixth century AD. \u0085 Chemical analysis of this \u0085 ice revealed that there had been two substantial volcanic eruptions. These same eruptions were then detected in a second core drilled in summer 1990 in central Greenland.\nThe dating of ice-cores is at that time depth is only roughly accurate\u0085. For eruption (number) one the core gave an apparent date of 527\u0085 while the (other) core \u0085 yielded an apparent date of 530.\nThe volcanic explosion must have been very substantial, as evidence \u0085 shows that acid-rich snow was falling at the (first) site\u0085 in Greenland for more than two years and at the (other) site for at least a year.\nThe final clinching evidence, however, comes from 10,000 miles to the south \u0096 from deep inside the Antarctic ice cap. \u0085 Scientists, again using ice-cores, discovered evidence of a truly massive volcanic eruption. The ice-core material revealed that acid snow had cascaded down on the Antarctic for at least four years running\u0085.(This) occurred sometime between 490 and 540.\u0094\nIt is very possible that both Greenland and Antarctica events were the same event.\nSo, then the next question is, which volcano was the culprit?\nAfter putting a lot of different facts together, Keys pinpoints the culprit as \u0093Krakatoa, the notorious island mountain which brought death and destruction to Java and Sumatra in the 1880s. Could a former bigger eruption of Krakatoa have been responsible for the catastrophe that tormented the world in the mid sixth century AD?...\nBuried deep in a little-known and normally ignored Indonesian chronicle is an extraordinary passage \u0085 describing a huge volcanic event in the Sunda Straits area... where Krakatoa is located\u0085The earliest surviving manuscript of this chronicle dates form 1869\n\u0093There was a furious shaking of the earth, total darkness, thunder and lightning\u0085 Then came a furious gale together with torrential rain and a deadly storm darkened the entire world.\u0094\nThe chronicle \u0096 known as the \u0093Pustaka Raja Purwa (\u0091The book of Ancient Kings\u0092) \u0085 claims that the eruption was so massive that \u0085. \u0093After the water subsided the mountain (which had burst into pieces) and the surrounding land became sea and the (single) island (of Java/Sumatra) divided into two parts. This (event) was the origin of the separation of Sumatra and Java.\u0094 \u0093\nOne problem with this text is that it was written 1,300 years after the event. But Keys explains how it was possible that that information was a real event, and how it was recorded and passed down through the generations.\n\u0093One key piece of evidence (that this is a true record) is that volcanologists who have read the eruption account in the 1869 manuscript of \u0093The book Of Ancient Kings\u0094 say that it is a very good description of the type which almost certainly did occur in the Sunda Straits\u0085. They believe that neither western scientists nor Javanese scholars in the 1850s or 1860s would have had the geological data to reconstruct the probable sequence of events and geography.\u0094\nReconstructing the Eruption\n\u0093Typically, volcanic eruptions are preceded by increasingly frequent and violent tremors. Often, the larger the eruption, the longer the seismic run-up to it will be\u0085. Throughout the second half of 534 earthquakes would have struck the region at the rate of one or two a day. In the weeks immediately before the eruption , the rate would have accelerated to a peak of 50 per hour in the final 24 hours, mainly in the 1-3 Richter Scale range.\nAlthough it is a controversial proposal, it is geologically possible that Sumatra and Java were one island prior to the 535 super-eruption \u0096 exactly as the Javanese \u0093Book of Ancient Kings\u0094 describes. The 535 eruption would therefore have burst forth from a volcanic mountain\u0085..\n(In) the first phase of the eruption \u0085a vast cloud of ash would have billowed forth, followed by a column of read-hot magma\u0085The second phase began with a vast explosive event that shot even larger quantities of molten magma into the air at up to 1,500 mph \u0096 reaching heights of perhaps 30 miles\u0085 The shock wave from the explosion would have devastated everything in its path for up to 20 miles\u0085. The heat (would have) forced the ash cloud heavenwards. As the mushroom cloud increasingly blotted out the light of the sun, and day was turning into night, ash would have rained down on forests and fields alike up to 1,000 miles away\u0085The water-vapour component (in the stratosphere) would have condensed to tiny ice-crystals. It is estimated that the entire eruption may have generated up to 25 cubic miles of ice crystals, which, spread out in a thin layer in the stratosphere, would have caused sunlight diffraction and cooling over vast areas of the globe. Super-fine volcanic ash and huge quantities of sulphur and carbon dioxide would have had similar effects.

And the greatest secret of history, what you were never taught at school or college, is that our planet had a global catastrophe in living memory, in 535 AD. You won't find this information elsewhere on the internet either. Something happened which caused the light of the sun to be dimmed greatly around the globe for 18 months. During this time, many trees did not grow at all. This event was followed by 30 years of unprecedented droughts and some flooding. This caused the death of a vast percentage of the population through starvation and disease.\nIt is likely that the cause of this catastrophe was the eruption of the super volcano Krakatoa. (Note: The terms \"Super volcano\" is used for a volcano with hundreds of times the power of any that we have visually recorded in the past few hundred years. Use the term \"super volcano\" for further research). We now have two super volcanoes showing signs of getting ready to erupt. Each is bigger than Krakatoa. One is in Naples Italy and the other in Yellowstone USA. The Powers That Be know all this and are keeping this knowledge to themselves. That is probably one reason why they have so many DUMBS (Deep Underground Military Bases). They are planning to turn this knowledge to their own advantage to take control of us. However, with the knowledge of what may come in our life time, you can prepare so that you and your family are not affected.\n\u0093In AD 535/536 mankind was hit by one of the greatest natural disasters ever to occur \u0085. It blotted out much of the light and heat of the sun for 18 months and resulted, directly or indirectly in climatic chaos, famine, migration, war and massive political change on virtually every continent\u0094.\nThis is in the opening page of \u0093Catastrophe\u0094 by David Keys, 1999, a book that should have been on the best seller lists but very few people know of. The book took four years to write and research, and is extremely well researched. One can only assume that the Powers that Be are happy to keep this knowledge from the public. This article is an attempt to summarize that book and discuss some of the implications.\nThe contemporary Roman historian Procopius described the mystery climatic disaster: \u0093The sun gave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year.\u0094\nSixth century historian and prominent church leader John of Ephesus wrote of 535 AD in his \u0091Historiae Ecclesiasicae\u0092 (\u0091Church Histories\u0092), \u0093There was a sign from the sun, the like of which had never been seen and reported before. The sun became dark and its darkness lasted for 18 months. Each day, it shone for about four hours, and still this light was only a feeble shadow. Everyone declared that the sun would never recover its full light again.\u0094\nAnother 6th Century writer Zacharias of Mytilene wrote, \u0093The sun began to be darkened by day and the moon by night.\u0094\nA Roman official known as John the Lydian reported that \u0093the sun became dim for nearly the whole year.\u0094\nIn Italy a Senior local civil servant, Cassiodorus Sentaro wrote in 536, \u0093We marvel to see no shadows of ourselves at noon\u0085.We have had a spring without mildness and a summer without heat.\u0094\nAccording to Keys, this one global disaster directly or indirectly caused the deaths of a huge percentage of the world\u0092s population. It indirectly affected the politics on every continent and contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire. The 100-year period after it occurred is the heart of history\u0092s so-called Dark Ages.\u0094\nIn 536 the Japanese Great King Senka wrote, \u0093Yellow gold and ten thousand strings of cash cannot cure hunger. What avails a thousand boxes of pearls to him who is starving of cold?\u0094\nHere is some more evidence from the book that there was a major global disaster in 535 AD.\n\u0093In the late 1960s an American tree-ring specialist, Valmore La Marche of the University of Arizona, collected a substantial number of high-altitude bristlecone-pine tree-ring samples from Campito Mountain in California. They showed a reduction in tree-ring width (i.e. tree growth), suggesting climatic deterioration, from 535/536 with a much more serious deterioration in 539. Growth did not then return to normality until the late 550s.\u0094\n\u0093In the 1980s, another American academic, Louis Scuderi of the University of Boston, collected a large number of foxtail-pine tree-ring samples from California\u0092s Sierra Nevada Mountains and these told a similar story, although the foxtail-pine data suggested that the period of climatic deterioration lasted even longer \u0085 almost 40 years\u0094.\n(Note: He does mention that low-altitude tree-ring evidence from New Mexico and Arizona shows no evidence of climatic problems in the years following 535).\n\u0093In Yucatan (south-east Mexico) \u0085 painstaking analysis of lake deposits over recent years has revealed evidence of a severe multi-decade (20 to 50 years) drought which seems to have started in the mid sixth century\u0085. The research carried out by scientists from the University of Florida and published in 1996 revealed that the sixth century drought was the first such event for almost 1,000 years and was not repeated for another three centuries.\u0094\n\u0093Tree-ring evidence from Scandinavia and western Europe also reveals a huge reduction in tree growth in the years 536-542, not recovering fully until the 550s.\u0094\n\u0093Tree-ring evidence from the British Isles shows that tree growth slowed down significantly in 535-536 and did not fully recover until 555\u0094.\n\u0093In South America, tree-ring data obtained from ancient Fitzroya conifer timbers have revealed that a dramatic cooling of temperature took place in AD 540\u0085 540 was the coldest summer for the past 1,600 years.\u0094\n\u0093Continuous tree-ring chronologies, going back to the 6th century AD and beyond, exist for Finland, Sweden, the British Isles, central Europe, the Aegean, Siberia, North America, Chile, Argentina and Tasmania. In a substantial percentage \u0085 the period 535 \u0096 550 stands out as a time of unusually low tree-ring growth. In several key chronologies, that 25-35 year period contains many of the narrowest ring sequences known for the past 2,000 years\u0085. From 538 or, in many places, 540, there was an almost universal massive decline lasting between two and eight years\u0085This was particularly marked in the Southern Hemisphere.\u0094\n(This next study is especially interesting because it suggests that the US government has been aware of the 535 disaster for some time and were prepared to spend a lot of money to study it): \u0093Back in 1983 a team of US scientists from Ohio State University\u0092s Institute of Polar Studies climbed onto Peru\u0092s 18,711-foot-high Quelccaya Glacier and succeeded in extracting two roughly 530-foot-long, 3.25\u0094 diameter ice-cores\u0085 Refrigeration equipment could not be flown in\u0085 (The ice-cores) had to be broken up into 6,000 2\u0094 long samples, each of which was packed in its own individual container and allowed to melt.\nThe Ohio team then had to carry the 6,000 samples down from the glacier using mountaineering ropes and crampons\u0085 The material finally arrived in Ohio\u0085The analysis revealed several episodes of dust storms, almost certainly caused by drought. By far the most intense and long-lasting episode, and the one that started most abruptly, was a period of drought which appears to have struck in the mid sixth century and to have lasted around 30 years.\u0094\n\u0093In Columbia\u0085an analysis by Columbian archaeologists Clemencia Plazas and Anna Falcheti revealed that the mid to late sixth century was the driest period in \u0085 3,300 years. From 100 BC to AD 1,000 the climate was almost uniformly wet \u0096 except for the mid to late sixth century.\u0094\n\u0093A recent total reassessment of the evidence has now led archaeologists to redate the collapse of the great Mexican city of Teotihuacan to the Sixth Century A.D\u0085.An American anthropologist, Rebecca Storey of the University of Houston, has analyzed data from more than 150 skeletons \u0085 Her findings reveal that in the years prior to the collapse, 68.3% of the working class population were dying before the age of 25, compared to 38.6% in more normal times.\u0094\nHe argues persuasively that it was this climatic disaster that indirectly caused the many plagues at that time, including the \u0091Great Death\u0092. Normally mice in wild areas in East Africa carry fleas which carry the plague harmlessly among wild animals. Keys believes that unnatural weather following the 535 incident, especially an excessive drought followed by excessive-rainfall, caused the spread of these rodents to other areas. Eventually the rodents met and passed the flea onto the black rat which normally did not have plague. The black rat in turn passed it onto humans. The plague reached Egypt in 1941. Trade in ivory by ships from Egypt to Europe carried the plague with it, killing whole cities. Up to 1/3 of the Roman Empire died horribly in the first massive outbreak of plague. People would get a sore on their body and be dead within 2 or 3 days. More died in subsequent outbreaks. Extrapolating from death rates of the much better recorded plague in the 14th Century, in Britain possibly somewhere between 60% and 90% died of plague, both peasants and members of the elite.\nThe 535 event was associated with some kind of dust / chemical pollution. In 541 the 13th Century British historian Roger of Wendover wrote, \u0093There dropped real blood from the clouds, and a dreadful mortality ensued.\u0094\n\u0093In China in 536 there was drought and famine and \u0093yellow dust rained like snow\u0085 The crops were ruined the following year by snow in August.\u0094\u0094\n\u0093Starting in the 530s, a horrific 32-year long drought devastated parts of South America.\u0094\nThe global catastrophe caused drought and flooding. Climactic extremes continued for roughly 30 years after the event.\n\u0093An analysis of British weather between 480 and 650 confirms that the period 535-555 was abnormally unstable.\u0094\nWhat caused the global cataclysm?\nKeys says that the disaster must have been caused by an asteroid impact of about 2.5 miles wide, a comet impact or a volcanic eruption. He gives a number of reasons why it was not an asteroid or comet. For example, the last time we got hit by a cosmic object of this size was 52 million years ago. Comets are also very rare. Both would have created at least a 25 mile wide crater or have produced such a tidal wave that would have rivaled Noah\u0092s flood. We do not know of either of these things happening so recently. Most importantly, neither would have produced enough dust to have darkened the sun for so long.\nThe most likely culprit is a super volcano, because in order to dim the sun, tons and tons of dust had to be thrown into the sky. A super volcano can do this by forcing huge quantities of sulphur into the stratosphere, which become sulphuric-acid aerosols, capable of staying aloft and directly changing the weather for several years.\nHere is more evidence that the Powers That Be know all about this and how important it is:\n\u0093In 1978, a joint Danish/Swiss/US Scientific team landed on the south-Greenland ice cap in several large freight aircraft specially fitted with giant skis. The planes \u0096 US military C130 Hercules \u0096 carried massive quantities of equipment, including generators, refrigeration units, prefabricated living quarters \u0096 and a huge drill.\nThis later piece of hardware was used to extract \u0096 in 6.5 foot lengths \u0096 some 1.25 miles of ice-core! In temperatures of between around 14 degrees Fahrenheit and minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit, engineers and scientist from Copenhagen University worked in three shifts, 24 hours a day, drilling deeper and deeper into the ice cap at roughly 400 feet per week.\nThen, early in the second year of the operation \u0085 the team extracted some lengths of core covering the second quarter of the sixth century AD. \u0085 Chemical analysis of this \u0085 ice revealed that there had been two substantial volcanic eruptions. These same eruptions were then detected in a second core drilled in summer 1990 in central Greenland.\nThe dating of ice-cores is at that time depth is only roughly accurate\u0085. For eruption (number) one the core gave an apparent date of 527\u0085 while the (other) core \u0085 yielded an apparent date of 530.\nThe volcanic explosion must have been very substantial, as evidence \u0085 shows that acid-rich snow was falling at the (first) site\u0085 in Greenland for more than two years and at the (other) site for at least a year.\nThe final clinching evidence, however, comes from 10,000 miles to the south \u0096 from deep inside the Antarctic ice cap. \u0085 Scientists, again using ice-cores, discovered evidence of a truly massive volcanic eruption. The ice-core material revealed that acid snow had cascaded down on the Antarctic for at least four years running\u0085.(This) occurred sometime between 490 and 540.\u0094\nIt is very possible that both Greenland and Antarctica events were the same event.\nSo, then the next question is, which volcano was the culprit?\nAfter putting a lot of different facts together, Keys pinpoints the culprit as \u0093Krakatoa, the notorious island mountain which brought death and destruction to Java and Sumatra in the 1880s. Could a former bigger eruption of Krakatoa have been responsible for the catastrophe that tormented the world in the mid sixth century AD?...\nBuried deep in a little-known and normally ignored Indonesian chronicle is an extraordinary passage \u0085 describing a huge volcanic event in the Sunda Straits area... where Krakatoa is located\u0085The earliest surviving manuscript of this chronicle dates form 1869\n\u0093There was a furious shaking of the earth, total darkness, thunder and lightning\u0085 Then came a furious gale together with torrential rain and a deadly storm darkened the entire world.\u0094\nThe chronicle \u0096 known as the \u0093Pustaka Raja Purwa (\u0091The book of Ancient Kings\u0092) \u0085 claims that the eruption was so massive that \u0085. \u0093After the water subsided the mountain (which had burst into pieces) and the surrounding land became sea and the (single) island (of Java/Sumatra) divided into two parts. This (event) was the origin of the separation of Sumatra and Java.\u0094 \u0093\nOne problem with this text is that it was written 1,300 years after the event. But Keys explains how it was possible that that information was a real event, and how it was recorded and passed down through the generations.\n\u0093One key piece of evidence (that this is a true record) is that volcanologists who have read the eruption account in the 1869 manuscript of \u0093The book Of Ancient Kings\u0094 say that it is a very good description of the type which almost certainly did occur in the Sunda Straits\u0085. They believe that neither western scientists nor Javanese scholars in the 1850s or 1860s would have had the geological data to reconstruct the probable sequence of events and geography.\u0094\nReconstructing the Eruption\n\u0093Typically, volcanic eruptions are preceded by increasingly frequent and violent tremors. Often, the larger the eruption, the longer the seismic run-up to it will be\u0085. Throughout the second half of 534 earthquakes would have struck the region at the rate of one or two a day. In the weeks immediately before the eruption , the rate would have accelerated to a peak of 50 per hour in the final 24 hours, mainly in the 1-3 Richter Scale range.\nAlthough it is a controversial proposal, it is geologically possible that Sumatra and Java were one island prior to the 535 super-eruption \u0096 exactly as the Javanese \u0093Book of Ancient Kings\u0094 describes. The 535 eruption would therefore have burst forth from a volcanic mountain\u0085..\n(In) the first phase of the eruption \u0085a vast cloud of ash would have billowed forth, followed by a column of read-hot magma\u0085The second phase began with a vast explosive event that shot even larger quantities of molten magma into the air at up to 1,500 mph \u0096 reaching heights of perhaps 30 miles\u0085 The shock wave from the explosion would have devastated everything in its path for up to 20 miles\u0085. The heat (would have) forced the ash cloud heavenwards. As the mushroom cloud increasingly blotted out the light of the sun, and day was turning into night, ash would have rained down on forests and fields alike up to 1,000 miles away\u0085The water-vapour component (in the stratosphere) would have condensed to tiny ice-crystals. It is estimated that the entire eruption may have generated up to 25 cubic miles of ice crystals, which, spread out in a thin layer in the stratosphere, would have caused sunlight diffraction and cooling over vast areas of the globe. Super-fine volcanic ash and huge quantities of sulphur and carbon dioxide would have had similar effects. Unlike ordinary volcanic ash, which falls to the earth within a few months, hydro-volcanic ash, high-altitude frozen-water-crystal clouds and sulphuric-acid and carbon-dioxide aerosols (minute drops) can stay in the stratosphere for years.\nIn the second phase part of the mushroom cloud would \u0085 have collapsed back, spreading horizontally\u0085This hot, poisonous wall of destruction would have moved outwards to perhaps as much as 40 miles\u0085killing anything in its path.\u0094\nIn the third phase, even more explosions etc. would have happened. Because the magma chamber was empty, the land fell downwards and the sea rushed in.\nThis affected the sunlight, and the weather, for years to come. This in turn affected the food and water supply of everyone on the planet.\n\u0093Today, all that is left of this massive collapse is a 25-mile diameter, mainly underwater caldera\n\u0093Krakatoa \u0085 is among the half-dozen largest calderas \u0085 in the world.\u0094\n\u0093Procopius, referring to the darkened sun, later wrote that \u0093from the time this thing happened, men were not free from war, nor pestilence, nor anything leading to death.\u0094\nCould such a catastrophe happen again?\nIn Yellowstone National Park is the world\u0092s largest dormant volcano. It covers 1,500 square miles. It will almost certainly one day burst forth upon the world as Krakatoa did. \u0093It appears to erupt roughly once every 600,000 \u0096 700,000 yeas \u0096 and the last eruption was exactly 630,000 years ago\u0085. What\u0092s more, the last decade has seen a substantial increase in potential pre-eruption activity\u0094.\nKeys wrote in 1999: \u0093Since 1988, upward pressure exerted by the magma reservoir and magma-heated water-vapour has forced hundreds of square miles of land to rise by three feet\u0085.\nAnother potential catastrophe is a currently dormant super-volcano in Long Valley, California. Keys wrote in 1999: \u0093Over the past 20 years, this too appears to have become progressively less stable\u0085.What\u0092s more, earthquake clusters are becoming much more intensive\nBeneath Naples in Italy is another super volcano. \u0093Since 1969, pressure from this magma has caused land to rise and fall twice \u0096 by almost 6.5 feet. In the early 1980s, it generated up to 300 small earthquakes per week. It\u0092s been known to have erupted catyclysmically twice \u0096 once 37,000 years ago\u0085 and once 12,000 years ago\u0085.\nThe fourth truly major volcanic caldera currently displaying ominous signs of increasing restlessness is that of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea\u0085. Five other large potentially active caldera volcanoes exist in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands and Mexico\u0085.If any one of these volcanoes explode, world climate would be plunged into chaos, precisely as it was in the sixth century\u0094.\nKeys says that when Yellowstone blows, Las Vegas and Phoenix will be covered with a three foot layer of ash. He doesn\u0092t say so, but I presume this would suffocate anyone in the area who did not have an oxygen supply for several weeks.\nSat Mar 03, 2012 1:50 am\nTigercat\n"}]]}
