While some foods could be cooked on either of these, some do better on one over the other.\nThe best way to tell them apart is that a griddle has a flat surface, whereas a grill has raised ridges that have two functions.

Though some may seem similar, not all food processors have the same function, and these differences become very important when you are considering buying one.\nPlease note that though I've listed the typical function of each type, not all models include blades or discs for each function. This is merely to indicate that some tools are more commonly designed for one function or another, but exceptions do exist.\nBlenders - Blending, Mixing\nThough some models have processing functions or attachments for chopping, most blenders can only blend or mix soft foods or liquids. Depending on the blade, some models can crush ice for blended frozen drinks.\nCompare prices\nHand-Operated Food Choppers - Chopping, Dicing\nThis is the kind of chopper where you place the onion or vegetable in small portions either in the unit or on a cutting board, and a hand slap on the top springs the blade assembly into action to chop. Some models have a rotary hand-turn operation. Inexpensive, easy to store and operate, these small choppers can be very convenient for quick, small chopping/dicing tasks.\nCompare prices\nMandolines - Slicing, Shedding, Grating\nThese range from plastic varieties to quality stainless steel units that usually include different sizes of cutting blades for slicing, grating or shredding. The process is usually done by moving the vegetables back and forth over the cutting blades. It's a quick, manual process with a mandoline that is reasonably easy to store and use. The process does not usually include chopping.\nCompare prices\nCheese Graters - Grating\nThese are mostly manual and come in various styles for grating cheese and most households have more than one shape or size. The most common is the box type where the grated cheese accumulates in the center of the grater, but the fun rotary style that is used in restaurants for hard cheeses such as parmesan, has become a family dinner favorite. Electric food processors (described below), may have a disc that can be used for grating large quantities of cheese.\nCompare prices\nCoffee Grinders - Grinding Coffee Beans\nDue to the shape of the cutter and design of the appliance, coffee grinders should be used only for grinding fresh coffee beans. They're small, economical and practical appliances for grinding your own beans to improve the taste of your coffee. There are some coffee makers that are designed with a built-in coffee grinder.\nCompare prices\nVegetable or Meat Grinders - Grinding\nThese come in electric and manual models and though they are very useful kitchen tools, their function is mainly to grind with a variety of discs for fine to coarse grinding.\nCompare prices\nHand-Operated Ricers - Ricing\nOnce used merely for ricing potatoes, creative cooks have expanded on this decades-old kitchen tool, using it to push through other soft cooked vegetables or fresh noodles.\nCompare prices\nJuicers - Separate Juice from Pulp\nThough juicers do process fruits and vegetables, they merely remove the juice from the pulp, something a food processor cannot do. Electric juicers are more popular than manual models since they require less effort, but are more expensive.\n"}, {"score": 1532.7333, "uuid": "1c5a3573-a216-516f-8c5e-a345c94bb07d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-72-36592", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/blendersprocessors/tp/Blender-Find-The-Best-Kitchen-Blender.htm", "page_rank": 1.2750204e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Blender</em> - Find <em>the</em> Best Kitchen <em>Blender</em>", "snippet": "<em>A</em> <em>food</em> <em>processor</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> handy and time-saving appliance, but before buying one, there are <em>a</em> few things to consider so that you buy <em>the</em> size and type that meets your particular <em>food</em> prep needs. <em>What</em> to do if your appliance has been recalled or you&#x27;ve upgrade to <em>a</em> new model.", "explanation": null, "document": "Kitchen Blender - Definition and Use\nCounter or Stand Blenders:\nThey are the most common style of blenders, have a stand-alone design with a jug/jar to blend the foods in.

They typically have an upright design in which food is pushed into a rapidly spinning mesh chamber with sharp teeth on its floor. The teeth shred the food into a pulp, and the centrifugal motion pulls the juice out of the pulp and through the mesh filter, where it is funneled out of the juicer via a spigot. In most centrifugal juicers, the pulp, once most of the juice has been pulled out, is ejected into a separate collection chamber. Centrifugal juicers work best with soft and hard fruits and vegetables, but not quite as well with leafy greens like kale or spinach, or with wheatgrass. Inexpensive centrifugal juicers can be found for as little as $40 or as much as $500, with most good-quality models ranging in price from $100 to $150. Popular centrifugal juicers include Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer, Breville, Hamilton Beach, Juiceman and L'Equip.\nMasticating juicers, meanwhile, typically have a horizontal design in which a tube containing the auger extends out of motorized base. Pieces of fruits and vegetables are pushed into the top of the tube, and they are crushed and squeezed by the auger. Juice drains out of the underside of the tube, while the pulp is squeezed out at the end of the tube. Because of the slower crushing and squeezing action, masticating juicers can process leafy greens and wheatgrass, and the juice that they produce will last much longer than juice made in a centrifugal juicer, which should be consumed right away as it starts losing nutrients nearly immediately. Masticating juicers are pricier than centrifugal models; starting at around $230 for most models. Some of the brands to look for are Champion, Omega, Lexen, Samson and Green Star.\nA new breed of juicers is emerging, the slow juicer or upright juicer. This type of juicer has an upright design similar to centrifugal juicers, but operates similar to the masticating juicer, with the auger or gear that crushes the food and presses out the juice. While pricey (around $350), these slow juicers are said to extract even more nutrients and juice than existing masticating models, and have the advantage of taking up less of a footprint on the counter than either of the other types of models. Hurom and Omega are among the brands making an upright, or slow, juicer.\nHealthy Cooking Equipment\n"}, {"score": 1690.9373, "uuid": "8b108070-4cb6-5577-ad66-95fa59cabad9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000wb-35-23662", "target_hostname": "www.differencebetween.com", "target_uri": "http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-virtual-and-vs-abstract/", "page_rank": 1.1705842e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Virtual and Abstract | <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em>", "snippet": "<em>What</em> all this means <em>is</em> that, when <em>the</em> programmer nominates <em>a</em> class as an Abstract, she <em>is</em> saying that <em>the</em> class will be incomplete and it will have elements that need to be completed by <em>the</em> inheriting subclasses.", "explanation": null, "document": "Apr 30th, 2011 | By Roshan Ragel\nemail\nVirtual vs Abstract\nVirtual and Abstract are two keywords used in most Object Oriented (OO) programming languages such as Java and C#. Although there are slight differences in what it means in different languages, both Virtual and Abstract keywords provide a sense of partial implementation to the entities it attaches to.\nAbstract\nTypically, Abstract classes, also known as Abstract Base Classes (ABC), cannot be instantiated (an instance of that class cannot be created). So, Abstract classes are only meaningful to have if the programming language supports inheritance (ability to create subclasses from extending a class). Abstract classes usually represent an abstract concept or entity with partial or no implementation. Therefore, Abstract classes act as parent classes from which child classes are derived, so that the child class will share the incomplete features of the parent class and functionality can be added to complete them. Abstract classes may contain Abstract methods. Subclasses extending an abstract class may implement these (inherited) Abstract methods. If the child class implements all such Abstract methods, it is a concrete class. But if it does not, the child class also becomes an Abstract class. What all this means is that, when the programmer nominates a class as an Abstract, she is saying that the class will be incomplete and it will have elements that need to be completed by the inheriting subclasses. This is a nice way to create a contract between two programmers, which simplifies tasks in software development. The programmer, who writes code to inherit, needs to follow the method definitions exactly (but of course can have her own implementation). In Java and C#, Abstract classes and methods are declared using Abstract keyword.\nVirtual\nVirtual methods/functions provide the ability to optionally override its behavior by an inheriting class (using a function with the same signature). The concept of Virtual function is important in the following scenario. Suppose a class is derived by a child class, then whenever an object of the derived class is used, it may refer to an object of the base class or the derived class. But, method call behavior can be ambiguous if the base class methods are overridden. So, in order to resolve this ambiguity, Virtual keyword is used. If the method is marked Virtual, then the derived class\u2019s function is called (if any) or else the base class\u2019s function is called. For example, in C++, Virtual keyword is used exactly for this purpose. In C#, the Virtual keyword is used in a similar way, but in addition, the keyword override should be used to modify all overridden methods. But in Java, there is no explicit Virtual keyword. All non-static methods are considered Virtual. Virtual functions with no body are called Pure Virtual functions. In Java and C#, Abstract methods are in fact Pure Virtual.\nDifference between Virtual and Abstract\nAlthough Abstract and Virtual are two keywords/concepts that provide a meaning of incomplete implementation to its associated entities, they do have their differences. Abstract methods (that must be defined inside Abstract classes) do not have an implementation at all, while Virtual methods may have an implementation. If Abstract methods are extended by a concrete class, all inherited Abstract methods must be implemented, while inherited Virtual methods may or may not be overridden.\nRelated posts:\n"}, {"score":

with a diminutive blade for performing small tasks.\u00c2 This latter feature is very handy.\u00c2 In fact, if your food processor does not come with an insertable, bantam sidekick, I strongly recommend you acquire a separate mini processor. \u00c2 Quite simply, a small bowl and blade will process limited quantities more proficiently.\u00c2 Mini processors are especially good for grinding a meager amount of spices or producing a few servings of a salad dressing.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 While most people appreciate the time and labor that food processors save, they do have their limitations.\u00c2 First, they don\u2019t handle liquids as well as solid or semi-solid concoctions.\u00c2 The more fluid the medium, the better off you are with a blender.\u00c2\nSecond, they don\u2019t always process uniformly.\u00c2 Sometimes part of the food is finely minced while sections further from the blade exhibit larger pieces.\u00c2 This can be mitigated by not overfilling the processor, intermittently pulsing it as opposed to continuous motion, and scraping down the sides between pulses. \u201cPulsing\u201d the food refers to a mechanism on virtually all food processors whereby you can briefly spin the blade by holding down a spring loaded button that disengages upon release.\u00c2 This is in contrast to the standard buttons that when engaged create constant operation. \u00c2\nBased on the target dish however, the inconsistency of the food may not be an issue.\u00c2 For example, if you were chopping items for a soup that will eventually be pureed, some variation in size is academic.\u00c2 However, if your food preparation requires a higher degree of perfection or aesthetic uniformity, then cutting everything by hand is the only way to go.\u00c2\nFinally, food processors have a tendency to pulverize items. \u00c2 Food can be rendered somewhat mushy as opposed to a chef\u2019s knife which can create finely minced pieces that maintain their structural integrity, albeit at the expense of more time and labor.\u00c2 The pulverization factor can be alleviated somewhat by again, intermittent pulses.\u00c2 Of course, depending on the recipe in question, homogenizing the ingredients might be the goal, such as when making a mousse.\u00c2 On the other hand, overworking certain ingredients can alter their taste.\u00c2 Case in point: \u00c2 there is a distinct difference in taste, (and texture), in salsa made in a food processor vs. salsa produced by chopping every ingredient by hand.\u00c2 Another poignant example is fresh herbs such as cilantro, parsley, or basil.\u00c2 Their \u201cprocessed\u201d counterparts can\u2019t compare with the hand cut.\u00c2 Onions, while OK to cut with the processor\u2019s slicing blade, tend to lose something when chopped with the regular blade.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Despite the aforementioned limitations, food processors remain ideal for numerous preparations.\u00c2 Here\u2019s a list of very common uses, which certainly isn\u2019t exhaustive.\n\u00c2\nSLICING, CHOPPING, GRATING & SHREDDING\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 The first and foremost use of a food processor is to chop and slice.\u00c2 As stated, various blade attachments allow for different sized cuts.\u00c2 There\u2019s usually blades that grate and shred as well which is extremely handy for grating and shredding cheese. \u00c2 If you have a sizeable amount of ingredients to fabricate and perfect uniformity is not an issue, nothing beats a food processor\u2019s primary function.\n\u00c2\nDRESSINGS\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Place all the ingredients for the dressing except the oil in the processor first.\u00c2 Attach the lid with an opening that allows for the pouring in of liquid.\u00c2 Whiz the base ingredients first and then slowly poor in the oil in a steady stream until everything is emulsified.\n\u00c2\nMAKING DOUGH\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 This is so much better than using a dough cutter or a fork.\u00c2 Add the flour and any other dry ingredients (such as salt, baking soda or powder, sugar, etc.) and give it a quick pulse.\u00c2 Add the butter or shortening and pulse until the desired consistency is achieved.\u00c2 Then add the fluid in small increments, gently pulsing, just until the dough comes together.\n\u00c2\nGRINDING MEAT\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Making your own ground meat is a good idea on so many levels.\u00c2 First, if you\u2019re a germaphobe, homemade ground beef is safer.\u00c2 Not that standard ground beef is dangerous but if you have a need to push the food safety factor to the nth degree, then grind your own.\u00c2 Second you have complete control over what types of meat will comprise your admixture.\u00c2 Supermarket ground meats can be an amalgamation of every miscellaneous scrap lying around the meat department.\u00c2 By purchasing whole pieces of chuck, sirloin, round, etc., you can tailor your recipe exactly.\u00c2 Finally, buying meat whole and grinding it yourself will produce a fresher, better flavor.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 A meat grinder, either an old-fashioned hand-cranked model or the kind that attaches to an electric mixer, is the best tool for the job.\u00c2 But it can be done in a food processor.\u00c2 You must be careful to pulse it gently so you don\u2019t obliterate the meat and create a paste.\u00c2 Cut the whole meat into manageable chunks first before adding it to the processor.\u00c2 It will process more smoothly and consistently than one large piece.\n\u00c2\nMOUSSES, P\u00c2T\u00c9S & SPREADS\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 Now here\u2019s where we want to pulverize ingredients into a smooth puree.\u00c2 A food processor excels for these spreadable comestibles.\u00c2 These items can vary a great deal in terms of their ingredients and procedural order.\u00c2 Simply follow your particular recipe.\u00c2 Here you don\u2019t need to pulse gently.\u00c2 However, don\u2019t overfill the bowl and definitely scrape down the sides once or twice to ensure everything is fully incorporated.\n\u00c2\nMAKING SPICE MIXTURES\n\u00c2\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2 If your spice mixture must be very finely ground, then an actual spice grinder will likely do the best job, especially for small amounts.\u00c2 But for a slightly coarser grind, especially a larger quantity, a food processor is adequate.\u00c2 I like to make my own ground hot pepper that I either add to food as is, or mix with oil to produce chile oil.\u00c2 I place a large handful of dried chiles in the processor and whiz them until ground.\nCopyright\n"}, {"score": 1428.9307, "uuid": "f822ebf1-f7ef-503a-8270-0fd248e6e801", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-04-26763", "target_hostname":

pieces of whole fruit, frozen fruits, hard vegetables and a lot of ice with ease. But do you need to buy a special smoothie blender in order to make great smoothies?\nThe answer depends on how often you make smoothies. If you plan on making smoothies more than once a week, it might be worth investing in a smoothie blender. But first, I recommend that you try the tools you already have.\nWhy Buy a Smoothie Blender\nThe big advantage to buying a smoothie blender is that they are powerful machines. You can make smoothies with frozen fruit (my preferred way to get that icy texture), because the smoothie blender can easily turn that frozen fruit into an icy milkshake-style smoothie in seconds.\nLikewise, smoothie blenders can turn whole fruits into drinkable smoothies or juices in a flash.\nThe Best Smoothie Blenders to Buy\nThe two leading smoothie blenders are the Blendtec (compare prices) and the Vitamix (compare prices) . Both of these blenders do an excellent job of crushing ice, frozen fruit, whole fruits and vegetables. Both of these blenders also have additional uses, including making salsa, pesto, nut butters and pureeing soups. And both of these blenders come with BPA-free pitchers.\nThe differences between the Blendtec and Vitamix are small - the key question is whether you want to spend the money on a smoothie blender at all.\nBlendtec vs. Vitamix - Which Is Better?\nThe Drawbacks of Smoothie Blenders\nThe biggest drawback of buying a smoothie blender is price. They typically cost $350-$500. The other drawbacks are height (some smoothie blenders are too tall to fit on countertops under kitchen cabinets) and noise (the two most popular smoothie blenders are very noisy).\nBecause these smoothie blenders perform many of the functions of other kitchen tools, such as an immersion blender, food processor, regular blender, chopper, etc., they can be quite useful if you make the investment. But if you already own these other tools, it may make sense to use them to start out with.\nA regular blender, such as a KitchenAid 5-speed blender (compare prices) , can perform the job of crushing ice very well. If you don't mind thinner smoothies, this is a good way to go.\nDon't have a regular blender? A food processor, such as the Cuisinart DLC Prep Food Processor (compare prices) can perform most of the tasks of a smoothie blender with ease.\nThe big drawback is that a food processor typically has a wide bowl and isn't really suited to pouring easily. But it's a good way to see if you do enjoy making smoothies often. And if so, you can always buy a smoothie blender then.\nComing up tomorrow\n"}], [{"score": 1340.4946, "uuid": "4a4031e2-aa65-5ecb-b24d-6b85a4d57e71", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-01-00005", "target_hostname": "cookingequipment.about.com", "target_uri": "http://cookingequipment.about.com/od/icecreammachines/f/gelatovicecream.htm", "page_rank": 4.7687707e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Ice Cream \u2013 What&#x27;s <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> gelato and ice cream?", "snippet": "What&#x27;s <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> gelato and ice cream?

Is there really any difference between gelato and ice cream?\nAnswer:\nIf you've ever visited Italy, you probably experienced creamy, delicious gelato. And maybe you assumed that the only reason it seemed richer and more intensely flavored than American ice cream back home was because you were enjoying it on the foot of the Spanish Steps in Rome, rather than on your couch back home.\nBut there are actually a few main differences between gelato and ice cream. To find out, I asked Alon Balshan, owner of Alon's Bakery and Market in Atlanta, whose own gelato is quickly becoming a favorite among frozen-treat connoisseurs there.\nAlon explained to me that while ice cream legally has a minimum of 10 percent fat, gelato is made with a greater proportion of whole milk to cream, so it contains more like five to seven percent fat.\nBut don't expect to be able to get Italian gelateria-style results by making a gelato recipe in your home ice cream machine: Alon also said that gelato is churned at a slower speed than ice cream, so it's denser because not as much air is whipped into the mixture. (Gelato contains about 25 to 30 percent air, while ice cream can contain as much as 50 percent air) Finally, while ice cream is typically served frozen, gelato is typically stored and served at a slightly warmer temperature, so it's not quite completely frozen.\nAs for that amazing, rich flavor, Alon says, \"Since there's not as much fat in gelato, it doesn't coat the mouth in the same way. So the flavors are more intense.\"\nBut one thing ice cream and gelato do have in common: you won't be able to resist just one more scoop!\nDo you like to make ice cream or gelato at home?

Our family started drinking green smoohies a few months ago and with our cheap blender and they were pretty good. Once I knew this was going to be a habit I purchased the Blend Tec and the smoothies are 100x better. I use the blender every day; sometimes twice. I have used it to mix baking ingredients and love the recipes it comes with. This is a must buy!\nI wanted a heavy-duty blender to make vegetable and fruit juices, and this baby fit the bill. Yes, it is terribly loud, but it really works, and it's super easy to clean. I've been using it daily and feeling good about the impact it's having on my health.\nI've repeatedly tried to dramatically increase my consumption of raw fruits and greens with little success. It is extremely difficult to chew large quantities of produce. Blended food is the answer. I have prepared all manner of concoctions using the Blentec blender The Blendtec works as advertised. My drinks, smoothies and sauces are blended to smooth perfection in a remarkably short period of time. I definitely recommend getting the 96 oz container. I prepare food for one, sometimes two, and find the larger size to be perfect. The container is also very easy to clean. The product is expensive, but it works very, very well. I use it several times a day. Think of it this way: instead of cooking your food on a stove or in an oven, you are processing the food in a blender. You are essentially cooking without heat.\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nmuch-needed vegetables Review by Katrina\nRating\nI was advised by my doctor to dramatically increase my veg and fruit consumption due to an auto-immune disorder. My existing blender, while perfectly okay for most things, could not produce a raw whole food smoothie that didn't require chewing. Chewing your juice is just wrong! I purchased this blender hoping to solve the deal breaking chewing issue. I couldn't be happier with this machine.\nHere are a few of my favorite things about it:\n1. It is able to fit on my counter under my upper cabinets (something VitaMix can't do)\n2. The \"blade\" inside isn't sharp, at all, making cleanup a snap since you don't have to be very careful.\n3. Preprogrammed buttons for the most popular tasks make it very simple to hit a button and let it do its thing.\n4. You don't have to hold onto the machine, the pitcher, or the lid while it works it's way quickly through pretty much whatever you put in it.\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nGetting healthy! Review by Duncan\nRating\nI got this one month ago. I have used it every day, usually two or three times. I have been intrigued by the ideas of the green smoothies for some time and have extensively researched blender options. I chose the Blendtec over the VitaMix because of the lower height of the machine, and the computerized blending options.\nIt was expensive, and my wife was not thrilled at first, but she is a believer now. I put it to her this way: I know I'll continue to use this because every morning I get to drink something that gives me as much satisfaction as a large Dairy Queen banana shake, but with the benefit of being healthy!\nI dropped 17 pounds this month and know that more is on the way. You probably can't go wrong with either this or the VitaMix, but I can tell you with certainty that I'm very pleased with this choice!\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nWow Review by Lora\nRating\nWell... I didn't read the instructions before first use. I used the pulse button to make the first green smoothie. I thought the blender was good.\nThen I sat down and read the manual. The next day, I used the smoothie button (preprogrammed to button 2). It started out innocently enough, speeding up and slowing down to let the mixture settle down, it kicked up a notch or two on the last 10 seconds of the countdown, then at the 5 second remaining mark, good lord! It ramped up to maximum rpm. Make sure the lid is on tight because everything in there may leap out. Wow.\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nblending newbie Review by Ted Wiloch\nRating\nBlendtec blenders are absolutely satisfying. I am happy that I made my purchase. Since getting it, I am more excited about eating healthy meals. I make my famous morning smoothies every morning, and I usually make a green smoothie in the evening. The performance has been outstanding, and I am still learning more and more about the product. I am just getting started!\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nReally too much Review by Kristen\nRating\nI was impressed with the Blendtec's power, but it fell short of my expectations in versatility. It works great for smoothies and juices which is the main reason we bought it, but when I've tried using it for something like mayonnaise I could find no suitable setting. Even on the lowest speed setting the Blendtec only pulsates. When trying to chop up mushrooms or other veggies I found that the pulse setting doesn't have a fast enough burst and when it does get going the speed is so fast that everything just ends up pureed. When I need a more gentle touch I have to pull out my old blender. It would be nice if the Blendtec had a few simple manual options. I would chose a Vitamix if I had to do it over again. I prefer simplicity.\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\namazing Review by Rene\nRating\nMy wife and I (especially her) have been waiting for a while to get a really nice blender, and this does not disappoint! It works just as it says it does. Everything is blended perfectly, the interface is easy to use, the lid stays put. We made strawberry daiquiris the first night. You couldn't even feel the seeds-- the frozen strawberries were just demolished in a matter of seconds. It has been awesome!\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nvery good blender Review by Greg Cromar\nRating\nThis did blend well, but it has too many shortcomings to be better than my Vitamix. I returned it after a few weeks of using it. I figured most people looking at this machine are between the Vitamix and the Blendtec. I talked my parents into getting one (they love it too), and I am now getting one for my daughter in college (she's excited, because she misses mine). My Vitamix will do nut butters, raw ice cream, green smoothies, soups, and on and on. I truly love it.\nDo you find this review helpful? Yes No\nOne of the best blenders Review by Hideo\nRating\nMy friend and I both purchased this unit because it has 3 hp. I started blending juice the day I received my unit. It chopped and blend everything without any problem. The container is very easy to clean. I just rinse it with water and let it air dry. My father was impressed the fact that the center spinning connecting shaft is metallic and not cheap plastic.

The mentality between a diet vs. a lifestyle change is huge\u2013 someone going on a diet is choosing their food based on how they want to look physically, it is a temporary fix and there is usually a deadline associated with the diet.\nFor example, a person might decide to go on a crash diet in order to look skinny in her swimsuit during the upcoming vacation. Or she might choose to cut back on calories until the baby weight comes off. Many times these diets cycle\u2013 once the goal is met, the person will allow themselves to start slipping on their food choices. And before they know it they are right back to where they started, which prompts them to begin another diet.\nTo make matters worse, many of these crash diets are very unhealthy. They starve your body of nutrients, which will cause you to initially lose weight but then you will hit a plateau. Often, that weight will come back more quickly because the body is in shock from the way it has been treated. It is not uncommon for someone to actually gain MORE weight after a crash diet.\nOn the other hand, a lifestyle change focuses on health and nutrition. The person is looking at the inward benefits of eating well (health, energy, avoid disease, etc), and therefore they are more likely to implement the changes long-term. Choosing to eat foods that contain high amounts of nutrients will help you to feed your body what it needs, and most people experience weight loss naturally!\nChoosing an inward motivation rather than an outward motivation is much more effective in creating healthy eating habits, because a lifestyle change is something permanent. It\u2019s changing the way you live your everyday life and keeping it like this long-term. You need something that you can follow for life, that will make you feel good and is easy to implement.\nThe way you think of your new healthy eating and exercise plan is crucial. Don\u2019t call it a diet. Call it a lifestyle change, and choose to think about how you are respecting and nourishing your body through your food choices. This will help you to create healthy, daily habits and you will also find that you can reach your long-term weight loss goals.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1208.2175, "uuid": "a1ee3240-96e1-55d9-8cff-1fc77d80d8f4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600tw-19-14048", "target_hostname": "www.nourishingtreasures.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nourishingtreasures.com/index.php/2012/01/28/the-difference-between-tropical-traditions-coconut-oils-handy-reference-guide/", "page_rank": 1.6030665e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Tropical Traditions\u2019 Coconut Oils \u2013 Handy Reference", "snippet": "Last Chance to Get Over $100 worth of Beyond Organic Products for $50 (ends 1&#x2F;31) \u2192 <em>The</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Tropical Traditions\u2019 Coconut Oils \u2013 Handy Reference Guide From time to time I get asked, \u201c<em>what</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Tropical Traditions\u2019 coconut oils?", "explanation": null, "document": "Made in small batches from family producers - not mass-produced\nHighest level of antioxidants\nTweet\nLea Harris founded Nourishing Treasures in 2006.

On the other hand, its our opinion that the vitamix is a bit quieter than the Blendtec Home blender.\u00a0 The TurboBlends also includes a tamper to help push things into the blender, which is something the Blendtec Home blender doesn't offer.\u00a0 If warranty is important, the Blendtec Home blender has an 7 year warranty, \u00a0 with a lifetime warranty on the coupling and blade.. The TurboBlend 4500 has a 5 year warranty and the TurboBlend VS has a full 7 year warranty. \u00a0Technically the Blendtec Home blender has a more powerful motor behind it..

These make it a multifunction kitchen tool. I love the small footprint as well as the capacity of this blender and its possibilities when it comes to small batch processing and blending. But I did find that the Magic Bullet is better for some things and not great for others.\nWhile it's handy for those small blending tasks, you get the best performance if you process less than maximum capacity. In other words, it blends a lesser amount than you would think, if you want it to blend well and avoid the frustration of having to 'tap' it or redistribute food contents for better blending. Trying different chopping (salsa, vegetables, onions) tasks, I found that though you should be able to just press and pulse slightly, the power of the Bullet tends to force the jar into the locked position - even when you don't want it to, requiring you to turn it to stop the blender or the results are pureed foods, rather than chopped. I often had overblended foods because of this.\nWhen I blended smoothies, ice blending (crushing) was inconsistent most of the time, leaving large chunks of ice - using smaller ice cubes may remedy this problem. Ice chunks aside, you can't beat being able to blend a nice smoothie and drink it from the same jar - it saves on cleaning. As for cleaning the Bullet, it's not hard at all; just rinse or wash all pieces immediately after use.\nOverall Impression\nWhile the Magic Bullet Blender is very handy for quick chopping of nuts, onions, garlic and for making small batches of sauces and spreads, I found it inconsistent for salsa or other vegetables with results often being pureed rather than chopped.\nHowever, it gets top billing for function, size and accessories, because you can use it for a lot of different food prep tasks even if results in some cases, are less than perfect. Being able to microwave cook or heat sauces and store blended foods in the jars, is also a plus. It's also much handier using the Bullet for small amounts like making baby food, than to use a larger blender.\nI was eager to try out the Magic Bullet, but testing left me a little disappointed. Since this was a borrowed unit, I'm not positive if I would buy my own. Though the size and function is appealing, the price is not. I do find the price high for this compact blender, even though it has a lot of accessories.\nRelated Resources\n"}, {"score": 813.21844, "uuid": "583b6c0a-9e1e-517b-9c5e-150ea4d9fc4b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-58-34583", "target_hostname": "housewares.about.com", "target_uri": "http://housewares.about.com/od/blendersprocessors/qt/foodchoppercommonuses.htm", "page_rank": 1.2328502e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Food</em> Choppers - <em>Food</em> Choppers and Common Uses", "snippet": "Whether electric or manual, <em>a</em> <em>food</em> chopper can cut your <em>food</em> preparation time and help you get to <em>the</em> serving stage sooner.", "explanation": null, "document": "breadmakers\nWhether electric or manual, a food chopper can cut your food preparation time and help you get to the serving stage sooner.

She has the fierce, dark beauty of a Mexican Indian, but she\u2019s tall, and when you see her move, you think Masai warrior or maybe ninja. And it\u2019s true: She does have ninja skills. When I first met Jazmin, she\u2019d just killed a pheasant. She was sitting on the deck talking with a friend when she spotted the bird at the edge of the yard, 20 feet away. She casually picked up a two-by-four and hurled it. The missile hit the pheasant in the head, a neat kill. Jazmin walked over and picked it up. \u201cDinner,\u201d she said.\nShe says she doesn\u2019t particularly like killing animals, but she does kill from time to time, if she has good reason. A deer invaded her garden and she killed it with a machete, and she sometimes nets fish in the surf near her home on the coast of Guerrero, Mexico. It\u2019s a skill born from practice and necessity: She grew up rural and poor. Her father abandoned her family when she was 8, and her mother, Esperanza, had to find a way to support seven children. \u201cWe ate a lot of natural things,\u201d she says. \u201cThings from the forest. \u00a0My brother used to kill iguanas. I\u2019ve got a good iguana recipe if you want it. It\u2019s the best meat as far as I\u2019m concerned. There are two types of iguana: green and black. The black is good to eat. The green is too beautiful to kill. Last winter I found a big black one in my house! Can you believe it? The way you kill them is you step lightly on their heads and then pull on the tail.\u201d\nHumans worship athleticism, talent and perfection. We have a fascination with the tiny fraction of people who stand on the other side of the line that separates life from art: the grand master, the prima ballerina. We are drawn to people who embody something of the divine; the ones who, through their grace and inspiration, remind us that to be alive is majestic. Often these heroes in our spotlight are athletes. Sometimes they are leaders \u2014 warriors, politicians or rebels. Sometimes they are great chefs or composers or guitarists. But outside the spotlight and the enchantment of our collective worship, there are other artists, who turn mundane actions into magic, who approach humble tasks with perfect artistry. The masters of skills born of necessity and perfected to fulfill a pride that is autonomous from credit or accolades, a pride based on the perfection of the action itself, the economy of movement, the swiftness of results.\nJazmin Rudin is one such person. She possesses the grace and determination to execute any task at hand with astonishing efficiency. For example, she hunts shrimp in the river with a homemade metal spear. \u201dYou take a long sharp piece of metal, filed at the end. It has to be really sharp. You attach that to a piece of surgical tubing so it snaps back to you when you throw it,\u201d she says. She mimes aiming a spear, and remarks that on a good day she can spear two kilos of shrimp this way. I express disbelief. She shrugs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing. If you learn when you\u2019re really little it\u2019s easy enough. You have to learn because the shrimp are not going to come to your house and knock on your door.\u201d She explains her technique: \u201cThe shrimp are under the rocks. You go underwater, and lift each rock. Don\u2019t lift it all the way. You need to lift gently so they don\u2019t see you.\u201d She\u2019s a demonstrative teacher. She talks slowly, and pauses to make eye contact. She\u2019s checking to make sure I understand her. To help me get it, she uses hand motions. \u201cThey also like to hide in the roots of the trees that grow into the river; they hang out in there, caved up. Before you go for it, you have to check out all the potential exits they might have.\u201d She mimes looking around and adds, \u201cSometimes you have to grab them with your hand, which can be prickly. But I say no! You\u2019re for me. I don\u2019t care if you bite me, you\u2019re not escaping me!\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s all about taking aim. Just like hunting with a gun. When everything is correct you\u2019ve got your shrimp.\u201d\nBut hunting isn\u2019t Jazmin\u2019s only talent. The lectures on killing iguanas and spearing shrimp are just digressions: I\u2019m here in her Oregon kitchen for a lesson in grilling chicken, estilo Mexicana. She learned this recipe for pollo asado from her mother, who raises chickens. Her mother learned it from her grandmother. Both women have lived their entire lives in the same small Guerrero village. Jazmin describes her grandmother as \u201cmuy antiquada,\u201d or very antiquated. \u201cShe has Indian ways, folk ways,\u201d Jazmin says. \u201cThere\u2019s something a little witchy about her.\u201d\nJazmin starts by butterflying a chicken thigh with a deft stroke of her knife. When I admire her technique she says, \u201cMy mother always says: \u2018I know how to cook chicken, but you are the chicken maestro.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s too much delight and humor in Jazmin\u2019s countenance for this revelation to sound boastful. Besides, as I watch her demonstration, I realize she\u2019s just stating a truth. \u201cTake the leg,\u201d she says. \u201cFind the thickest part and slice it open, like so. Don\u2019t cut it all the way through. Leave a layer of flesh so that you can fold the meat back. When you fold it open, the bones and meat are on one side, and there\u2019s pure meat on the other side. You want to cut it so both sides are of equal thickness.\u201d She slams the chicken leg flat on her cutting board. \u201cChickens prepared this way absorb more sauce,\u201d she says and gives me a challenging look. I\u2019m not about to argue with someone who can kill living shrimp with a handmade spear.\nAfter salting the butterflied chicken legs and breasts, she sets the meat aside in a bowl and works on the sauce. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to put seven dried chiles guajillos to soak in a bowl of water,\u201d she says, helpfully adding, \u201cIt\u2019s important to soak the chiles first, because it helps the chile to retain the red color.\u201d She assembles her spices: powdered oregano, cumin seed, ground cloves and whole peppercorns, which she\u2019ll grind in a stone mortar and pestle, or molcajete . The basalt bowl stands on its own three legs; the grinding stone is the size and texture of an avocado. \u201cIn Mexico everyone has the rock,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have a molcajete, use the blender. It\u2019s not quite the same, but it works.\u201d To make the sauce, she places two cloves of garlic and strips of wet chile in the molcajete, and then deftly adds spices and water a little at a time. The finished result is a uniform liquid, which she ladles over the chicken.\nWhile the chicken marinates and the grill heats, we talk. Jazmin\u2019s pueblo on the coast of Guerrero sounds a lot like the village in coastal Jalisco where I spent part of my childhood. It\u2019s a rural culture, rooted in farming and fishing and family. Jazmin has always felt different from the other girls in town; she\u2019s never cared for makeup or clothes. \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned like my grandmother,\u201d she admits. But although her values may be old-fashioned, she\u2019s not exactly a textbook campesina: Her great joy in life is surfing, she raves about Hank Williams III, and she\u2019s taught her dog, Rambo, to ride on the front of her four-wheeler. She married Mark, an older guy from Oregon, when she was 19, so that could help explain her cultural idiosyncrasies. But as I watch Jazmin laugh uproariously at a silly joke, it strikes me that even without the foreign influence, she would have been an oddball. She\u2019s one of those rare individuals who always cleaves true to some inner compass.\n\u201cThe secret to barbecuing chicken is to make sure the flame isn\u2019t too hot,\u201d she says, holding her hand over the gas grill, which she views with some contempt. We\u2019re standing on a back porch in Bend, Ore., and Jazmin has been waxing poetic about the superiority of Mexican chickens. \u201cIn Mexico, we get a chicken that\u2019s been killed that day. And it\u2019s double good when you grill it over real coals; these gas grills have nothing on real charcoal.\u201d She slaps a chicken thigh on the grill. \u201cKeep turning the chicken over and over again,\u201d she instructs. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different style. Not as juicy maybe, but more flavorful.\u201d She\u2019s right; when we pull the chicken off the grill a scant 20 minutes later, the meat has a satisfying, chewy texture and the flavor sings, savory and complex.

Another scalp for social media?\nTopics: Food\nThe battle over \u201cpink slime\u201d is getting messier. Blaming an \u201cunfounded public outcry over the use of boneless lean beef trimmings\u201d in the nation\u2019s commercially sold ground beef supply, meat processor AFA Foods Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday. Beef Products Inc. \u2014 the South Dakota-based meat titan that invented the pink slime manufacturing process \u2014 is also reeling, idling plants in multiple states. In response, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a politician who hails from a state where there is a whole lot of boneless beef extrusion going on, called for a congressional investigation into the causes of the public uproar.\n\u201cWe have a smear campaign going on against a product that is healthy and safe,\u201d Branstad said. \u201cIf they get by with this, what other food products are they going to attack next?\u201d\nScore another scalp for social media. Because when Terry Branstad inveighs against \u201cthey,\u201d that\u2019s exactly who he\u2019s talking about: the easily outraged masses of Twitter and Facebook. We\u2019ve known about \u201cpink slime\u201d for years. Food Inc. took us into a Beef Products Inc. factory and showed us the repulsive stuff back in 2008. The New York Times referenced the name ( coined by a USDA researcher as far back as 2002 ) and devastatingly punctured the safety claims in a breakthrough piece of reporting in 2009. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver blasted it on his reality TV show a full year ago.\nBut only in the last few weeks has pink slime captured the national consumer consciousness, and in doing so provided us with just the latest example of how quickly social media grass fires can become conflagrations with real dollar-and-cents consequences. On March 5, the Daily reported that the USDA was holding firm to its plans to buy 7 million pounds of pink slime for its national school lunch program. The very next day Bettina Siegel, a blogger who writes extensively about food and kids, created a petition on Change.org titled \u201cTell USDA to Stop Using Pink Slime in School Food.\u201d Within a week the petition had over 200,000 signatories and an Internet frenzy had been born.\nFox News columnist Dan Gainor would have us believe that the real villain here is ABC News, which jumped on the anti-pink slime bandwagon with particular passion, but make no mistake, \u201cpink slime\u201d is a semantic framing that was born for the Twitter era. When you have only 140 characters to spread the news, \u201cpink slime\u201d packs all the wallop you need. The process itself, in which fatty trimmings left over at the slaughterhouse are heated, disintegrated via centrifuge, and then dosed with ammonia, is easy to express in a simple Facebook illustration. We saw it with Susan G. Komen for the Cure and we saw it with SOPA \u2014 when the social media masses get a bee in their bonnet, they can\u2019t be stopped.\nCertainly, the beef industry knows whom it is blaming.\nFrom the Kansas City Star:\nThe outrage over pink slime registered the sort of quick and virulent response that seems to characterize a new media age. Janet Riley, spokeswoman for the industry group the American Meat Institute, said she\u2019d never seen anything like it \u2014 not with E.coli outbreaks, passing worries about so-called mad cow disease or sundry health studies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a social phenomenon,\u201d she said. \u201cTwitter just made it crazy.\u201d\nThe beef processing industry is trying to fight back, with websites \u2013 Beef Is Beef, Pink Slime Is a Myth \u2013 and even a catchy slogan, \u201cDude, it\u2019s beef.\u201d Pink slime contrarians are also eager to point out that if we want low prices for our burgers and \u201cefficient\u201d use of our beef resources, we should learn to embrace pink slime. But I suspect that the defenders of \u201clean, finely textured beef\u201d are unlikely to see a social media wave of support break in their favor.\nI may be the wrong person to make this argument, as I am a Berkeley, Calif., resident who feeds his children hamburgers made from grass-fed cows raised in Marin. But the questions of whether \u201cpink slime\u201d is safe or efficient or guarantees us low-cost patties are all beside the point. It is impossible to look at the beef trimmings being transformed into pink goo in \u201cFood Inc.\u201d without being revolted. And when American consumers are revolted, they don\u2019t reach for their wallets. Gov. Rick Perry can warn all he wants about how \u201csocial media rumors\u201d and \u201chysteria\u201d threaten to destroy any industry. Maybe that\u2019s even true. But it\u2019s not social media\u2019s fault that pink slime is getting a bad rap. It\u2019s the inherent disgustingness of the process that deserves the blame. When you see it, or think hard about the process that creates it, you just don\u2019t want to eat it.\nWhat\u2019s amazing about the current social media revolution is that it is bringing to pass something that food activists have been dreaming about for decades: If only consumers were more informed about the nature of the industrial food system, they would change their behavior. Well, guess what, with a little help from grass-roots viral marketing, the activists turn out to have been right.\nSaturday, Mar 24, 2012 11:45 AM UTC2012-03-24T11:45:00Zl, M j, Y g:i A T\nThe birth of food-phobia\nTopics: Food , History , Science , Editor's Picks\nThis article is adapted from the new book \"Fear of Food,\" from University of Chicago Press.\nAt the root of our anxiety about food lies something that is common to all humans \u2014 what Paul Rozin has called the \u201comnivore\u2019s dilemma.\u201d This means that unlike, say, koala bears, whose diet consists only of eucalyptus leaves and who can therefore venture no further than where eucalyptus trees grow, our ability to eat a large variety of foods has enabled us to survive practically anywhere on the globe. The dilemma is that some of these foods can kill us, resulting in a natural anxiety about food.\nThese days, our fears rest not on wariness about that new plant we just came across in the wild, but on fears about what has been done to our food before it reaches our tables. These are the natural result of the growth of a market economy that inserted middlemen between producers and consumers of food. In recent years the ways in which industrialization and globalization have completely transformed how the food we eat is grown, shipped, processed, and sold have helped ratchet up these fears much further.\nAs a glance at a web page exposing \u201curban legends\u201d will indicate, there are an amazing number of bizarre fears about our food supply (often involving Coca-Cola) always \ufb02oating about. These might provide some insight into the nature of conspiracy theories, but they are not the kind of fear that interest me. What interests me are fears that have had the backing of the nation\u2019s most eminent scienti\ufb01c, medical, and governmental authorities. Many of them were the most eminent nutritional scientists of their time. The government agencies involved were staffed by experts at the top of their \ufb01elds. Yet, as we shall see, many of the fears they stoked turned out to be either groundless or at best unduly exaggerated. Others involved frightening all Americans about things that should concern only a minority. These scares, and the anxiety about food they have created, result from a con\ufb02uence of forces that since the end of the nineteenth century have transformed how Americans eat and think about their food.\nFirst and foremost is something that contemporary home economists often noted: that for many years the production and preparation of food has been steadily migrating out of the home. In the country\u2019s early years, when 90 percent of Americans lived on farms, the outsiders handling their food were mainly millers and vendors of essentials like salt and molasses. One usually had a personal, trusting relationship with these suppliers, who were often neighbors.\nBy the late nineteenth century, though, industrialization, urbanization, and a transportation revolution had transformed the nation. Cities boomed, railroads crisscrossed the nation, massive steamships crowded its ports, and urbanites were provided with foods that were not only not grown by neighbors \u2014 they were not even grown in neighboring countries. Large impersonal companies were now in charge of the canning, salting, re\ufb01ning, milling, baking, and other ways of preserving and preparing foods that had previously been done at home or by neighbors.\nAll along the way, the foods passed through the hands of strangers with plenty of opportunities to pro\ufb01t by altering them, to the detriment of the quality and the healthfulness of the foods. There was, then, plenty of reason to mistrust what had happened to food before it reached the table.\nThese natural concerns were heightened by modern science. In the late nineteenth century, nutritional scientists discovered that food was not just undifferentiated fuel for the human engine. Rather, they said, it consisted of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, each of which played a different role in preserving health. Only scientists could calculate how much of them were necessary. They then laid much of the groundwork for modern anxiety about food by warning that taste was the least reliable guide to healthy eating.\nAt the same time, fears were stoked by the new germ theory of disease. That contemporary Americans fear food more than the French is rather ironic, for many modern food fears originated in France. It was there, in the 1870s, that the scientist Louis Pasteur transformed perceptions of illness by discovering that many serious diseases were caused by microscopic organisms called microbes, bacteria, or germs. This \u201cgerm theory\u201d of disease saved innumerable lives by leading to the development of a number of vaccines and the introduction of antiseptic procedures in hospitals. However, it also fueled growing fears about what industrialization was doing to the food supply.\nOf course, fear of what unseen hands might be doing to our food is natural to omnivores, but taste, sight, smell (and the occasional catastrophic experience) were usually adequate for deciding what could or could not be eaten. The germ theory, however, helped remove these decisions from the realms of sensory perception and placed them in the hands of scientists in laboratories.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, these scientists were using powerful new microscopes to paint an ever more frightening picture. First, they con\ufb01rmed that germs were so tiny that there was absolutely no way that they could be detected outside a laboratory. In 1895 the New York Times reported that if a quarter of a million of one kind of these pathogenic bacteria were laid side by side, they would only take up an inch of space. Eight billion of another variety could be packed into a drop of \ufb02uid. Worse, their ability to reproduce was nothing short of astounding. There was a bacillus, it said, that in only \ufb01ve days could multiply quickly enough to \ufb01ll all the space occupied by the waters of Earth\u2019s oceans.\nThe reported dangers of ingesting germs multiplied exponentially as well. By 1900 Pasteur and his successors had shown that germs were the cause of deadly diseases such as rabies, diphtheria, and tuberculosis. They then became prime suspects in many ailments, such as cancer and smallpox, for which they were innocent. In 1902 a U.S. government scientist even claimed to have discovered that laziness was caused by germs. Some years later Harvey Wiley, head of the government\u2019s Bureau of Chemistry, used the germ theory to explain why his bald head had suddenly produced a full growth of wavy hair. He had discovered, he said, that baldness was caused by germs in the scalp and had conquered it by riding around Washington, D.C., in his open car, exposing his head to the sun, which killed the germs.\nAmerica\u2019s doctors were initially slow to adopt the germ theory, but public health authorities accepted it quite readily. In the mid-nineteenth century, their movement to clean up the nation\u2019s cities was grounded in the theory that disease was spread by invisible miasmas \u2014 noxious fumes emanating from putrefying garbage and other rotting organic matter. It was but a short step from there to accepting the notion that dirt and garbage were ideal breeding grounds for invisible germs.\nIndeed, for a while the two theories coexisted quite happily, for it was initially thought that bacteria \ufb02ourished only in decaying and putrefying substances \u2014 the very things that produced miasmas. It was not difficult, then, to accept the idea that foul-smelling toilets, drains, and the huge piles of horse manure that lined city streets harbored dangerous bacteria instead of miasmas. Soon germs became even more frightening than miasmas. Scientists warned that they were \u201cpractically ubiquitous\u201d and were carried to humans in dust, in dirty clothing, and especially in food and beverages.\nThe idea that dirt caused disease was accepted quite easily by middle-class Americans. They had been developing a penchant for personal cleanliness since early in the nineteenth century. Intoning popular notions such as \u201ccleanliness is next to godliness,\u201d they had reinforced their sense of moral superiority over the \u201cgreat unwashed\u201d masses by bathing regularly and taking pride in the cleanliness of their houses. It was also embraced by the women teaching the new \u201cdomestic science\u201d in the schools, who used it to buttress their shaky claims to be scienti\ufb01c. They could now teach \u201cbacteriology in the kitchen,\u201d which meant learning \u201cthe difference between apparent cleanliness and chemical cleanliness.\u201d\nBut the most fearsome enemy in the war against germs was not a lovable pet, but the annoying house\ufb02y. Dr. Walter Reed\u2019s investigations of disease among the American troops who invaded Cuba during the Spanish-American War in 1898 had famously led to the discovery that mosquitoes carried and spread the germs that caused yellow fever. But yellow fever was hardly present in the United States. Much more important was his subsequent discovery that house\ufb02ies could carry the bacteria causing typhoid to food, for that disease killed an estimated 50,000 Americans a year. Although Reed\u2019s studies had shown that this could happen only when \ufb02ies were practically immersed in human, not animal, excrement, his observations soon metamorphosed into the belief that during the war typhoid-carrying \ufb02ies had killed more American soldiers than had the Spanish. This was buttressed by a kind of primitive epidemiology, wherein experts noted that typhoid peaked in the autumn, when the \ufb02y population was also at its peak.\nOf course, it took much more than just some frightening ideas to arouse Americans about their food. The immense amounts of money involved in the food industries meant that, inevitably, huge \ufb01nancial stakes were involved as well. However, the stakeholders were not just the usual suspects, the large corporations that dominated food production. They also included much less mendacious interests as well.\nWell-meaning public health authorities sought to demonstrate their importance by issuing exaggerated warnings about food dangers. Home economists helped justify their role in the education system by teaching how proper eating would avoid life-threatening diseases. During World War II, the federal government propagated the misguided notion that taking vitamins would make up for the de\ufb01ciencies caused by food processing and help the nation defend itself from invasion. After the war, nonpro\ufb01t philanthropies such as the American Heart Association raised billions of dollars in donations to spread the message that eating the wrong foods was killing millions of Americans. Scienti\ufb01c and medical researchers were awarded many more billions in government and corporate grants for studies warning about the dangers of eating fats, sugar, salt, and a host of other foods.\nBut the resulting food fears needed a receptive audience, and that is precisely what middle-class Americans were primed to be. By the early twentieth century, they had become the dominant force in American culture. Because they mainly lived in cities and large towns, they bene\ufb01ted most from the innovations in transportation, processing, and marketing that led to greatly expanded food choices. However, the resulting erosion of the reassuring personal relationships between sellers and buyers made them particularly susceptible to food scares. The media now became their major source of information about the safety of their food. Since much of this information was now scienti\ufb01c in origin, it was therefore the middle-class media \u2014 \u201cquality\u201d newspapers and magazines, and, later, radio and television news and public affairs shows \u2014 that played the major roles in disseminating it.\nThe residual Puritanism of the American middle class also helped make them susceptible to food fears. A culture that for hundreds of years encouraged people to feel guilty about self-indulgence, one that saw the road to salvation as paved by individual self-denial, made them particularly receptive to calls for self-sacri\ufb01ce in the name of healthy living. This helped them lend a sympathetic ear to scienti\ufb01c nutritionists\u2019 repeated warnings that good taste \u2014 that is, pleasure \u2014 is the worst guide to healthy eating.\nBy the end of the twentieth century, this guilt-ridden culture seemed to have weakened, as the notion that self-indulgence would bene\ufb01t both individuals and society gained ground. However, at the heart of this more solipsistic view of life there still lay the old idea that illness and death were the result of an individual\u2019s own actions, including \u2014 and often especially \u2014 how they ate. (\u201cAmericans,\u201d a British wag has remarked, \u201clike to think that death is optional.\u201d) As a result, middle-class Americans have lurched from worrying about one fear of alimentary origin to another, with no apparent end in sight.\nThe spread of AIDS in the 1980s once more aroused public fears of the spread of infectious diseases. A slew of movies, television programs, and newspaper and magazine articles on bioterrorism stirred this pot. Commercial interests smelled opportunity in this and began stoking germophobia in promoting their soaps, detergents, and even prescription drugs. In 1992 a marketing journal wrote of how in the past four years this promotion of \u201cgerm warfare\u201d had led to \u201camazing\u201d growth in sales of home hygiene products. Then, in 1997 P\ufb01zer introduced a consumer version of Purell, the hand sanitizer it developed for the medical profession, and mounted a fearmongering advertising campaign to promote it. Its success spurred other companies to join in and use germophobia to promote a host of competing disinfectants. P\ufb01zer then responded with Purell 2-Go, small bottles of which could be attached to backpacks, lunch boxes, and key chains, so that people could disinfect their way through the outside world.\nThe SARS scare in 2004 heightened germophobia even more. Even though SARS was spread by a virus, not a bacterium, most Americans were unaware of the difference. They began snapping up a panoply of germicidal products such as contraptions that sprayed disinfectant on doorknobs, portable subway straps (for those who did not have \u201cCity Mitts\u201d anti-microbial gloves), and, to combat germs in airplanes, the Air Supply Ionic Personal Air Puri\ufb01er. A book called \u201cGerms Are Not for Sharing\u201d instructed children in how to play without touching each other. Those fearing germs on fruits and vegetables could buy the Lotus Sanitizing System, which used an electric charge to infuse tap water with ozone that would kill the bacteria on them \u2014 a process not unlike the Electrozone treatment that was purported to turn sea water into a disinfectant a hundred years earlier.\nBy then, of course, the water supply had once again fallen under suspicion, leading to the enormous growth of the bottled water industry. However, nothing could shake Americans\u2019 con\ufb01dence that breakfast cereals, dairy products, and other foods in brightly colored, tightly wrapped packages were free of harmful bacteria. It all amounted to impressive testimony to the ongoing effectiveness of advertising campaigns such as those mounted by Kellogg\u2019s and Nabisco in the early twentieth century.\nThis represented yet another irony: that many of the fears that originated in the industrialization of the food supply were ultimately dissipated by the kind of packaging and marketing that were integral parts of it.\nContinue Reading\nHarvey Levenstein is professor emeritus of history at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

Here's the Raw Truth even they don't know!\nOpinion by Robert Ross, 8/19/2011\nThree-dimensional model of an ATP molecule --\ncarbon atoms are gray, nitrogens are blue,\nphosphorus are yellow, and oxygen is red.\nSome health professionals trained in standard allopathic medicine will tell you (because it is what they were taught) that the pH of what you eat doesn't change your internal acid/alkaline balance. That is based on a simplistic and incomplete understanding of how digestion works and the effect of acidic toxins on the body's buffering system at the cellular level.\nResearch you can read about right here shows that the medical establishment is just plain wrong about this. For one thing, the stomach's role as an organ of digestion is it's SECONDARY function. The primary purpose of the stomach is to create alkaline buffers to neutralize the acidic toxins created by our food, the environment and the metabolic processes in our bodies. As Dr. Robert Young has explained in his New Biology theories, the hydrochloric acid in the stomach is actually a by-product of the production of sodium bicarbonate! The more acid-forming food or drink we consume the more sodium bicarbonate the stomach makes to buffer it. Every molecule of hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach is the result of sodium bicarbonate production. The equation is:\nNaCl + H20 + CO2 = NaHCO3 + HCL\nThe principle mechanism of action that causes the body's internal acid/alakline balance to get out of kilter is also well known. You see, we already know that your blood chemistry must remain at a consistent pH within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly alkaline. Your body will do anything to maintain this balance or homeostasis since otherwise you will die. In fact, this is so important to your survival that the body will steal alkaline pH buffers from other organs to keep the blood pH balanced. Other organs can manage to survive for decades with an out of balance pH, so your body has no problem borrowing buffers from something like, let's say, your bones to keep the blood in homeostasis. If the body borrows calcium from your bones to neutralize the acid toxins caused by eating too much protein you will be fine for years. Of course, you end up with osteporosis after a lifetime of this - but it is small sacrifice when the alternative is a quick death!\nWhat most doctors don't realize is that this process, this sacrifice, goes much deeper than just your bones - every cell in your body may be called upon to make a similar sacrifice when your lifestyle, diet and environment are so acid-forming! Your body is constantly producing acid toxins. This is actually normal. So you have mechanisms to neutralize these toxins, called buffers. But it isn't normal for you to have a shortage of buffers. If you cannot excrete the acid toxins fast enough then they back up throughout the body - \"acidifying\" the body. This isn't enough to be labeled a diagnosable disease but it is just enough to change the subtle chemistry of cellular respiration.\nOf course, your body is designed to survive even under the worst circumstances, though perhaps not with the level of health and wellness you might like! Every metabolic process in the body has a backup mechanism for when the main biochemistry isn't working. So healthy alkaline-based chemical reactions are in fact entirely different from those that take place in an unhealthy system altered by acidic toxins. For example, if the pH of your blood falls to the low end of its normal range (~7.35-7.45) by a mere .10 difference it could reduce the oxygen levels in your blood by as much as 300%! Oxygen is of course the key to all of life - and essential to many biochemical processes. And that's in the blood, where pH homeostasis and oxygen levels are more critical than anywhere else.\nImagine what happens in other organs when they get too acidic...and normal chemical reactions involving oxygen, called aerobic, become almost impossible! Then anaerobic (without oxygen) back-up systems take over to keep you alive, often for decades - but alive isn't the same thing as healthy! The best example of something that goes horribly wrong at the cellular level when you body is forced into an anaerobic, survival mode is how it makes, stores and produces energy with a substance called ATP.........\nRaw Science: pH of Diet Affects pH at Cellular Level\nStudies show that Mad Cow Disease caused by acid pH!\nby Robert Ross, July 15, 2011\nWhy is this important to a raw foodist? We are not likely to be eating any kind of meat soon, let alone from a mad cow! The thing is -- this is more hard evidence of the importance of an alkaline-forming diet and lifestyle! Even better, it is evidence that helps refute the argument that alkaline-forming foods and drinks don't affect the body's overall pH. The answer is that it clearly does. Here's how I come to that conclusion from this research.\nA prion (protein+infection)is a misshapen protein which became an infectious agent when it lost it's correct shape. You see, it is normal for proteins to fold or bend, but under some conditions they lose control and get permanently bent out of shape, becoming infections that cause a fatal diseases like mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in people. There is no cure for these fatal conditions.\nSeveral researchers have discovered\nthat prions deadly misshapen form is determined by the pH they are exposed to. In a healthy neutral or alkaline environment these proteins are just fine. However, under low pH, acidic conditions increase (red line in chart), proteins get more and more distorted until they become Prions -- infectious proteins.\nAs human being you should just as mad as these poor factory-farm cows! But unlike a cow, you can do something about it. First, just don't eat cows. If you enjoy a little meat now and then, do it on a rare basis, like a special treat, and then only eat free-range, organic meats. And for your other meals, start enjoying healthy, alkaline-forming raw food and drink alkaline mineral water (from your water ionizer)! Sadly, factory farm cows don't have these choices - but you do!\nRaw Science in the News!\nWas the devastating European e.coli superbug bioengineered?\nMad Scientist or Extraterrestrial Invader?\nRobert Ross, 6/7/2011 - While a super resistant e.coli outbreak is straining hospital resources in Germany nobody in the mainstream media seems to be concerned about where a new super e.coli suddenly came from. The German e.coli is from the 0104 strain, a type of e.coli that has almost never been resistant to antibiotics before. What's so strange about this? I'm glad you asked. You see, it isn't easy for a bacteria to become a super bug overnight. It happens slowly, relatively speaking, as the bacteria is exposed to more and more different antibiotics. Usually you'll see a strain resistant to one or two antibiotics first. Then, as different antibiotics must be used to treat the infection, the e.coli eventually becomes exposed to other antibiotics becoming resistant to them, too. But not this time. This new German strain magically became resistant to every antibiotic that may be used against it over night!\nHow could such a thing happen in nature? Well -- it can't! And studying the DNA of the German e.coli is pretty damning evidence that nature didn't do it - a genetic engineer did! Or maybe it was extraterrestrials?\nGermany's Robert Koch Institute analysed the DNA of the O104 e.coli and discovered that it is resistant to some of the most widely used antibiotics by hospitals. The only way this could happen is by genetic manipulation in the lab we've all seen in grade-B science fiction movies! Or maybe it was extraterrestrials?\nRaw Science in the News!\nTHE RAW FOOD-RADIATION CONNECTION\nby Robert Ross, 5/5/2011\nAlkalize your Body for Natural Radiation Protection\nYou may not realize is that there is a profound connection between alkaline-forming raw foods, alkaline mineral water and ionizing radiation. You see, ionizing radiation does the same thing to your body cooked, processed, acid-forming foods do only much, much faster and more deadly. Simply put, ionizing radiation scavenges electrons from the molecules of healthy cells in the same way that the free radicals in cooked, processed food does.

That is based on a simplistic and incomplete understanding of how digestion works and the effect of acidic toxins on the body's buffering system at the cellular level.\nResearch you can read about right here shows that the medical establishment is just plain wrong about this. For one thing, the stomach's role as an organ of digestion is it's SECONDARY function. The primary purpose of the stomach is to create alkaline buffers to neutralize the acidic toxins created by our food, the environment and the metabolic processes in our bodies. As Dr. Robert Young has explained in his New Biology theories, the hydrochloric acid in the stomach is actually a by-product of the production of sodium bicarbonate! The more acid-forming food or drink we consume the more sodium bicarbonate the stomach makes to buffer it. Every molecule of hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach is the result of sodium bicarbonate production. The equation is:\nNaCl + H20 + CO2 = NaHCO3 + HCL\nThe principle mechanism of action that causes the body's internal acid/alakline balance to get out of kilter is also well known. You see, we already know that your blood chemistry must remain at a consistent pH within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly alkaline. Your body will do anything to maintain this balance or homeostasis since otherwise you will die. In fact, this is so important to your survival that the body will steal alkaline pH buffers from other organs to keep the blood pH balanced. Other organs can manage to survive for decades with an out of balance pH, so your body has no problem borrowing buffers from something like, let's say, your bones to keep the blood in homeostasis. If the body borrows calcium from your bones to neutralize the acid toxins caused by eating too much protein you will be fine for years. Of course, you end up with osteporosis after a lifetime of this - but it is small sacrifice when the alternative is a quick death!\nWhat most doctors don't realize is that this process, this sacrifice, goes much deeper than just your bones - every cell in your body may be called upon to make a similar sacrifice when your lifestyle, diet and environment are so acid-forming! Your body is constantly producing acid toxins. This is actually normal. So you have mechanisms to neutralize these toxins, called buffers. But it isn't normal for you to have a shortage of buffers. If you cannot excrete the acid toxins fast enough then they back up throughout the body - \"acidifying\" the body. This isn't enough to be labeled a diagnosable disease but it is just enough to change the subtle chemistry of cellular respiration.\nOf course, your body is designed to survive even under the worst circumstances, though perhaps not with the level of health and wellness you might like! Every metabolic process in the body has a backup mechanism for when the main biochemistry isn't working. So healthy alkaline-based chemical reactions are in fact entirely different from those that take place in an unhealthy system altered by acidic toxins. For example, if the pH of your blood falls to the low end of its normal range (~7.35-7.45) by a mere .10 difference it could reduce the oxygen levels in your blood by as much as 300%! Oxygen is of course the key to all of life - and essential to many biochemical processes. And that's in the blood, where pH homeostasis and oxygen levels are more critical than anywhere else.\nImagine what happens in other organs when they get too acidic...and normal chemical reactions involving oxygen, called aerobic, become almost impossible! Then anaerobic (without oxygen) back-up systems take over to keep you alive, often for decades - but alive isn't the same thing as healthy! The best example of something that goes horribly wrong at the cellular level when you body is forced into an anaerobic, survival mode is how it makes, stores and produces energy with a substance called ATP.........\nRaw Science: pH of Diet Affects pH at Cellular Level\nStudies show that Mad Cow Disease caused by acid pH!\nby Robert Ross, July 15, 2011\nWhy is this important to a raw foodist? We are not likely to be eating any kind of meat soon, let alone from a mad cow! The thing is -- this is more hard evidence of the importance of an alkaline-forming diet and lifestyle! Even better, it is evidence that helps refute the argument that alkaline-forming foods and drinks don't affect the body's overall pH. The answer is that it clearly does. Here's how I come to that conclusion from this research.\nA prion (protein+infection)is a misshapen protein which became an infectious agent when it lost it's correct shape. You see, it is normal for proteins to fold or bend, but under some conditions they lose control and get permanently bent out of shape, becoming infections that cause a fatal diseases like mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in people. There is no cure for these fatal conditions.\nSeveral researchers have discovered\nthat prions deadly misshapen form is determined by the pH they are exposed to. In a healthy neutral or alkaline environment these proteins are just fine. However, under low pH, acidic conditions increase (red line in chart), proteins get more and more distorted until they become Prions -- infectious proteins.\nAs human being you should just as mad as these poor factory-farm cows! But unlike a cow, you can do something about it. First, just don't eat cows. If you enjoy a little meat now and then, do it on a rare basis, like a special treat, and then only eat free-range, organic meats. And for your other meals, start enjoying healthy, alkaline-forming raw food and drink alkaline mineral water (from your water ionizer)!

This new German strain magically became resistant to every antibiotic that may be used against it over night!\nHow could such a thing happen in nature? Well -- it can't! And studying the DNA of the German e.coli is pretty damning evidence that nature didn't do it - a genetic engineer did!

Infant nutrition is critical for ensuring proper development, maximizing learning capacities and preventing illness. At no other time in life is nutrition so important. But which foods are best? The research clearly points in the direction of Weston A. Price Foundation principles.\nBreast or Bottle\nNumerous studies support the benefits of breastfeeding. For example, breastfed babies tend to be more robust, intelligent and free of allergies and other complaints like intestinal difficulties.1 Other studies have shown that breastfed infants have reduced rates of respiratory illnesses and ear infections.2,3 Some researchers believe breastfed infants have greater academic potential than formula-fed infants, which is thought to be due to the fatty acid DHA found in mother's milk and not in most US formulas.4\nHowever, other studies show the opposite. In 2001, a study found breastfed children had more asthma than bottle-fed.5 A Swedish study found that breastfed infants were just as likely to develop childhood ear infections6 and childhood cancer as formula-fed babies.7\nSo, what is best for baby? It comes down to nutrition! Hands down, healthy breast milk is perfectly designed for baby's physical and mental development, but this is only true when mom supplies her body with the right nutrients.\nThe typical modern diet is filled with products based on sugar, white flour, additives and commercial fats and oils, which do not nourish and build. The proper nutrients are necessary to create breast milk that will provide all a growing baby needs. These include good quality proteins from foods such as grass-fed meats and organ meats, good quality fats from butter, coconut oil, olive oil, cod liver oil and egg yolks, as well as complex carbohydrate-rich foods like vegetables, whole grains and legumes--think whole food, natural and seasonal, with a big emphasis on healthy fat.\nBottom line, in a perfect world, with perfect nutrition, every woman would breastfeed. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world. What about low milk supply, an unwell mother or adoption? Luckily, it is possible to make a wholesome whole food baby formula. (See FAQs on Homemade Baby Formula .)\nAfter (or With) the Breast or Bottle\nIdeally, breastfeeding should be maintained for a year, with a goal of six months for working mothers. The first year of life requires a full spectrum of nutrients, including fats, protein, cholesterol, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Once breast milk is no longer the sole source of these nutrients, where should one go?\nThere are three concepts to keep in mind. First, make your little one a \"whole foods baby\"! Avoid processed and refined foods as much as possible, including many brands of baby food; they are usually devoid of nutrients and have added \"undesirables.\" It is always best to make your own baby food from organic, whole foods. (You can freeze it in one-serving sizes for later use.) Better-quality, additive-free, prepared brands of baby food, like Earth's Best, do exist, but it is still better to make your own baby food to be assured of the quality--plus making baby food puts mom on the right track for home food preparation for the years to come.\nSecond, go slowly and be observant; every baby will have an individual response to different foods. Introduce new foods one at a time and continue to feed that same food for at least four days to rule out the possibility of a negative reaction. Signs of intolerance include redness around the mouth; abdominal bloating, gas and distention; irritability, fussiness, over-activity and awaking throughout the night; constipation and diarrhea; frequent regurgitation of foods; nasal and/or chest congestion; and red, chapped or inflamed eczema-like skin rash.8\nFinally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a baby's small intestine does produce is lactase, for the digestion of lactose in milk.1)\nFoods introduced too early can cause digestive troubles and increase the likelihood of allergies (particularly to those foods introduced). The baby's immature digestive system allows large particles of food to be absorbed. If these particles reach the bloodstream, the immune system mounts a response that leads to an allergic reaction. Six months is the typical age when solids should be introduced,9,10,11 however, there are a few exceptions.\nBabies do produce functional enzymes (pepsin and proteolytic enzymes) and digestive juices (hydrochloric acid in the stomach) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat, which is critical for growth, energy and development.13 In addition, the cholesterol in human milk supplies an infant with close to six times the amount most adults consume from food.13 In some cultures, a new mother is encouraged to eat six to ten eggs a day and almost ten ounces of chicken and pork for at least a month after birth. This fat-rich diet ensures her breast milk will contain adequate healthy fats.14\nThus, a baby's earliest solid foods should be mostly animal foods since his digestive system, although immature, is better equipped to supply enzymes for digestion of fats and proteins rather than carbohydrates.1 This explains why current research is pointing to meat (including nutrient-dense organ meat) as being a nourishing early weaning food.\nIs Cereal the Best First Food?\nRemember, the amount of breast milk and/or formula decreases when solid foods are introduced. This decrease may open the door for insufficiencies in a number of nutrients critical for baby's normal growth and development. The nutrients that are often in short supply when weaning begins include protein, zinc, iron and B-vitamins. One food group that has these nutrients in ample amounts is meat.\nUnfortunately, cereal is the most often recommended early weaning food. A recent Swedish study suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, they may suffer from low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption.15\nIn the US, Dr. Nancy Krebs headed up a large infant growth study that found breastfed infants who received pur\u00e9ed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months grew at a slightly faster rate. Kreb's study suggests that inadequate protein or zinc from common first foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. More importantly, both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat.16 Thus, the custom of providing large amounts of cereals and excluding meats before seven months of age may short-change the nutritional requirements of the infant.17\nMeat is also an excellent source of iron. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources (non-heme). Additionally, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb iron from other foods.18 Two recent studies19,20 have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. While researchers found no measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they received an increased amount of meat, the levels of hemoglobin (iron-containing cells) circulating in the bloodstream did increase. Meat also contains a much greater amount of zinc than cereals, which means more is absorbed.21 These studies confirm the practices of traditional peoples, who gave meat--usually liver--as the first weaning food. Furthermore, the incidence of allergic reactions to meat is minimal and lower still when pur\u00e9ed varieties are used.17,22,23,24\nDon't Fear Fats!\nPediatric clinicians have known for some time that children fed low-fat and low-cholesterol diets fail to grow properly. After all, a majority of mother's milk is fat, much of it saturated fat. Children need high levels of fat throughout growth and development. Milk and animal fats give energy and also help children build muscle and bone.1 In addition, the animal fats provide vitamins A and D necessary for protein and mineral assimilation, normal growth and hormone production.27\nChoose a variety of foods so your child gets a range of fats, but emphasize stable saturated fats, found in butter, meat and coconut oil, and monounsaturated fats, found in avocados and olive oil.\nFoods to Introduce\nEgg yolks, rich in choline, cholesterol and other brain-nourishing substances, can be added to your baby's diet as early as four months,1 as long as baby takes it easily. (If baby reacts poorly to egg yolk at that age, discontinue and try again one month later.) Cholesterol is vital for the insulation of the nerves in the brain and the entire central nervous system. It helps with fat digestion by increasing the formation of bile acids and is necessary for the production of many hormones. Since the brain is so dependent on cholesterol, it is especially vital during this time when brain growth is in hyper-speed.25 Choline is another critical nutrient for brain development. The traditional practice of feeding egg yolks early is confirmed by current research. A study published in the June 2002 issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition compared the nutritional effects of feeding weaning infants 6-12 months of age regular egg yolks, enriched egg yolks, and an otherwise normal diet. The researchers found that both breastfed and formula-fed infants who consumed the egg yolks had improved iron levels when compared with the infants who did not. In addition, those infants who got the egg yolks enriched with extra fatty acids had 30 percent to 40 percent greater DHA levels than those fed regular egg yolks. No significant effect on blood cholesterol levels was seen.26\nThus, the best choice for baby is yolks from pasture-fed hens raised on flax meal, fish meal, or insects since they will contain higher levels of DHA. Why just the yolk? The white is the portion that most often causes allergic reactions, so wait to give egg whites until after your child turns one.1,11\nDon't neglect to put a pinch of salt on the egg yolk. While many books warn against giving salt to babies, salt is actually critical for digestion as well as for brain development. Use unrefined salt to supply a variety of trace minerals.\nAround four months is a good time to start offering cod liver oil, which is an excellent source of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA (also important for brain develoment) as well as vitamins A and D. Start with a 1/4 teaspoon of high-vitamin cod liver oil or 1/2 teaspoon regular dose cod liver oil, doubling the amount at 8 months.12 Use an eye dropper at first; later baby can take cod liver oil mixed with a little water or fresh orange juice.\nIf baby is very mature and seems hungry, he may be given mashed banana during this period. Ripe banana is a great food for babies because it contains amylase enzymes to digest carbohydrates.1\nAt Six Months\nPur\u00e9ed meats can be given at six months (or even earlier if baby is very mature). Meats will help ensure adequate intake of iron, zinc, and protein with the decrease in breast milk and formula.17\nA variety of fruits can be introduced at this time. Avocado, melon, mangoes and papaya can be mashed and given raw. High-pectin fruits such as peaches, apricots, apples, pears, cherries and berries should be cooked to break down the pectin, which can be very irritating to the digestive tract.\nAs time goes by, move up in complexity with food and texture. At about six to eight months, vegetables may be introduced, one at a time so that any adverse reactions may be observed. Carrots, sweet potatoes and beets are excellent first choices. All vegetables should be cooked (steamed preferably), mashed and mixed with a liberal amount of fat, such as butter or coconut oil, to provide nutrients to aid in digestion.\nEarly introduction to different tastes is always a good plan to prevent finickiness. Feed your little one a touch of buttermilk, yogurt or kefir from time to time to familiarize them with the sour taste. Lacto-fermented roots, like sweet potato or taro, are another excellent food for babies to add at this time.1\nAt Eight Months\nBaby can now consume a variety of foods including creamed vegetable soups, homemade stews and dairy foods such as cottage cheese, mild harder raw cheese, cream and custards. Hold off on grains until one year, with the possible exception of soaked and thoroughly cooked brown rice, which can be served earlier to babies who are very mature.\nAt One Year\nGrains, nuts and seeds should be the last food given to babies. This food category has the most potential for causing digestive disturbances or allergies. Babies do not produce the needed enzymes to handle cereals, especially gluten-containing grains like wheat, before the age of one year. Even then, it is a common traditional practice to soak grains in water and a little yogurt or buttermilk for up to 24 hours. This process jump-starts the enzymatic activity in the food and begins breaking down some of the harder-to-digest components.1 The easiest grains to digest are those without gluten like brown rice. When grains are introduced, they should be soaked for at least 24 hours and cooked with plenty of water for a long time. This will make a slightly sour, very thin porridge that can be mixed with other foods.29\nAfter one year, babies can be given nut butters made with crispy nuts (recipe in Nourishing Traditions), cooked leafy green vegetables, raw salad vegetables, citrus fruit and whole egg.\nExtra Feeding Baby Tid-Bits\nHow do you know when it's time to add solids? Observe your baby's signs. When infants are ready for solids they start leaning forward at the sight of food and opening their mouths in a preparatory way. In addition, babies should be able to sit up and coordinate breathing with swallowing. Finally, infants will stop pushing their tongue out when a spoon or bit of food is placed in their mouth--a reflex common in infants that disappears at around four months of age.30\nKeep in mind, all babies are different and will not enjoy or tolerate the same foods or textures. Experiment by offering different foods with various textures. Remember, just because your baby doesn't like a food the first time it is introduced does not mean he will not like it the second time. Continue to offer the food, but never force.\nBaby's food should be lightly seasoned with unrefined salt, but there is no need to add additional seasonings, such as herbs and spices in the beginning. However by 10-12 months, your baby may enjoy a variety of natural seasonings.\nTo increase variety, take a small portion of the same food you are preparing for the rest of the grown-up family (before seasoning), or leftovers, and pur\u00e9e it for baby (thin or thicken accordingly).\nTo gradually make food lumpier, pur\u00e9e half of the food, roughly mash the other half and combine the two.\nFrozen finger foods are a great way to soothe a baby's teething pain\nKeep a selection of plain yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, fresh fruit, and fresh or frozen vegetables handy to prepare almost instant natural baby food any time--even when vacationing or traveling.\nOrganic foods have minimal toxicity, thus placing a smaller chemical burden on the body. This is particularly a benefit for our youngsters. They are more vulnerable to pesticide exposure because their organs and body systems are not fully developed and, in relation to body weight, they eat and drink more than adults. Furthermore, the presence of these chemicals in the environment leads to further contamination of our air, waterways and fields.\nThere are different ideas concerning when to offer babies water. Many resources suggest giving water about the same time solids are introduced. This is often in combination with cup drinking or sippy-cup training. Keep in mind, breast milk and formula are providing the majority of nutrients in the first 6-9 months, so it is important not to allow a baby to get too full on water. When solids become a larger part of the diet, more liquid may be needed for hydration and digestion. Also, extreme heat, dehydration, vomiting, and fever may also indicate a need for extra water. Bottom line: follow your baby's cues. Always serve filtered water to your baby. You can add a pinch of unrefined salt to the water for minerals.\nLet baby eat with a silver spoon--the small amount of silver he will get from this really does help fight infection!\nJust Say No\nOne important warning: do not give your child juice, which contains too much simple sugar and may ruin a child's appetite for the more nourishing food choices. Soy foods, margarine and shortening, and commercial dairy products (especially ultra-pasteurized) should also be avoided, as well as any products that are reduced-fat or low-fat.\nBy the way, baby fat is a good thing; babies need those extra folds for all the miraculous development their bodies are experiencing. Chubby babies grow up into slim, muscular adults.\nCommon sense prevails when looking at foods that best nourish infant's. A breastfeeding mother naturally produces the needed nutrition when she consumes the necessary nutrients. The composition of healthy breast milk gives us a blueprint for an infants needs from there on out. Finally, be an example. Although you won't be able to control what goes into your child's mouth forever, you can set the example by your own excellent food choices and vibrant health.\nEgg Yolk (4 months +)\nBoil an egg for three to four minutes (longer at higher altitudes), peel away the shell, discard the white and mash up yolk with a little unrefined sea salt. (The yolk should be soft and warm, not runny.) Small amounts of grated, raw organic liver (which has been frozen 14 days) may be added to the egg yolk after 6 months. Some mothers report their babies actually prefer the yolk with the liver. From Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.\nPureed Meats (6 months +)\nCook meat gently in filtered water or homemade stock until completely tender, or use meat from stews, etc., that you have made for your family. Make sure the cooked meat is cold and is in no bigger than 1-2 inch chunks when you puree. Grind up the meat first until it's almost like a clumpy powder. Then add water, formula or breast milk, or the natural cooking juices as the liquid.\nBaby Pate (6 months +)\nPlace 1/4 pound organic chicken livers and 1/4 cup broth or filtered water in a saucepan, bring to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer for eight minutes. Pour into a blender (liver and liquid) with 1-2 teaspoons butter and a pinch of seasalt and blend to desired consistency.\nVegetable Puree (6 months +)\nUse squash, sweet potatoes, parsnips, rutabagas, carrots or beets. Cut vegetables in half, scoop out seeds from squash and bake in a 400 degree oven for about an hour, or steam them (in the case of carrots and beets) for 20 to 25 minutes. Mix in butter when pur\u00e9eing. You can cook these vegetables for your own dinner and pur\u00e9e a small portion in a blender or food mill for your baby. From Natural Baby Care by Mindy Pennybacker.\nFruit Sauce (6 months +)\nUse fresh or frozen peaches, nectarines, apples, blueberries, cherries, pears, berries or a combination. Note: Whenever possible, use organic fruit, and peel the fruit if it is not organic. Cut fruit and put in a saucepan with 1 cup filtered water for every 1/2 cup of fruit. Bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer about 15 minutes or until the fruit is cooked. Pur\u00e9e the mixture in a blender or food mill and strain if necessary. Don't add sugar or spices but you can stir in a little butter or cream. From Natural Baby Care by Mindy Pennybacker.\nDried Apricot Puree (6 months +)\nBring 2 cups filtered water to a boil with 1 pound unsulphured dried apricots and simmer for 15 minutes. Reserve any leftover liquid to use for the puree. Puree, adding the reserved liquid as necessary to achieve a smooth, thin puree. May be blended with some butter.\nFermented Sweet Potato (6 months +)\nPoke a few holes in 2 pounds sweet potatoes and bake in an oven at 300 degrees for about 2 hours or until soft. Peel and mash with\u00a01 teaspoon seasalt and 4 tablespoons whey. Place in a bowl, cover, and leave at room temperature for 24 hours. Place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. From Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.\nBaby Custard (6 months +)\nMix 1 cup raw milk or whole coconut milk, 1 cup raw cream, 6 egg yolks, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and a pinch of stevia powder. Pour into buttered ramekin dishes. Place ramekins into a Pyrex dish filled part-way with water. Preheat oven to 310 degrees and cook for about 1 hour.\nSmoothie for Baby(8 months +)\nBlend 1 cup whole yoghurt with 1/2 banana or 1/2 cup pur\u00e9ed fruit, 1 raw egg yolk (from an organic or pastured chicken) and a pinch of stevia.\nCoconut Fish Pate (8 months +)\nPlace 1 cup leftover cooked fish, 1/4 teaspoon seasalt, 1/4 teaspoon fresh lime juice in a food processor and process with a few pulses. Add 1/2-1 cup coconut cream or whole coconut milk to obtain desired consistency.\nCereal Gruel for Baby (1 year +)\nMix 1/2 cup freshly ground organic flour of spelt, Kamut\u00ae , rye, barley or oats with 2 cups warm filtered water mixture plus 2 tablespoons yoghurt, kefir or buttermilk. Cover and leave at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve with cream or butter and small amount of a natural sweetener, such as raw honey. From Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.\nSalmon and Rice Mousse (1 year +)\nHeat 2 cups chicken broth to a slow boil and add 1/4 cup soaked brown rice. Lower the heat, cover tightly, and let cook for 30 minutes or until it is almost done. Wash 3 ounces salmon thoroughly and remove all bones carefully. Add the salmon to the rice, cover, and let it poach for 10 minutes or until done all the way through. Allow the salmon and rice to cool enough that it can be pur\u00e9ed safely in the blender or food processor. If it is too thick, add just enough water to obtain the consistency you want. Season with a little seasalt.Serve with a pur\u00e9ed vegetable. From The Crazy Makers by Carol Simontacchi.\nCrispy Nut Butter (1 year +)\nPur\u00e9e equal amounts of crispy nuts, raw honey and coconut oil. Add salt to taste. Serve at room temperature.

Large, starchy, and edible the tuberous roots can grow up to two even three feet long and weigh as much as 80 pounds.\u00a0 Sweet potatoes belong to the morning glory family and are native to the tropical areas of the Americas. There are two basic types of sweet potatoes: moist (orange-fleshed) and dry (yellow-fleshed).\u00a0 It's the orange-flesh version that is mistakenly called yams.\nYou see it was really a marketing angle adopted in the 1930s by some Louisiana farmers looking to distinguish their sweet tuber which they called a \u201cyam\u201d from the dry, pale sweet version grown in the North. So today in American supermarkets, \u201cyams\u201d are sweet potatoes with vivid orange color, and, when cooked, are sweet and moist. The most popular \"yam\" is the Beauregard, which is uniform in size and shape with smooth skin and deep orange flesh.\nSo what we are seeing in the markets, at least here in the States and Canada labeled as yams are actually sweet potatoes with a relatively moist texture and orange flesh.\nOver at Straight Dope the following is offered:\n\"Contrary to what even some grocery store produce guys think, yams and sweet potatoes are unrelated vegetables, though in both cases you're eating the root of a tropical vine. Sweet potatoes, Ipomoea batatas (\"batata\" is the original Taino name, whence potato), are an American plant of the morning glory family, whereas yams are of the genus Dioscorea. Yams, which are rarely seen in the U.S. and Canada but are a staple in tropical regions, can grow up to seven feet in length. The name is thought to derive from the West African word nyami, \"to eat,\" which is heard in Jamaican patois expressions such as, Oonu wan fi nyam banana dem?, 'Do you guys want to eat those bananas?'\"\n"}, {"score": 660.2692, "uuid": "8d9db2e3-8740-5b9c-b3ec-2511e27b194c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400tw-82-06704", "target_hostname": "www.myfivefingers.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myfivefingers.com/paleo-diet-1/", "page_rank": 3.780905e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>A</em> Practical Approach to <em>the</em> Paleo Diet, Part 1 | MyFiveFingers.com", "snippet": "Understanding What\u2019s Paleo, What\u2019s Not and What\u2019s in <em>Between</em>\u2026Here\u2019s how I classify <em>foods</em> in terms of <em>a</em> Paleo diet.

It\u2019s a great diet. It works for improving performance, fat loss and a myriad health problems. Once you understand the basics, it\u2019s also pretty easy to do. In this series of articles, I\u2019ll explain the basics of Paleo and talk about some of the finer points, modifications and nuances I\u2019ve learned in the nearly 7 years I\u2019ve been working with the diet in one variation or another.\nIn this first post, I\u2019ll talk about the fundamentals of Paleo and give you my own ideas about the best way to classify different foods and think about them within the greater context of Paleo. The classification of foods that I use is something I developed on my own and not something you\u2019ll find anywhere else. I\u2019ll explain why a little later.\nWhat\u2019s important to understand is that Paleo is really a broad diet philosophy as opposed to a set and rigid diet \u2013 or worse, a fad diet. Yes, there\u2019s the book \u201cThe Paleo Diet\u201d by Loren Cordain , but there are many other interpretations of Paleo and variations based on the \u201cHunter-Gatherer\u201d template. If you want to understand the context of Paleo as a diet genre, check out my post \u201c There Are MANY Different Paleo Diets .\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the Point of Paleo?\nThe basic premise of the Paleo diet is that our genes have remained virtually unchanged for a very, very long time. While there is some disagreement on the numbers, the idea is that we spent about 2.5 million years as a species eating nothing but meat, vegetables and fruit (when fruit was available) and little else. It was only about 15,000 years ago that we started to move from hunting and gathering to agriculture. This is when grains and dairy became widely available.\nPaleo theory says that our digestive systems and bodies are much better adapted to meat, fruit and vegetables than to things like grains, dairy, processed foods and the pesticides and hormones that get into our modern food. If you stop and think about the fact that two of the most common food sensitivities are to gluten and casein (a protein in cow milk), it doesn\u2019t seem completely unrealistic that there could be some truth to this idea.\nBelow is a diagram from my book, \u201cThe Paleo Dieter\u2019s Missing Link,\u201d that shows visually what I\u2019m talking about in terms of a food timeline. Obviously, the diagram isn\u2019t totally to scale.\nThe main point of Paleo is to give our bodies the foods that they evolved to eat and thrive on. The payoff being improved health, performance, longevity and superior digestion.\nWhat\u2019s On a Paleo Diet?\nSo, basically, Paleo is meat, fruit and vegetables. Pretty simple, right? And, it actually IS simple to a great extent. Some people get confused because they just don\u2019t know enough about food in general, but many others have trouble because of all the information circulating online and in the various Paleo books that are out there. Everything you\u2019ll find on Paleo \u2013 other than the stuff I write \u2013 will classify foods in two categories \u2013 Paleo and Not Paleo.\u00a0 I decided that this system was limiting and instead I choose to talk about foods in terms of Paleo in five categories.\nUnderstanding What\u2019s Paleo, What\u2019s Not and What\u2019s in Between\u2026\nHere\u2019s how I classify foods in terms of a Paleo diet. You\u2019ll likely note that some of the foods in category two \u2013 like raw dairy and brown rice \u2013 are NOT what are considered Paleo foods by most. I actually have a number of reasons for including these foods in my version of Paleo and I\u2019ll talk about those reasons in an upcoming installment of this series.\nHere are the five categories of Paleo foods:\n1) Foundational Paleo Diet Foods \u2013 Base Your Diet on These\nThese are meats from animals fed their appropriate diet (cows fed grass, for example), wild-caught fish and vegetables and fruits (preferably organic).\n2) Foods of Early Agriculture \u2013 Foods to Consider Adding if Well-Tolerated\nEggs from well-raised chickens, raw dairy from well-raised cows and/or goats, organic brown rice and properly prepared gluten-containing grains. Things like fresh ground organic coffee are also included in this category.\n3) Paleo Foods to Use Sparingly\nThese are starchy Paleo foods like yams and sweet potatoes best left to post-workout and concentrated Paleo foods like coconut milk, dried fruits, raw nuts and seeds, nut and seed milks and raw honey.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supplements\nFoods in this category are things like coconut oils and the various fish oils that can be used to round out the fat content in the diet, protein powders (if necessary, well tolerated and of high quality), things like fiber supplements and certain nutrient supplements.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modern Foods \u2013 Avoid These\nThis category holds most everything else like processed foods, processed grain products, soy products, beans and legumes, roasted nuts, sugar and high-fructose corn syrup products. Alcohol is also in this category.\nA Graphical Representation of the Five Categories of Paleo\u2026\nIn Conclusion\u2026\nThose are the basics of what Paleo is. At least, that\u2019s my version. In the next post, I\u2019ll get into more of the details of the diet and explain how to make it work for you in a practical way.\nEditor\u2019s Note: \u00a0What are your thoughts on the Paleo diet? \u00a0Have you tried it, or are you thinking about it? \u00a0Let us know, and ask any questions you\u2019d like to have answered by Adam in the comments below! \u00a0(you can read more in Part 2 here )\nRelated Posts\n"}, {"score": 660.2122, "uuid": "9497893d-d0bf-5d67-8fc7-cff430667105", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0409wb-44-02730", "target_hostname": "www.enerhealthbotanicals.com", "target_uri": "http://www.enerhealthbotanicals.com/survive2thrive-food-storage-naturalnews.html", "page_rank": 1.1736189e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "100% Organic Stored <em>Food</em> for your emergency stored <em>foods</em>.", "snippet": "We put together example meals for each day and came out with these numbers. now many people might be concerned with calories, well there <em>is</em> <em>a</em> major <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> calories and nutrition. empty calories are detremental to your health, especially in <em>a</em> surivival&#x2F;crisis situation.", "explanation": null, "document": "PANCAKE MIX, GLUTEN FREE: 1 lb\nMISO POWDER: 1/4 lb\nSPICE MIX: 1/16 lb\nBLACK BEANS\nBlack Beans have a special kind of fiber that the colon uses to produce butyric acid, a fatty acid that the cells of the colon uses to fuel their activity and maintain proper intestinal transit time. Sufficient fiber intake is crucial to good intestinal health. Black beans are rich in fiber, beneficial antioxidants, folates, protein, minerals and B vitamins.\nGARBANZO BEANS\nGarbanzo Beans have high nutritional content, namely fiber, protein, trace minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, antioxidant rich phytochemicals and folates. Garbanzos, probably because of their high fiber and nutrient dense nature, give a feeling of fullness that prevents overeating. Garbanzos are high in fiber and many studies have shown how fiber assists in the balance of excess blood fats, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\nPINTO BEANS\nPinto Beans are high in fiber, which helps balance blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Pinto beans are also rich in beneficial antioxidants, folates, protein, minerals and B vitamins. One mineral that is especially rich in molybdenum that helps detox sulfites from the body. They also contain good iron content, a mineral that needs replenishing regularly. Other important minerals in pinto beans that are cofactors in the production of a very potent antioxidant, Superoxide Dismutase are copper and manganese.\u00a0 Pintos are particularly high in protein too.\nROLLED OATS\nOats are highly nutritious and are rich in fiber. The special form of fiber in oats is itself rich in beta glucans, a kind of fiber with important cholesterol\u00a0 and blood sugar balancing as well as immune enhancing benefits. Oats are also rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. They are versatile in that you can cook them or just soak them for 20-30 minutes before eating them. Soaking oats with raisins or other dried fruit creates a very tasty breakfast.\nGREEN LENTILS\nLentils are also a food with a high nutritional content.\u00a0 As with most beans and pulses, lentils are high in fiber, which help s balance blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Lentils are also are rich in beneficial antioxidants, folates, protein, minerals and B vitamins. One mineral that is especially rich in lentils is magnesium, an important mineral that helps relax arteries and thus benefit cardiovascular health. Another important mineral well represented in lentils is potassium, a crucial mineral involved in the cell\u2019s absorption of nutrients and release of waste. Lentils can be easily soaked overnight and then rinsed twice daily for 2-3 days until they sprout. In this form no cooking is needed and the lentils can be added to salads or sandwiches.\nQUINOA\nQuinoa is a nutty south American supergrain that is rich in amino acids (protein) as well as many other nutrients. What sets quinoa apart from other grains is that it is a complete protein. It is also high in mineral content, especially manganese, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and iron amongst others. Quinoa is also rich in phytochemicals that act as antioxidants in the body. A diet containing frequent portions of whole grains has been shown to contribute to a reduced risk for a large number of health conditions as part of a healthy lifestyle.\nMILLET\nMillet is another healthy grain that is less well known in the west but which is gaining in popularity. It has been enjoyed as a staple for hundreds of years in both Africa and certain regions of India. Millet is one of the few grains that is considered to have an alkaline effect on the body, a fact that is gaining recognition in many nutritional circles which consider that an alkaline body is less likely to succumb to disease.\u00a0 Millet is rich in amino acids, minerals, B vitamins and other important phytonutrients. It is particularly rich in phosphorous, a mineral that is crucial for the rebuilding of cell membranes and of the nervous system .\u00a0 It also has a high amino acid content.\nCHIA SEED\nChia itself is considered a superfood. It has an optimal balance of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids as well as being a superb source of vegetable based protein. Chia is hydrophilic in nature. It absorbs much more water than most other foods, leaving you feeling full and allowing your body to absorb nutrition more slowly.\nSPROUTED SUNFLOWER SEEDS\nSprouted sunflower seeds are very rich in folates and calcium as well as containing a good amount of vitamin E, B vitamins, iron, potassium and zinc. They also provide a good source of healthy fats. In the sprouted form most of the nutrients in the sunflower seeds soar. For example available calcium in the sprouted seed is almost three times as much as the non-sprouted seed. Available vitamin A skyrockets.\nBROWN RICE\nWhy would you ever eat white rice, when the milling process removes close to 70 % of the nutrient content. Rice is probably one of the most consumed grains worldwide. Unlike white rice, brown rice contains valuable fiber in its bran as well as vitamin rich properties in the valuable rice-germ. Brown rice is also rich in minerals such as selenium, manganese, iron and magnesium, not to mention the many essential fatty acids and B complex vitamins, in addition to substantial amounts of fiber.\nPOWDERED MILK\nOrganic powdered milk has a creamy taste with your oatmeal makes a winning breakfast. What\u2019s more, consuming dairy that is not organic is not at all healthy. This milk is 100 % organic from cows that are treated as nature intended, grass fed, free roaming and without hormones or antibiotics. Rich in calcium too.\nSPROUT BLEND\nSprout blend contains sprouts of the following seeds that are subsequently dried at a low temperature. French and red lentils; whole peas, mung beans, aduki beans, alfalfa and radish. As mentioned above under sprouted sunflower seeds, all sprouted seeds contain a much higher nutritional profile than their unsprouted counterparts.\nENERFOOD SUPERFOOD GREEN DRINK\nEnerfood, our award winning greens product Enerfood was a must for the pail, since it 100% Organic and contains powerful nutrition for better health, energy and immune system support. It is not just us that think so. Enerfood was Voted BEST SUPERFOOD by Natural News!\nPANCAKE MIX (GLUTEN FREE)\nThis pancake and baking mix makes delicious, gluten free and casein free pancakes, waffles, cr\u00eapes, muffins and more. This mix blends well with the organic powdered milk in the pail. If you follow a gluten free and/or casein free diet, you can blend this mix with dairy free rice, or almond milk.\nMISO POWDER\nThis organic fermented vegetable stock is easily rehydrated with water and added to your beans or grains just prior to turning off the heat . Once added, remove pot from heat and allow this final liquid to be absorbed into the grains or mix with the beans. Miso is a great buttery and salty stock alternative that is rich in Vitamin B12 and minerals.\nCAJUN SPICE MIX\nThis tasty little blend adds some zest to your stored foods. When you prepare your beans or lentils, you can add some Cajun spice to the pot to give some clean warming flavor.

Take, for example, Xiao Long Bao\u2014the soup-filled dumplings hailing from Shanghai that have since been popularized throughout the world. Even referring to them as \"dumplings\" is enough to set off some food scholars who insist that they are distinct from what we traditionally classify as dumplings. The question is, what does it mean to be authentic and more precisely, is it even possible for authenticity to be preserved across the many barriers of language mapping, social custom, and regional tastes?\nFirst, a bit of history: Generally thought to have been invented in the late 19th century, possibly as early as the years preceding the Guang Xu period (1875-1908) of Qing China, xiao long bao hail from the town of Nan Xiang in what is now Shanghai's Jiading district. There, they are called xiao long man tou (\"little basket steamed bread\")*. So the rumor goes, the first XLB were sold out of a shop owned by a Mr. Huang Mingxian, who was driven to innovate them due to the increased competition of new vendors attracted to the crowds his famous steamed buns brought in. Mr. Huang may have adapted the soup bun form, as the much larger but similarly shaped Yangzhou tang bao (\"soup bun\")** might indicate, but its unlikely that he invented them all his own.\n* For reasons of clarity, xiao long bao will be the term predominately used throughout the article unless otherwise necessary. Soup dumpling and XLB will be used when convenient. In Southern China, mantou, a foodstuff native to and imported from the country's North, is used to describe synonymously with bao zi to describe steamed with bread with a filling . Hence, xiao long man tou.\n** Its not entirely clear whether the giant soup buns are a recent invention or not.\nThis lore is probably condensed history. I spoke with Fuchsia Dunlop , the West's foremost expert on Chinese cuisine, who explained, \"I don't think anyone would say that Nan Xiang was the first place in the region to do the soupy dumplings because there are other versions which offer to go back much longer.\"*** Internationalized by Taiwanese chain Din Tai Fung, xiao long bao are today one of 83 folk arts protected by the Shanghai government.\n*** For her part, Dunlop suggests that XLB were probably invented closer to the turn of the (20th) century rather then the 1870s. Her two sources agree on this.\nWhat Makes A Dumpling?\nIn the West, \"dumpling\" is a term used to define a wide range of boiled, dough-based foods ranging from gnocchi to the simmered balls of biscuit dough in chicken 'n' dumplings to matzoh balls and pirogi. The term has been reapplied to a wide variety of similar boiled or steamed dough-based snacks from Asia without cooking method, technical composition, or wrapping style taken into account. Unlike western dumplings, Asian dumplings unanimously have fillings. However, in China, no single, all encompassing term for the concept exists. To give you a sense of the confusion, it's like lumping omelets and meringue cookies into a single, undifferentiated category simply because they are both made with beaten eggs. It's thus a logical fallacy to assume or imply a one-to-one mapping of the Western word \"dumpling\" and any Mandarin word for common forms of stuffed dough-based snacks.\nLet's take a look at a few key categories.\nJiao zi refers to a foodstuff of vegetables and/or meat wrapped in unleavened, pleated dough that is traditionally accompanied by a vinegar dipping sauce. (Guo tie, zheng jiao, and shui jiao are some variations.) This is most often what Westerners picture when they say \"dumpling\"; many dictionaries translate the word accordingly.\nServed in soup or sometimes a puddle of chili oil, hun tun (\"wontons\"), described by Dunlop as \"probably China's most ancient dumpling\", are related but distinct, generally made with square wrappers that are less formal in their pleating and sealing.\nDim Sum gaau (Cantonese for \"jiao\") are also distinct from either hun tun or jiao zi. Wonton wrappers often contain eggs and are square, jiao zi's are circular, and gauu thin to the point of translucency.\nPurse-shaped bao zi (roughly translated as \"wrapped around thing\") are made with a fluffy, sweet, yeast-leavened dough housing sweet or savory fillings and are regarded as their own species: steamed buns.\nFurther complicating matters, jiao zi wrappers can be made with leavened dough, as in Hebei province in central China. In the North, this is not uncommon either. Form, too, is essential: jiao zi are horn-shaped, hun tun larger and triangular or circular, and gaau tinier. Perhaps the most important thing to understand about dumplings, and buns too, is that any attempt to be definitive will ultimately fail. Fresh complications and intricacies inevitably arise.\nSo are Xiao Long Bao Dumplings?\nXiao long bao from Shanghai Cafe Deluxe . [Photograph: J. Kenji Alt-Lopez]\nIn New York, we tend to think of soup dumplings**** in narrow terms: little bao zi babies with thin jiao zi-esque wrappers. But no definitive form exists. In an article for CNNGo , preeminent Shanghai food critic Shen Hongfei explained that what are popularly marketed as xiao long bao are in fact \"Nanjing tang bao ... [these are] the soup-filled dumplings with very thin skin.\" For a proper xiao long bao, chef Antnight hony Zhao agrees, \"the skin should be a bit thicker then tang bao, but not as thick as in sheng jian [bao],\" and the filling meatier. When our conversation veered towards variations in style, Dunlop said, \"it may be that it's a kind of Western obsession. I can't say that definitively, it just seems that there are just different variations, and the Nan Xiang [style] has become very famous because it's an extremely touristy area.\"\n**** Contrary to the claims of a certain notoriously grumpy critic, there does indeed exist a word in Mandarin, \"\u6c64\" (\"tang\"), that translates into soup. At least according to my copy of the Common Press' Concise English-Chinese Dictionary (3rd edition), purchased in a Shanghai book store (which has to count for something here.)\nAs far as English terms are concerned, it seems acceptable to call something that is doughier a bun and something with a thinner wrapping a dumpling. So the argument goes, if bao zi have leavened dough, which is almost always true, but xiao long bao\u2014or the form Westerners are familiar with\u2014don't, then they are dumplings, not buns. However, if we are going to equate dumpling with jiao zi, then we ought to be clear. Leavened or unleavened dough, xiao long bao are not jiao zi, which are always horn shaped. Like other bao zi, XLB are purse shaped. As an all encompassing term for these related foodstuffs, dumpling doesn't do justice, failing to take into account the particulars and gray zones endemic to the Chinese perspective.\nIndeed, we already are dealing with an issue of translation between the microcultures of China. Bao zi were, for all intents and purposes, a foreign foodstuff to rice eating southern China. Imported from the wheat consuming north, they were already facing cultural reappropriation before making their way to our distant shores.\nThe problem with getting all riled up over whether \"soup dumpling\" is a misnomer or not is that translation is never clean. A dumpling means something different to a Chinese-American than it does to an Anglo-American eating in a Chinese restaurant or a Polish-American making pirogi. Food is constantly being re-contextualized, consumed and informed by people under new circumstances. Lost in all this white noise is the fact that \"dumpling\" is an English word with roots in Low German, used to describe a befuddling variety of unrelated foods.\nWhat Is Authenticity?\nThe soup dumpling obsession springs from the drive towards authenticity\u2014and particularly the prioritization of \"informed consumption\"\u2014which emphasizes experiencing cuisine in its original and unadulterated context; an attempt to remove \"the Other\" from our dining experience. Xiao long bao pointedly address the issue of how much influence the culture of origin should maintain. To what degree should we accommodate the original perspective? Should cultures deal with systematic and interruptive differences in classification through accommodation or correction?\nAs Dunlop pointed out, \"there are different ways of classifying things [in Chinese cuisine]. You can classify things by the kind of flour, the kind of starch used in the wrapper. Or by the shape, or by the filling, or by the cooking method. In daily life, it's not something people think about.\" Authenticity would demand that we strictly adhere to the system of origin. If food is the primary conduit through which we experience culture, then this is probably the right path.\nWhat this train of thought doesn't account for is that we are not, no matter the lengths, ever eating xiao long bao in the unadulterated context. Even at a stall in an unregulated Hongkou district night market, you are still, and maybe more than ever, a lao wei (\"foreigner\"). Authenticity in food is an illusion.\nIs this damnation? Not quite. Refusing to incorporate the external perspective devalues the culture of origin, limiting us to experiences we are already familiar with. When blogging about her dilemma over how to translate \u8c46\u8150 (\"do fu\") into English, Dunlop wrote: \"As someone writing about Chinese food and culinary culture, shouldn't I be advocating a Chinese-derived term when describing a foodstuff that has its origins in China? I suddenly noticed how many of the terms used by English speakers for Asian foods are derived from the Japanese.\" The problem with working from the secondary perspective is that the individual is presented with an already re-interpreted picture.\nIn his 1989 Vogue Magazine essay \"True Choucrote\", Jeffery Steingarten offers us a more elastic definition of authenticity. Writing about his pursuit of the most authentic choucroute garnie a l'Alsacienne (Alatian pork with sauerkraut), the critic advises: \"... if it could have been made in Alsace by a traditional cook, it is authentic. When my chart gave me permission, I choose what most pleased my tastes ... Authenticity seems more a matter of ranges and limitations than of outright prescriptions.\"\nHowever, in spite of Steingarten's guidelines, authenticity in food remains reductionist and misleading, at its worst favoring a crystallized illusion. It's a culinary imperialism that treats restaurants like reservations, where \"ethnic\" people cook food in ways that have not changed since time immemorial\u2014and always will. While recognizing its positive contributions, Dunlop noted, \"Authenticity should never be an argument for conservatism. Cuisines are always about where they are now\u2014they've always evolved through contact, through absorption of new ingredients, through contact with new people.\"\nMa po do fu, a misunderstood dish? [Photograph: J. Kenji Alt-Lopez ]\nIn his Shanghai cuisine primer Culinary Nostalgia , Mark Swislocki, referencing 1950s reporter Chen Mengyin, wrote, \"what passes for Sichuan cuisine today only took shape relatively recently, probably no more then 250 years ago.\" A flush of immigrants and new ingredients changed the game. Today, anything less than searing heat is considered a misrepresentation (it isn't). But when digging into that ma po do fu, you aren't thinking about how those chilies, which give the dish its vital kick, were originally brought over from the New World by European merchants. They have become synonymous with Sichuanese cuisine to the point of being one of its defining elements\u2014talk about evolution through contact with new people!\nIt's hard to find a more poignant example of the flaws inherent to the authenticity model.\nSuch \"defining\" foods are often mythologized, and in the process shed the complexity of their historical origins. Take pizza, brought over to the United States, as anybody could tell you, by Italian immigrants. Some Americans even make pilgrimages to Naples in search of more authentic pizza. But this was a two way street\u2014remember, the first tomatoes had to be imported from the New World.\nFusing Authentic Cuisines\nCemented into our culture as they are, restaurants are a modern invention. And it is becoming increasingly clear that, when presented in the authenticity paradigm, they limit our perception of what a cuisine can be. To suggest that a dish can only be made in one way, if it is to be true to its culture, ignores historical reality: If most people eat and ate at home, how can everyone possibly be eating the same thing? Do all New Yorkers only eat Brooklyn-style plain slices? It's a radical oversimplification. The concept of authenticity, as contemporarily pushed, ignores the malleable nature of food, framing it as static and unchanging.\nOnly, the problem is that food made with some notion of \"authenticity\" in mind is often made better; with more attention, love and respect. The best foods in the world are those that were developed by generations of home cooks and restaurant chefs who developed intricate systems of flavor with limited regionally-based resources. It's unreasonable to expect a single modern cook to invent a brand new cuisine or dish that can compete with, say, dumplings or pizza. In self-conscious modern \"fusion\" cuisines, cooking food spuriously often means appealing to the worst aspects of our palates and, in catering to cultural ignorance, stripping a cuisine of its eccentricities, producing a culinary minstrel show\u2014an edible farce.\nIn an interview with Eatocracy , chef Ming Tsai stated, \"it's adapted for the wrong reasons, to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public.\" Valuing authenticity affords greater diversity. It's easy to imagine the Chinese as one monolithic people when you imagine them all eating the cloyingly sweet General Tso's chicken. But, as Dunlop has pointed out, China is a continent unto itself, with a continuous stream of culture dating back to the Han dynasty and drawing on sources as ancient as the Bronze Age's Xia. With 1,226 miles between them, Shanghai and Chengdu, both culturally a part of Southern China, are twice as far apart as Berlin and London are. Step outside those bounds and the distances get enormous. Despite China's massive scale and population, for many foreigners, its cuisine and all of its varied traditions are compressed into one air-tight serving.\nA lot of New Yorkers would boast that you can't find good pizza anywhere outside of New York\u2014even 225 miles away in Boston. In contrast, Taiwan\u2014where the perceived international standard for xiao long bao was established at Din Tai Fung by a Shanxi immigrant\u2014is 430 miles away from Shanghai.\nFor the average American, minor technical differences don't matter much. But shouldn't they? Willful cultural ignorance is nothing to boast about. Yet, Dunlop concedes the inevitability of simplification and reconciliation: \"I could try to run a one-woman campaign for dou fu or beancurd, but this might be at the cost of winning converts to the pleasures of Chinese food, which is, after all, the main point of what I do.\" It's a position to consider. What's more important: celebrating the playful joys of soup dumplings or getting into fits over translation? The way the obsession\u2014giving the linguistic issue precedence over the culinary concern\u2014is manifested suggests a distracted focus; an objectification of food into cultural capital.\nWhat's the verdict? Food doesn't have to be \"authentic\" to be delicious\u2014though it certainly helps to maintain the spirit of the cuisine. Delimiting a food like pizza with an artificial certification of authenticity (like the standards set by the Vera Pizza Napoletana society) ignores its origins on the trade routes, a place of birth shared by a great deal of our favorite foods. Some Americans become obsessed with eating chilies, learning to love spicy in an effort to experience more authentic cuisine\u2014all the while forgetting where peppers first came from. That aside, the concept has undoubtedly pushed food forward in this nation, exposing millions to new flavors and ingredients they'd otherwise never experience. But maybe it's time we moved beyond authentic, towards a more malleable, and perhaps delicious, cuisine.\nAbout the author: Chris Crowley is a former Serious Eats intern and he author of the Bronx Eats column.

Some things I was sure had to be in the book, like a sour cherry souffl\u00e9 I once ate for lunch on a day trip to East Germany when I was nine or the stewed artichoke dish that my mother, not an enthusiastic cook, shall we say, learned from her equally bored-in-the-kitchen mother, but that is, nonetheless, a total delight. But I went back and forth on a lot of the other recipes for a long time, unsure whether it made sense to include them or not. In the end, the recipes that did make it into the manuscript are a motley jumble, sort of like me: Some Italian, some German, with a dose of American can-do spirit thrown in for good measure. Sadly, not every recipe I loved made the cut, like Bienenstich, for example, or potato dumplings. As you can probably imagine, a book-in-process has a mind of its own and some of my favorite recipes, try as I might, just did not fit the way I wanted them to. Since My Berlin Kitchen is a narrative, a food memoir, I had to stick with the food that really inspired the stories. One of the cast-offs were these pretzels: Yeasty, chewy, salty wonders that look far more complicated to make than they actually are. I loved finding that out. Here in Germany, good pretzels are everywhere (of course, the best ones are in the south of Germany - Berlin is not a pretzel region), but there is something so deeply satisfying about making these yourself. And fresh out of the oven, they are unbeatably delicious. (They do not, however, keep well. Eat them within a few hours of making them or don't bother at all - freezing doesn't help things either.) Besides, the recipe, which comes from Zingerman's Bakehouse, is so easy you will not believe it. You won't! But really, so easy. The key is having instant yeast, one of my very favorite things in the kitchen (also known as bread-machine yeast and, importantly, not the same thing as active dry. With instant yeast, you just add it directly to the flour without proofing it in warm water first). Once you've got your instant yeast, you make a quick yeast dough that has a little sugar and a little butter in it and then, before it's even risen or anything, you divide and shape it - either into pretzel shapes or into little round balls for pretzel rolls (delicious when split, buttered and filled with smoked salmon, in case you're wondering). Only after the pretzels and rolls are shaped do you let the dough proof, at first on the counter and then in the fridge. I made this recipe several times and I found the pretzels tasted best after a refrigeration of just one hour. The only other thing you have to do is hunt down some food-grade lye. Here in Germany, this means trekking to your closest Apotheke (pharmacy) and asking for Natriumhydroxid in pellet form. You'll get a little container with enough pellets (that you have to dissolve in water) for several batches of pretzels. But in the US, your best bet is to mail-order it on amazon.com. Do not, I repeat, do not bother with the baking soda bath replacement for lye. It isn't the same thing, not even close. Your pretzels will not have the same inimitable tang or color that the lye-dipped ones have and that make a pretzel intrinsically a pretzel. Once your pretzels have spent the requisite time in the fridge and you've prepared your lye bath (carefully, with gloves on, and - for security's sake - with any small children at a safe distance), you just heat your oven, line a baking sheet with ungreased parchment paper, dip each pretzel into the lye bath, plop it on the sheet, sprinkle it with salt, and then stick the sheet in the oven until the house fills with the smell of real pretzels after about 15 minutes. It's amazing. I love tearing into the pretzels when they're hot and pliable. If you've got a couple of mouths around, you'll find the pretzels disappear surprisingly quickly. The crumb is astoundingly white against the deep brown exterior and it has this wonderfully salty, complex flavor. In Bavaria, Laugenbrezeln are often served with a pungent mixture of softened Camembert, butter, raw onions, paprika and other spices called Obatzda - you tear off pieces of your pretzel and dip them into the cheese mixture - but all over the country you also often see Laugenbrezeln split horizontally and thickly buttered, then glued back together again. You know, just a light afternoon snack. Either way, they are delicious and - in my very biased opinion - light years better than a New York City street cart pretzel festooned with mustard. Not even in the same league, actually. So go forth and buy yourself some lye and get cracking! These are the most fun things (yes, I did just use that as a adverb, forgive me) to come out of my kitchen in a long while.

In a deep bowl, wearing rubber or latex gloves, make a solution of 1/2 cup lye and 10 cups water (or 1 part lye to 20 parts water); pour lye carefully into water to avoid splashing. Dip each pretzel in solution, turning it over for 10 to 15 seconds, and place back on baking sheet. 6. Sprinkle pretzels with salt. Bake about 15 minutes or until deep brown.

The GI tract is a large network of thousands of types of microorganisms consisting mostly of non-pathogenic bacteria. These bacteria flora, also known as the normal flora, serve two main purposes:\nTo help metabolize ingested foods that are otherwise indigestible by the human body.\nTo serve as a shield against pathogenic microbes by competing for resources and survival.\nGut Bacteria & Obesity\nIn an experiment conducted by the Nature Publishing Group, gut flora were taken from obese and lean mice to investigate their ability to affect absorption of nutrients. The normal flora of the obese mice were injected into a separate group of mice and it was observed that it \u201cproduce[d] a dramatic increase in body fat within 10\u201314 days, despite an associated decrease in food consumption.\u201d It is evident that metabolic activity of microbes in the gut causes abnormal amount of sugar to be absorbed.\nThere are varying genetic factors within the general population that affect protein and enzyme expression and efficacy. The bacteria flora in the GI tract is just one example of why obesity is more complicated than we think.\nDietary consumption is another key influence on obesity. Specifically, the type of food and its ability to be broken down into monosaccharides and/or triglycerides is directly correlated with how fattening it is. For food containing carbohydrates, its ability to be broken down can be quantified as its Glycemic Index. The more complex the food, the harder it is to break down and thus, the lower its glycemic index value will be.\nThat said, nutritional and dietary intake cannot be overly simplified with the concept of \u201c Calories In vs Calories Out \u201d. It is a common misconception that causes confusion. As a health professional puts it, \u201cit\u2019s not quite so simple as 3,500 calories being the deficit to lose a pound.

Over the last 10-15 years, I've been noticing a proliferation in the number of magazine articles and books discussing menopause and the controversies surrounding estrogen replacement therapy. I've also noticed that fewer of us are resorting to euphemism when discussing menopause. For 4 out of 5 mid-life women, menopausal symptoms remind us of the distinctly physical aspects of this biological change.\nThe Co-op has a good selection of books on natural approaches to menopause. When I was asked to write on this subject, I selected four books, and in the week and a half that I've had them, I've read between one-half to three-quarters of each. I wish I could tell you that I've found a quick way to relieve my hot flashes, or that I have found the book to answer all my questions on menopause. But, I haven't. I still dress in easily shed layers, and while I feel better read on the subject than I was two weeks ago, I am even more aware of the controversies and disagreements over treatment to relieve menopausal symptoms.\nI'll discuss the four books in the same order that I read them.\nEstrogen the Natural Way by Nina Shandler is an eminently useful book containing over 250 recipes for the menopausal woman. Ms. Shandler's recipes incorporate generous amounts of soy and flaxseeds, natural sources of phytoestrogens and lignans. Prestigious medical journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Cancer Research, and the British Medical Journal, have published articles citing the health benefits of eating soy and flaxseed. These plant foods offer estrogenic benefits without the (cancer) risk of pharmaceutical estrogen replacement therapy (referred to as ERT).\nThe book contains useful charts, such as one diagramming the nutrients in soy vs. dairy and meat, and another charting how much of these estrogenic foods one needs to eat in order to reap their beneficial properties. For the soy novice, Shandler unravels the differences between silken tofu, firm tofu, or tempeh. She explains why she uses flaxseeds in her recipes, rather than flax oil. (Though flax oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, it is not a good source of plant estrogens called lignans. Lignans are not only estrogenic, but they also benefit the cardiovascular system and digestive regularity.) Both the information in the introductory chapters and the recipes intrigued me enough that I'll purchase this book.\nMenopause Naturally, by Sadja Greenwood, M.D., is very informative and easy to read. The author is a practicing physician and professor whose chief interests are gynecology and women's health care. Because Greenwood suffered and survived breast cancer in her early 40's, she had a vested interest in nonhormal methods (not HRT) for lessening menopausal symptoms, as well as in finding ways to lessen the risk of long-term low-estrogen conditions, such as osteoporosis.\nI was intrigued to learn that hot flashes occur because menopausal women are not able to manage any subtlety in maintaining their skin temperature. We all shiver to keep warm and sweat to cool off in order to maintain an average body temperature of 98.6 degrees. Estrogen plays a key role in helping our skin's blood vessels expand and contract. With less estrogen, menopausal women's fluctuating efforts to maintain body temperature is dramatically pronounced. Greenwood writes that only about 10% of Japanese women (who eat soy daily) have hot flashes, compared to 80% of North Americans. My only criticism on this book is that it does not go into any single aspect of menopause in depth, but rather is a (successful) overview. This is a good first book for the woman preparing for this time in life.\nMenopausal Years, The Wise Woman Way, by Susun S. Weed offers herbs and soothing words to assuage and to celebrate the midlife changes of menopause. Of the four books I took home, this was the one I liked the least. In fairness, there was a lot of useful information in this book, such as helpful sections on calcium sources from both food and herbs, the prompting for adequate loading-onto-the-skeleton exercise to prevent osteoporosis, and the advice to use only one herb at a time when trying herbal treatments. What alienated me was the heavy current of goddess language that ran through the entire text. I realize that what turned me off may very well be what most attracts the next reader. If you like talk of \"wise woman ways\", \"crone's ceremonies\" and such, this may be the very book for you. Or, if you are specifically interested in herbal treatments for the symptoms that accompany menopause, the author seems very knowledgeable. At the author's recommendation, I am drinking a fenugreek seed tea at night and in the morning in an effort to temper hot flashes. The author promises that (at least) my \"sweat will smell like sweet maple syrup\".\nI regret that I left What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause by John R. Lee, M.D. until last. I've run out of time to read the entire book before this article's deadline. Now, I'll have to purchase this book, too! Dr. Lee, and co-author Virginia Hopkins, offers meaty information on the confusing subject of hormone replacement therapy and natural progesterone. This is not easy (or light) reading, but the authors' ideas on the benefits of natural progesterone seem intriguing and valuable. In brief, Dr. John Lee thinks that standard HRT is harmful and that many of the adverse symptoms of menopause are not due to low estrogen levels, but rather to the menopausal loss of our bodies' production of progesterone. Lee writes that the form of progesterone that is typically used in HRT is not natural, nor beneficial.\nDuring the month of May, the Coop will offer special savings on EmeritaJ products. As the EmeritaJ Pro-Gest Natural Progesterone Cream is one of the recommended creams in Dr. Lee's book, I am going to finish the book and make an informed decision whether this is a product I'd like to try.\nEating Flax and Soy\nBy Pamela Lee, from the June 1999 Newsletter\nWhen I wrote last month's newsletter article, I had been hounded by months of unrelenting hot flashes. My hot flashes did not follow the typical pattern cited in the four books I reviewed in last month's article on menopause \u0096 worse in the evening and night hours. Rather, mine were occurring in an irritating 24-hour schedule, as if wacky unseen forces were flipping my internal thermostat between 95 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. I'd resorted to an only-cardigan wardrobe, and given up wearing any pullover shirt or sweater, which couldn't be shed quickly enough. But I've found relief! In less than a month's time, my hot flashes have been tamed. Though they still warm me unexpectedly, they are far less severe and mercifully less frequent. I owe my comfort to eating flax and some soy.\nNow guys, lest you think this article is just for us middle-age women, much has been written about scientific studies indicating the beneficial benefits for both men and women in eating more flax and soy foods. The lignins and the essential fatty acids in flax seed have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and to play a role in cancer prevention. Phytochemicals in soy have been shown to interfere with the reproduction of prostate cancer cells. Not only is breast cancer lower in Asia, but rates of prostate cancer are also low among men eating traditional Asian diets which rely on soy products for protein.\nI was afraid that food allergies would prevent me from making use of the beneficial benefits of soy. I used to eat a lot of tofu, back in my decade of vegetarianism. But I had since become sensitized to soy. I'm please to find that after leaving soy alone for years, I can now eat it occasionally (once a week or so), but still not everyday. My (hot flash) cure came by consuming 23 tablespoons of flaxseed, daily. Sometimes I ate my daily dose in crackers, cookies, or quick bread. But I found that a fruit smoothie was just as tasty and more efficient when I hadn't time to cook. Simply grind 23 T. of flaxseed in an electric coffee grinder, then blend it with fruit and rice milk, soymilk, yogurt, or milk. My favorite flax smoothie is: 1 banana, 1 cup blueberries (frozen until fresh is available), 2/3 cup rice milk, and 23 T. ground flaxseed. If you use soymilk, you'll increase the phytoestrogenic benefits of your drink. If your sweet tooth needs tickling, add 2 T. of blackstrap molasses and you'll be gaining more calcium as well.\nThis first recipe is what got me started with my daily dose of flaxseed. These bars are so tasty and easy to prepare, that I found the daily dose not only pain-free, but also pleasurable. When my home-dried supply of apples ran out, I made this cookie using (the Co-op's) organic dried figs. I added a dash of salt and 2 T. molasses, then renamed my version \"Flax Newtons\". The following two recipes are from Nina Shandler's book called Estrogen The Natural Way.\nApple Bars\nPrep and cooking time: under 20 minutes\nEquipment: electric coffee grinder and electric food processor.\nYield: Makes 8 bars\n1/2 c frozen apple juice or orange juice concentrate\n2 c dried apples\n1 1/4 c flaxseed\n1 T vanilla extract\nPlace the juice concentrate and dried apple rings in a saucepan. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until softened.\nWhile the apples cook, grind the flaxseed in an electric coffee grinder 1/3 cup at a time. Pour the ground seeds into a food processor with the S blade inserted. Add the softened dried apples and vanilla.\nProcess until the mixture is dough-like. If the mixture rises above the processor blades, shut off the machine and push the mixture down with a spatula. Then, turn the machine back on. When the dough is fully mixed, it will form a ball in the well of the food processor.\nPress the dough evenly into a 9x9-inch cake pan. Cut into eight bars. (Make three evenly spaced cuts in one direction and one in the other.) Remove from the pan. Place in a storage container or in plastic sandwich bags. Refrigerate.\nThese crackers are wonderfully good. They are darker and heavier than corn chips, but still taste great with dips or salsa. I suggest trying them with the hummus. You can use 1/2 to 1 t salt instead of the miso.\nCorn Crackers\nPrep and cooking time: under 10 minutes\nBaking time: 25 minutes\n"}, {"score": 586.8744, "uuid": "2da726ec-9e86-5332-b38c-e789237891fe", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0405wb-31-15901", "target_hostname": "www.fredericpatenaude.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fredericpatenaude.com/blog/?p=283", "page_rank": 1.5192768e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Did We Adapt to Cooked <em>Foods</em>? | Frederic Patenaude Raw <em>Foods</em> Diet", "snippet": "It <em>is</em> possible.

This is inevitable; I judge the relevance of any award by the amount of controversy it causes. Few people care that they didn\u2019t get an award they didn\u2019t know about. But as bloggers and their readers grouse, I thought I\u2019d offer my perspective as a judge.\nThe judging process was straightforward: Anyone could nominate a blog in any of the categories, and when nominations closed, Tom sent each of the judges a spreadsheet with all the nominees. As far as I know, every nominated blog was on the spreadsheet, except for the ones written by the judges and the ones that didn\u2019t meet Tom\u2019s eligibility requirements. Each of the six judges ranked five finalists in each category, and then Tom combined all those to come up with the top four finalists he presented to readers.\nMy Judging\nJudges could use any criteria we wanted for deciding our top five. I gave 50 points for the \u201cso what?\u201d factor, which varied based on the category. For the Single Subject category, for instance, my \u201cso what?\u201d translated into a simple question: If I wanted to learn about your subject, would your blog be a good way to do it? Then I gave 40 points for writing ability: Can the blogger communicate in a logical way? Does s/he demonstrate good knowledge rather than knee-jerk, poorly considered opinions? Finally, I gave 10 points for mechanics: Does the blogger know that it\u2019s and its are separate words? Does s/he drop words from sentences? I gave this little weight in the total because most blogs don\u2019t have copy editors. (For the graphics awards, I just gave a single score.)\nI read the front page of entries for each site, and then all the posts from last September \u2014 sometimes people beef up their posts at awards time. I took notes on each blog. Brutal notes, too: I summed up one site with \u201cblah blah blah\u201d and another with \u201cwho nominated this site?\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if the site\u2019s author was a real-life friend, a social-networking \u201cfriend,\u201d or a total stranger. I tried to be as objective as one can be in a subjective context.\nIs This The Best We Can Do?\nTom wrote of the finalists , \u201cThe collection of finalists \u2026 is a stellar example of all the things that are outstanding about the wine blogosphere.\u201d As someone who pored through all the nominees, I had the opposite view: Is this the best we can do? There were one or two categories where I wished I could submit just three finalists, not five. In my scheme, not one site scored above 90 points (though there was at least one 89).\nI am guilty of many of the sins I noticed on other blogs. I\u2019m not sure how I would grade OWF if I were looking at it through the objective lens I turned on the WBA nominees. So I used my Web-wide jaunt as a reminder about what I could do to improve this site.\nSome of you may find these little discoveries interesting. Some of you may tell me to take a hike (or, you know, some other phrase). That\u2019s fine, because I want to preface these comments with one bit of advice: Write your blog for yourself. Writing for rewards and recognition is a sucker\u2019s game. I have felt the sting of being overlooked for awards, but I finally remembered that I write OWF for my own benefit; my readers seem to keep coming back, so who cares if I don\u2019t have a little badge in my sidebar?\nWhat I Learned From The AWBA Nominees\nContext matters. If I want to read page after page of \"berries-cherries-flowers\" tasting notes and irrelevant scores, I\u2019ll pick up one of the big wine magazines. If I want to read uneducated, fawning press about some new health effect of wine, I\u2019ll turn to newspapers. As bloggers, we can tell our readers why a given wine matters (or doesn\u2019t) and where it fits in the world. We have the ability to talk about how it moves us (or doesn\u2019t). We can wrap news stories in our own opinions and research. We can take a reader farther than the magazines can. We can teach and inform.\nPersonality matters. As bloggers, we don\u2019t have to adhere to a dry, third-person editorial voice. We can be ourselves. We can use the first-person perspective that few feature wells allow. Of course, too much personality can grate on the reader, but too much is better than none at all. When I read a blog post, I want to get a sense of the person who wrote it. I want to care enough to click on the \u201cAbout\u201d link at the top of your page. We should let ourselves shine through a bit more.\nWriting matters. I\u2019m not a prescriptivist about grammar, despite what you may think. But you don\u2019t need to memorize Strunk & White to communicate ideas in a useful way. Writing is a craft before it\u2019s an art, and almost anyone can learn the craft. Magazines and newspapers have hard-working editors who clean up a writer\u2019s prose: We have to rely on ourselves. I gave some advice about this in an earlier post \u2014 and I would add A Writer\u2019s Coach to my list of recommended books \u2014 but I think many blogs would benefit from a few hours between writing and posting and one last careful read before the author hits Publish.\nWe have the opportunity to transform the way people look at wine. Our readers bond with us, learn about our lives, and trust our recommendations in ways most wine writers can\u2019t imagine. We can introduce our readers to something beyond the mass-market bottles and the everyday grapes. We can show them that high quality doesn\u2019t only come from a big magazine.\n"}, {"score": 580.6101, "uuid": "ea96a601-5b37-5e50-bfb7-cb8fd44b1acc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-54-29316", "target_hostname": "merecat.org", "target_uri": "http://merecat.org/food/", "page_rank": 1.1896657e-08, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "mere cat: <em>Food</em>", "snippet": "I like to call myself <em>the</em> CrustMaster 2000\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 mostly because I have been using <em>a</em> <em>food</em> <em>processor</em> recently instead of <em>a</em> pastry <em>blender</em> to cut in <em>the</em> shortening.)", "explanation": null, "document": "1 cup thick sour cream\n1 tablespoon sugar\nvanilla [I used 1/2 teaspoon]\n1.

The detours added at least three hours to the travel time, but made the trip seem shorter and certainly far less grueling.\nI was not familiar with places outside the southeastern corner of the Keystone State, so for guidance we turned to Lew Bryson's dead-tree compendium \u201c Pennsylvania Breweries ,\u201d an iPhone app called Find Craft Beer and, of course, beermapping.com .\nThe first stop was Selin\u2019s Grove Brewing which had the most imaginative and best-executed menu of any place on the trip, including many vegetarian options.

Blue Canoe occupies the building formerly occupied by Four Sons, which we had visited in years past; not much has changed. More good food and beer and even live music.\nConsidering its size, Erie itself disappointing, almost devoid of craft beer, at least according to our references. We had lunch at Matthews Trattoria & Martini Lounge . Fine food, but macros only. From there, we walked a few blocks to the only brewpub, The Brewerie at Union Station , which, in the middle of Friday afternoon was basically empty. Andy\u2019s Pub had an acre of pool tables, but only two beers on tap: Bud Lite or Miller Lite.

It wasn't until the early twentieth century, however, that the phenomenon of the 'Indian' restaurant or curry house, as we know it today, really took off. The earliest South Asian restaurant kitchens worked with a one-pot system, where a thurka (sauce) was made as a base for creating dishes such as the korma and jalfrezi.\nThere are now over eight thousand restaurants in Britain serving their own version of South Asian regional cuisine, and it should come as no surprise that, over time, food has been adapted for the British palate. Dishes such as the every-popular masala are very much British Asian creations, and it's unlikely that they would ever be served at any table in India or Pakistan. It's a rare thing indeed to hear a child of South Asian descent say 'My Mum cooked a great vindaloo last night!'\nEven dishes widely regarded in the UK as 'truly authentic' are anglicized, such as the balti, an anglicized form of the Urdu word meaning 'bucket'. The balti is thought to have been popularized in the 'Balti Belt' of Sparkhill and Sparkbrook in Birmingham, where restaurants cooked huge amounts of curries in big buckets.\nIn the last few years there has been a backlash against the anglicization of South Asian food, with dhosas (thin Indian pancakes made with gram flour) and lassi cropping up on menus UK-wide.\nPrevious:\nany material that can be ingested by an organism and metabolized to provide energy and precursors for biosynthetic reactions.\nPrevious:\nHome > Library > Animal Life > Veterinary Dictionary\nMaterials taken into the body by mouth which provide nourishment in the form of energy or in the building of tissues.

It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , or minerals . The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort to produce energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.\nFood safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection , World Resources Institute , World Food Programme , Food and Agriculture Organization , and International Food Information Council . They address issues such as sustainability , biological diversity , climate change , nutritional economics , population growth , water supply , and access to food .\nThe right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ), recognizing the \"right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food\", as well as the \"fundamental right to be free from hunger\".\nContents\nFood sources\nGlobal average daily calorie consumption\nAlmost all foods are of plant or animal origin. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. Maize , wheat , and rice - in all of their varieties - account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. [2]\nOther foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi , especially mushrooms . Fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread , alcoholic drinks , cheese , pickles , kombucha , and yogurt . Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina . [3] Inorganic substances such as baking soda and cream of tartar are also used to chemically alter an ingredient.\nPlants\nSee also: Herbs and spices\nMany plants or plant parts are eaten as food. There are around 2,000 plant species which are cultivated for food, and many have several distinct cultivars . [4]\nSeeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as Omega fats . In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals ( maize , wheat , rice , et cetera ), legumes ( beans , peas , lentils , et cetera ), and nuts . Oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower , flaxseed , rapeseed (including canola oil ), sesame , et cetera . [5]\nSeeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered a health food, although not all seeds are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a lemon , pose a choking hazard, while seeds from apples and cherries contain a poison ( cyanide ).\nFruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants have evolved fruits that are attractive as a food source to animals, so that animals will eat the fruits and excrete the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes , pumpkins , and eggplants , are eaten as vegetables. [6] (For more information, see list of fruits .)\nMain articles: Animal source foods and Food chain\nAnimals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. Meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from muscle systems or from organs . Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands , which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter , et cetera). In addition, birds and other animals lay eggs , which are often eaten, and bees produce honey , a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood , sometimes in the form of blood sausage , as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured , salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as civet . [8]\nSome cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. Vegetarians do not consume meat. Vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source.\nProduction\nMain articles: Agriculture , Food industry , and Genetically modified food\nTraditionally, food was obtained through agriculture . With increasing concern in agribusiness over multinational corporations owning the world food supply through patents on genetically modified food , there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages biodiversity , local self-reliance and organic farming methods. [9] Major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the World Trade Organization and Common Agricultural Policy ), national government policy (or law), and war. [10]\nIn popular culture, the mass production of food, specifically meats such as chicken and beef, has come under fire from various documentaries, most recently Food, Inc , documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals, often for easier revenues from large corporations . Along with a current trend towards environmentalism, people in Western culture have had an increasing trend towards the use of herbal supplements, foods for a specific group of person (such as dieters, women, or athletes), functional foods (fortified foods, such as omega-3 eggs), and a more ethnically diverse diet. [11]\nSeveral organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised. According the International Water Management Institute and UNEP , well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fibre and animal products, they also provide services such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, erosion control and habitats for plants, birds fish and other animals. [12]\nTaste perception\nMain article: Taste\nAnimals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet , sour , salty , bitter , and umami . As animals have evolved , the tastes that provide the most energy ( sugar and fats ) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter , are not enjoyable. [13] Water, while important for survival, has no taste. [14] Fats, on the other hand, especially saturated fats , are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.\nSweet\n3D structure of cellulose , a beta-glucan polysaccharide .\nGenerally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose , or disaccharides such as sucrose , a molecule combining glucose and fructose. [15] Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include raw sugar , which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.\nThe stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar. [16]\nSour\nSourness is caused by the taste of acids , such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus , specifically lemons , limes , and to a lesser degree oranges . Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria. [17] Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.\nSalty\nSalt mounds in Bolivia .\nSaltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium . It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt , fleur de sel , kosher salt , mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney 's function.\nThe rind or pith of a lemon is exceptionally bitter, while the lemon itself is characterized as sour.\nSalt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths , tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically speaking, salt has been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion, thus working as a preservative. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety. [18]\nBitter\nBitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Dark, unsweetened chocolate , caffeine , lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.\nUmami\nUmami , the Japanese word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture, but has a long tradition in Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of glutamates , especially monosodium glutamate or MSG. [15] It is characterized as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor. Salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami. Meat and other animal byproducts are described as having this taste.\nCuisine\nMain articles: Cuisine , Regional cuisine , and Global cuisines\nMany cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as gastronomy . Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption. Some popular types of ethnic foods include Italian , French , Japanese , Chinese , American , Cajun , Thai , and Indian cuisine. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits . While evolutionarily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are omnivores , religion and social constructs such as morality , activism , or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste , the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.\nPresentation\nMain article: Food presentation\nAesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people \"eat with their eyes.\" Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory. [19] [20]\nContrast in texture\nTexture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding granola to yogurt , adding croutons to a salad or soup , and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter. [21]\nContrast in taste\nAnother universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. Opposite flavors, such as sweet and saltiness , tend to go well together, such as in kettle corn and with nuts .\nFood preparation\nMain article: Outline of food preparation\nWhile many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, palatability , texture , or flavor . At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, pressure cooking , fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a kitchen . Some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to preserve the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place. [22]\nRefrigerators help to keep food fresh.\nAnimal preparation\nWorkers and cattle in a slaughterhouse\nThe preparation of animal-based food usually involves slaughter , evisceration , hanging, portioning, and rendering . In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses , which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the United States has established the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as kosher , shechita , and dhabi\u0125a halal. Strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut. [23]\nOn the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and seafood may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality. [24]\nCooking\nMain article: Cooking\nThe term \"cooking\" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as culinary art , generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, tools , and the skill of the individual cook. [25] The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it. [26]\nCooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, texture , appearance, and nutritional properties. [27] Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at Homo erectus campsites dating from 420,000 years ago. [28] Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of pottery . [29]\nCooking equipment\nMain article: Cookware and bakeware\nThere are many different types of equipment used for cooking.\nOvens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to 500 \u00b0F) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens; for example, Indian culture uses a Tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. [30] Western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens , conventional ovens, toaster ovens , or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven . Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas , electric, or oil-fired. [31]\nVarious types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a saut\u00e9 pan , sauce pot, frying pan , or pressure cooker . These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming , simmering , boiling , and poaching for moist methods, while the dry methods include saut\u00e9ing , pan frying , and deep-frying . [32]\nIn addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A grill operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking. [33] A Mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa , which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In Argentina , an asado (Spanish for \"grilled\") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled. [34]\nRaw food preparation\nMain article: Raw foodism\nCertain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in their raw state. Salads consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. Sashimi in Japanese cuisine consists of raw sliced fish or other meat, and sushi often incorporates raw fish or seafood. Steak tartare and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with baguettes , brioche , or frites . [35] In Italy, carpaccio is a dish of very thinly sliced raw beef , drizzled with a vinaigrette made with olive oil. [36] The health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above 118 \u00b0F (47.8\u00a0\u00b0C). [37] An example of a raw meat dish is ceviche , a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is \"cooked\" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.\nRestaurants\nMain article: Restaurant\nRestaurants employ trained chefs who prepare food, and trained waitstaff to serve the customers. The term restaurant is credited to the French from the 19th century, as it relates to the restorative nature of the bouillons that were once served in them. However, the concept pre-dates the naming of these establishments, as evidence suggests commercial food preparation may have existed during the age of the city of Pompeii , and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in China during the Song Dynasty . The coffee shops or caf\u00e9s of 17th century Europe may also be considered an early version of the restaurant. [38] In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion for out-of-home dining . Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants ( fast food ), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and vending machines , 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases. [39]\nFood manufacturing\nMain article: Food manufacture\nPackaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international food industry . Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved salting , curing , curdling, drying , pickling , fermenting , and smoking . [40] Food manufacturing arose during the industrial revolution in the 19th century. [41] This development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging new technology, such as milling , preservation, packaging and labeling , and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants. [42]\nAt the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food brands . There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies. [43] Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated processing and packaging methods, and logistics and distribution advances can enhance product quality, improve food safety , and reduce costs. [42]\nCommercial trade\nFood imports in 2005\nInternational exports and imports\nThe World Bank reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the USA and Japan. Food is now traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season. [44] Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports. [45] Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports. [46]\nIn 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in a dramatic increase in trade liberalization . This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the WTO enforcement of agricultural subsidy , tariffs , import quotas , and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved. [47] Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade. [48]\nMarketing and retailing\nMain article: Food marketing\nFood marketing brings together the producer and the consumer. It is the chain of activities that brings food from \"farm gate to plate\". [49] The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans. [50] The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.\nIn the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers. [26] [42] With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter -based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them. [26] [51]\nIn the 20th century, supermarkets were born. Supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts , and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world. [52]\nUnlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to advertising , transportation, and intermediate corporations. [53]\nPrices\nMain articles: 2007\u20132008 world food price crisis and Food vs. fuel\nIt was reported on March 24, 2008, that consumers worldwide faced rising food prices. [54] Reasons for this development include changes in the weather and dramatic changes in the global economy , including higher oil prices , lower food reserves, and growing consumer demand in China and India . [54] In the long term, prices are expected to stabilize. [54] Farmers will grow more grain for both fuel and food and eventually bring prices down. [54] Already this is happening with wheat , [55] [56] with more crops to be planted in the United States , Canada , and Europe in 2009. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018. [54]\nIt is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of pork jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983. [54]\nFood prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. [57]\nFamine and hunger\nFood deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation . This is often connected with famine , which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. Rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war. [10]\nStarvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes. [58] Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales . [59]\nFood aid\nMain article: Food aid\nFood aid can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required. [60] Conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop. [61] Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as food politics . Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries. [62] International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the World Food Programme . [63]\nSafety\nSalmonella bacteria is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in undercooked chicken and chicken eggs\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) Flowchart\nFoodborne illness , commonly called \"food poisoning\", is caused by bacteria , toxins , viruses , parasites , and prions . Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version. [64] The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as \"foreign bodies\") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze. [64]\nFood poisoning has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates. [65] The sale of rancid , contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of hygiene , refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other microbiological studies by scientists such as Louis Pasteur , contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of Justus von Liebig , which led to the development of modern food storage and food preservation methods. [66] In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ( HACCP ), which can identify and eliminate many risks. [67]\nRecommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking. [68]\nFoods that spoil easily, such as meats , dairy , and seafood , must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the general rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as Salmonella or E. coli . [69]\nAllergies\nMain article: Food allergy\nSome people have allergies or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy. [70] The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are gluten , corn , shellfish (mollusks), peanuts , and soy . [70] Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea , rashes , bloating, vomiting , and regurgitation . The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen . [70]\nRarely, food allergies can lead to a medical emergency , such as anaphylactic shock , hypotension (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although latex products can induce similar reactions. [70] Initial treatment is with epinephrine (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an Epi-pen or Twinject . [71] [72]\nOther health issues\nHuman diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of cancers in a human epidemiological analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto in 1981. [73] These cancer may be caused by carcinogens that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain mycotoxins such as aflatoxins which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts. Other carcinogens identified in food include heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, polyaromatic hydrocarbons in charred meat and smoked fish, and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon . [74]\nAnticarcinogens that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruits and vegetable. Antioxidants are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens. [74]\nDiet\nMain article: Diet (nutrition)\nCultural and religious diets\nDietary habits are the habitual decisions a person or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. [75] Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos . Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only kosher foods are permitted by Judaism , halal foods by Islam , and in Hinduism beef is restricted. [76] In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's cuisine .\nDiet deficiencies\nMain article: Avitaminosis\nDietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of adipose tissue, known as body fat. [77] Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, iodine deficiency . [78] It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to vitamin A deficiency. [79] Vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy . [80] Calcium , Vitamin D , and phosphorus are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein. [81]\nMoral, ethical, and health conscious diets\nMany individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a healthier diet , avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and antioxidants . [82] Obesity , a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing heart disease , diabetes , and many other diseases. [83] More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from genetically modified food . [84] Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming ( grains ) on animal welfare , human health, and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a counterculture with a preference for organic and local food . [85]\nNutrition and dietary problems\nUSDA Food Pyramid\nBetween the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition , there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy , obesity , or osteoporosis , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.\nNutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins . Additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber .\nAs previously discussed, the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for hunters and gatherers . Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with advanced technology , enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.\nLegal definition\nSome countries list a legal definition of food. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as foodstuffs include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans . In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, chewing gum , water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed , live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, cosmetics , tobacco and tobacco products, narcotic or psychotropic substances , and residues and contaminants.

Regardless, I do feel that I was a little harsh yesterday in my statement against one of FN's stars: Sunny Anderson.\nAt first, I thought it was some joke. A mere poser pretending to be a celebrity but to my surprise, it was Sunny herself. After reading her comment and reflecting on my post, I realized I had forgotten why I - all of us - started cooking in the first place. I love food.\nAs we journey further into the never-ending realm that is food, we lose focus of why we started to cook or become fascinated by food. We become tangled and entrenched by techniques, Michelin stars, fancy ingredients, gorgeous photographs, etc. as we become more seduced by this wonderful passtime,tradition and culture.\nThis phenomena isn't just in the case of food: it's everywhere. We start to play a sport because it's fun and you like playing against friends and peers. As you become more involved and develop as a player, the \"fun\" element is lost only to be replaced by stats, equipments, fame and W's.\nAlthough I still hold my opinions about FN, I do believe that celebrity chefs are a necessary - and essential - force to develop future cooks and chefs. I've always made fun of Rachael Ray and Sandra Lee of how ridiculous some of their creations are. However, if they can motivate another mother/father, another child or another Ryne to start cooking - they've succeeded. Even if they use store-bought marinara sauce, absolutely butcher a classic dish or the end product looks like goo out of Alien, as long as homemade food is being shared and loved with friends/family, it's a triumph in the name of food. And really, who gives a damn what it's called (of course to a certain extent) . If it tastes good, it tastes good. If you love food, you love food.\nSo I challenge you chefs and homecooks alike, rediscover your love for food and go back to the passion that started it all: What made you start cooking or sparked your interest in food?\nOn that note, I leave you with a fast and easy recipe that's perfect as a weeknight meal. I used white crab meat but feel free to use jumbo lump, lump or even claw meat. The fresher the better but regardless - it's still going to be a tasty dish.\nAngel Hair Pasta with Crab\nFrom Gordon Ramsay's Cookalong Live , Serves 2 as a Main or 4 as a Starter\nIngredients:\n- 0.5 lb angel hair pasta\n- 3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced\n- 1 red chili, sliced thinly\n- 5 spring onions, chopped\n- 0.333 (third) of a cup of white wine\n- juice of 2 limes\n- 0.5 lb white crab meat\n- handful of parsley, chopped once\n1) Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and once it's at a rolling boil, add olive oil and add the pasta. Cook the pasta to al dente, which should be about 2 - 3 minutes: just enough time to make the sauce.\n2) In a hot pan, add olive oil and saute the garlic, chili and spring onions for a minute or two. Season with salt and pepper.\n3) After sauteing briefly, deglaze with white wine by circling around the edge of the pan.\n4) Reduce the white wine to a syrup consistency and add the crab meat and the juice of 1 lime. Heat the crab meat through.\n5) Drain the pasta and season lightly with salt/pepper and add a little extra-virgin olive oil to the pasta to prevent sticking.\n6) Add the pasta to the sauce and throw in the chopped parsley. Stir to combine.\n7) Serve immediately with another squeeze of lime juice before diving in.\n________________________________________________________\nCome back tomorrow to find out what that melted butter will be used for.

But a Boston Scrod is still the \"catch of the day\".\nBACK TO TOP\nTWO APPLES A DAY!\nThe apple is one of our most common fruits and has been popular since prehistoric times. Wild apples originated in central Asia and spread slowly westward into Europe so that by the middle ages apples were a major fruit crop. When the Roman legions invaded Britain, they brought their own apples even though the ancient Norse had cultivated apples on the island long before.\nWhen the Europeans came to colonize the new world, they brought their apples as well as plums, pears and cherries. Apples favour any climate but tropical and they are a fruit that thrives in our climate. There was a time barely a century ago that you could count upwards of 1000 varieties of apples being grown. Apples were most popular because they could be kept year round without refrigeration ensuring a steady supply of fresh fruit throughout the winter.\nOf those 1000's of varieties that were grown, barely a dozen are grown commercially. Growers wanted uniformity, shorter trees for picking and apples that just plain looked good. Years of careful breeding have produced a product that travels well and lasts but we have missed out on some of the different tastes that were available. Lucky for us that an apple tree is very hardy and long-lived. Cuttings have been taken and seeds produced from some of these long lost apple trees and in the smaller farmer's markets and off the busy highways and byways we can sometimes find these tasty morsels.\nIn cooking, the apple is one of our more flexible foods. We have a tendency to use apples more for desserts, but they are wonderful in savoury dishes like pork, chicken, goose and duck. Great also in salads with berries and nuts or even served hot with red cabbage. Pies and fritters, flans and tarts, dried and fried, cider & juice, moussed or strudelled, served or preserved its a wonderfully adaptable fruit.\nAPPLE TIDBITS A worm in an apple may not look appetizing but it is a good sign that pesticides were not used. The first apple orchard in North America was planted on Beacon Hill, overlooking Boston harbour. \"Don't upset the apple cart\" is a very old phrase. Plautus was an Roman playwright and he was the one that coined this phrase way back in 255 B.C. in his play called Epiducus. Johnny Appleseed was a real character and was born John Chapman in 1774 in Massachusetts. He became a missionary and followed the pioneers westward along the Ohio river. He was so impressed with apples and the speed with which they grew, that he sprinkled seeds and passed along seedlings through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Researchers at Yale University have found that inhaling the apple scent has a calming effect. So the next time you feel stressed at the grocery store, sniff a batch of apples!\nWhy two apples a day? We know apples are a great snack, and all fruit has to be good for you but the old saying \"an apple a day\" just doesn't cut it in the modern world. We know now that \"two\" apples a day would be more fitting. Apples are a good source of fibre and they do have vitamins A and C so eat two instead of one to \"keep the doctor away\"!\nBACK TO TOP\nGARLIC\nVampires beware! Begone cholera, chicken pox, dandruff, typhoid & gangrene. Newly married, tuck a clove in your buttonhole, you'll have a successful wedding night! These are but a few of the tales that have been woven about garlic over the ages. Garlic is so ancient, it has contributed to the help or cure to many of life's trials and ailments.\nGarlic is one of the first foods to be cultivated. The earliest reference to garlic was approximately 5000 years ago, written in Sanskrit. The ancient Egyptians thought so much of garlic that they would trade a healthy male slave for 15 pounds of garlic. They would feed the garlic to the rest of the slaves building the pyramids believing it provided them with additional strength. It wasn't until the time of the Crusades that garlic came to Europe and was quickly received not only as a food, but as a medicine as well.\nGarlic is a member of the lily family and a cousin to the onion family. Purchased as a bulb in a papery membrane, it is virtually odour free. Open the bulb up and you'll find many cloves or bulblets, scratch these and the power of garlic is unleashed. The more you slice, dice or crush a clove, the more flavour (or odour) is released. What is actually being released is an amino acid called alliin. When crushed, two reactions take place, one which causes that wonderful \"breath\" and the other which is the cause of garlic's curative claims. Medical science has indeed found that garlic is good for you. It promotes cardiovascular activity and a regular diet of garlic will lower blood cholesterol.\nFrom the ancient world to California. The garlic we know and love is now grown on huge acreages in the United States, Mexico, France, Italy & Spain. This white skinned garlic is known as \"American\" garlic whereas the Mexican and Italian garlic has a mauve coloured skin and is known for its milder flavour. Because garlic is a cousin to the onion, some garlics are not really garlics at all. \"Elephant\" garlic for instance, is actually a relative of the leek and has a very mild flavour. So kick back, peel a few cloves, and look forward to a long, healthy (possibly lonely) life!\nGARLIC TIDBITS Hippocrates, in describing garlics medicinal properties, stated that garlic was \"hot, laxative and diuretic\". The Latin word for garlic, allium, is derived from a Celtic word meaning hot. Native Americans who lived on the shores of Lake Michigan called their garlic, Chicagaoua which is how the city of Chicago is said to have received its name. Garlic festivals can be found all over the world and even all garlic restaurants where you'll even find garlic in the desserts! In 1330, King Alfonso XI of Castile founded an order of knights who were bound together by the fact they all hated garlic. The last word goes to the 16th century poet Thomas Nashe, \"Garlick maketh a man wynke, drynke & stynke.\"\nBACK TO TOP\nCOD, SCROD & MORE\n\"Before you take out the re-cycling, I want to keep that article on Cod Tongues\" shouted Kerry, as I bundled up newspapers, cans & bottles. Sure, says I, with visions of me dining this week on whatever it is the fishing industry labels a \"Cod Tongue\". Manufacturers and food processors are notorious for giving foods their own monikers. \"Ugly\" fish becomes \"Yummy\" fish and everyone buys it. Needless to say I was feeling a little trepidation at what may appear on my plate, so I checked it out.\nWith visions of all those poor cods, tongueless, unable to chat to their buddies I was reminded of a time when rabbits feet were popular. My friends and I at the time imagined rabbit farms populated by two and three legged rabbits! Anyways, this is one time that the name actually fits. Cods do have tongues and they are cooked up and served! As us Westerners have Prairie or Mountain Oysters (calf or sheep testicles), Newfoundlanders have their Cod Tongues.\nWhen you find a cod fishery on the East coast, you will also find local kids who cut out the tongues right on the dock and sell them for pocket change. Most cod tongues now are purchased from cod farms, imported from Norway, but the tradition of noshing on a fish tongue still continues. For those brave enough to order cod tongues, here is the simple Newfoundlander way to cook them. Using 7-8 tongues per person, wash them, toss them in a bag in a mixture of pepper, salt and flour and fry them up in some pork fat. When they're golden brown, serve them up. They're described as a \"little gelatinous snack\" so you may want to dip them in something tasty.\nWhat is to become of the poor tongueless cods! No worry there, the cod is one the world's most popular fish, accounting for almost 10% of the world's total catch. It made its North American commercial debut in Gloucester Massachusetts in 1623 and was an immediate success. People loved its mild, delicate flavour and its lean, white, firm meat. The cod became so popular that its image could be found on stamps & coins and there is even a \"cape\" named for its distinctive silhouette.\nWhile the Newfoundlanders were plucking out tongues, the Vikings were plucking out livers. It had long been thought that cod liver oil was good for \"what ails you\" but it wasn't until 1782 that a London physician actually reported the therapeutic value of the oil. He reported that the oil did help to relieve the symptoms of rheumatism. In Philadelphia in 1885, a physician published a list of ailments whose symptoms could be allieved by taking cod liver oil orally or even by rubbing it on your skin. So the oil could; aid digestion, stimulate appetite, prevent colds, increase the red blood cell count & even help reconstruct damaged tissue. Rubbing the oil on could also repel your friends! This published account of the oils amazing properties led to millions of children being subjected to the oils \"repugnant\" taste. For the one major drawback of the oil was its taste. Terrible! Doctors would recommend a \"whiskey wash\" before and after taking the oil and one textbook of the day even recommended chewing a smoked herring before and after to try and trick the tongue. Now thank goodness, we can sample the therapeutic value of cod liver oil in a gel cap.\nCOD TIDBITS A scrod is a small cod, generally weighing less than three pounds. A cod can grow to 100 pounds and is fished in both the Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. The Norwegians, who farm cod, attract young cod to feed by playing recordings of Tuba music underwater!\nBACK TO TOP\nCHRISTMAS TREATS\nEvery Christmas it seems I get busier. As a caterer, I am on demand to my clients to feed them all manner of sweets & savouries over the Christmas \"entertaining\" season. I could say that the following article is a favourite from Christmas past (as it is) and I could say that it is being re-printed by popular demand (which would be a stretch of the truth) but I do hope you will enjoy this again, so.....\nEvery Christmas, just about now, my mouth starts watering for those seasonal Christmas treats. I'd like to tell you about my personal favourites. The Mandarin orange that appears every December and promptly disappears until next year. The smell of freshly baked gingerbread and the fun of trying to put together a house that doesn't topple. My Christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without plum pudding, a hard sauce and a measure of brandy.\nAfter eating Mandarin oranges for years, last year I finally got curious about the Mandarin and its history. To talk Mandarin I had to check out \"oranges\". Did you know there are more than 80 varieties of oranges grown and of these they are categorized into three basic botanical classifications. The Mandarin of the far east is one of these main classifications of oranges.\nSo along with turkey, the candy cane and my other favourites, the Japanese Mandarin is almost a major food group for me. One of the earliest references to the sweet orange (which would include the Valencia and Navel) is from China back in 2200 BC! The Mandarin has its origins in both Japan and China.\nThe tangerine orange is from the Mandarin family. The tangerine received its name from the fact if was developed in Tangier, North Africa. The Mandarin orange we see a lot of now is the Satsuma which are virtually seedless whereas the tangerine has quite a number of seeds. Both have those trade mark skins that slip off so easily and are the most distinguishing trait of the Mandarin. So next time you get a Mandarin with pips, it is most likely a tangerine, no pips and you're eating a Satsuma.\nI have that \"Figgy Pudding\" song ringing in my head right now. I had someone ask once if figgy pudding actually has figs and in the same breath they asked where the plums were in the plum pudding. Well Virginia, our classic plum pudding did indeed at one time have plums but not any more. The modern version of this Christmas classic is made with suet, dried currants, raisins, almonds and spices. My wife Kerry loves all the ingredients in the pudding but one, the suet. Suet is actually fat, found in beef, sheep and other animals so this one pudding not popular with vegetarians.\nThe pudding is normally boiled or steamed, most often served warm. My personal preference is to flame the pudding with brandy (lots) accompanied by a hard sauce. A hard sauce can vary in flavourings, but the basic ingredients are the same; a mixture of sugar and butter that is flavoured and chilled. Refrigerating this sauce until \"hard\" is where it receives its name. You can have some fun with your hard sauce and place it in a decorative mold before refrigerating. And what are the more popular flavourings? Brandy, rum and whiskey of course which is why this sauce with the pudding is so popular!\nI like a ginger cake in the summer, with a smooth sweet icing but at Christmas it has to be a gingerbread. Back in the middle ages, gingerbread was considered a \"sweet\" and fair ladies presented this hard, honey spiced bread as a gift to dashing knights going into tournament battle. I wonder if they ate those hard cookies or used them as jousting weapons!\nGingerbread in those days was intricately shaped and decorated, sometimes even with a gold leaf. To this day, we still use our gingerbread to create fun and fanciful shapes such as gingerbread men, ginger Santas or even our household's gingerbread dinosaurs. If you really want to get creative with gingerbread, you can build a cottage or even a house.\nGingerbread has some old Christmas roots. In Czechoslovakia, before the advent of glass baubles and ornaments, gingerbread was baked and cut into a variety of shapes for decorations at Christmas. In Belgium, St. Nicholas makes two visits to the children. One is to check on their behaviour (have they been naughty or nice) and the second visit is to fill their shoes and baskets with candies & toys. Their gingerbread tradition is to bake images of St. Nicholas as well as other images of the festive season.\nIn the Sorrenti household, we bake gingerbread everything. Santas, farm animals, dinosaurs and of course our gingerbread house. Our yearly tradition has the children from the neighbourhood after Christmas demolishing the house and all its splendid candy decorations. Eating as much as they dare and taking the rest home. And my gingerbread house inspiration? Remember when Hansel & Gretel were lost in the forest....... \"They were beginning to think they might die of hunger in the forest, when they came upon a snow white dove, singing on the branch of the tree. The bird spread its wings and flew on a little way ahead of them. \"It wants us to follow.\" cried Hansel. They followed the dove until it arrived at a cottage and perched on the roof. It was the most extraordinary cottage they have ever seen! It was made of candy, cake, marzipan and barley sugar, and the windows were of clear spun sugar! The children ran up to the house and the poor things were so hungry they broke off pieces and ate them.\"\nThe children who so much enjoyed the gingerbread houses are now teenagers (need I say more) and the tradition is now a fond memory. Happy holidays to all!\nBACK TO TOP\nHALLOWEEN\nHalloween is coming and in one name or another has been celebrated for over 2000 years. The Celts celebrated \"Samhain\" (Sa-wan) who was the god of death. The last day of October heralded the end of harvest, the days were shorter and colder and this particular god allowed the souls of the dead to visit the homes they used to live in.\nTo protect themselves from the ghosts and goblins on this night, everyone would gather together in a large field and light a bonfire. The fire would scare away the demons and the evil spirits and everyone would roast marshmallows. This Celtic holiday was the early ancestor of our Halloween. The Romans conquered the Celts and somewhere around 800 AD the Christians declared a holiday on November 1st called All Saints Day. The mass that was said on this holiday was known as Allhallowmas and the evening before, October 31st became known as All Hallow Even. Many centuries later, our Irish cousins arrived in America (around 1840) and brought the custom of Halloween with them.\nMany foods are popular around halloween, especially the pumpkin and if you're under the age of 12, candy of course is the \"food\" of choice. The pumpkin became popular for its colour was symbolic of the harvest, as black was symbolic of the spirits. If you serve black and orange, you can be assured of success at Halloween. Better yet, create a ghoulish party menu for your guests, young or old. Start with hors d'oeuvres. Skin transplants are fun (anything in a rice wrapper) and follow with barbecued Road Kill (a hamburger will do) placed on a Shrunken Head (a suitable roll) and serve with hot Transylvanian Mud (chocolate fondue) for dessert. Whatever menu you plan, accent with orange and black and add your own favourite ghoulish names.\nWhen you make your jack-o'-lantern, be sure to save the seeds. They're call pepitas and they make a great snack. First you have to remove all the fibres and gook from the seeds, soak them in cold water and spread them on a baking sheet to air dry overnight. Put them in a bowl and toss them with a tbsp of olive oil and respread them on the cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes. Keep an eye on them and turn occasionally for a golden brown seed. When they're done, sprinkle them with salt, parmesan cheese or your own favourite seasoning mix.\nPUMPKIN TIDBIT The world's largest pumpkin weighed in at 1061 pounds. Now that is a lot of pie!\nBACK TO TOP\nBUTTER\nIf I were to say focaccia, baguette, croissant, white, whole wheat, cracked wheat, seven grain, rye, I'm sure you could picture all of these, fresh from the oven, topped with a little butter! My friends at the CBC presented me with a listener's question; \"why or when did we start with the practice of spreading butter on bread?\"\nIt is hard to imagine a time when butter did not grace a fresh slice of bread but for all foods there is a beginning. The fun part about being interested in food is that you can be a veritable cornucopia of trivia. When asked recently about the origins of barbecue I remember the Arawaks, for barbecue is their word and they are the original inhabitants of the Caribbean Islands, pre-dating the Carib Indians. With the same image comes Henry Ford, who didn't invent charcoal, but he took charcoal and created the briquette which popularized the backyard barbecue for millions of North Americans.\nI knew that butter has been around for centuries, not necessarily packaged in cute little one pound packages. Butter has been a part of our world since prehistoric times. The origin of butter is believed to have come from early herdsmen, carrying milk in a bag made from an animal's stomach. As the herdsmen sloshed the milk around in the bag, the milk divided into fat (the butter), milk solids and whey (the buttermilk). Cute story and it is most likely true for butter can be made from the milk of not just cows, but sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, camels, yaks and even water buffaloes.\nBy the Middle Ages, butter was very plentiful and was viewed as \"poor\" food. Only peasants ate butter. Also plentiful was bread, a staple, and it is surmised that at some point the bread was used as a spatula to scoop the butter out of the churn. One taste and they were hooked.\nIt wasn't until the 19th century that the aristocracy accepted butter. French classic cuisine could not live without butter and this was butter's entree into society. Aristocrats couldn't get enough of butter. In fact the upper classes consumed almost three times as much butter as everyone else. They spread butter on everything.....\nSo you decide which story you like better. Personally, I like the peasants, scooping out the butter with their bread.\nBUTTER TIDBITS There is a law that says that butter must contain at least 80% fat. The fat in real butter is saturated fat and does contain cholesterol. You don't save calories by eating margarine instead of butter, they are roughly equal. But those that love butter do have a tendency to eat more. And for those that have always wondered what \"Maitre d'hotel butter\" is. This is softened butter mixed with parsley, lemon juice and seasonings, generally served with meat of fish.\nBACK TO TOP\nFOOD TRENDS - WRAPS\nMention a \"wrap\" to my mother and she envisions a short furry thing that wrapped around her shoulders. Given to her by my grandfather, he thought that all women, to feel elegant, should be wrapped in fur. My grandfather's generation had their own ideals of style and today the mention of a wrap is more likely to conjure up an image of food, not fur.\nThe wrap is nothing new, just merely a word to describe how different cultures get their food from the plate to their mouth. According to the Japanese Restaurant Association, 1.2 billion of us eat with chopsticks, 1.5 billion eat with a knife fork & spoon, 350 million eat with a knife and their hands and 250 million eat with their hands alone. My kids fall somewhere in the latter two categories. So when we're not using utensils to eat we're stuffing food in or between something.\nIn North America and other western countries we use bread as a carrier to get food to our mouths. From a typical sandwich to the specialty rolls used for hamburgers and hot dogs. In Israel and the Middle East we would be more apt to use a pita bread and fill it with a \"falafel\", a ground chick pea mixture. Falafels are fun, you can add lots of veggies for a very healthy, filling \"sandwich\". In Greece, you'd find a Pita stuffed with lamb, peppers & onion with the unlikely name of \"gyro\".\nMoving to our continent, down south in Mexico, flour tortillas are used to wrap up a multitude of foods. The tortillas are great, if you get the large size and you're practiced at the \"wrap\" you can actually get the food to your mouth without dripping the ingredients in your lap. Everything it seems has been used at one time to encase food. Corn husks, lettuce leaves, grape leaves, banana leaves and even palm fronds. Not all of these are edible though. I prefer the phyllo pastries, crepes, eggrolls, ravioli, turnovers and more. Every country and culture has its own variation of a wrap.\nWhy are wraps so popular here? It seems we have an unwritten criteria for food to be acceptable in our culture, especially foreign foods and wraps seem to fit that criteria. We've been brought up in the fast food generation and view food differently than our forefathers. So what is the criteria for food for the millennium? It cannot drip or fall apart if eaten with one hand while driving. If food has to be re-heated, it has to be foolproof and still taste good. Food has to have that fine balance between bland & spicy, still feel fun to eat and have a crisp or a crunch. Food also has to have the image of being healthy, even if its not. And food for the younger generation has to have great advertising!\nBACK TO TOP\nFRANKENFOODS\nI suppose I had always been aware that some of the foods I eat have been \"tinkered\" with to some degree. The strawberry that came all the way from California and still looks delicious. The perfect corn rows along the highway and the signs proclaiming the perfect seed variety that achieved those \"perfect\" corn rows. How about those firm red tomatoes with no apparent flavour?\nWhen I first heard the expression \"GE foods\" I imagined that General Electric were in the food business. I have no fear in proclaiming my naivety in this matter. This particular \"GE\" stands for Genetic Engineering or the genetic enhancement of foods and it has been going on for quite some time now. But it has only been recently that many people and different groups are taking a verbal stand on the subject.\nThe Toblerone Chocolate people in Switzerland recalled thousands of pounds of chocolate because it was discovered that a soya lecithen ingredient in the manufacture of the chocolate was genetically enhanced. This company has taken an active stand against the inclusion of any genetically enhanced foods in their products.\nLets back up a bit and take a look at what is actually happening. Genetic variations on a random basis occur naturally in all living things. This has been the basis of our evolution and the evolution of food. Once mankind became aware of this \"natural selection\" we have been able to selectively breed plants and animals to yield more positive results. An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel was one of the earliest genetic engineers. In 1865, he was interested in Sweet Peas and experimented with cross pollinating different plants from his garden. A modest beginning for what is now a burgeoning science.\nModern day scientists are now taking this simple approach many steps forward. They are now able to take the basic building blocks of plants and animals, their genes, and manipulate and splice to achieve the same results it took centuries to achieve in the past. Splicing the gene of a hardy fast growing tomato (for discussion's sake) to a slow growing but very tasty tomato sounds like a good thing. We all benefit from an abundant supply of a tasty tomato. Now here is what has some groups up in arms.\nWe'll introduce a new term here called \"GM\" or genetic modification. Scientists and engineers are going beyond improving single species. They are actually splicing or mating if you wish, animals and plants. This \"trans-species modification\" raises many moral and ethical issues. Called \"Transgenic\" foods, they can already be found on our supermarket shelves. A variety of potatoes as well as some grains and vegetables have already reached the marketplace.\nIn Europe, as of November of 1996, they introduced labeling laws so that consumers can know they are eating \"GE\" foods. No such laws exist in the United States or Canada yet. We have to rely on our government and existing controls to ensure the safety of these products.\nThe Scientific community have stated Pros and Cons with Genetic Modification over the traditional method of \"selective breeding\".\nPROS A desired change can be achieved in a very few generations and with a wider range of genetic material, there are more options for food improvement. There is greater precision in selecting desired characteristics.\nCONS Difficult to keep the transfer of new enhanced genes in a plant for instance from spreading to it's wild species growing nearby. Traditional farming structures in other parts of the world are affected. (A North American chemical company went to India to grow super sunflowers. In an area with 2000 small farmers they contracted with only 20 to grow their superflowers, putting the others out of work.)\nThere is no doubt that GE is big business. Companies like Monsanto, Dupont and DeKalb are spending billions of dollars in research. Are businesses the only ones to benefit? \"A potato that is bred to be resistant to pests does not have to be sprayed with toxic pesticides.\" This is good for the environment say some. \"Our ecosystem is fragile, a blight can seriously damage our worlds food supply, GE can help.\" Say others.\nNot all agree that GE foods are a good thing. Many fear that genetic mutations may cause new diseases, toxins and allergies to food. They worry about diseases between species, cancer and even birth defects.\nSo next time you hear about GE and GM you won't be thinking about appliances and cars. In all the discussions about GE foods I do believe there is one thing that should be done immediately. We should follow the Europeans in demanding that GE foods be labeled as such. Apart from the environmental and social issues brought about by GE foods we still have some ethical issues. On all these issues Canadians have the right to know. Write your MP and tell him what you think.\nBACK TO TOP\nPICNICS\nLast week here in Calgary the temperature reached a little over 20 degrees for the first time in six months! So now you know that people do not live in Calgary for the weather. Before this first fine day of spring had ended, I felt like heading out on a picnic. I wasn't quite ready so I opted instead for the \"urban picnic\" and fired up my barbecue with some chicken and potatoes. A quick salad with some tasty greens to complement the meal and I felt I had celebrated the day.\nThe joy of the picnic is in the spontaneity of the moment. Spring is always the catalyst for me to start picnicking but I have also enjoyed many a fine repast in the snow while cross country skiing. So lets take \"picnic\" at its true meaning; \"a pleasure outing with an outdoor meal\". We can go anywhere, at anytime and eat anything we like. A small bit of preparation though can certainly help with the \"spontaneity\" of a picnic.\nA picnic doesn't have to be a fancy affair, but you should plan on a bit of comfort and pack properly. A wicker picnic hamper is fun but any container will do. A paper bag will even work well. Plan on taking a blanket or quilt to set down (Kerry and I have a great blanket from Mexico) and bring along some cloth napkins. Fun dishtowels work well too for they are big enough to cover your lap. Melamine plates, plastic glassware and enough serving and eating cutlery. We use a heavy duty plastic that we can wash. They come in fun colors and they're light to carry too. A small cutting board and a Swiss army knife (make sure it has a corkscrew), garbage bag for litter and some tupperware or insulated containers for your food.\nAnd where can we have a picnic? The urban dweller can choose a park, a deck, a garden or even a rooftop. On Gabriola we have many fun picnic sights. Miles of beaches and acres of forest to enjoy a spring meal. The tailgate picnic is a favourite. Pack the family or friends and head off to a quiet road or stop for the view. I like Berry Point, watching the ferries and listening to the barking of the seals.\nPicnics can be a \"composed\" affair with elaborate menus or impromptu. My fondest memories are of backpacking in Europe and eating in the local \"Piazza\" or by the roadside. My picnic consisted of a baguette, whatever fruit and vegetables I could buy cheaply from the market as it closed (sometimes for free!), a wedge of cheese and my litre of red wine. Back then the litre bottle with stopper cost more than the wine! My Swiss army knife created many a memorable sandwich.\nA \"composed\" or planned picnic can be just as memorable. There is a lot of enjoyment in the planning & preparation. Here is a fun and simple picnic menu that you can enjoy hot in your own garden/deck/yard or pack it up for a fun \"room\" temperature tailgate picnic.\nFor our menu, we're going to use the barbecue and our main dish will be a Salmon (to feed six). Take two salmon fillets (plan on 6-8 oz per person) and between these spread; a mixture of \u00bd cup unsalted butter, finely grated lemon rind (2 tbsp or one lemon), 4 tsp of diced dillweed and salt and pepper to taste (blend mixture). Create a sandwich of this mixture and place it on a large sheet of foil wrap, turn up the edges and add the juice from the lemon with 3 ounces of white wine. Wrap up the foil tight so that there are no leaks and place on the barbecue (medium heat) for approximately 30 - 40 minutes. Section one more lemon and some fresh dill and take along for garnish.\nWhen the salmon is just about done, we're going to grill some veggies. Place the salmon on the upper shelf and in a grill basket, add; 1 medium eggplant (cubed), 1 large red pepper (coarsely chopped in 1\" pieces), 1 dozen mushrooms, 2 medium carrots (coarsely chopped and blanched), 6 small onions (peeled and blanched). Layer the vegetables in the grill basket and top with fresh chopped herbs (chives, tarragon and oregano). Crush one garlic clove in 2 tbsp of olive oil and mix with 1/4 cup lemon juice and brush or drizzle onto veggies. Turn occasionally and grill for approximately 10 minutes.\nNext, for some basil bread, take a medium baguette and cut one inch slices not quite through to the bottom. Melt some butter (1/2 cup) and in a blender add a good bunch of basil. Take the mixture and chill just enough to spread on the slices. Wrap tightly in foil and add to the top shelf of the barbecue for about 20 minutes.\nTo this great feast, add a salad of some California mixed greens, a touch of balsamic vinegar, olive oil and cracked black pepper. Save some of your herbs to sprinkle as well, or pluck some nasturtium leaves and flowers for an edible garnish.\nRemember, good food and a fun location are great, but the best picnic will always be in the company you choose to share. Good friends and good food!\nPICNIC TIDBIT The word picnic comes from the French word pique-nique which means \"nothing much\".\nASPARAGUS\n\"Perennial Rite of Spring\"\nThere are many rites of Spring, culinarily speaking, and fresh asparagus is one of them. Kerry's cousin Bill's parents live in the midst of United Empire Loyalist territory in Eastern Ontario and they have an asparagus farm. Bill makes a yearly pilgrimage to assist in harvesting and his phone call last week to ask \"how many pounds would you like\" got me thinking of different asparagus recipes. But it was Bill's \"out of the blue\" question about \"where white asparagus comes from\" that prompted me to do some research. My first image was of half blind farmers hunched over in darkened caves cultivating asparagus that never saw the sun. I told Bill that I wasn't sure about where white asparagus came from, but I'd find out and get back to him.\nAsparagus is a perennial plant with an underground stem that produces edible shoots that have been considered a delicacy for over 2000 years. The Egyptians and the Romans ate asparagus but it wasn't \"discovered\" in Europe until the 17th century. Louis XIV, the Sun King, apparently had a great liking for asparagus. Its no surprise then that the French take their asparagus seriously. They cultivate all \"three\" varieties of asparagus; green, purple and white. In fact the French go further and even classify their asparagus with three grades according to the appearance of the shoot and the bud. Asparagus is a member of the lily family and if cultivated properly, can produce spears for 20 to 30 years. Those large stalks of asparagus you see in the store actually come from an older plant. Size of an asparagus spear is not an indicator of tenderness. I had always thought the thinner the spear, the more tender. Not true, with asparagus you look for color. The greener the stalk, the more flavourful and more tender. Asparagus plants do have sex as well or should I say \"have a sex\" (dioecisous) for they are either male or female. A bed of asparagus will be planted with alternating male and female plants. The male plant does develop more spears than the female plant but the stems are smaller in diameter. Once an asparagus bed is developed, you wouldn't notice much difference in the plants. In late summer, the female plant will form small red berries.\nIt takes a few years for an Asparagus plant to mature and be ready for harvesting. At three years limited harvesting can take place with a full harvest by year four. Fresh asparagus is harvested throughout May and June with hot house varieties keeping us going the rest of the year. Like most vegetables, asparagus is best eaten soon after harvesting. It will keep refrigerated wrapped tightly in a plastic bag for three to four days.\nHow about that white asparagus? I was close on guessing this one. White asparagus is grown between mounds of dirt and each year at harvest they are watched closely. As soon as there is a \"hint\" of the soil cracking from the stem beneath, the harvesters before dawn rush in. If the tip of these stalks see the sun, they will turn a light purple and will lose a grade. For all this care and attention, you would think that white asparagus would have a wonderful flavour. No way. White asparagus is prized for its color, not taste. Our green asparagus has all the flavour. Even the purple asparagus which is harvested after growing only an inch or two has more flavour.\nHOW TO BUY ASPARAGUS Asparagus, like sweet corn, contains sugar that begins turning into starch once it is picked. The fresher the better. Look for stalks that are a good size, firm and green with tightly closed tips. If the buds on the tips are starting to separate it is a sign that the asparagus was picked when it was too mature (it may be tough). Your stalk should be more than 2/3 green. If the stalk has too much white, it may have been picked too early. Soft and wrinkled stalks are older and will have lost some flavour.\nHOW TO COOK ASPARAGUS There are some very fancy \"rigs\" for sale that will steam your asparagus. You may have seen some people tying fancy ribbons around their stalks, standing them up in a pot and steaming them. Well there are those that like to have all their stalks pointing in the same direction. The fancy rigs and the tying don't aid in the cooking, but are more for the presentation. Your asparagus can do just as well cooked loose in a skillet, a bit of water and simmered for about ten minutes.\nHOW TO EAT ASPARAGUS Before you cook the asparagus, you should trim it. You will be sold a full stalk that will most likely have a \"woody\" end. The best way to trim the asparagus is to hold each end firmly (but gently) with both hands and slowly bend the asparagus outward. The stalk should break at the proper point leaving you with a tender stalk for cooking. The Sorrenti family table etiquette for eating fresh asparagus is quite simple. Add butter to the hot stalk, watch it roll off, grasp stalk in your fingers and eat!\nThe French on the other hand enjoy dipping their asparagus in sauces. I do quite enjoy a hollandaise or bernaise sauce for their buttery richness. Fun on its own it is also a great addition to a salad (lightly blanch it) or to a pasta. Blanch the asparagus, cut the spears into 3/4 to one inch pieces and toss into a fresh pesto sauce and serve with linguine noodles. How about an Asparagus Carpaccio? Take a pound of fresh asparagus and take the top two inches of all the tips and cut them off. Slice these in half lengthwise. Take the rest of the stalks and on an extreme diagonal, cut them wafer thin. Arrange on a platter with some fresh radicchio and drizzle olive oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and top with fresh Parmesan cheese curls. This makes a great starter for from four to six people.\nAsparagus on its own is low in fat. If you don't want to add the butter or dip it in the bernaise sauce, add a squeeze of lemon and enjoy Spring!\nBACK TO TOP\nLETTUCE\nThe salad days of summer are almost over and my editor thought corn would be a good close to the summer. But I\u0092ve gained some summer pounds and I can\u0092t think of corn right now, and anyway, I just wrote about Indian corn and Sweet corn a few years back. Salad, says Kerry, good greens to get that waist back in shape is what you need. And for me, I keep humming that corny line, lettuce entertain you over and over. So lettuce it is.\nC.D. Warner (a 19th century garden lover) said Lettuce is like conversation: It must be fresh and crisp, and so sparkling that you scarcely notice the bitter in it. This would describe my favourite mix of lettuce, mesclun, or sometimes called a gourmet salad mix . This is a mix of different lettuce and herbs sold commercially. It is especially tasty because it is a mix of baby or young salad greens. You may find; arugula, dandelion, frisee, oak leaf, radicchio and sorrel. This is one salad mix that is such a fine blend of flavours that you may not even want to use a dressing on it.\nBut there are certain things that a specialty lettuce is just not suitable for. Oak leaf and radicchio do not go well on a burger. Diced dandelion and sorrel just don\u0092t cut it on a burrito and a BLT made with arugula won\u0092t cut the mustard. Of the dozens or more lettuces you may find on your supermarket shelf, you still can\u0092t replace the old standby Iceberg lettuce (or Head Lettuce).\nIceberg lettuce a few years back was sometimes the only lettuce you could find. It received its name because it was shipped across the continent from California, buried beneath mounds of ice. (It used to be called Crisphead lettuce.) This lettuce is second only to the potato in popularity and appeals to everyone. Even those who hate vegetables can\u0092t fault this lettuce which is low in calories, is always crispy, is always available and has very little taste. This lack of taste is why this lettuce is so popular on a hamburger, on a taco and sandwiched between the bacon and tomato.\nThe only drawback this lettuce seems to have is its size. Bring home a head of Iceberg and it never seems to fit in the crisper. If you\u0092re single, it can be a lot of lettuce for one. But don\u0092t worry, the geneticists are hard at work. They\u0092re producing baseball sized lettuces now and who knows, in the future, they may just change the color.\nAnd for you Caesar salad lovers we have one of my favourites, Romaine lettuce. I\u0092ve always enjoyed the tender shoots in the middle of the romaine but apparently I\u0092ve been missing out on a lot of nourishment. It is the outside leaves that are the best for you. (My kids think the croutons are the best!). Its not by chance that we find Romaine in a Caesar salad for the lettuce was so named because the Romans admired its healthful properties. The emperor Augustus was apparently cured of an illness by eating Romaine and he even erected a statue to praise the lettuce.\nThe cut versus tear controversy over lettuce has raged I\u0092m sure for centuries. Here is my humble opinion. Cut iceberg, romaine and endive lettuce, tear all the rest.\nSALAD TIDBIT Question: How many men does it take to make a salad dressing? Answer: Four. It takes a miser to measure the salt, a frugal man to measure the vinegar, a generous man to measure the oil and a real crazy one to mix it all up!\nBACK TO TOP\nHOLIDAY ENTERTAINING\nA local reporter called last week to interview me on an article she was planning for the \"homestyle\" section. She said she was talking to others about being organized and pre- planning for the Christmas season. Kerry started laughing when she heard that this woman wanted to talk to \"me\" about being organized. \"Me\" of the desk piled high with papers from another decade. Of course we all know that an appearance of disorganization actually masks an individual who is very organized with a mind as sharp as a tack! (Ha! says Kerry again.)\nPre-planning for the Christmas holiday season is something every caterer must do just to survive the volume of home and office parties that take place every year. So here are a few tips from a holiday caterer to a household entertainer.\nI'll never forget the time (on Gabriola Island one holiday season) that Kerry and I were invited to an open house for hors d'oeuvres and punch. The hostess had been working for days to prepare hundreds of little canapes and \"pop in your mouth\" nibbles. As we arrived, we went through the kitchen and most of these little dainties were laid out on the counter, ready to be served. Most of these items were salad fillings. Egg, some seafood, lots of mayonnaise. There wasn't a hint of chill to the food and although I enjoyed the company immensely, I didn't touch the food. There are much better ways to make lasting impressions on your friends.\nThis hostess needn't have worked tirelessly for days to prepare if a little pre-planning had been done. Now is the time to decide what you plan on doing and who you plan on seeing over the holiday season. The easiest decision you could make would be to book a trip, but if that isn't an option, here are a few hints for a successful and stress free open house.\nPicking a time to invite your guests is the first step. The time of day dictates the type and quantity of food to be offered. I find the easiest to plan for is the \"after dinner\" time period from 7 - 10:00 pm. Inviting your guests for 7:00 tells them to eat first and any hors d'oeuvres you are serving will be appreciated instead of consumed in hunger. Also, the hors d'oeuvres for this time period are the easiest to pre-prepare.\nSatays, wraps and pastry hors d'oeuvres can all be pre-prepared and frozen until the day of the function. Tasty marinated beef and chicken satays can be frozen raw on the skewer and when pulled from the freezer only take minutes to thaw and cook. Spanokapitas (spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo pastry) are fun to make and freeze easily. Empanadas, tasty pastry filled treats can also be made in advance. Empanadas are great because you can put your favourite filling in these pastry treats. We do a tuna, black olive, caper and tomato filling and serve it with a sun-dried tomato dip. Quesadillas freeze well flat with their fillings of cheese, chicken and peppers but you can also use the same flour tortilla shell to roll up any number of ingredients. A zesty bean paste with colored bell peppers works well. When pulled from the freezer, let stand for about an hour and slice off 3/4\" wheels and present in a basket or tray.\nPresentation is important to any gathering. In our house, we tend to more baskets, favourite pieces from Island potters and even clay flower pot liners. Once your menu is planned, you can decide which dish will look best in what you have on hand. If you don't have it, you have weeks to find it. When you're not in a rush, you can generally find what you need inexpensively. Garage sales can still yield treasures. When I present my food, I generally do it on a piece of seasonal or colourful fabric. I prowl the sales aisles of some of all the fabric stores looking for bolt end bargains. Two metres is all you need to accent your food display.\nEach item may suit a particular dip or spread. For the home, its easier to shop for this and this you can do in advance as well. A tasty salsa for your quesadillas, a yoghurt for you spanokapitas, a zesty curry dip for your satays. On the day or your function, shop the deli section and pick up some tasty olives and your favourite cheeses to accent your hors d'oeuvres. On your way in the house, snip some branches and clip some leaves to decorate your food presentations with.\nYou won't have to spend more than a few hours to prepare because of your pre- planning. The last step is one I enjoy. Put your feet up, and pour yourself a congratulatory glass of wine. Bon Appetit!\nCANADIAN BACON, EH!\nWhat we (in Canada) call \"back bacon\" or even \"peameal bacon\" is what our American cousins call Canadian Bacon. So why do they call it Canadian Bacon? This is another one of those fun food questions I get and this one had me stumped for a bit, but like all food, there is a story or two.\nTo find out why they call it Canadian Bacon, we have to look at a bit of history and go way back in time. The pig was one of the first animals to be domesticated and it is guessed that this happened around 7000 BC. Fast forward to the 15th century and the first pig to land in North America was brought by Hernando de Soto who landed in Florida in 1539.\nPigs became very popular later that century with the early Atlantic coast colonists because they were growing corn and had an ample supply of feed for the pigs. In fact so many pigs were raised in the colonies, that when they took them to market, they blazed some major trails, so large in fact the these trails later became the routes of the major railroads.\nAnyway, we have two stories to tell on how Canadian bacon got its name. The actual cut of bacon is from the loin, located in the middle of the back. This cut is where we get our pork chops from. It is surmised that some astute Canadian butcher, instead of making pork chops, cut off the bones from this tender cylindrical morsel, cured & smoked it and sliced it up for breakfast. Now this story definitely credits Canadian ingenuity!\nThe other story, and most likely the one we'll credit is actually all a matter of taste. The Americans love their bacon from the belly of the pig or \"belly bacon\" if you will. The English like their bacon from a little of both, a bit of belly and a bit from the back. So we can call this English Bacon or \"Brit\" style. We in Canada have preferred the bacon from the \"back\" which we call back bacon and due to our preference, the Americans call it \"Canadian\" bacon.\nNow you aren't supposed to call it Canadian bacon unless it has been produced in Canada, if it comes from the United States the proper term is \"Canadian style\". You can fry it, bake it, barbecue it or even eat it cold but my favourite is a tender slice on top of an English muffin, topped by a poached egg and slathered with Hollandaise sauce. Now thats Eggs Benedict, and another story for later!\nPORK TIDBITS\nDuring World War II pork was used for the well known \"C\" & \"K\" rations for soldiers. Fat from the pig was one of the main ingredients in making nitroglycerine used in the manufacture of explosives which also helped the war effort.\nThe 40's & 50's brought an end to the pig being fat. Lard turned into a dirty word and we started thinking lean, so that todays pig is now almost 50% leaner.\nPEANUTS\nSo who remembers the time that at Halloween when you returned from a night of trick or treating, you had a bag full of twist candies and peanuts? Those little chocolate bars are a wonderful invention, but still fairly recent. Home made fudge, candy, store bought twists and even the occasional \"Candy Apple\" are a thing of the past.\nDo peanuts really grow on trees? Why do we \"work for peanuts\" and what exactly is a \"peanut gallery\"? Peanuts don't grow on trees. In fact they aren't nuts at all but are actually legumes, members of the pea family. The peanut forms when the plant flowers, pollinates itself and when the petals drop off, the fertilized ovary drops down on a stem into the earth where the peanut grows. It is also known as a \"groundnut\"\nThe Incas used to stuff peanuts in jars and leave them at their burial sites so that the spirits of the dead could have nourishment. The Spaniards noticed these peanuts first but the earliest cultivation is credited with African slaves from the Southern colonies who planted peanuts as food for themselves. They called peanuts Nguba, the origin of the word \"goober\", which is what the peanut was called in the southern states.\nBy the turn of the century, a fellow named George Washington Carver invented equipment to pick the peanuts, without using \"stoop\" labour. He also urged his fellow farmers to plant peanuts in rotation with their cotton. He went further and developed over 300 uses for the peanut as human food but also as fodder for pigs. Apparently pigs fed peanuts yield superior hams and it also explains why my kids can spread peanut butter on a ham sandwich!\nWith farmers planting lots of peanuts, and Carver forging a market, two enterprising Italian immigrants recognized an opportunity and founded the Planters Nut & Chocolate Company. Planters started in a two storey loft in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania that they rented for $25.00 per month. In 1916 the Planters boys offered a prize for the best company trademark. A schoolboy won the competition with his drawing of an animated peanut. Mr. Peanut was born and has been with us ever since.\nPeanut butter is very much a North American experience. Although the early Incans are thought to have made a paste out of peanuts, it was a doctor from St. Louis who in 1890 thought peanut butter would be a good health food for elderly people. Peanut butter took a little while to catch on and in 1933 Skippy creamy peanut butter was first sold and now 100's of millions of jars of peanut butter are sold annually. Half of all peanuts cultivated in the states go towards the making of peanut butter. A typical 12 ounce jar of peanut butter contains over 548 peanuts in the shell\nPEANUT TIDBITS\nWorking for peanuts meant basically that you working for nothing, because years ago, peanuts were worth nothing as a crop.\nThe Peanut Gallery was an expression that came from the time that poorer folks inhabited the furthest and cheapest seats from the entertainment of the time and they brought their own peanuts as snacks for their kids.\nAlmost 1/4 of the peanuts grown in the states end up in candy.\nTwo tablespoons of peanut butter will supply about 15% of an adults protein needs for the day as well as sticking anything else you eat with it to the roof of your mouth!\nMEDIEVAL CUISINE\n(the start of the last Millenium)\nThe last 1000 years started with what you could call \"Medieval Cuisine\". This sounds ominous but actually refers to the cuisine of Western Europe from the 13th to 15th centuries. For 100's of years, European food was only what you could grow on the patch of land you held. After the First Crusade in 1099, towns were built, some were fortified and came with their own castle but all came with a \"market square\" where goods and produce could be traded.\nThe Arabs were very influential in the creation of this medieval cuisine. They were the traders who brought spices to the Mediterranean and introduced unknown ingredients such as sugar to the diet. The noblemen who built the towns and castles also employed scribes who produced the manuscripts that have allowed us a glimpse of medieval life. All too often though, we are faced with lists of ingredients for purchases of food versus actual recipes for the dishes. Cooking was not something the nobility did, but in later years, instructional writings for recipes were written. The servants had to know how to produce the dishes the household enjoyed.\nIn medieval times your status in the world determined what one ate. A common labourer would receive a ration of bread with a meat accompaniment. He would receive salted beef or pork while his employer would enjoy lamb, veal or fresh poultry. Spices were also an indicator of social standing. Spices in dishes were used to enhance the dish and the more and varied spices that were used, the more elegant the dish. Spices, other than a little pepper, were not used by the lower classes, for their staple meats were all salted.\nMost kitchens consisted of a large cauldron in which the soup or gruel was prepared. Gruel was sustenance for the poor and mainly consisted of cabbage, beets, onions, garlic, spinach and turnips. For the very poor, a piece of salt pork or beef in the gruel was a luxury.\nThere were some early recipes for meat pies. Most described a whole chicken or whole joints of meat wrapped in thick pastry with instructions that the pie may be kept for up to two weeks. The early pie crusts were methods of preservation and would most likely be inedible. Tender crusts came along a little later with the use of flour, eggs and butter and instead of whole chunks of meat, chopped and sliced meats were used.\nFor many, a mince meat pie is tradtitional for Christmas. Mince meat has its origins in medieval cuisine, when an an ox or beef heart was chopped up, boiled and added to ale, dried fruits and spices. Quite often the pie filling was made and kept for weeks before finding its way into a pie. These days, our tastes prefer the dried fruits and seasonings but not the meat. The basic recipe for mince meat has remained virtually unchanged since medieval times.\nMEDIEVAL TIDBITS\nThe commoners may not have had the benefit of spices for their food but a standard accompaniment to their salted beef or pork was mustard.\nGruel has always sounded bad but it is nothing more than a very tasty vegetable soup!\nModern \"medieval\" feasts always have the particpants using their fingers to eat which isn't entirely true. The dagger was very useful and acted as \"all purpose cutlery\". It was used to spear food, cut meat, as well as to discourage would be thieves!\nSPAGHETTI\nAre you a twirler? Those serious about their spaghetti know what I am talking about, all others will have a picture of a drum majorette and her baton! If there was actually a definitive compendium of \"pasta\" terms a twirler would be described as follows;\nTwirler - One who, with great grace and talent is capable of placing the tines of their fork in a plateful of spaghetti and spinning (generally in a clockwise direction) the fork to gather the perfect mouthful of spaghetti, uncut. Twirling may occur on the plate or the more adept use a pasta spoon.\nI am sorry to say that only one of my sons is a twirler. Actually he is what is known as a half twirler. He is a southpaw and has a tendency to only get half twirled before losing the strands so he races it to his mouth for a half bite, half slurp. My other son I am sorry to say has not a twirl in his repertoire. In his youth he dug in with the fork and slurped the strands but now as a young adult he is actually cutting the spaghetti. He is my first born, so I will not disown him for this breach of spaghetti etiquette but I do turn away and visibly wince.\nAll families have their noble traditions and the Sorrenti family for generations have been twirlers. I even have my own pasta fork and spoon. A nice touch which turns a simple pasta meal into more of an event! Alas, I am afraid the art of twirling may die off with my generation.\nThe noble tradition of twirling hasn\u0092t a long history because spaghetti itself is relatively young. Pasta has been around for centuries and in the middle ages it was easier to make macaroni or a rolled pasta than a thin pasta. If they did make thin strips of pasta it was called vermicelli or \"little worms\". Spaghetti, which in Italian translates into \"thin cords\" didn\u0092t reach the mainstream in Italy until about the mid 1850's. Even then, it was still easier to roll pasta than it was to make vermicelli or spaghetti. It wasn\u0092t until the late 19th century, and the invention of extrusion\nmachines that the making and eating of spaghetti became popular. It is now the most popular shape of pasta, accounting for almost 2/3 of the world\u0092s consumption of pasta.\nWith spaghetti being a relatively young food, all those classic dishes we associate with spaghetti are very young as well. The first application of a tomato sauce on spaghetti didn\u0092t show up until 1839 in an early cookbook. Spaghetti alla carbonara was thought to be a noble dish with a long history. This dish with pancetta, a raw beaten egg and cheese is actually thought to have come from the American occupation in the second world war where soldiers introduced bacon and eggs with the local pasta cuisine. Still great taste, but not a recipe handed down from generations of Italians! Spaghetti in meat sauce was immortalized in a can! After the second world war, tinned spaghetti was very popular because it was easier to eat. Eating spaghetti in public was an embarrassment for most because they knew not how to twirl!\nSPAGHETTI & PASTA TIDBITS\nSpaghetti was first introduced by Eliza Acton (of England) in her 1849 book of \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\".\nPasta first arrived in North America with the Spanish but more notable was Thomas Jefferson who was in Paris in 1784 to 1789. He ate a lot of macaroni (a generic term of the time for pasta of different shapes) and had two crates shipped home with him.\nFONDUES\nThere is nothing I enjoy more than getting up early on a Saturday, gathering up all my change, and charging out to the nearest garage sale. Thank goodness Kerry and the kids share my passion for purchasing other people\u0092s castaways. It was a garage sale not too long ago that has inspired this column. Kerry discovered, amidst the mismatched cutlery, souvenir glasses from Niagra Falls and the latest kitchen gadget from 1960, a bright orange \"fondue pot\". You know the kind, the bright orange enamel, the wooden handle, sitting on the black base with a little stainless steel candle holder and 6 stick forks. Each fork of course has its own colored end, in case, heaven forbid, you snatched someone elses food.\nYes Virginia, fondues are \"in\". Read any of the glossy food magazines. Fondues are back in. Kerry and I were theorizing what, when and how the \"fondue\" fell from grace. For the last ten years we\u0092ve been hammered with \"don\u0092t eat fats\" and \"cholesterol is bad for you\". We\u0092ve equated certain foods , fried foods and certainly cheeses as foods we shouldn\u0092t be eating too often. But like everything else, moderation never prevails initially and we seemed to have eliminated the fondue from our lexicon if not our diet. Thank goodness sanity has now prevailed and we understand foods a little better. All fats are not bad!\nSo what exactly is a fondue. The word fondue is from the French word \"fondre\" or \"melt\". In terms of a culinary definition, there are a few well known options. The most famous is the Swiss specialty. The Swiss fondue consists of one or more cheeses melted in a pottery fondue dish with white wine. The dish is kept hot over a spirit lamp, or candle and you would spear pieces of bread and dip them in a cheese.\nAnother culinary classic is the Fondue bourguignonne where a metal fondue dish is filled with hot oil. Cubes of beef are dipped in the hot oil until cooked and then dipped in a variety of flavored sauces. Horseradish, barbecue, aioli, tomato and any combination of flavors. A relish tray of olives, pickles and chutneys may also be served with this fondue.\nSimilar to the bourguignonne fondue but dating to the 14th century Mongols is the Chinese fondue. With the Chinese fondue, strips of beef, chicken and fish are cooked in heated chicken stock accompanied by bowls of fresh vegetables (Chinese of course). The condiments are Asian: soy, ginger and sesame oil sauces.\nThe final culinary mainstay in the fondue family is the Chocolate fondue. Melted dark chocolate is kept warm so that fresh fruit, cookies and even cake can be dipped. In fact I think you could almost dip anything in this chocolate and have it taste good. These four are the true culinary fondues and have stayed the test of time.\nThank goodness the nineties taught us to be inventive with our food and not be afraid to experiment. How about a Mexican fondue? Take a jalapeno flavored cheese and toss in some Tequila. Use fresh jalapenos and bell peppers as dippers (bread too!). How about an Italian fondue? Use a spicy tomato sauce for dipping. Small meatballs, spicy sausage, tortellini and a herbed flat bread make great dippers.\nYou could also cheat by calling a cold dip a fondue as well. Make a variety of dips presented with a variety of fruits, vegetables and cooked meats for dipping. The wonderful thing about the fondue is it is great and easy to serve when you are entertaining guests. All the ingredients can be prepared ahead of time, leaving more time for your guests. When you are ready to eat, you don\u0092t have to rush. The fondue stays warm and waits for you.\nIf you feel like a treat this week-end, here is a classic Swiss fondue recipe. Season your fondue pot by rubbing a garlic clove around the inside. In a saucepan on low heat, stir in one cup of white wine, a tsp of lemon juice and slowly add two cups of grated Gruyere cheese and two cups of Emmental cheese. Stir until melted. In a separate small bowl, take two tsp of corn starch and blend with two tbsp of kirsch (or regular brandy) and stir into the mixture until smooth and thick. . Add a dash of white pepper and a pinch of nutmeg for seasoning and transfer to your fondue pot. Cube some fresh French bread presented in a basket. Slice up some bell peppers, celery, carrot, cauliflower and broccoli and even add some slices of apple on a tray, add your skewers and start dipping!\nI know you are wondering. What did Kerry and I pay for this garage sale fondue pot? For the seller who may be reading this, not enough. For us, we\u0092ll just say we are now the proud owners of a $3.50 bright orange evening\u0092s entertainment!\nFONDUE TIDBITS\nCheese fondues are great for getting children to try different foods or even to eat healthy vegetables. Everything tastes great slathered in cheese!\nFUNERALS & FRUITCAKES\nWhen I told Kerry I was thinking of writing about \"funeral food\" she thought me quite crazy and a touch macabre. I wasn\u0092t having a black day, a blue day or even suffering from having watched too many X-Files episodes. I quite innocently thought about writing about the venerable fruitcake and in one of my reference books \"funeral food\" followed \"fruitcake\". Combine this with the fact that as a caterer I have just finished feeding two quite large funerals in the past two weeks and I thought it a fitting subject.\nAnyways, I got to thinking that very few people actually get around to planning their own funeral repast. Think about it. You plan your financial affairs and even who gets Gramma\u0092s tea set. Everything is planned and written down except the menu for that one big event! You\u0092ll accept down home homilies from friends, neighbours, relatives and co-workers at the big event, but do you really want to accept their down home cooking? Throughout life you\u0092ve been subjected to your Aunt Mable\u0092s chicken casserole with that strange spice she always used but you\u0092ve never been able to identify. Do you really want to subject all your friends to this tongue numbing experience? No way. Start planning your own funeral food now!\nIf you want to have some fun, you could go with a \"black\" theme. You could start with some black bread canapes spread with a tasty black bean salsa. A squid ink pasta with a light tomato sauce and black olives. Finish with a black berry pie, black coffee and have everyone toast you with a black sambucca liqueur. Whatever you may plan, just don\u0092t leave the food to chance!\nBecause you never know, you may end up with a few dozen fruitcakes on the dessert table. A study was done on fruitcakes and 1000 adults were polled on what they did with fruitcake. Well, 38% said they gave it away (funeral food!), 28% actually ate their fruitcake, 13% used it as a door stop, 9% fed the birds, 4% threw it out and 8% just couldn\u0092t remember. I liked the doorstop reference the best. A good fruitcake is said to have the same density as mahogany.\nOf course a great fruitcake has very little cake in it at all. There should only be enough cake there to hold all the great ingredients in place. My favourite is the dark fruit cake made with molasses or brown sugar and steeped in bourbon. Candied fruit, fruit rind, dates, raisins, nuts and spices all contribute to this traditional winter holiday cake to make it one of my favourites. I am one of the 28% that actually eat fruitcake all year long. Baked slowly and covered in cheesecloth soaked in liquor and foil wrapped it can last all year in a fridge. Just give it a shot of bourbon every few months to let in know you care and while you\u0092ve got it unwrapped, take a slice for yourself.\nNow is the perfect time to start baking for friends and family. Armed with the above statistics, you know what your friends and family are apt to do with your fruitcake!\nFUNERAL FOOD TIDBITS\n\"My grandfather had a wonderful funeral...it was held in a big hall with a accordion players.

I am writing today to ask you to do this, even when it costs you. Yep, I'm talking about Girl Scout cookies.\nThe meaning of Girl Scouting\nI spent several years in Girl Scouts as a child, back when Girl Scouts started out as Brownies, spent more time outdoors than in, and sang campfire songs I wouldn't dare teach my troop today. That's right -- I'm now the leader of Troop #9045, a first-year group of twelve Daisies and Brownies who meet in a first-grade classroom from 5:30 to 6:30 every other Tuesday night. Next year we'll have Daisies, Brownies, and Juniors, ages five to ten, and will cap our troop size at around twenty girls.\nThe Girl Scouts-produced curriculum, It's Your World--Change It! is a great launchpad for our troop activities, though I follow it loosely, in part because we're blending Brownies and Daisies and find ways to design activities that engage all of the girls together. As far as I can see -- and the materials seem pretty straightforward -- the goal of this curriculum is to help our young girls use their natural curiosity and empathy to find opportunities to have a positive impact in the world. I've been looking ahead to the materials you offer for Juniors and Cadets as well, and I'm excited -- they take on environmental and social issues that our children will inherit soon enough, unflinchingly but with sensitivity as well. Overall, it's the modern Girl Scouts' emphasis on service, outreach, and engagement with issues that matter to kids -- approached from a child's perspective but harnessing the wisdom of elders -- that makes me a passionate advocate for the role of Girl Scouts in a world now full of sports-oriented, special-interest, and keep-em-off-the-streets after-school programs that simply didn't exist when the Girl Scouts were founded a century ago this year. Girls believe in Girl Scouting, and through Girl Scouting they learn to believe in themselves and in their voices.\nA failure of leadership... in a leadership organization\nBut the way the Girl Scouts USA leadership - you, the board - have handled our girls' concerns about the environmental impact of Girl Scout Cookies under the tenure of board president Connie Lindsey and CEO Kathy Cloninger - is starting to make me feel like a hypocrite. And given the choice between my girls and the organization that purports to support them, I'll choose the girls every time.\nIn case the details of this case have faded from memory, in 2008 Madison Vorva and Rhiannon Tomtishen started working on a project to earn their Girl Scout Bronze Award. They researched endangered orangutans in Indonesia and discovered that palm oil production is destroying the world's last remnants of orangutan habitat. To be more specific, palm oil producers pay laborers to burn the forests and slaughter every orangutan found along the way, paying a bounty on each one. Any infants that survive this purging are sold as pets, the land is converted to palm oil production, and the orangutan populations continue their nosedive toward extinction .\nNoting that palm oil is an ingredient in Girl Scout cookies, Madison and Rhiannon did what any good Girl Scout would do -- they sought the nearest and most effective target for their change-making activities. They started an education campaign, circulated petitions and even met Jane Goodall and got her to sign their petition. Unfortunately, the Girl Scouts administration (you) told the girls that while the bakers that supply cookies to Girl Scouts are a part of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which \"researches\" and \"develops\" sustainable sources of palm oil, these bakers are unable to remove the palm oil from their cookies.\nWe'll set aside, for this discussion, what exactly the RSPO is and whether there will be any suitable forest left for orangutans to live in by the time they achieve their goals. Specifically, it's unclear how the activities of the RSPO will do anything to stop or even slow the destruction of the forests on which the orangutan depend; based on their certification criteria, it seems entirely possible that a new plantation established through the burning of forests and the slaughter of orangutans could then apply for a \"sustainable producer\" certification without a blemish to their name. Add to that the fact that Girl Scouts (you) won't even demand that cookie bakers buy palm oil from producers currently certified under this scheme, and, well, the cookies are tasting a little less sweet.\nWhat's worse -- what's unconscionable, in fact -- is that an organization whose stated mission is to make girls believe they can make a difference would fail to respond to the call to leadership of the very girls in whom it helped foster the confidence to speak up for what's right. And why? Because it was not in the organization's immediate, secure, financial, and public relations interest. Meanwhile, other groups are taking the lead you've abandoned. The UK's Girl Guides [Readers: Girl Scouts, throughout most of the world, are called Girl Guides] have now eliminated palm oil from the cookies they sell , substituted with olive and rapeseed oil, but all we hear in the U.S. is that, as the forests and their inhabitants are being wiped (are almost wiped) from this earth, the issue is complicated and the solution lies somewhere in the fog of the future.\n(We refuse to) get the message\nTo me, Girl Scouts of the USA's stance sends a frightening message to girls, and that message is the one they already receive on every corporate-sponsored kids' cartoon and in free teaching materials provided by fast food chains: That \"making a difference\" is all about thinking small, and keeping it that way, and making the easy choices while putting off the hard ones until it's too late. Picking up litter and encouraging recycling but never asking where all this waste is coming from and what can be done about it. Getting fresh air and exercise but never examining the food we eat or where it comes from. Running \"Save the Rainforests\" educational campaigns while selling cookies that contribute to their destruction. You -- we -- were supposed to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\nThis year -- our first year as a troop -- we took a \"soft sell\" approach to getting our girls on board with cookie sales. Our six-year-old daughter, who took a keen interest in the issue of orangutans being killed by the scores in the jungles of Indonesia, and the fact that they might not even exist outside of zoos by the time she is old enough to vote, chose to sell homemade cookies instead of the official Girl Scout cookies. She also split the cost with her parents to \"adopt\" an orangutan through Orangutan Outreach ( Luna, pictured at left), which cost her $40 of her own savings. She also made a homemade \"I don't eat palm oil\" T-shirt.\nThat six-year-old girl then sold 48 dozen cookies at $5 a dozen, studiously working within the rules established by Girl Scouts for off-script fundraising (your policies on that front are another story entirely), and although we haven't done the math yet, we think the net will be around $3 per dozen cookies sold. We'll split that profit down the middle, donating about $70 to Orangutan Outreach and $70 to our troop for next year's supply fund.\nThe rest of our troop sold about a thousand boxes of Girl Scout cookies. (I believe the troop nets about forty cents a box on those, or $400 in total, for an average of about $40 per participating Girl Scout.) See, as their troop leader, it didn't feel fair to bring five-year-olds into the world of tough choices that your board is forcing the rest of us -- parents, consumers, troop leaders -- to make. I couldn't see a way to help them recognize and confront this issue without deflating their interest, or their parents', in the organization I believe in so passionately.\nBut I won't do it again. Next year's curriculum is It's Your Planet -- Love It! and I'm not making excuses for you any longer. Those voices you heard over the past few months telling people not to buy Girl Scout cookies are going to be louder next year, and you're going to have fewer allies ready to argue against them. Those who took the bait this year and let themselves believe that your RSPO membership represented a meaningful change in direction will experience nagging doubts. And as for my girls -- Troop 9045 -- we are going to hold ourselves responsible for what we say and do, and we are going to practice what you preach. We're going to discuss, evaluate, and decide as a troop how to address the issue of Girl Scout cookies' role in the deforestation of Indonesia and the likely extinction of one of the most amazing species on our planet. And we're going to do it whether you're on board or not.\nSincerely,\nLeader, Girl Scout Troop #9045\nGirl Scouts of Central Texas\n"}, {"score": 544.13293, "uuid": "66ef4b97-cce4-5f36-8462-4e67a04dd4dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-54-22546", "target_hostname": "www.101cookbooks.com", "target_uri": "http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/a-twist-on-guacamole-recipe.html", "page_rank": 1.2945276e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>A</em> Twist on Guacamole Recipe - 101 Cookbooks", "snippet": "I would suggest you be as picky about <em>the</em> &quot;curry powder&quot; as you are about <em>the</em> avocados!

Restaurants are typically too cheap to do it right - adding all sorts of ingredients to stretch the green gold. Pre-made guacamole products? Well, they run the spectrum from not-very-good to outright inedible. I hate to say it, but it's a rare thing to come across the perfect guacamole specimen - or guacamole recipe for that matter.\nGreat guacamole starts with perfectly ripe avocados (I always have to remind myself to plan ahead a day or two) - you'll know they are ready by cradling each candidate in your palm and pressing confidently against the the pebbled skin with the pads of your fingertips. If the flesh feels as if you might leave a faint mark, you likely have a good one. If the flesh feels as if it might collapse beneath your grip, move to the next - over ripe. Some people prefer the button test - you'll know an avocado is under ripe if you attempt to jostle the little stem button around a bit and it won't budge. Falls right out? It might be too ripe.\nOther things to consider:\nResist the urge to over mix guacamole, it should have lots of big chunks - unruly texture bound together loosely with vibrant green avocado flesh. It is not a puree.\nTomatoes or no tomatoes? For the record, I'm against them. But more people than not use chopped tomatoes in their guacamole. They might actually work nicely in this variation I'm exploring today, but when I'm playing it straight - it's simply avocado, onions, garlic, lime and salt.\nWhite onions, not yellow. White onions deliver a clean, sharp onion flavor that is less sweet and soft than your standard yellow onion. White onions cut through the richness of the avocado nicely.\nI've been thinking about a way to put a twist on traditional guacamole, without it ending up gimmicky. I was after something familiar, yet different - a version of the chips/salsa/guac thing that happens at various social gatherings but with a fresh interpretation. It also occurred to me that if I was going to experiment, this might be the week to do it - with many of you heading to Superbowl parties and that sort of thing. So, here's what I came up with - an Indian-inspired variation of my favorite guacamole recipe. Instead of chips, I cut wedges of naan bread and baked them off in the oven for a bit until they crisped up. I subtly spiced the avocado with cumin and curry powder.\nadded 1/31/2008: There's a nice list of healthy Super Bowl recipes just posted to Mighty Foods as well.\nA Twist on Guacamole Recipe\nFeel free to add a chopped tomato if you like, a bit of cilantro might be tasty as well. Many stores now sell reheatable naan bread - Whole Foods, etc. Totally fine for this recipe. Or, even better, stop into your favorite local Indian restaurant and pick up a stack to use for dipping.\n1 small white onion\n"}, {"score": 537.31537, "uuid": "598f414a-e275-55ce-b121-8fbe09e8c45e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-22-08725", "target_hostname": "www.nourishingtreasures.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nourishingtreasures.com/index.php/2011/06/14/finally-a-nutrition-text-that-gets-it-right/", "page_rank": 1.1756057e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>A</em> Nutrition text that gets it RIGHT! | Nourishing Treasures", "snippet": "Covers <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> good vegetables &amp; fruits (organic, attention paid to soil vitality) &amp; bad vegetables &amp; fruits (processed into <em>foods</em>, raised with chemical fertilizers, pesticides, &amp; herbicides or genetically-modified) Defines <em>what</em> they are, why they\u2019re good for you, and how to avoid fake", "explanation": null}, {"score": 535.5035, "uuid": "75f86f8b-9132-5299-a649-64c54b6ca2ff", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1108wb-12-14027", "target_hostname": "www.goldmedalwineclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.goldmedalwineclub.com/blog/category/wine-and-food/", "page_rank": 1.4895422e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Wine and <em>Food</em> \u00ab Wine Club Blog \u2013 Gold Medal Wine Club", "snippet": "To finish and thicken <em>the</em> stew, stir in butter-flour (buerre-manie sauce) paste to desired consistency.

How can you tell the difference?\nFriday, August 26th, 2011\nMany wine tasters confuse the taste sensations of sweet and fruity, and those who DO get it, often find it difficult to explain the difference. So, how do you do it?\nOne way to tell the difference is practicing with a glass of tea. Taste a sip of tea on its own, and you\u2019ll find it to be bone dry, and perhaps even a bit tannic (that astringent sensation on your tongue). Now, add a squeeze of lemon to the tea and taste it again. The tea is still dry, but there is now\u00a0a fruity (citrus) component from the lemon. Next add sugar or honey to the tea, and taste it a third time \u2013 you should find it to taste both fruity AND sweet.\nIf you want to try this experiment with wine, practice by tasting a Sauvignon Blanc next to a Riesling. The Sauvignon Blanc will offer tropical, citrus, \u201cfruity\u201d flavors, while the Riesling, which typically has more residual sugar (the amount of sugar remaining in wine after fermentation), will help you differentiate what \u201csweet\u201d is.\nAnother way to determine if a wine is sweet, is by taking a look at the alcohol content. During the wine making process, the natural sugar in grape juice converts to alcohol. Higher alcohol wines typically produce a drier style because more of the sugar in the grapes is converted to alcohol. Low alcohol wines (under 12%) are usually sweeter.\nTry some of these tests and see if you can tell the difference!\nA delicious summer recipe to pair with your Peltier Station 2007 Viognier\nWednesday, August 3rd, 2011\nViognier is a relative newcomer to California wine country, but it is quickly gaining hype due to its refreshingly floral notes and its ability to compliment some intruiging food options.

The Senate is expected to take action on the bill in the coming days before sending it to President Obama for his signature.\n\u201cProjects like Highway 14 are critically important to southern Minnesota\u2019s economic recovery,\u201d said Walz. \u201cThese funds will not only create jobs as we expand the existing highway to four lanes, but it will also create economic opportunity for the majority of southern Minnesota\u2019s businesses, who use Highway 14 to ship their goods.\u201d\nThe funding in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill is in addition to dollars already targeted for these projects through the regular state budget and through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was enacted earlier this month.\n\u201cThese funds will do more than just create jobs,\u201d continued Walz. \u201cThese dollars strengthen the fabric of our communities. Because of projects like the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System, Bolder Options, the Sherriff\u2019s Youth Program, and Winona State\u2019s National Child Protection Training Center, our children will drink clean water, receive invaluable support from caring adult mentors, and be less likely to fall pray to child predators. Investments like these in the future of our country are priceless.\u201d\n\u201cFinally, these funds support the ongoing investment in renewable energy production, medical research, and education that President Obama called for last night in his address to Congress. The alignment between southern Minnesota\u2019s priorities and the President\u2019s goals could not be more apparent than in this list of projects I requested on behalf of the community leaders and citizens of southern Minnesota,\u201d concluded Walz.\nThe FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill funding at the request of Congressman Walz for the following projects:\n$200,000 for Bolder Options\nTo expand Bolder Options' youth mentorship program into the Rochester area\n$713,625 for the Center for Renewable Energy at Minnesota State University, Mankato\nThis funding would support on-going research into cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel and other renewable forms of energy.\n$290,000 for Crop Disease Research at the University of Minnesota\nResearch into crop diseases that threaten Minnesota's wheat, oat and barley industries.\n$235,000 for the Competitive Farm Benchmarking Program at the University of Minnesota Funding for a project that helps farmers compare their costs of production and maximize their efficiencies of operation.\n$323,000 for Hormel Institute in Austin Funds would help the Hormel Center develop an International Center of Research Technology to provide cutting edge technology to biomedical researchers from across the country and the world.\n$2,375,000 Hwy 14 Waseca-Owatonna\nFunds would support the four-lane expansion of Highway 14 from Waseca to I-35 at Owatonna.\n$475,000 for 55th Street in Rochester\nFunds would provide for final design, right-of-way acquisition and first stage construction of a 1.9 mile extension of 55th Street as a 4-lane expressway.\n$27,000,000 for Lewis and Clark Regional Water System Centered in twenty communities in western Minnesota, northern Iowa, and eastern South Dakota, this pipeline provides treated water from the Missouri River to more than 300,000 people in three states.\nSeveral Members of Congress from three states requested this funding. This area is so desperately short of water that there are restrictions on constructing new small business and residences; the pipeline will be essential to the economic viability of these small towns. Many of the communities involved have pre-paid the local share of the project, in order to keep inflationary costs at a minimum, and are only awaiting the federal share.\n$700,000 for the National Child Protection Training Center at Winona State University\nThe Center trains social workers, teachers, and health care professionals to recognize and report signs of child abuse.\n$500,000 for the Northern Tallgrass Prairie National Wildlife Refuge in Minnesota and Iowa\nThis project will support land acquisition to add acreage to the refuge.\n$181,000 for St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital Fresh Start Disease Prevention Program\nFunds would support the expansion of a chronic disease management program in Wabasha to help participants reduce their risk of heart disease.\n$190,000 for St. Mary\u2019s University\u2019s Teacher Mentorship Program\nFunds would help expand the university's educator professional development programs by using technology to allow greater outreach to teachers in MN with impact on thousands of students in critical STEM subjects.\n$200,000 for Sheriffs Youth Program in Rochester.\nFunding would support the expansion of SYP\u2019s services for at-risk youth.\n$712,000 for Transit Operations Center in Rochester\nWould fund the construction of a new 60-bus garage facility; as well as a new park-and-ride facility in Rochester.\n$8,604,000 for Upper Mississippi River Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program\nThis multi-state project was requested by several Members of Congress.

The concept is the same: the root vegetable is washed, sliced, and fried or baked until it is crisp. It can be salted or seasoned much like a potato chip can. Carrot chips, in fact, look much like deep orange potato chips.\nUnlike potato chips, however, carrot chips are rich in Vitamin A, an essential part of a healthy diet. Fried carrot chips, like potato chips, can contain a large amount of fat. However, there are many health-food companies that offer baked carrot chips that contain all of the great vitamins, but a nominal amount of fat.\nWith health consciousness on the rise, people are always looking for better ways to eat. Snacking, it has been found, is a big reason why people gain weight; weight gain, of course, can lead to all kinds of circulatory and skeletal problems and can result in obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, many snack foods such as potato chips are full of fat and calories, but offer little nutrition. Therefore, choosing healthy snack foods like baked carrot chips can be very important to one\u0092s health.\nInterested in making your own baked carrot chips for a healthy snack? Here\u0092s a great recipe:\n1. Spray a baking sheet with a light coat of oil.\n2. Slice your desired number of carrots into rounds that are 1/4 inch (2.54 cm) thick.\n3. Place the slices on the baking sheet without overlapping them.\n4. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n5. Place the baking sheet in an oven, preheated in 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).\n6. Bake the carrot chips for approximately five minutes, or until the edges turn brown.\n7. Turn the chips and back for another 5-10 minutes.\n8. Enjoy!\nCarrot chips may, in fact, become a very important food in some developing countries University of Nebraska Scientists Ahmad Sulaeman and Judy Driskell have been working with carrot chip recipes. They believe that carrot chips might help to combat vitamin deficiencies in children who are growing up in impoverished circumstances. These scientists are working with deep fried carrot chips. Because people in developing countries have a hard time getting enough calories as well as vitamins, the fat content in deep friend carrot chips is not a concern. In fact, the extra calories can be quite important to their diet. Unlike baked carrot chips, deep fried carrot chips can contain over 50% fat.\nCarrot Hot Dog - click here Carrot Puddings - here 2346 carrot recipes here\nViking Carrot Casserole 1 Cup of Water 2/3 Cup of pearl barley 1 to 1 1/2 Cups of milk 1 Teaspoon of Sea Salt 2 Tablespoons of honey 1/4 Teaspoon of nutmeg 2 Eggs, beaten 1 Tablespoon of butter 2 to 3 Tablespoons of bread crumbs\nBring water to a boil and add barley.

EAT!\nEat your Carrot Green Tops (the leaves)\nThere is some debate about whether you can eat the green leaves.\u00a0 Yes you can!\nDespite the presence of celery and carrots in the carrot family of Apiaceae (\"umbellifers\"), many other members of the family are highly poisonous, but not carrot.\nThey ARE edible and are highly nutritive, rich in protein, minerals and vitamins. The tops of the carrots are loaded with potassium which can make them bitter, so the use of them in food is limited, but there some ideas and recipes on a separate page.\nTop 10 reasons for eating Carrots\nHave you had your carrots today? Maybe you don't realise there are 10 very good reasons why you should be eating this wonderful vegetable every day.\n1. They taste good. Carrots have a mild, pleasant flavour that is great by themselves or blended with other foods.\n2. Carrots can be eaten cooked or raw. Crunchy or soft, from soups to salad, it's entirely up to your mood or your menu.\n3. Kids (even toddlers) like the mild taste of carrots.\n4. Raw carrots are great to carry in a sack lunch, to your next picnic, or in the car when you are on the go.\n5. Carrots are available and in season all year long.\n6. Carrots are inexpensive all year.\n7. They are a great source of Vitamin A and Beta Carotene. Vitamin A is very important for healthy skin, eyes, hair , growth, and helps our bodies resist infections. Beta Carotene is linked to reducing chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. (see nutrition page) .\n8. Carrots are a good source of fibre. Fibre is important of our gastrointestinal tracts and is linked to reducing cholesterol in our bodies.\n9. Carrots are low in calories. One average carrot contains about 30 calories.\n10. Carrots are a great source of alpha carotene, probably more powerful than beta carotene in inhibiting processes that may lead to tumour growth.\nTry to eat a carrot a day. Here's how:\nThe basic rule of this diet is to add a carrot at or near the beginning of every meal. Why should this work? This works because a bulky carrot at or near the meal's beginning leaves\nno room in the stomach at the meal's end for the extra ice-cream or cheesecake. That saves perhaps 500 calories a day, which translates to a weight loss of about a pound a week. Even plain water at the beginning of a meal will tend to create a full feeling in the stomach sooner in the meal. This will reduce the amount of food consumed at the end. But eating carrot is more fun.\nGetting your carrot-a-day is easy, considering the vegetable's versatility and blendability. And subtlety: carrots enhance but don't overwhelm. Here are ways to put power on your table.\nCook grated carrots with beans, split peas, lentils, rice, pastas. Good in stuffing. Try them roasted - split large carrots lengthways and brush with a little oil then put on a roasting tray \u00a0in a 200c oven for about 45 minutes until tender and browned. Try roast carrots, potato, sweet potato and pumpkin serve with steamed green vegetables and a nice sauce.\nToss grated carrot with potatoes for hashbrowns. (Toss in grated zucchini and minced onion, too.)\nAdd to sauces, white or red. Grated carrots give body and impart subtle flavour, and they fit any tomato or creamy soup, sauce, or casserole.\nMix finely-ground carrots into peanut butter. New kind of crunch. (If you want to make a really GOOD Peanut Butter & carrot sandwich, smoosh in a banana.)\nHot and Cold Salad: Saut\u00e8 onion, green pepper, and grated or finely sliced carrots. Remove from heat and pour your preferred salad vinegar over hot veggies. (It will hiss and steam.) While hot, add to chilled salad greens. Toss and serve.\nHerb and Vegetable Bread or Biscuits: To your regular dough, add finely grated carrots; minced onion (dried flakes or fresh green); parsley; garlic powder; sprinkle of basil and skosh of oregano or sage. We like to add some dried or pesto tomatoes and a few hearty shakes of parmesan cheese.\nFor some reason, males and small children who normally turn down veggies like those baby carrots. They come washed, peeled, prepackaged - meaning they cost more than their bulk-buy counterparts. But it's still more nutrition per penny than fast food.\nThe Wonder\u00a0of Carrot Juice\nThe cookware we use for food preparation, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the pesticide-sprayed leafy greens we eat, can lead to an exposure to heavy metals. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, October 1985, carrot juice can pull these heavy metals from fatty tissue where they reside, bind them up, and discharge them from the system.\nCarrot juice, because of its many healthy benefits, is frequently called the \"miracle juice.\" A large number of people in all walks of life suffering from various ailments have found that the inclusion of carrot juice in their diet has greatly improved their health. Countless others have found it to be a valuable \"protective\" agent in the building and maintenance of health in both children and adults, while its delicious flavour makes it popular with all members of the family as a beverage, plain or combined with other juices.\nCarrot juice is a very important source of vitamin A. Scientists in the U.S. estimate that this juice contains the largest source of vitamin A, than any other fruit juice. Carrot juice provides an important source of dietary fibre and has approximately 24 calories in each 2 oz. Serving. It contains important nutrients such as calcium, phosphorous, iron, sodium, potassium, vitamin B complex, vitamin A, and as mentioned - mostly vitamin A.\nCarrot juice is a therapeutic agent used for over 150 years as an ancient practice. It is\nreported to contain healing properties that have proven to treat varied diseases. Even complexion problems can be eliminated with the intake and digestion of needed potassium in carrot juice to help neutralize excess acid to the skin. The vitamin A in carrot juice helps the liver flush out toxins from the body - toxins that cause complexion problems.\nLearn more about your favourite beverage at Carrot Juice Com here: All about Carrot Juice\nFresh juice has the ability to distribute an additional significant variety of nutrients, recognized as enzymes, which are your body's labour power. Performing as catalysts in hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions that occur throughout your body, enzymes are crucial for digestion and amalgamation of food, for conversion of food packs into body tissue, and for the creation of energy at the cellular level. In fact, enzymes are vital for most of the metabolic actions taking position in your body every second of every day.\nFresh juices are a wonderful resource of enzymes. The freshness of juice is one of their key features, since enzymes are damaged by high temperature. Given that fruits and vegetables are juiced uncooked, the enzymes are still there when you drink the juice!\nFruit and vegetable juices are also excellent sources of the traditional nutrients. Citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges, etc.) are packed with vitamin C. Carrot juice contains vitamin A, in the form of beta-carotene. Green juices are excellent sources of vitamin E. Fruit juices are also a source of essential minerals like iron, copper, potassium, sodium, iodine, and magnesium, which are most easily assimilated throughout digestion.\nSince juicing eliminates the hard to digest fibre, nutrients are obtainable to the body in a great deal of larger quantities than if the piece of fruit or vegetable was eaten whole. For instance, since a lot of the nutrients are in the fibre, when you eat a raw carrot, you are only able to absorb about 1% of the beta-carotene. When a carrot is juiced, eliminating the fibre, virtually 100% of the beta-carotene may be assimilated.\nFruits and vegetables offer another substance that is completely fundamental for good health - water. Over 65% of most of the cells in the human body are made of water, and in some tissues, such as the brain, the cells may be made up of as much as 80% water. Water is extremely necessary for good health, yet most people don't consume enough water each day. Fruit and vegetable juices are free of unnecessary substances and are bursting with pure, clean water.\n(reference http://www.soymilkquick.com/juice.html)\nMake Carrot Juice\nAlmost any large variety, one called Neptun is an excellent long season 'Flakee' type carrot with large conical roots up to 12in/30cm long, with an intense orange colour and are particularly sweet for their type.\nIf you can find it, Juwarot is the carrot with the highest beta carotene content. Otherwise the regular shop varieties, Imperator, Nantes, Chantenay, Danvers and Nairobi.\nAvoid \"baby carrots\", also make sure you use all of the carrot. Many take off their skins, where most of the goodness lies. Make sure you drink it as soon as possible as it does not keep well. Best made and drunk fresh.\n1. Wash fresh, whole carrots. Trim off the ends.\n2. Following instructions for your model, push carrots through juicer, catching juice in cup as directed.\n3. Clean pulp from strainer as you go along, if necessary.\n4. Drink juice immediately or within a few days. Carrot juice does not keep for long and tastes best when fresh\nPreparing Carrots for Juicing. Wash carrots thoroughly in cold water, using a stiff vegetable brush. Scrape lightly, but do not peel, as valuable vitamins and minerals lies close to the surface. The juice should be taken immediately it is made, if at all possible. If not, let the juice flow directly into glass jars which should then be covered with screw-on lids. After pouring the quantity to be used immediately, keep the remaining juice tightly covered, in the refrigerator to prevent loss of vitamin and mineral content through oxidation.\nCarrot juice blends with practically all other juices. It is a delicious nourishing beverage for all members of the family at all times and it should be an important part of the diet in cases of illness. One pound of carrots will make approximately six to eight ounces of carrot juice. The large, firm, dark-yellow carrots should be selected for juicing, rather than the light-yellow ones, because of their greater carotene content.\nIt\u0092s also important to add a good squeeze of lemon juice, you won\u0092t really notice the taste of it and it will stop the apple juice from oxidising and turning the whole thing a muddy brown colour. Oxidisation won\u0092t affect the taste, but it\u0092s nicer if your fresh juice doesn\u0092t look like pond water.\nBlack Carrot has been planted in Turkey for over a century and is juiced \u00a0for fresh drinking and manufacturing a local sharp summer drink called \"Salgam\". Tameks Tarim is the Turkish producer and their site is www.tameks.com.\nTips\nIt is not necessary to peel the carrots, but if they are not organic, you may wish to.\nTry running an inch or so of ginger root through the juicer with the carrots for a zesty variation.\nYes, you can freeze carrot juice, but:\n1. It will be very thin and separated when thawed (so you can use it for cooking, for an ingredient in salad dressing, etc, but not so great for drinking)\n2. It may pick up flavours in the freezer, so be certain to wrap it very tightly.\n3. A small amount of nutritional value will be lost.\n4. There is no need to blanche the carrots first, just make juice as normal in a juicer.\n5. It should last a month, but it's never as good as fresh.\nCocky Carrot\n1 1/2 oz Stolichnaya\u00ae vodka\n1 1/2 oz triple sec (or Cointreau)\n1 oz carrot juice\n1 oz citrus energy drink (180 or Crunk or Lucozade!)\nCombine ingredients in a cocktail shaker and stir. Strain over ice into a collins glass. Garnish with an orange wheel, and serve.\nCarrot Balls\n2 cups sliced carrots, cooked and mashed\n1 1/2 cups soft breadcrumbs\n1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar\n1/2 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. pepper\nDash of hot sauce 1 egg white\n1 1/4 cups coarsely crushed cornflakes\nCombine carrots, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, pepper, and hot sauce; toss lightly.

And even though I didn\u2019t actually learn to cook until after college, once I did I quickly dabbled in everything from homemade egg rolls to pasta from scratch to my grandmother\u2019s crepes. Nothing could have prepared me though for all the \u201cnew foods\u201d that I had to learn about \u2013 and now can\u2019t live without \u2013 once we made the switch to \u201c real food .\u201d I am constantly amazed at all the items on my regular shopping list that I had never purchased before we decided to cut out processed food\u2026\nWhole-wheat flour\nOther real food newbies likely \u201cflirted\u201d with whole-wheat flour on occasion, but no no\u2026not me. I promise you that I had never before purchased or cooked with whole-wheat flour (because I hated anything made with it !) until the start of all this 2 years ago.\n-\nOats\nWe used to eat boxed granola cereal, but it never occurred to me that you could actually make it yourself (and that it would be soooo much better)! The main ingredient in homemade granola is oats and the first time I made it I found myself saying\u2026 \u201cAre plain \u2018oats\u2019 just oatmeal?\u201d I\u2019ve never been an oatmeal fan myself (and I\u2019m still not, although I\u2019ve since learned that my kids love it) therefore I never bought oats for any reason, but now I buy pounds of it every week and get worried if our supply is low!\n-\nHoney\nSomebody must have bought at least one bottle of honey before our switch to real food because I remember a tiny bear shaped container of it in our pantry that was all crusted over and crystallized from lack of use (LOL). Now I buy this stuff in big jars and use it in everything from the granola we love so much to our sandwich bread . I\u2019ll be the first to admit that \u201csugar is sugar\u201d (even if it contains trace nutrients like honey) so we still aim to use it in moderation, but it\u2019s quite a change from my white sugar days. And trust me I used to use A LOT of sugar\u2026brown, white, and powdered.\n-\nKale / Collards\nI could not have picked Kale or Collards out of a line-up to save my life. And even a year into our real food journey I still couldn\u2019t say that I had truly adopted these as part of our regular menu. But, today I finally feel like I am figuring out how to not only incorporate, but also enjoy these nutrient-rich leafy greens (and occasionally even get my kids to eat them, too)!\n-\n\u201cRaw\u201d nuts and seeds\nTo me nuts were greasy, salty and packaged in a blue \u201cPlanters\u201d container. I admit I didn\u2019t even know what it meant for them to be \u201craw\u201d so I can completely relate when readers ask me where in the world to find such a product. (Answer: The bulk bins at health food stores!)\n-\nPinto Beans\nI wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead buying \u2013 much less eating \u2013 pinto beans and now my homemade slow cooker refried bean recipe (made from dried pinto beans) is one of my most favorite lunches! This might just be the strangest transition of them all\u2026because it\u2019s so ingrained in my brain that I don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d beans.\n-\nWhole Milk\nOkay, I shouldn\u2019t say that I NEVER bought whole milk because my kids actually drank it for a short period of time when they were babies, but it is most certainly a beverage I didn\u2019t drink myself (probably since I was a baby). I was a skim milk girl all the way, and I admit that I was a little \u201cscared\u201d to make the switch, but I am so glad I did! Now I know what \u201creal\u201d milk tastes like, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. (Note to the raw milk advocates\u2026it\u2019s illegal here in N.C., although I am not sure I\u2019d drink it anyway.)\n-\nCoconut Oil and Ghee (a.k.a. Clarified Butter)\nThese are both unrefined \u201ccooking fats\u201d that I didn\u2019t even purchase until long after completing our 100-day pledge, and to be honest I had no idea what to do with either one! I am finding that ghee is nice to have around because you can use it like butter, but it has a much higher smoke point so it doesn\u2019t burn as easily. Also, there\u2019s apparently not much you CANNOT do with coconut oil\u2026just check out the reader comments in my post about it!\n-\nLara Bars\nI still call these \u201cgranola bars\u201d out of habit even though I know there\u2019s no granola in there, but that\u2019s because they replaced my very regular consumption of \u201cQuaker Chewy Granola Bars\u201d (in the old days of course). My favorite Quaker bars were the peanut butter chocolate chip, but sometimes I would go for the variety pack to switch it up. J Now I instead have a stash of Lara Bars (the cashew cookie only has 2 ingredients!!) as the \u201cjust in case\u201d snacks in my purse.\n-\nKiwi\nThis might be a little random, but the point here is that it is never too late to try and \u201clike\u201d new foods. I am not sure why, but I never ate kiwi before last year (that I can recall) and one day my 4-year-old asked if we could buy one. I certainly wanted to embrace her little adventurous food streak (and set a good example about trying new stuff) so I said \u201cyes.\u201d And I am so glad I did because now that I\u2019ve figured out that soft = ripe\u2026I absolutely love kiwis!

I see most doctors as not being integral to the public, as they make loads of money. They are the leading and highly paid\u00a0 \u201cfrontmen/women\u201d for Big Pharma\u00a0 (firms allied to the largest chemical-producing giants for foods and agriculture as well) \u2013 and thus promote a corrupted-by-commerce ideology of so-called \u201chealthcare.\u201d Of course we are not told that doctors are part of sales assembly0line Oh no!\nMyth of having best-guiding knowledge\nDoctors are supposedly wise and rational \u2013 uplifted by TV ads and the like to become authorities to be blindly trusted. In reality, doctors are indoctrinated to believe drugs are the best thing since sliced bread. They then, with the belief and economic incentives, lure us all \u2013 and incredibly against common sense and reason, to take in some of the most highly toxic substances (like mercury in vaccinations) into our bodies, through our mouths and down the hatch or through our veins! Even with cancer being caused by chemicals, we are supposed to take in more chemicals, and as part of the most corrupt forms of denial. We are deceived, by those who are self-deceived, and especially when we are repeatedly told, as a mantra, that lethally harmful effects are just insignificant \u201cside-effects.\u201d Tell that to the families of the 2-300,000 people who die every year of these \u201cside-effect\u201d \u2013 and from \u201cproperly prescribed\u201d pharmaceuticals in America alone! Many more are harmed for the rest of their lives. ASD is a case in point.\nSymptoms of ASD becoming increasingly intense\nThe symptoms of ASD can also become more intense, depending on how much of the chemical sweetener we dare to consume, and in what combinations. Chemical additives often become far more seriously toxic when combined with others. Consumers can thus go from having a mild headache to violent fits of vomiting. Central nervous system disorders following the ingesting of these sweeteners are also common, as are nervous twitches and abnormal reflexes. (See: aspartame info )\nMilitary health crises\nA wave of fibromyalgia hit the American troops during the Gulf War. Studies showed that drinking diet sodas in the 120 degree heat lead to serious health repercussions. It was called the \u201cGulf War Syndrome,\u201d but the same problem occurred to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. ( See: Story of gulf war syndrome )\nExtent of the problem\nSynthetic sweeteners are now in over 25% of all food, drink, gum and candy available. This is bound to create a vast cumulative effect and with the end result is ASD, another form of synthetic chemical overload or gross pollution of our internal ecology. See our articles on the life-centered vision of nature , and which explains why the 17th-century borne math-designing ideology (which underlies all of synthetic chemistry) does not really represent the root order of nature, why it so disrupts and systemically harms our bodies).\nNo drug cure\nThis is why there is no curing drug for this syndrome and there never can or will be one. What sufferers of ASD really need is a detoxification from a life-long pollution of synthetic chemicals (which began to be significantly added to our food supply in the late 1940\u2032s to make more $-profits) \u2013 and which goes against the wisdom of our bodies. A vast number of health ailments are caused by resulting chemical overloads when we ingest those \u201cphoods\u201d \u2013 additives approved by the FDA, what I always call the single most corrupt and harming agency on the planet (See story of illnesses caused by artificial sweeteners ).\nDrugs can make conditions far worse\nCancer is a distant end result of taking in synthetic chemicals while living in a toxic, polluted world. ASD is one of the short-run and ever growing consequences. It is never cured by taking in more chemicals, which out to be so obvious.\nSo what is the cure?\nIt really takes no Phd from Harvard to figure that out. Just throw away your artificial sweetener-full products \u2013 like sugar free gum, candy, and drinks. Read labels. Avoid aspartame, sucralose, sorbitol, acesulfame-k, aspartic acid, and saccharine. It may save your life.\nNon-toxic alternatives, in moderation\nNot to put on weight or to avoid a harmful glycemic blood sugar rush, try some more natural alternatives, like Xylitol or Stevia. They don\u2019t have the negative effects of chemical sweeteners.\u00a0 However, they have very little calories associated with a lot of sweetness, so you may end up having cravings. Thus it is better yet to have our sweets from fruits as nature more often intended. You could moderately eat more carrots and beets, or sweet tomatoes as well. If any problems remain, why not experiment with an elimination diet \u2013 eliminating one food at a time to see which you are allergic to. If that still doesn\u2019t work to find the cause, seek out a natural health practitioner for advice. Remember, if you are eating crappy junk food, drugs won\u2019t cure the resulting ill health harvest. Just stop eating the crappy-hellish junk food. _____________________________________________________________________________\nBased on an article in Natural News by S.D.

So I was hooked the moment I read this recent headline:\nNorway authorities take away Indian couple's kids, say feeding with hands wrong\nAlthough the details of this ongoing story have yet to be fully revealed, it spotlights cultural stereotypes often associated with dining etiquette. While North Americans and Northern Europeans deem that transferring edibles to the mouth with a metal-pronged stick is somehow more refined than using the utensils we were born with, members of the many cultures who have been eating with their hands for thousands of years beg to differ.\nAfricans, Arabs and Indians (to name only a few) describe in rhapsodic terms the advantages of eating with their fingers: the sensuous connection to the food, the feeling of sharing and community, practicality (in that it\u2019s easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones) avoiding waste, even a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvelous meal.\nAfter reading scores of impassioned comments that the above mentioned article garnered, I felt compelled to conduct my own interviews to get a first-hand perspective on this cultural divide, followed by a hands-on lesson (see video clip below.)\nphotos courtesy of Vijitha Shyam of Indian food blog Spices and Aroma\nVinita Chopra Jacinto grew up in Northern India and is now a chef instructor at the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco. She feels strongly that Indian food tastes best when eaten with one\u2019s fingers. She tells me that Indians eat with their hands because they believe that food is, \u201cmore than just protein, carbs and fat it nourishes the mind, intellect and spirit. Eating should be sensual and mindful, employing all the senses: sight, smell, sound, taste and touch. Using your hands gives you a tactile connection with your food.\u201d\nJacinto clarifies some regional differences, \u201cIn the North, where breads are commonly consumed, you tear a piece of bread and wrap it around your food. While, in the South, rice is combined with curries, and each mouthful offers a unique blend of flavors. Traditionally in Southern India, plates are made of disposable, recyclable, banana leaves. Using a knife and fork on a banana leaf would shred your plate.\u201d\nSignificantly, all cultures that shun silverware maintain a set of rules for eating with the hands. Before the meal, the hands must be washed, wiped or even rubbed with sand, as desert Arabs do. But the foremost rule is that only the right hand is employed for eating.\n\u201cThe left hand is never used for that,\u201d Jacinto says, \u201cIt is considered unclean.\u201d In principle, at least, this is because the left hand is saved for bodily cleaning. Another taboo Jacinto cautions against is jutha, or double dipping your bread into a communal dish of food.\n\u201cThe secret to gracefully eating with your fingers,\u201d Jacinto advises, \u201cis to use your thumb. For example, a small amount of rice is formed into a little pile on your plate, blended with one or more bits of curried lentils, vegetables, meat or fish, and then picked up with a twist of the wrist, held onto by the fingers and maneuvered right up to your mouth. But don\u2019t put your fingers into your mouth.\u201d she instructs, \u201cJust use your thumb to push the food inside.\u201d\nFharzana Elankumaran, founder of I Heart Curry , where she teaches Indian cooking classes, also grew up eating with her hands in Bangladesh. \u201cI appreciate this way of eating because you have more control over your food,\u201c she says. \u201cFor example, if you\u2019re eating fish or chicken, you don\u2019t have to worry about cutting with a knife around the bones. When you use your fingers, you can get every last bit of meat and so waste less. It\u2019s an expression of the great respect we have for the food.\u201d\nIn her Indian cooking classes, Elankumaran encourages students to eat with their hands, but finds that it may be a challenge for first-timers. \u201c Sometimes my students tell me their hands get tired, because they are using a whole new set of muscles.\u201d\nYemeni dish at Oasis Market and Restaurant\nOn a shopping trip to Oakland\u2019s Oasis Market and Restaurant , I spy manager Rassam Sharif eating his lunch by hand. It\u2019s a Yemeni specialty, fahsa (cooked boneless beef topped with whipped fenugreek, with a salsa-like sauce). Sharif kindly demonstrates his technique: he tears off a bit of tandoori bread, dips it into the meat and salsa, and brings it to his mouth with 3 fingers. Sharif prefers eating by hand because, he says, \u201cYou have more connection to your food. With a spoon, it\u2019s just like shoveling something into your mouth to get full. In Islam, we are taught that the Prophet said to eat from your own side of the dish, slowly, with the right hand, just until you are not hungry. It makes you take your time and be mindful of what you\u2019re eating.\u201d\nEnough talk, I decide, it\u2019s time for me to get some hands-on tutoring.\nLuckily, my request for cross-cultural dining instruction interests Mostafa Raiss El Fenni, owner of Berkeley\u2019s Sahara Home D\u00e9cor . He invites me to stay for lunch and we sit on intricately carved and painted chairs amid his stunning collection of Moroccan carpets, ottomans, embroidered textiles, brass lanterns, conical clay pots and delicate tea glasses.\nMostafa Raiss El Fenni -- Moroccan food\nRaiss El Fenni, a former Cal student and chemist, whose shop promotes the works of artists from his homeland, tells me, \u201cEating with your hands is about sharing,\u201d and as the youngest in a family of 12 children, he got a lot of practice doing that. There is an intimacy formed when you all eat from the same dish dipping in small pieces of bread, he explains. \u201c And if you find a piece of meat close to you that\u2019s especially good, you can share it with your neighbor.\u201d\n\u201cDoes each person take the piece of meat and bread onto their own plate?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have individual plates. We are a very collective society. But if we invite guests over who are not familiar with this way of eating, we show them how it\u2019s done.\u201d\nWatch my lesson in eating with the hands, Moroccan style:\nFilmed and Edited by Kim Aronson\nIn the college dorm, it was a bit of culture shock for Raiss El Fenni that each student ate his own sandwich. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get used to eating by myself. So, I just waited with my food until they were done, and then said, \u201cHey, want to share? Eventually they got the idea and would offer to share some of their sandwiches with me too.\u201d\nRaiss-El-Fenni also hosts Moroccan parties in colorful Berber tents set up outside his shop. Parties range from mint tea and pastries to an all-out catered feast with live music and belly dancers. And of course, he will encourage your guests to eat with their hands for the true Moroccan experience.\nTanjia Moroccan Restaurant\nAfter my tasty lesson, I invite my husband out for a Moroccan meal and tell him I\u2019ll show him how to eat with his hands, so we head over to Tanjia , an Oakland Moroccan restaurant we haven\u2019t yet tried.\nWe enter the lovely blue and red interior with low couches that let you sit close to your dining companion. But I am disappointed to see the tables set with forks and knives. When I tell the server we hoped to eat in Moroccan fashion, she gladly takes away the silverware and returns with a pot of water and washes our hands.\nThe first course is an assortment of delicately spiced salads: carrots, eggplant, cucumbers, tomato and bell pepper. Easy to scoop up with chunks of home baked bread. But with the arrival of the lamb and eggplant and chicken with honey and prunes, which are so meltingly tender you can tell they have cooked slowly for hours, my husband chickens-out of the hands-on approach and, to keep him company, I ask for two forks. It\u2019s not so easy to change a lifetimes's eating habits.\nOwner Jamal Zahid recently took over the restaurant from his brother, Said who started Tanjia in 2000. It has always been a \u201csilverware optional restaurant\u201d but seeing the reaction of a younger generation of customers not used to the traditional Moroccan way of dining sans utensils, Zahid decided-- as an act of hospitality to his guests-- to set the table with forks and knives, a reversal of his brother\u2019s default setting. Personally, Zahid favors eating with the hands as a way to feel connected to the food and savor the meal slowly.\nEthiopian platter and injera - Cafe Colucci\nAt Oakland\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Colucci Ethiopian restaurant , by contrast, forks are nowhere in sight. Injera, the spongy, slightly sour, crepe-like bread made from the teff grain, functions as tablecloth, plate and utensil and the food is served family style, atop a large injera circle. \u201cEating is almost a sacred ritual,\u201d says owner Fetlework Tefferi, whose award-winning restaurant just celebrated its 20th year. Besides the rules of hand washing and right hand only, she adds another from her native Ethiopia, \u201cOnce the tray of food is laid on the table, no one rises until all are done and the tray removed. We chew slowly, with closed mouths and a calm dignity. The food is sacred. It\u2019s not polite to rush through your meal.\u201d\nAgain, eating with the hand is more than just a mechanism to get sustenance into the mouth. \u201cOn certain occasions,\u201d explains Tefferi, \u201cwe feed each other by hand, it\u2019s called goorsha and it\u2019s a loving act, an endearment. You might feed a child who is not eating enough or a guest you are entertaining. But if I were to make a bite for a man, \u201cshe chuckles,\u201d I need to make sure it\u2019s a big, well-packed roll of injera. I guess it\u2019s a macho thing.\u201d She adds, \u201cWe usually don\u2019t eat alone. If you are in a restaurant in Ethiopia, for example, and the people at the next table get served first, they will probably ask you to join them or at least take a few bites with them. That kind of sharing is what holds us together.\u201d\nTefferi demonstrates how to tear off a small square from the rolls of injera in the basket. She describes the technique as \u201cwrap and roll.\u201d You lay your piece of injera over some food and use all your fingers to gather up the filling and twist it into a little packed pouch, which you may dip into several different dishes on the tray. Our platter today has collard greens seasoned with black cumin, cabbage with carrots, potatoes with ginger, garlic and turmeric, lentils in red berbere sauce, yellow split peas in turmeric sauce, Ethiopian cheese and kitfo, a highly seasoned raw meat dish.\n\u201cChildren are taught to make a bite of food that\u2019s just big enough to fit in their mouth all at once, without stuffing their cheeks and to eat only with their right hands.\u201d Tefferi remembers her mother training her left-handed brother by having him sit with his left hand behind his back.\n\u201cIn the restaurant, we get 97% American diners. If they ask for silverware, I tell them it will be $10 extra,\u201d teases Tefferi, with a twinkle in her eye, \u201c I just want them to try eating with their hands.\u201d This gracious cultural ambassador wants to encourage more people to appreciate the 3000-year old cuisine of her homeland. \u201cWe need to revisit the way people used to eat; how much they cared and believed that whatever they put into their mouths was sacred,\u201d says Tefferi. \u201cThe aroma is important too. Even after you wash up at the end of the meal, the scent of the food remains on your hand. Later, you might hold up your hand to someone else and say \u201cSmell my hand, see how good the food was!\u201d\n(It was and I did.)\n\"Eating with a fork and knife is like making love through an interpreter\u201d\n-- attributed variously to Prime Minister Nehru and the Shah of Iran\nRelated links:\nA recent study says babies may eat better when they feed themselves with their fingers\nChad Ward\u2019s pointed history of the fork on Leite\u2019s Culinaria\n"}, {"score": 513.94196, "uuid": "7a750f5b-ae91-57e4-a2ed-ae25b337ea85", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1904wb-72-04425", "target_hostname": "smokinchoices.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://smokinchoices.wordpress.com/category/fermented-foods/", "page_rank": 1.3021767e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "fermented <em>foods</em> \u00ab SMOKINCHOICES (and other musings)", "snippet": "For over 40 years, I have been concockting my own butter in <em>the</em> kitchen.

In the original article in that newsletter Dr. Cordain states:Although the medical and dermatology communities generally have gone on record stating that diet and acne are unrelated, there is now extensive evidence to show otherwise \u2014 including a recently completed clinical trial from my colleague Neil Mann\u2019s laboratory at RMIT in Melbourne1, 2. In this book I review the four immediate causes of acne and then show how various elements of diet ultimately influence these four immediate causes. In addition to the high dietary glycemic load that is ubiquitous in the typical Western diet, I explain how other common foodstuffs, including dairy products3, may provoke acne symptoms. The book is available as an e-book at my web site: http://www.dietaryacnecure.com .\nA 10,000 Year Old Riddle of Bread and Milk Solved\nIntroductionMost nutrition students know that dietary proteins are not absorbed by the intestines because they are broken down into their component amino acids by enzymes in the gut during the digestive process. Even if dietary proteins escape proteolytic (protein shearing) degradation in the gut, they are normally denied entry into the bloodstream by various gut, liver and immune system barriers.\nFor the past 20 years the pharmaceutical industry has been keenly interested in figuring out a way in which to get intact proteins past the gut barrier and into the bloodstream \u2014 and rightly so. A billion dollar market would be instantly opened up to any company that could develop a procedure to transport insulin (a large protein molecule) across the gut barrier without directly injecting it into the bloodstream. An insulin pill would be a diabetic patient\u2019s dream come true. Well guess what? The day in which an insulin pill will become a reality is getting closer.\nAs a Paleo Diet fan, you may be scratching your head and saying, \u201cSo-what \u2013 why should I be interested in an insulin pill. Shouldn\u2019t proper diet and exercise be the preferred approach for treating type 2 diabetics?\u201d You are absolutely correct, but the relevance of the insulin pill for Paleo Diet devotees is not to be necessarily found in the clinical application, but rather in the pathway whereby intact proteins gain access to the bloodstream. This pathway and its nutritional ramifications represent one of the most fascinating and relevant evolutionary tales in all of human history.\nLectins\nAlthough cereal grains, legumes and dairy foods represent staples for most of the world\u2019s people, these foods were infrequently or never consumed by humans living prior to the advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago4. Both cereal grains and legumes are rich sources of proteins called lectins. In particular, whole wheat contains the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), peanuts contain the lectin, peanut agglutinin (PNA), and kidney beans contain the lectin, phytohemagglutinin (PHA).\nBecause of their sturdy molecular structure, lectins are resistant to the gut\u2019s proteolytic enzymes and have been found fully intact in the guts of both humans and animals5, 6. Further, at least two animal studies have demonstrated that dietary WGA and PHA are rapidly transported across the gut wall into systemic circulation7, 8. Following consumption of tomato juice, tomato lectin (TL) has also been found in systemic circulation of both rats and humans9. More recently, a single study in humans reported the presence of intact PNA in the bloodstream of healthy adults following ingestion of 200g of salted roasted peanuts10.\nBecause of their resistance to digestive enzymes and their ability to rapidly cross the intestinal barrier, lectins have been intently studied by pharmaceutical scientists interested in creating a vehicle for delivering drugs into systemic circulation without the need to directly inject them with a hypodermic needle11. Until 2003 it was unknown how lectins could so rapidly cross the gut barrier and enter the systemic circulation.\nHowever, recent studies using WGA as a drug delivery vehicle have identified the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) as the \u201cback door\u201d by which WGA gains entry into gut cells and then into circulation12.\nHormones and Receptors\nA hormone is a chemical substance that is secreted into body fluids and transported to another organ or tissue, where it produces a specific effect upon metabolism. Hormones most frequently gain entry into organs and tissues by binding a receptor on the surface of the organ or tissue. You can think about the hormone as a key (referred to as a \u201cligand\u201d) and the receptor as the lock. If the key fits the lock, then metabolic processes are put into place in organs and tissues which influence their metabolism.\nThe EGF-R is an unusual receptor in that it is expressed on the inside (luminal side) of the gut rather than on the blood (serosal) facing side13. The reason for this anomaly is that saliva contains a hormone, epidermal growth factor (EGF), which binds to the EGF-R. So when you swallow saliva, you swallow a hormone (EGF) which may bind the EGF-R located on the luminal side of the gut. EGF found in saliva facilitates gut healing when it binds the EGF-R.\nSince WGA, PHA and PNA14, as well as high wheat diets in normal, healthy humans15, may cause extensive damage and disruption to the epithelial cells lining the gut, it is likely that these lectins induce gut cells to up regulate (increase) the numbers of EGF-R to facilitate healing. However, the down side of increasing gut EGF-R in the continued presence of dietary lectins in the gut is that it creates a vicious cycle for enhanced lectin entry into these cells, and thence into the systemic circulation.\nWhole Grain Cereals and Vitamin D Metabolism\nNutritional scientists have known forever and a day that excessive consumption of whole grain cereals severely impairs vitamin D metabolism and can lead to the bone disease, rickets16. In fact, as far back as 1918, before vitamin D was discovered, a scientist in England by the name of Mellanby routinely induced experimental rickets in puppies by feeding them an oat diet17. Epidemiological studies of human populations consuming high levels of unleavened whole grain breads show vitamin D deficiency and rickets to be widespread 18-20. A study of radio-labeled vitamin D in humans consuming 60g of wheat bran daily for 30 days clearly demonstrated an enhanced elimination of vitamin D in the intestines21.\nThe EGF-R, WGA and Rickets\nMechanistically, scientists have never really understood why excessive consumption of whole grains, particularly wheat, could cause rickets. However, with the recent discovery that WGA gains access to the systemic circulation by binding the EGF-R in the gut, it became increasingly clear that WGA and similar whole grain lectins could impair vitamin D metabolism.\nBecause of its affinity to the EGF-R, WGA circulating in the bloodstream has the capacity to gain entry into any cell expressing the EGF-R. It should be noted that epithelial cells located in skin tissue express the EGF-R. Consequently the keratinocytes within the epidermis, because of their expression of the EGF-R will internalize WGA if it is present in peripheral blood. Keratinocytes are also the site of vitamin D synthesis upon ultraviolet (sunlight) irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the cell.\nOnce within skin keratinocytes, WGA blocks the nuclear pore 22, 23, a structure that normally allows passage of certain cellular hormones and large molecules into the nucleus which then cause gene transcription. In particular, WGA blocks the cellular transport of the vitamin D receptor and its endogenous ligand (vitamin D) to the nucleus24, 25 which may result in impaired vitamin D utilization, and systemically increases the risk for rickets.\nNeolithic Food Introductions and Rickets: Evolutionary Implications\nThe Neolithic (new Stone Age) was the period between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago when Agriculture first began in the Near East and then gradually spread to Northern Europe and elsewhere. As former hunter gatherers adopted a farming way of life, their diets changed rather dramatically. Whereas cereal grains were rarely or never consumed by hunter-gatherers, whole grain emmer wheat and barley became staples as hunter gatherers transitioned into early farmers (4, 16). Because whole wheat flour contains sizeable amounts of WGA (30-50 mg/kg)26, a typical Neolithic farmer could easily have consumed 15-25mg of WGA per day on a regular basis. High intakes of WGA like these have the potential to severely impair vitamin D metabolism and thereby increase the risk for developing rickets.\nAlthough rickets is rarely fatal in children and adolescents, it can cause flattening of the pelvic bones in females which may permanently narrow the birth canal. A rickets-induced, narrowed birth canal would have greatly increased mortality for mother and child during childbirth27. In England between the 16th and 18th centuries, the maternal mortality rate was estimated to be 24 to 29 deaths per 1000 births, and many of these deaths were directly attributed to maternal rickets27. It is likely that maternal mortality would have been higher still under the more primitive birthing conditions during the Neolithic. Hence, the reliance upon whole wheat as a staple food in Neolithic people would have represented a powerful negative evolutionary selective pressure that surely was responsible for millions of deaths over the course of thousands of years.\nPrevalence of Lactase in Northern Europeans\nNorthern Europeans and their descendants are unusual amongst the world\u2019s peoples in that they maintain the ability to consume cow\u2019s milk without digestive discomfort because their guts produce lactase, the enzyme necessary to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. Between 70 to 90% of Northern Europeans maintain the adult lactase persistence (ALP) gene, whereas the presence of ALP in most of the world\u2019s people is much lower, ranging from approximately 3 to 25 % (Figure 1)28.\nFigure 1. The percentage of some world\u2019s people with the ability to digest lactose in milk.\nThe standard evolutionary explanation for the presence of ALP in Northern Europeans is that once they had adopted dairying, selection for the ALP genes allowed lactose in milk to be digested without gastrointestinal disturbances and diarrhea. Consequently, ALP enabled calcium and other nutrients in milk to be readily digested, thereby enhancing nutrition and increasing survival28. One of the problems with this explanation is that many of the world\u2019s societies with long histories of dairying, such as the Mongols, the Herero, the Nuer, the Dinka, the Zulu and the Xhosa have low levels of the ALP gene and are generally lactase deficient28, 29. These people have taken a behavioral approach to reduce the lactose in milk by consuming it as fermented products (sour milk, kumis, and yogurt) or as cheese. Certainly, Northern Europeans could have taken this approach. So the evidence suggests that the selection for ALP in Northern Europeans must have occurred for reasons other than the additional calcium and food calories found in fermented milk products.\nExtreme Dermal Depigmentation in Northern Europeans\nIn addition to maintaining a high frequency of ALP, Northern Europeans are unique amongst the world\u2019s people in that they exhibit extreme dermal de-pigmentation. Blond or red hair, very light skin and blue or gray irises are external characteristics that rarely occur together in any other people of the world. The standard evolutionary explanation for extreme dermal de-pigmentation is that Northern Europeans resided at high latitudes where sunlight was seasonally restricted causing impaired vitamin D metabolism30, 31. Accordingly, the selection for light skin enhanced vitamin D synthesis during brief periods of sunlight exposure in these high latitude, sunlight compromised people. The problem with this explanation, as has been previously pointed out, is that other world\u2019s people living at similar or higher latitudes have not evolved extreme dermal depigmentation32 as depicted from the Biasutti map below (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. The Biasutti map depicting skin pigmentation in the world\u2019s peoples29.\nPutting It All Together: The Bigger Picture\nThe reason why Northern Europeans evolved extreme dermal de-pigmentation was two fold. First vitamin D metabolism was slightly compromised in these people from reduced sunlight exposure by living at higher latitudes. But more importantly, regular consumption of whole wheat, because of its high WGA content, pushed vitamin D metabolism to the breaking point, likely causing an epidemic of rickets during the Neolithic. Remember that WGA gets into the bloodstream by binding the EGF-R, and then impairs vitamin D metabolism by blocking the nuclear pore, thereby preventing vitamin D from doing its job. So, one evolutionary strategy employed to overcome WGA\u2019s deleterious effect upon vitamin D metabolism was to select genes coding for lighter skin so that more vitamin D could be synthesized during intermittent sunlight exposure.\nThe second evolutionary strategy taken by natural selection was to reduce or impair the uptake of any WGA that was ingested from wheat. This is where the selection for the adult lactase persistence (ALP) gene comes in. Raw cow\u2019s milk is a rich source of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and contains 325ng per ml33. In contrast, the processing of milk to make fermented milk products will greatly reduce or destroy EGF as it is unstable when exposed to heat, light and acidity33-35. By ingesting raw cow\u2019s milk Neolithic people would be directly dosing themselves with EGF which then could compete with and displace WGA for the EGF-R. Further, EGF from cow\u2019s milk would facilitate gut healing to reduce the number of EGF receptors elicited by the destructive effect of WGA on the gut lining. The net effect of additional EGF from cow\u2019s milk would be to impede entry of WGA into the bloodstream thereby improving vitamin D metabolism, which in turn would reduce the incidence of rickets.\nNeolithic individuals bearing the ALP genes would gain selective advantage over those who didn\u2019t have this gene because they could drink EGF containing cow\u2019s milk without gastrointestinal discomfort. Consequently, over the course of hundred of generations, there would have been a rapid selection for the ALP genes, not because the calcium and food calories in milk provided crucial nutrition, but rather because the EGF in milk countered the rickets producing effects of WGA from whole wheat consumption. Thus, the extreme dermal depigmentation and high prevalence of the lactase enzyme in Northern Europeans were caused by the same negative selective pressure: high consumption of WGA containing whole wheat. Perhaps there are additional lessons to be learned by us all from this 10,000 year evolutionary experiment in eating whole grains.\nFruit and Vegetable Waxes: Are They Safe?\nWhen you visit the produce section of your local supermarket, have you ever noticed the glossy wax that is frequently present on cucumbers and apples, and sometimes on bell peppers and other fruits and vegetables? Have you wondered why these waxes were applied and if they are safe or if they may have any deleterious health effects?The purpose of fruit and vegetable waxes are fourfold: 1) to reduce shrinkage from water loss, 2) to provide a barrier to gas exchange which prolongs shelf life by simultaneously reducing the oxygen content and increasing the carbon dioxide content of the fruit or vegetable, 3) to improve appearance by adding a shiny film, and 4) to sometimes provide a carrier for fungicides or other chemical agents to prevent microbial decay36-38.\nThe waxes applied to fruits and vegetables can take on many different formulations incorporating a variety of waxes and other substances. Listed below are five common waxing formulas37:\n18.6% oxidized polyethylene, 3.4% oleic acid, 2.8% morpholine, 0.01% polydimethylsiloxane antifoam.\n18.3% candelilla wax, 2.1% oleic acid, 2.4% morpholine, 0.02% polydimethylsiloxane antifoam.\n9.5 % shellac, 8.3% carnauba wax, 3.3% morpholine, 1.7% oleic acid, 0.17% ammonia, 0.01% polydimethylsiloxane antifoam.\n19% shellac, 1.0% oleic acid, 4.4% morpholine, 0.3% ammonia, and 0.01% polydimethylsiloxane antifoam.\n13.3 % shellac, 3.0% whey protein isolate, 3.1% morpholine, 0.7 % oleic acid, 0.2% ammonia, 0.01 % polydimethylsiloxane antifoam.\nNote that morpholine is a common element in almost all waxing formulas and is permitted for use in the U.S., Australia, Canada and other countries, but not in Germany. Morpholine\u2019s function is to serve as a solvent and fungicide39, 40. Morpholine, by itself, in the doses that are present in fruits and vegetables probably does not constitute a health risk39, 40. However, during the digestive process, if there are nitrites simultaneously present, morpholine is chemically changed into Nnitrosomorpholine (NMOR), a potent carcinogen in rodents. The estimated safe lower limit for NMOR is 4.3 ng/kg body weight per day. It has been estimated that for adults, consuming waxed apples and a mixed diet, NMOR ingestion can approach (3.6 ng/kg body weight) the lower limit of safety. However, these estimates did not actually measure NMOR formation in humans40. Additionally, nitrite ingestion is quite variable in humans41. Hence, it is entirely possible that chronic consumption of waxed fruit and vegetables containing morpholine could present a slight risk for cancer in certain individuals.\nShellac is a common ingredient in many waxes and is derived from the hardened secretion of the lac insect, Laccifer lacca. It has been reported to elicit allergies in some susceptible people, as has carnauba wax36. Waxes generally cannot be removed by regular washing. So if you prefer not to consume waxes, you must buy un-waxed produce or peel the fruit or vegetable.\nFruits and vegetables which are waxed include: apples, avocados, bell peppers, cantaloupes, cucumbers, eggplants, grapefruits, lemons, limes, melons, oranges, parsnips, passion fruit, peaches, pineapples, pumpkins, rutabagas, squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, turnips and yucca. Since many of these fruits and vegetables are typically peeled and the peel is not consumed, only a few common fruits and vegetables present a problem.\nUntil only very recent times, fruits and vegetables were generally harvested when ripe and brought to market without wax coatings. Even today, fruit and vegetables can be harvested, packed, and stored without the use of waxes, and storage life can be extended through careful handling36.\nThe relative cancer risk of not eating fresh fruits and vegetables is much greater than the small risk posed by consuming waxed fruits and vegetables. Personally, I prefer my produce wax-free, and as fresh as possible.\nRecipe of the Month\nBroiled Pork Tenderloin Zesty Rub1 minced garlic clove\n1 tablespoon paprika\n"}, {"score": 475.462, "uuid": "fc998ebd-ac63-549d-839a-febbf6e781b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-15-32824", "target_hostname": "permaculture.org.au", "target_uri": "http://permaculture.org.au/2011/04/21/a-solar-powered-life-part-vi-the-ideological-debate/", "page_rank": 1.1816949e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>A</em> Solar Powered Life, Part VI - <em>The</em> Ideological Debate Permaculture Research", "snippet": "We can say that <em>the</em> main <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>a</em> society designed according to permaculture methods and <em>a</em> feudal&#x2F;capitalistic society <em>is</em> that permaculture based society <em>is</em> democratic and <em>the</em> other <em>is</em> undemocratic. <em>The</em> second thing <em>is</em> very simple: 1.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 471.49265, "uuid": "1055580e-b3bf-5c0a-b608-524110d0e08c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1105wb-98-20050", "target_hostname": "www.alwaysorderdessert.com", "target_uri": "http://www.alwaysorderdessert.com/2011_10_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 2.0321658e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Always Order Dessert: October 2011 -- <em>Food</em> Blog and Recipes", "snippet": "Add <em>the</em> cooked squash and sage to <em>the</em> <em>blender</em> or <em>food</em> <em>processor</em> and process in batches until smooth, adding about <em>a</em> cup of <em>the</em> reserved chicken broth.", "explanation": null, "document": "Watch Alejandra on Emeril's Table This Week!\nBack in May, Eugene and I taped an appearance as guests on Emeril's new show for the Hallmark Channel, Emeril's Table. The show is finally going to be airing THIS week on Thursday, October 6 at 11AM/10c so be sure to tune in and watch us! (Check your local listings for exact time and channel in your area.)\nHere is a little rundown of our experience on the show!\nThe new show (produced by Martha Stewart's company) is designed in a kind of roundtable style where a group of 4 or 5 guests join Emeril at a table and watch him prepare a meal.\nOn each episode, the guests all have something in common; our episode featured newlyweds, while other episodes featured themes like \"book club members\" or \"poker players,\" etc.. On our show, the theme didn't have anything directly to do with the food we made, but it gave us something to talk about (besides food, of course!). We also got to help a bit with the cooking, and were encouraged to ask Emeril questions throughout the show.\nOur episode is called \" The Magic of Phyllo,\" and in it we learned to make several buttery flaky phyllo dishes included a tuna tartare, baklava, and phyllo-wrapped prawns.\nThe taping was SUCH a blast! We got there early in the morning and started off with hair and make-up. I absolutely LOVED the make-up artist as she was really funny in this really no-nonsense sarcastic way, and did a great job with my makeup. I told her I tend towards the more theatrical with my make-up (and, let's face it, everything) so she gave me a bold pink lipstick and these incredible false lashes that I didn't want to ever take off.\nAfter make-up, the hairstylist tried unsuccessfully to tame my cowlicks (::sigh::), and then we headed to wardrobe, where a stylist picked outfits for us from clothing we brought from home (all solid, bright colors). They only shot us from the hip and up, so I was wearing comfy leopard print slipper flats on my feet the whole time (shhhhhh).\nThe other newlywed couple on the show was a blast. They both had a great sense of humor so the four of us spent most of the down time cracking jokes with them and trying to keep a straight face when the cameras were on.\u00a0 (I admit that on one occasion they shushed us, which of course made us crack up even more. We were like schoolkids.)\nNo Bam!\nOnce we were all dressed, the producer came by to instruct us on a few guidelines for the show and walk us through the process. We were told to always address Emeril as \"Chef\" (vs \"Hey, Emeril!\"). And, most importantly, we were also specifically asked to NOT say the word \"Bam!\" at any point during the taping.\nWe started laughing when we heard that and she explained that apparently people always just want to say \"Bam!\" to him, but he doesn't do that anymore. I think he is trying to evolve his brand a bit past the \"Bam!\" with this new program, which would explain it.\nWhile we waited for our taping to start, we hung out in a conference room decorated with a bunch of Martha's EMMY and Golden Globe statues. They also had tasty homemade granola and yogurt there for us to snack on, which I thought was \"very Martha\" of them.\nOnce the first show he was taping finished, Emeril came out to change into a fresh chef's coat (I think he wears a new one for each show) and greet us before our taping. He was super friendly and it was nice to get a chance to meet him before going on set.\nOn Set\nWhen it was time to tape the show, we headed to the set (which is also the set for the Martha Stewart show ), and took our places at the table. We were each served a glass of prosecco, and in just a few minutes, the show began!\nI was totally fascinated with the way the show was produced. It was shot very quickly in real time (with breaks between segments) though all the recipes were prepared to different stages in the test kitchen by a staff of cooks and a head chef. Emeril would run through some of the steps on cameras and then they'd break for commercial and swap out what he was working on for the almost completed dish, which he would then finish on air.\nWhen the cameras were off, Emeril was very focused, but as soon as the cameras were rolling it was like a switch would go on and he'd get into lively TV mode. It reminded me of the way my dad (who is a news anchor) has his own on-air/off-air switch that he turns on whenever he's in front of cameras (or even just a crowd). It's definitely a TV personality thing. I need to start working on my own... ;)\nOne thing I thought was pretty cool was they way that whenever they finished taping a dish, an assistant would come and whisk it away to a little mini photography studio set in the corner of the room where they would take beauty shots of the food. Once they finished photographing, we (and the staff) were then able to eat it.\nAt one point, Emeril called the other husband and me up to help him finish one of the dishes (I believe it was a tuna tartare appetizer). They told us to act really excited so we did, throwing our heads back and laughing and smiling at each other and Emeril like a pair of maniacs. (That's what's going on in that photo up there.)\nAfter Emeril's part of the show was done, they took some random shots of us just eating and talking to each other, during which we were encouraged to talk about the food we ate. (It was really good and we said as much.) I did my best to eat elegantly; not the easiest thing when the food in question is a giant phyllo-wrapped prawn complete with eyeballs and long tentacles!\nThe one thing that made me laugh for days after the taping (apart from the no \"Bam!\" rule) was the way that Emeril just could not seem to get my name right throughout the show. I actually can't wait to see the final show to see if they edited it in any way because he literally called me by about 6 different names throughout the taping. All close variations of Alejandra (Alexandra, Alexandria, Alezandra, etc.), but just never quite right.\nOn one occasion, a producer pulled him over and reminded him of my name, which was funny because he then proceeded to say it out loud perfectly to me about 6 times, only to call me Alezandra again once the cameras started rolling. I wasn't alone though; he also had some trouble with equally tricky sriracha sauce and kataifi (shredded phyllo), which he kept calling \"gaddafi.\" Yes, as in Muammar.\nDespite his wacky pronunciation, you can tell he really knows his stuff. In between takes, some of the producers or test kitchen staff would ask him questions about food, and he always knew the answer and would elaborate with a little story.\u00a0 I would have loved to have been able to hear more of those!\nOnce the taping finished, we took a group photo with Emeril in front of the set, and then we all got to take the food we made back with us to the green room where we literally finished every single bite. Of all the dishes, my favorite was definitely the prawns, followed by the tuna wraps. Once every speck of phyllo was gone, we all packed up our clothing and headed out. The staff was really relaxed and funny, and it was great to work with them throughout the entire morning. On our way out, they even gave each of us one of Emeril's cookbooks to keep!\nWant to check out the show? Tune in THIS Thursday, October 6th at 11AM on the Hallmark Channel. (Check your local listings for channel info.) Note that they show 2 episodes of the show back-to-back and we're on the first one (the Magic of Phyllo episode).\n(Unfortunately Eugene and I don't actually get the Hallmark Channel with our cable package, so we're going to have to try to finagle a way to see the show since they can't provide DVDs for us. If any of you have it and can figure out a way to record it and email it to me, please email me and let me know as that would be awesome!) UPDATE: I upgraded our cable!

At the time, he didn't specify that it was mochi, referring to it only as a \"box of weird Japanese candy for your family.\" When we opened the box the next day, we were all a bit puzzled by the dusty pastel lumps found inside. We took turns tasting the various types, alternately chewing and grimacing and spitting it out after a few seconds.\n\"This is gross,\" said my brother, never one to mince words. \"Why would he bring us such weird candy?\"\nMy parents were equally puzzled (albeit less rude) and turned away after a couple minutes, preferring the familiar sweetness of the Godiva this friend had also brought.\nWhile I admit that I didn't love the way the candy tasted either, I was fascinated with the texture. I love chewy, squooshy things. My brother is regularly grossed out by the way that I tend to play with my food when I think that nobody is watching--hollowing out a loaf of bread and squishing the doughy mass into a tight little ball or emptying out the filling of a truffle and licking it off my finger before eating the shell. I love getting my hands dirty with food; I have no qualms about plunging my hands into raw turkeys or kneading sticky piles of flour and eggs into pasta dough. It's probably also why I love Silly Putty and Play-Doh, and why I was always getting in trouble for stealing that gummy blue putty tape that my elementary school teachers used to stick posters to the wall.\nGiven these proclivities, it's no wonderf I've spent the past few weeks intrigued with the idea of making my own mochi. My friend Matt is obsessed with mochi ice cream and regularly sends me e-mails and IMs that say little more than \"Mochi is just so wonderful.\" I'd been plotting to teach myself to make it so that I can surprise him with a little tray of homemade mochi ice cream balls when he comes to visit me next month. My impromptu expedition to the Japanese grocery store last weekend proved to be the perfect way to get started on Project Homemade Mochi.\nI decided to start by teaching myself to make daifuku--a round ball of mochi stuffed with Anko, a sweet red bean paste made from azuki beans. I'd never tasted it before, but had seen various pictures on the web (particularly this lovely shot from Kyoto Foodie). I love the lumpy squooshy look of it and was excited to get started. Of course, Alejandra being Alejandra, I didn't really bother to find a recipe before hitting the store. One would think that no recipe + everything in a foreign language would make for an unsuccessful trip, but not for me! Using what bits I'd read about what mochi is and my memory of the taste, I haphazardly selected ingredients that seemed like they might be right: rice flour, a package of sweetened red bean paste, confectioner's sugar, and some tapioca starch. I lucked out as this plus water and food coloring was really all I needed.\nWhen I got home I searched online for mochi recipes. They all seemed to follow a similar pattern, but varied in amounts and ratios. Most advised using the microwave as a quick way to cook the dough, but few other instructions were clear. Bored and eager to get in the kitchen, I decided to just wing it.\nIn a large bowl I mixed equal parts rice flour (I used dango-ko, which is a mix of glutinous and non-glutinous rice flour and--rather fortuitously--seems to be the\nkind best suited for microwave preparation) and tepid water. To this I added powdered sugar, a few drops of red food coloring, and some almond extract (just because I'm obsessed). I processed with a hand blender until smooth and then poured into a Pyrex pie dish that I covered and placed in the microwave.\nWhile the dough cooked, I rolled little balls out of chilled sweetened red bean paste and dusted everything with starch in anticipation of the sticky dough. After letting it cool a bit I dusted my hands with starch and scooped some out. Molding it was easy: I simply rolled a ball out of the mochi dough then flattened it out a bit on the floured mat. I plopped a ball of red bean paste in the center and then pulled up the sides of the mochi dough like a little bag (it reminded me of making Beggar's Purses back at school). I pinched the top and then rolled around in my hands until smooth on all sides. I repeated this about a dozen times. It was easy, but sticky and messy (my favorite!).\nAfter shooting them, I covered them with plastic wrap and stored in the fridge. I had one for breakfast this morning and it was delicious. The gooey mochi dough had a subtle sweetness and a faint hint of almond, and the red bean paste was oozed out in a creamy contrast to the stickiness of the mochi. If you've never tried red bean paste before, it literally tastes like sweet refried beans--but it's good!\nI'm not sure if it's just because I made them to my tastes or if my palate has just changed over the past year, but I can honestly say that I loved these treats. I'll be tackling the ice cream version next--possibly with my own homemade green tea ice cream!\nA Few Helpful Tips:\n1. Dust EVERYTHING with tapioca (or potato or corn) starch: the surface, your hands, spoons, plates. This dough is incredibly sticky and it's the only way to handle it.\n2. I tend to have naturally cold hands--a huge benefit when working with chocolate and confections, but if you are naturally warm-handed, I would suggest washing with very cold water before you get started. It will keep the dough from sticking as much.\n3. Play around with extracts or food colors--I don't think that it's exactly traditional, but it gives the final treats a great look and taste. I started out with just a few drops of red, but then decided I wanted them to be hot pink so I threw in a bit more and loved the final look. I'm excited to try out other color combinations.\n4. Blow off the extra starch before eating--you'll want to keep it nice and dusty for storing, but as it's tasteless, it takes away from the experience.\nDaifuku--Anko-stuffed Mochi\nDaifuku literally means \"great luck\" in Japanese. Apparently, the word fuku means both \"belly\" and \"luck.\" It seems that the original meaning of big belly, which referred to the filling nature of the confection, evolved over the years to mean a bringer of good fortune. When I first read this, I instantly thought that the belly part referred to the fact that the daifuku actually look like little bellies. I've taken to calling them \"chubby belly cakes\" in my head--but that's just me... ;)\nIngredients\n1 1/2 cup Dango-ko rice flour\n1 1/2 cup tepid water\n2/3 cup confectioner's sugar (feel free to adjust according to personal preference)\n1 package or can of sweetened Anko (red bean paste), refrigerated to keep firm.\nfood coloring (optional)\nalmond extract (optional)\ntapioca, potato, or corn starch for dusting and controlling the sticky dough\nYou will also need a microwave and a flat microwavable dish such as a deep-dish pie plate.\n1. In a large bowl, mix the rice flour, sugar, and water until smooth. You may need to use a hand blender or mixer to make sure there aren't any lumps.\n2. If desired, add drops of food coloring and/or extract and mix in thoroughly. Note that the batter will be quite thin--very similar to pancake batter in consistency.\n3. Pour batter into a shallow microwavable dish and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 4 minutes. Remove dish and pull off plastic to release steam. Stir the mix until smooth again (it will be cooked in some parts and not in others so don't worry if it looks uneven). Microwave again for another 3 to 5 minutes until the top is dry.\n4. While mix cooks, take out the refrigerated bean paste and roll into small balls about the size of a chocolate truffle. Dust your hands with starch or confectioner's sugar to keep from sticking.\n5. Remove mochi dough from microwave and let cool for several minutes. You can speed this up by pounding it with a flour-covered pestle until shiny and smooth.\n6. To Mold: taking one heaping tablespoon of dough out of the dish and place in your starch-covered hands. Work into a circle and then flatten on the floured board. Drop a ball of red bean paste inside and the pull mochi around the edges like a little purse. Pinch the top shut and then use your hand to smooth into a soft round shape. Dust with additional starch and set aside. Repeat this process until you use up all the mochi.\nCover finished Daifuku tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate to store (or freeze). Serve and enjoy much the way you would any other cookie or small cake.\nPosted by Alejandra Ramos at 1:08 AM\n"}, {"score": 462.55597, "uuid": "b3640757-e0c6-5c5d-bbf9-fdd292678178", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1020wb-04-20870", "target_hostname": "eatocracy.cnn.com", "target_uri": "http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/08/24/mayonnaise/", "page_rank": 1.1959933e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "How to win over <em>a</em> mayo hater \u2013 Eatocracy - CNN.com Blogs", "snippet": "Just stop, stick in <em>a</em> spoon and give your creation <em>a</em> taste.

I am excited to get to dinner as I get to feature a couple of my favourite recipes here. The baked rice recipe is fantastic for convenience. I love being able to throw a bunch of ingredients in the pot, bang it in the oven and walk away and do something else for 1 \u00bd hours, as so many meals seem to have us standing at the bench for that period instead! It can be kept as a simple and nourishing meal by having with salad, or add a few toppings after cooking for an absolute feast.\nFor dinner the feature topic is good oil vs bad oil. I have promised a little discussion on eating oils, which has been a controversial issue for many years. The mainstream information has gone back and forth over the issues of fats, cholesterol, animal fats, vegetable oils, margarine, butter\u2026.it\u2019s become a real confusion. I hope that a few simple principles plus some suggestions for further reading will help to clarify this important nutritional topic.\nRemember that we will always come back to our principle of \u2018off the vine\u2019 meaning the foods that are best for us are those in their most natural form. The more we process the ingredients the more nutrients are lost, the more disease inducing alterations are wrought in the molecules of the food substance. And often the more toxic and unnecessary additives are included. This is especially true for fats.\nFirst let\u2019s get an idea of what to eliminate. Those fats that are altered in their structure by whipping will be the first to go. Throw out your margarine, your blended (fridge soft) butters. These whipped fats provide \u2018free radicals\u2019, altered oxygen molecules known to be implicated in many serious diseases.\n\u2018Free-radicals\u2019 is an important topic for presbyopes. (Those with \u2018old-age\u2019 reading blur.) These altered fat molecules are a toxin which the body can often have difficulty eliminating and must store somewhere in the body. The storage location chosen by the body is frequently the lens of the eye, creating the \u2018stiffening\u2019 that is often attributed to aging. Those who wish to reverse or prevent reading blur in maturity will follow these guidelines for fat consumption, helping to avoid or reverse this accumulation and it\u2019s effects.\nDo your best to eliminate from your diet whipped cream, fried foods (where the fats have been altered by heating to high temperatures) heat processed and old oils, which have been stored in clear jars or for long periods. These will have been altered by the exposure to light and air.\nMany of the vegetable oils available in these modern times contain fatty acids which are not beneficial to the body, and the methods of processing them do not assist. Come back to the old fashioned vegetable oils, Olive being the pre-dominant traditional oil. Purchase high quality oil (the more \u2018virgin\u2019 the better), and only use that which has been stored in dark bottles. Buy small quantities and use it up within a matter of weeks. Store in a cool dark place and use it on foods after they have been cooked rather than before as much as possible.\nWhy eat fats at all? Fats from animal and vegetable sources are an essential nutrient for long term health. For vegetarians it is especially important to ensure a sufficiency of beneficial fats in the diet. Fats give a concentrated source of energy, they provide the materials for building cell membranes and hormone and hormone-like substances. Fats play a vital role in bone health, allowing calcium to be incorporated effectively. They enhance the immune system. They act as carrier for fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K. They contribute to nutrient conversion and a multitude of other processes.\nGeneral health is important to good eyesight, as we have discussed at previous meals. This can be brought down to specifics in many ways. One example is Vitamin A, which is an important chemical component of night vision. While it is toxic in overdose, constant appropriate amounts are vital to fuel the chemical interchange that allows us to see in dim light. As you can understand, it\u2019s not just the vitamin A that is needed, but the beneficial fats to facilitate its use in the body.\nIn general, for all these processes to take place we need different kinds of fats, which work together for optimum bodily function.\nFor those who don\u2019t wish to eat animal products, beneficial fats can be obtained from nuts, seeds and avocado. Good quality organic olive oil can also play an important role. One of the most beneficial vegetarian fats is that obtained from cold-pressed linseed (flaxseed) oil. (Purchase this oil only from the refrigerator section of the store, keep it in the refrigerator and never ever heat it. Drizzle it over salads and cooked foods on the plate. Cap quickly and return to the fridge after each use.) This oil provides those essential fats now widely promoted as being most obtainable in fish oils (omega-3), making it a vital option for vegetarians and vegans.\nFor those who have a more varied diet, then fish, eggs and some meats will join the vegetarian sources to provide a complete cross section of fatty nutrients. I say \u2018some meats\u2019 and what I mean is that it is better to eat small quantities regularly than large portions. For many people who do not have a very physically active lifestyle, longevity will be improved by not overloading the body with lots of heavy proteins.\nWhat is your body doing at dinner time? As most people have already completed their periods of vigorous activity through the day, it seems clear that dinner is not a time for large energy inputs. Eating meals that are easily and quickly digested will be the best option, especially for those with any tendency towards sleeping problems. This can include having a hard time falling asleep, waking up in the night and being unable to return to sleep, and finding it hard to wake up even after a full nights sleep.\nYou will notice that your eyesight is strongly affected by your energy levels. It\u2019s not just that your eyesight at its best when you feel energetic and well rested. Good brain function is important for good eyesight and good brain function requires sufficient deep and restful sleep. Ensuring you get enough good quality rest is an important part of your overall health and good eyesight routine.\nNutritional responses to insomnia would begin by first eliminating any sugars or sweets of any kind after 7pm or after 4pm if the first solution is not effective. This means even fresh fruit. Establish a routine bedtime and stick to it, as the body responds best to regular habits. Eat a light meal in the evening, preferably before 7pm. Your best sleep is obtained before 12midnight, and it is suggested that the most beneficial bedtime is no later than 10pm.\nIf you find you are waking up tired then the suggestion about no snacks after dinner, and a light meal become even more important. Watch your food combining as well. In these ways you can help to ensure that your body is resting during the night rather than using energy for ongoing digestion of large meals or poor combinations. If you are feeling tired as soon as you get up in the morning then a boost of B vitamin complex may be helpful. These are also the vitamins often found very useful if you are stressed. I have found I sleep better during times of stress and have much more energy during the day with the addition of a B complex to my diet.\nBrown rice contains B1, B3 and Biotin. Egg yolks, lentils, sunflower and sesame seeds (remember vitamin content will be easier to assimilate if seeds and nuts are sprouted, see our breakfast article) contain B1 & B2. Fish is also a good source of B3, B6, and B12, especially Tuna. Brewer\u2019s yeast, nuts and whole grains each offer many of the B vitamins. The combination of brown rice, lentils or other legumes, and vegetables is therefore an excellent source of both complete vegetarian protein and a good source of B vitamins.\nRecommended reading:\nNourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon, New Trends Publishing, Washington DC.\nFats that Heal, Fats that Kill by Udo Erasmus, visit http://www.edoerasmus.com/ .\nRecipes:\n"}], [{"score": 433.58347, "uuid": "7bfaa2df-7b98-5140-b0f2-8f8d801c332a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-94-33644", "target_hostname": "www.keeperofthehome.org", "target_uri": "http://www.keeperofthehome.org/2011/02/a-sweethearts-breakfast-oatmeal-whole-wheat-pancakes-and-homemade-pancake-syrup.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>A</em> Sweetheart\u2019s Breakfast: Oatmeal Whole Wheat Pancakes and Homemade Pancake", "snippet": "If we look at <em>the</em> value increase <em>between</em> selling coconuts to industry <em>vs</em> production of coconut sweeteners we\u2019re up over 250%.

After all, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, right? Even after 34 years of marriage, this still holds true for my sweetheart.\nA healthy alternative pancake syrup\nThe syrup I serve with pancakes is a\u00c2\u00a0concoction I came up with when the price of organic maple syrup went through the roof. The best price I've found for organic maple syrup is $17.99 (quart) at Whole Foods (their own 365 brand). But even at that, it was prohibitive for my budget. So I punted.\nMy \"maple\" flavored syrup, costs about a third of organic maple syrup and its' simple to make. Granulated coconut palm sugar is the base (the one I like is SweetTree Organic Unrefined - High Nutrient Blonde Coconut Palm Sugar ).\nPalm Sugar - Nutritionally Dense\nOne of the great things about this sweetener, besides the cost, is that it is a healthier choice than maple syrup and many other sugars as well. Coconut palm sugar is made from the sweet flower blossom nectar of the green coconut tree, coco nucifera, and contains lots of minerals and other nutrients. The nectar is boiled and then dried and granulated.\nA sustainable sweetener\nAnother advantage is that this sweetener is an ecologically sound product. A blurb from the back of the package states, Tropical palms are an ecologically beneficial tree crop that grow in diverse, wild-life supportive agro-ecosystems, restore damaged soils and require little water. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has reported that palm sugars are the single most sustainable sweetener in the world.\nOther uses for coconut palm sugar syrup\nWhatever you'd use raw honey, organic maple syrup, stevia, or regular sugar for...this syrup can serve as a substitute. We use it for smoothies, for sweetening whipped cream, yogurt, baked oatmeal , etc. Use it as you would use organic maple syrup. It is just about the same consistency.\nAn Addendum: One sweetener I won't use\nI thought I should add just a little info about a sweetener that is currently labeled as healthy. Recent research has disclosed the truth about this so-called healthy alternative sweetener, however.\nOf course, as some of you may know, I am referring to agave nectar. I used this syrup for several years and loved it. Easier to measure than honey, it became my favorite sweetener until I read this article from Dr. Joseph Mercola .\nOatmeal Whole Wheat Pancakes\nNote: For all who are sensitive to gluten, these pancakes are made with wheat flour and therefore are not gluten free.\n1 1/2 fresh organic whole wheat flour\n1/2 cup rolled organic oats (not quick-cooking type)\n2 cups organic cultured buttermilk\n3 eggs (from pastured chickens is best), slightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon real sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon stevia extract (optional)\n2 tablespoons melted organic butter or coconut oil\n1 teaspoon baking soda\nbutter or coconut oil for griddle\nDirections:\nThe day before: Combine buttermilk,\u00c2\u00a0 flour and oats; cover bowl and \"soak\" for 12 - 24 hours in a warm place. (For information regarding why wheat, oats, and other seed foods should be \"soaked\" before preparation, please go here for a brief explanation, then scroll down the page to the subtitle A Real Food Lesson.)\nThe following morning: Stir in eggs, salt, stevia, butter and baking soda. Batter will begin to increase in volume as soon as baking soda is added. Batter will also be thicker than other whole grain or white flour batters, but if it seems too thick to ladle, add a little milk to thin.

Do you have any more information on this type of sugar actually being a sustainable practice? I would like to research it a little more before buying more. Thank you for any information you can give.\n@Sharon ,\nHello Again Albrey,\nI already received a response from SweetTree farms and am including it in this email (I\u2019d leave a link, but can\u2019t get the web address off of the PDF file that was sent to me).\nBut first, it may be important to note that the brand of coconut palm sugar I referred to is a product of Indonesia, not the Philippines. As to whether that makes a difference or not, I am not sure. But I was somewhat satisfied after having read the response from SweetTree.\nBelow is the response:\n\u201cQuestion:\nHow sustainable is Coconut Sugar if harvesting the sweetener means that a grower can no longer harvest coconuts?\u201d\n\u201cAnswer:\nSweetTree Coconut Sugar is the world\u2019s most sustainable sweetener. Environmentally, Socially and Economically, Coconut Sugar simply stacks up cleaner and more equitably than any other sweetener we have ever seen (and that\u2019s pretty\nmuch all of them because we\u2019re based in the humid tropics where the majority of these sweeteners are grown). What type of sweetener was recorded as the first source of sugar for humans? Coconut Sugar (and other palm sweeteners). What type of sweetener is used in multiple ancient healing traditions as a medicinal and daily tonic? Coconut Sugar. And what sweetener comes from a source which grows wild in diverse and healthy forest ecosystems? Coconut Sugar. The list of positives for why one should choose Coconut Sugar over other \u201cmono-crop\u201d grown options (cane, corn, agave, beet) literally goes on and on. Coconut palms are called the \u201cTree of Life\u201d with reason; every part of the tree offers us a source of some form of sustainable nutrients or shelter; Coconuts, Coconut Milk, Coconut Water, Coconut Pith, Coconut Frond, Coconut Fibers, Coconut Flowers, Coconut Nectar, Coconut Oil\u2026and the list goes on. In fact, the only comment we have ever heard questioning the greatness of Coconut Sugar is the idea that if you harvest coconut sugar you can no longer harvest coconuts. In fact this isn\u2019t true at all. Coconuts produce inflorescences about every 3-4 months. What this means is that there are usually multiple flower stalks on a single tree..and what this means is that a grower of coconuts can actually choose to harvest sugar from one flower stalk and let the other stalk mature to coconuts.\nAlso it\u2019s important to know that nothing in the world of coconut production is ever set in stone; If a grower chooses to produce coconut sugar from all the flower stalks produced by the tree and then 3 months later decides to produce all coconuts he need only wait for new flowers to emerge and he can let those grow to mature nuts. In fact, it should probably be said that the greatest danger to the continued production of coconuts in the tropics is the industry that uses coconuts! One of the reasons that coconut sugar has been so embraced by small farmers in our experience is because it offers a way out of the poverty experienced by these coconut growers when they sell their produce to the copra market (copra is dried coconut meat and it is used for coconut oil production\u2026the largest market for coconuts on earth).\u201d\n\u201cQuestion:\nI really love using the Coconut Palm sugar and with our family of diabetes with my grandmother, it is wonderful to find such a healthier sugar alternative that works good with baking as well. I have a few questions if you can help. I know some companies that produce coconut oil from the Philippines do not get into the palm sugar market because they do not want to support coconut products that prevent coconut trees from bearing fruit (this would include \u201ccoconut sugar\u201d because it is harvested from the flowering bud of the coconut tree.) This mainly because coconut trees in the Philippines have been on the decline for decades, and the coconut oil from coconuts is also now valued as a fuel source in bio-diesel production, resulting in less coconut oil availability as a food source each year. So just wanted to get your view on this as I understand that Sweet Tree gets theirs\nfrom Indonesia and would not be involved in the decline of coconut trees in the Philippines? Also, is the sugar sourced from a different species of palm different from the species coconut oil is harvested from? Anyway, just had those thoughts as we try to make good decisions for our family on healthy alternatives for sugar and trying to keep supporting companies like yours and others that have the same ideals in helping the environment as well.\nThanks so much.\nA customer\u201d\n\u201cAnswer:\nWhile it is true that in most cases farmers feel they must choose to focus their coconut palm roduction on either coconuts OR flower nectar for the production of sugar and spirits, this is actually not accurate. In most cases (the productivity/age of\nthe palm being the variable) farmers can produce both crops in the same period by simply managing the inflorescences separately. Here in Indonesia, we have a small number of producers that choose to produce both coconuts and coconut sugar\u2026the\njury however is still out on whether total yields are reduced through this style of management. Actually this system was first developed by the Philippine Coconut Authority. And as for companies in the Philippines not wanting to support coconut products that prevent palms from bearing fruit, I think this is far more directly related to an overarching concern by industry that small holders will find a more economically rewarding value addition opportunity than simply selling coconuts in bulk to a highly industrialized \u201coil\u201d industry. Farmers (unless working in a Community\nProcessing Program which would likely be extremely small scale and fraught with management issues) probably do not get much of a benefit from the \u201chighly valued\u201d bio-fuel that is produced far from the farms. The production of finished goods by small-holders is an efficient albeit sometimes\nrisky way to bridge poverty alleviation and development needs with private entrepreneurialism. The farmers in our Indonesian program have increased their incomes by over 100% per month through the direct involvement and investment of Big Tree Farms in central processing facilities and educating markets around the world about this incredible sweetener\u2026And these were farmers that had been producing traditional sugar well before we showed up! If we look at the value increase between selling coconuts to industry vs production of coconut sweeteners we\u2019re up over 250%. This sweetener is one of the few truly sustainable ingredients in the world. We know that is a big statement, but we feel its deserved\u2026in terms of people, health and\nenvironment coconut sweeteners provide huge benefit every step of the way\u2026Lifting communities out of poverty, bringing much needed minerals and vitamins into the human body in a mode (sweets) that often does just the opposite,\nand in preserving rainforest, protecting fragile tropical biomes and indeed promoting the return of devastated land back to balance\u2026.As you can see\u2026We are hooked.\u201d\nReply\nAlbrey February 9, 2011 at 2:25 pm\n@Sharon , Wow, so much information!

Reserve 10% of the soaking liquid (should keep for a long time in the fridge). Discard the rest of the soaking liquid; cook the rice in fresh water. UPDATE: I reduce the amount of water added at this point. For example, if I have 1 cup rice and 2 cups water to soak, I pour off the water (reserving some) and add about 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 cup fresh water. You could be really precise and measure what you pour off, then add the same amount fresh to make up for what the rice has already absorbed. This makes a big difference in cooking nice rice! Don\u2019t forget the rule of rice cooking \u2013 no peeking under the lid once you reduce to a simmer!\nThe next time you make brown rice, use the same procedure as above, but add the soaking liquid you reserved from the last batch to the rest of the soaking water.\nRepeat the cycle. After three times, 96% or more of the phytic acid should be degraded at 24 hours.\nNeutralizing and reducing that percentage of phytic acid is unheard of with other methods and grains.\u00a0 Even sourdough only decreases phytates by 64% .\u00a0 The modified fermentation acidifies the water and continues to keep the pH stable and even lowers it, whereas soaking in slightly acidic water ends up moving closer to a neutral (7) pH as time passes.\nThe Point?\nThe goal of all this soaking and fermenting is supposed to be to reduce the levels of phytic acid in your grains so that minerals are more bioavailable and easy to assimilate into your system.\u00a0 After taking care to soak brown rice the third time with a bit of old starter water, the phytic acid is almost gone completely.\nThe sad news is that at the end of this research journal entry, the researchers found that zinc, the mineral in question for their study, was almost no more well-absorbed after the accelerated fermentation than it was before.\u00a0 They concluded that more study is needed; I concur and am left wondering if the work involved in soaking is worth it.\u00a0 There are other positive impacts beyond just phytic acid reduction, luckily.\nAnother way to reduce phytic acid in rice: germinated brown rice .\nI\u2019d love to see more of you!\u00a0 Sign up for a free email subscription or grab my reader feed .

Flame, flame.\" \"Boy, what a bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!\" Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately obvious from the verb. These have their own listings in the lexicon. Soundalike slang: Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting. It is considered particularly\nif the phrase is bent so as to include some other slang word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine `Dr. Dobb's Journal' is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr. Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'. Terms of this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers: Boston Herald American => Horrid (or Harried) American Boston Globe => Boston Glob San Francisco Chronicle => the Crocknicle New York Times => New York Slime However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples include: Prime Time => Slime Time Data General => Dirty Genitals Government Property - Do Not Duplicate (seen on keys) => Government Duplicity - Do Not Propagate for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins Margaret Jacks Hall => Marginal Hacks Hall This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque whereas hacker rhyming slang is intentionally transparent. The -P convention: turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from the LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate (a Boolean-valued function). The question should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't. (See T and NIL.) At dinnertime: Q: \"Foodp?\" A: \"Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.\" or \"T!\" Q: \"State-of-the-world-P?\" A: (Straight) \"I'm about to go home.\" A: (Humorous) \"Yes, the world has a state.\" On the phone to Florida: Q: \"State-p Florida?\" A: \"Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?\" [One of the best of these is a Gosperism (i.e., due to Bill Gosper). When we were at a Chinese restaurant, he wanted to know whether someone would like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup. His inquiry was: \"Split-p soup?\" --GLS] Overgeneralization: A very conspicuous feature of hackerspeak is the frequency with which names of program tools, command language primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them. Thus, (to cite one of the best-known examples) UNIX hackers often\nfor things rather than *searching* for them. Many of the lexicon entries are generalizations of exactly this kind. Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well. Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform cases (or vice versa). For example, because porous => porosity generous => generosity hackers happily generalize: mysterious => mysteriosity ferrous => ferrocity obvious => obviosity dubious => dubiosity Also, note that all nouns can be verbed. e.g.: \"All nouns can be verbed\", \"I'll mouse it up\", \"Hang on while I clipboard it over\", \"I'm grepping the files\". English as a whole is already heading in this direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are simply a bit ahead of the curve. Similarly, all verbs can be nouned. Thus: win => winnitude, winnage disgust => disgustitude hack => hackification Finally, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural forms. Anything ending in x may form plurals in -xen (see\nand\nin the main text). Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this way; ex. `soxen' for a bunch of socks. Other funny plurals are `frobbotzim' for the plural of\n(see main text) and `Unices' and `Tenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Tenexes'; see\n,\nin main text). But note that `Unixen' and `Tenexen' are *never* used; it has been suggested that this is because -ix and -ex are latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural. The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is generalization of an inflectional rule which (in English) is either an import or a fossil (such as Hebrew plural in `-im', or the Anglo-Saxon plural in `en') to cases where it isn't normally considered to apply. This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware of what they are doing when they distort the language. It is grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness. Spoken inarticulations: Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where their referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on a comm link or in email. Another expression sometimes heard is \"Complain!\", meaning \"I have a complaint!\" Of the five listed constructions, verb doubling, peculiar noun formations, and (especially!) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but rhyming slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large universities, and the P convention is found only where LISPers flourish. Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood as members of sets of comparatives. This is especially true of the adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality of code. Here is an approximately correct spectrum: MONSTROSITY BRAIN-DAMAGE SCREW BUG LOSE MISFEATURE CROCK KLUGE HACK WIN FEATURE ELEGANCE PERFECTION The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never actually attained. Coinages for describing\nseem to call forth the very finest in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that \"\nhave more words for equipment failures than Inuit have for snow\", or than Yiddish has for obnoxious people. Hacker Speech Style =================== Features extremely precise diction, careful word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use of contractions or `street slang'. Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued --- but an underlying seriousness and intelligence is essential. One should use just enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as `in the culture'; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude are considered tacky and the mark of a loser. This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical fields. Unlike the jargon construction methods, it is fairly constant throughout hackerdom. It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions --- or, at least, the people they're talking to are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they've done so much coding that distinguishes between if (going) { and if (!going) { that when they parse the question \"Aren't you going?\" it seems to be asking the opposite question from \"Are you going?\", and so merits an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part weren't there (in some other languages, including Chinese and Japanese, the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't arise). Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French `si' or German `doch' with which one could unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question. For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use a double negative even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows it. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an affirmative knowing it will be mis-parsed as a negative tends to disturb them. Hacker Writing Style ==================== Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parens, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if \"Jim is going\" is a phrase, and so is \"Bill runs\" and \"Spock groks\", then hackers generally prefer to write: \"Jim is going\", \"Bill runs\", and \"Spock groks\". This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes) but it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussing programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code extra characters can be a real pain in the neck. For example: First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -,\" then... is different from First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -\", then... from a computer's point of view. While the first is correct according to the stylebooks and would probably be parsed correctly by the a human recipient, the second is unambiguous. The Jargon File follows hackish usage consistently throughout. Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great Britain, though the older style (which became established for typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there. Hart's Rules and the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors call it `new' or `logical' style quoting. Another hacker quirk about quoting style is a tendency to distinguish between `marking' quotes and \"speech\" quotes; that is, to use British-style single quotes for emphasis and reserve double quotes for actual reports of speach or text included from elsewhere. Interestingly, some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes thoroughly enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with USENET -- ESR]. One further permutation that is definitely *not* standard is a hackish tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes in pairs; that is, 'like this'. This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some programming languages. There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or lose information they can be discarded without a second thought. It is notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example, in vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even when constructed to appear slangy and loose. There is another respect in which hackish usage often parallels British usage; it tends to choose British spellings whenever these seem more phonetically consistent than the American ones. For example, a hacker is likely to insist on (British-style) `signalling' rather than American-standard `signaling' on the grounds that the latter ought to be pronounced /sig'nay'ling/ rather than /sig'n@-ling/. Similarly, `travelling' is preferred to `traveling'. Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available. One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and this becomes such a synesthetic reflex that a person who goes to caps-lock while in\n(see main text) may be asked to \"stop shouting, please, you're hurting my ears!\". Also, it is common to use bracketing with asterisks to signify emphasis, as in \"What the *hell*?\" (mote that this interferes with the common use of asterisk suffix is a footnote mark). An alternative form uses paired slash and backslash: \"What the \\hell/?\". The latter is never used in text documents, as many formatters treat backslash as an\nand may do inappropriate things with the following text. Also note that there is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this*, (which emphasizes the phrase as a whole) and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a very young child or mentallly impaired person). In a formula, `*' signifies multiplication, and two asterisks in a row are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN). Thus, one might write `2 ** 8 = 256'. Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead `2 ^ 8 = 256'. This goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII `up-arrow' that later became caret; this was picked up by Kemeny & Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the bc(1) and dc(1) UNIX tools that have probably done most to reinforce the convention on USENET. The notation is mildly confusing to C programmers, because `^' means logical\nin C. Despite this, it was favored 3--1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of USENET. It is used consistently in this text. Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN). This is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long. The tilde (`~') is commonly used in its mathematical sense of `approximately'; that is, `~50' means \"about fifty\". Underlining is often suggested by substituting underscores for spaces and prepending and appending one underscore to the underlined phrase. Example: \"It is often alleged that Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ in response to Robert Heinlein's earlier _Starship_Troopers_\" On USENET and in the\nworld common C boolean operators (`|, !, ==, !=, >, <') are often combined with English by analogy with mainstream usage of &. The Pascal not-equals, `<>', is also recognized. The use of prefix `!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common; thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'. Another habit is that of using enclosure to genericize a term; this derives from conventions used in\n. Uses like the following are common: So this\nwalks into a bar one day, and... In flat-ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see <> used in exactly this way to bracket words which themselves have entries in the File. This isn't done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that the reader needs specially to be aware that the term has a jargon meaning and might wish to refer to its entry. One quirk that shows up frequently in the\nstyle of UNIX hackers in particular is a tendency for some things which are normally all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning of sentences. It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation (the \"spelling\") and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an appropriate reflex because UNIX and C both distinguish cases and confusing them can lead to lossage). Another way of dealing with this is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of sentences. Finally, it should be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English. Partly this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP ((which uses deeply nested parentheses (like this) in its syntax) (a lot (see?))), but it has also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation. One area where hackish conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux is the marking of included material from earlier messages --- what would be called `block quotations' in ordinary English. From the usual typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra indent) there derived the notation of included text being indented by one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under UNIX and many other environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent. Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages this way, so people had to paste in copy manually. BSD `Mail(1)' was the first message agent to support inclusion, and early USENETters emulated its style. But the TAB character tended to push included text too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions), leading to ugly wraparounds. After a brief period of confusion (during which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading \">\" or \"> \" became standard, perhaps because the character suggests movement to the right (alternatively, it may derve from the \">\" that some V7 UNIX mailers use to quote leading instances of \"From\" in text). Inclusions within inclusions keep their > leaders, so the `nesting level' of a quotation is visuallly apparent. Now, it was rapidly observed that the practice of including text helped solve what had been a major nuisance on USENET: the fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order. Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even consist entirely of, \"No, that's wrong\", or \"I agree\" or the like. It was hard to see who was responding to what. Consequently, in about 1984, new news posting software was created with a facility to automatically include the text of a previous article, marked with \"> \" or whatever the poster chose. The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines. The result has been that, now, careless posters post articles containing the *entire* text of a preceding article, *followed* only by \"No, that's wrong\" or \"I agree\". Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease, and there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader skip over included text if desired. Today, some posting software rejects articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning with \">\", but this too has led to undesirable workarounds such as the deliberate inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't quoted and thus pull the message below the rejection threshold. Because the default mailers supplied with UNIX and other operating systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still alive; however, >-inclusion is now clearly the preferred form in both netnews and mail. Practice is still evolving. One variant style reported uses the citation character `|' in place of `>' for extended quotations where original variations in indentation are being retained. One also sees different styles of quoting a number of authors in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses information) uses a leader of \"> \" for everyone, another (the most common) is \"> > > > \", \"> > > \", etc. (or \">>>> \", \">>> \", etc., depending on line length and nesting depth) reflecting the original order of messages, and yet another is to use a different citation leader for each author, say \"> \", \": \", \"| \", \"} \" (preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of messages is still apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors' names). Yet *another* style is to use each poster's initials (or login name) as a citation leader for that poster. Occasionally one sees a \"# \" leader used for quotations from *authoritative* sources such as standards documents; the intended connotation is to the root prompt. International Style =================== Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad. Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of English slang (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File versions!) the local variations are interesting, and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers. There are some references to `Commonwealth English'. These are intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, India, etc., though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage). There is also an entry on COMMONWEALTH HACKISH, which see. Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia are reported to often use a mixture of English and their native languages for technical conversation. Occasionally they develop idioms in their English usage which are influenced by their native-language styles. Some of these are reported here. A note or two on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they are parallel with and comprehensible to English-speakers. UNIX Conventions ================ References such as `malloc(3)' and `patch(1)' are to UNIX facilities (some of which, such as patch(1), are actually freeware distributed over USENET). The UNIX manuals use `foo(n)' to refer to item foo in section (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls, n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where present) is system administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7 have changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to from any of the entries. Pronunciation Guide =================== Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listing for all entries that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English nor obvious compounds of same. Slashes bracket a phonetic pronunciation to be interpreted using the following conventions: 1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an apostrophe or back-apostrophe follows each accented syllable (the back apostrophe marks a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables). 2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English. The letter \"g\" is always hard (as in \"got\" rather than \"giant\"); \"ch\" is soft (\"church\" rather than \"chemist\"). The letter \"j\" is the sound that occurs twice in \"judge\". The letter \"s\" is always as in \"pass\", never a z sound (but it is sometimes doubled at the end of syllables to emphasize this). The digraph `kh' is the guttural of `loch' or `l'chaim'. 3. Vowels are represented as follows: a back, that ah father, palm ar far, mark aw flaw, caught ay bake, rain e less, men ee easy, ski eir their, software i trip, hit ie life, sky o cot, top oh flow, sew oo loot, through or more, door ow out, how oy boy, coin uh but, some u put, foot y yet yoo few [y]oo oo with optional fronting as in `news' (noos or nyoos) An at-sign is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded vowels (the one that is often written with an upside-down `e'). The schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n; that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and /kuhl'r/, not /kit'@n/ and /kuhl'@r/. Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream dictionaries). The case-blindness is a feature, not a bug. The Jargon Lexicon ****************** {= [^A-Za-z] (see\n) =} <@-party> /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet address] n. (also `@-sign party' /at'sien par`tee/) Semi-closed parties thrown at SF conventions (esp. the annual Worldcon) for hackers; one must have a\nto get in, or at least be in company with someone who does.

Ada Lovelace (the niece of the poet Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while cooperating with Babbage on the design of his mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would certainly blanch at the use her name has been latterly put to; the kindest thing that has been said about it it is that there is probably a good small language screaming to get out from inside its vast,\nbulk.\n/ad'vent/ n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first implemented on the\nby Will Crowther as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods. Now bet\noperating system only permitted 6-letter filenames. This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style now expected in text adventure games and popularized several tag lines that have become fixtures of hacker-speak. \"A huge green fierce snake bars the way!\" \"I see no X here.\" (for X some noun). \"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.\" \"You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.\" The \"magic words\"\nand\nalso derive from this game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth/Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance.\npl.n.

Soundalike slang: Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting. It is considered particularly\nif the phrase is bent so as to include some other slang word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine `Dr. Dobb's Journal' is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr. Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'. Terms of this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers: Boston Herald American => Horrid (or Harried) American Boston Globe => Boston Glob San Francisco Chronicle => the Crocknicle New York Times => New York Slime However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples include: Prime Time => Slime Time Data General => Dirty Genitals Government Property - Do Not Duplicate (seen on keys) => Government Duplicity - Do Not Propagate for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins Margaret Jacks Hall => Marginal Hacks Hall This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque whereas hacker rhyming slang is intentionally transparent. The -P convention: turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from the LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate (a Boolean-valued function). The question should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't. (See T and NIL.) At dinnertime: Q: \"Foodp?\" A: \"Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.\" or \"T!\" Q: \"State-of-the-world-P?\" A: (Straight) \"I'm about to go home.\" A: (Humorous) \"Yes, the world has a state.\" On the phone to Florida: Q: \"State-p Florida?\" A: \"Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?\" [One of the best of these is a Gosperism (i.e., due to Bill Gosper). When we were at a Chinese restaurant, he wanted to know whether someone would like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup. His inquiry was: \"Split-p soup?\" --GLS] Overgeneralization: A very conspicuous feature of hackerspeak is the frequency with which names of program tools, command language primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them. Thus, (to cite one of the best-known examples) UNIX hackers often\nfor things rather than *searching* for them. Many of the lexicon entries are generalizations of exactly this kind. Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well. Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform cases (or vice versa). For example, because porous => porosity generous => generosity hackers happily generalize: mysterious => mysteriosity ferrous => ferrocity obvious => obviosity dubious => dubiosity Also, note that all nouns can be verbed. e.g.: \"All nouns can be verbed\", \"I'll mouse it up\", \"Hang on while I clipboard it over\", \"I'm grepping the files\". English as a whole is already heading in this direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are simply a bit ahead of the curve. Similarly, all verbs can be nouned. Thus: win => winnitude, winnage disgust => disgustitude hack => hackification Finally, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural forms. Anything ending in x may form plurals in -xen (see\nand\nin the main text). Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this way; ex. `soxen' for a bunch of socks. Other funny plurals are `frobbotzim' for the plural of\n(see main text) and `Unices' and `Tenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Tenexes'; see\n,\nin main text). But note that `Unixen' and `Tenexen' are *never* used; it has been suggested that this is because -ix and -ex are latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural. The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is generalization of an inflectional rule which (in English) is either an import or a fossil (such as Hebrew plural in `-im', or the Anglo-Saxon plural in `en') to cases where it isn't normally considered to apply. This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware of what they are doing when they distort the language. It is grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness. Spoken inarticulations: Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where their referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on a comm link or in email. Another expression sometimes heard is \"Complain!\", meaning \"I have a complaint!\" Of the five listed constructions, verb doubling, peculiar noun formations, and (especially!) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but rhyming slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large universities, and the P convention is found only where LISPers flourish. Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood as members of sets of comparatives. This is especially true of the adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality of code. Here is an approximately correct spectrum: MONSTROSITY BRAIN-DAMAGE SCREW BUG LOSE MISFEATURE CROCK KLUGE HACK WIN FEATURE ELEGANCE PERFECTION The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never actually attained. Coinages for describing\nseem to call forth the very finest in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that \"\nhave more words for equipment failures than Inuit have for snow\", or than Yiddish has for obnoxious people. Hacker Speech Style =================== Features extremely precise diction, careful word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use of contractions or `street slang'. Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued --- but an underlying seriousness and intelligence is essential. One should use just enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as `in the culture'; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude are considered tacky and the mark of a loser. This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical fields. Unlike the jargon construction methods, it is fairly constant throughout hackerdom. It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions --- or, at least, the people they're talking to are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they've done so much coding that distinguishes between if (going) { and if (!going) { that when they parse the question \"Aren't you going?\" it seems to be asking the opposite question from \"Are you going?\", and so merits an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part weren't there (in some other languages, including Chinese and Japanese, the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't arise). Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French `si' or German `doch' with which one could unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question. For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use a double negative even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows it. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an affirmative knowing it will be mis-parsed as a negative tends to disturb them. Hacker Writing Style ==================== Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parens, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if \"Jim is going\" is a phrase, and so is \"Bill runs\" and \"Spock groks\", then hackers generally prefer to write: \"Jim is going\", \"Bill runs\", and \"Spock groks\". This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes) but it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussing programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code extra characters can be a real pain in the neck. For example: First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -,\" then... is different from First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -\", then... from a computer's point of view. While the first is correct according to the stylebooks and would probably be parsed correctly by the a human recipient, the second is unambiguous. The Jargon File follows hackish usage consistently throughout. Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great Britain, though the older style (which became established for typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there. Hart's Rules and the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors call it `new' or `logical' style quoting. Another hacker quirk about quoting style is a tendency to distinguish between `marking' quotes and \"speech\" quotes; that is, to use British-style single quotes for emphasis and reserve double quotes for actual reports of speach or text included from elsewhere. Interestingly, some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes thoroughly enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with USENET -- ESR]. One further permutation that is definitely *not* standard is a hackish tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes in pairs; that is, 'like this'. This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some programming languages. There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or lose information they can be discarded without a second thought. It is notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example, in vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even when constructed to appear slangy and loose. There is another respect in which hackish usage often parallels British usage; it tends to choose British spellings whenever these seem more phonetically consistent than the American ones. For example, a hacker is likely to insist on (British-style) `signalling' rather than American-standard `signaling' on the grounds that the latter ought to be pronounced /sig'nay'ling/ rather than /sig'n@-ling/. Similarly, `travelling' is preferred to `traveling'. Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available. One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and this becomes such a synesthetic reflex that a person who goes to caps-lock while in\n(see main text) may be asked to \"stop shouting, please, you're hurting my ears!\". Also, it is common to use bracketing with asterisks to signify emphasis, as in \"What the *hell*?\" (mote that this interferes with the common use of asterisk suffix is a footnote mark). An alternative form uses paired slash and backslash: \"What the \\hell/?\". The latter is never used in text documents, as many formatters treat backslash as an\nand may do inappropriate things with the following text. Also note that there is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this*, (which emphasizes the phrase as a whole) and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a very young child or mentallly impaired person). In a formula, `*' signifies multiplication, and two asterisks in a row are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN). Thus, one might write `2 ** 8 = 256'. Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead `2 ^ 8 = 256'. This goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII `up-arrow' that later became caret; this was picked up by Kemeny & Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the bc(1) and dc(1) UNIX tools that have probably done most to reinforce the convention on USENET. The notation is mildly confusing to C programmers, because `^' means logical\nin C. Despite this, it was favored 3--1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of USENET. It is used consistently in this text. Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN). This is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long. The tilde (`~') is commonly used in its mathematical sense of `approximately'; that is, `~50' means \"about fifty\". Underlining is often suggested by substituting underscores for spaces and prepending and appending one underscore to the underlined phrase. Example: \"It is often alleged that Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ in response to Robert Heinlein's earlier _Starship_Troopers_\" On USENET and in the\nworld common C boolean operators (`|, !, ==, !=, >, <') are often combined with English by analogy with mainstream usage of &. The Pascal not-equals, `<>', is also recognized. The use of prefix `!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common; thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'. Another habit is that of using enclosure to genericize a term; this derives from conventions used in\n. Uses like the following are common: So this\nwalks into a bar one day, and... In flat-ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see <> used in exactly this way to bracket words which themselves have entries in the File. This isn't done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that the reader needs specially to be aware that the term has a jargon meaning and might wish to refer to its entry. One quirk that shows up frequently in the\nstyle of UNIX hackers in particular is a tendency for some things which are normally all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning of sentences. It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation (the \"spelling\") and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an appropriate reflex because UNIX and C both distinguish cases and confusing them can lead to lossage). Another way of dealing with this is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of sentences. Finally, it should be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English. Partly this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP ((which uses deeply nested parentheses (like this) in its syntax) (a lot (see?))), but it has also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation. International Style =================== Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad. Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of English slang (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File versions!) the local variations are interesting, and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers. There are some references to `Commonwealth English'. These are intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, India, etc., though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage).

UNIX Conventions ================ References such as `malloc(3)' and `patch(1)' are to UNIX facilities (some of which, such as patch(1), are actually freeware distributed over USENET). The UNIX manuals use `foo(n)' to refer to item foo in section (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls, n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where present) is system administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7 have changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to from any of the entries. Pronunciation Guide =================== Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listing for all entries that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English nor obvious compounds of same. Slashes bracket a phonetic pronunciation to be interpreted using the following conventions: 1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an apostrophe or back-apostrophe follows each accented syllable (the back apostrophe marks a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables). 2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English. The letter \"g\" is always hard (as in \"got\" rather than \"giant\"); \"ch\" is soft (\"church\" rather than \"chemist\"). The letter \"j\" is the sound that occurs twice in \"judge\". The letter \"s\" is always as in \"pass\", never a z sound (but it is sometimes doubled at the end of syllables to emphasize this). The digraph `kh' is the guttural of `loch' or `l'chaim'. 3. Vowels are represented as follows: a back, that ah father, palm ar far, mark aw flaw, caught ay bake, rain e less, men ee easy, ski eir their, software i trip, hit ie life, sky o cot, top oh flow, sew oo loot, through or more, door ow out, how oy boy, coin uh but, some u put, foot y yet yoo few [y]oo oo with optional fronting as in `news' (noos or nyoos) An at-sign is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded vowels (the one that is often written with an upside-down `e'). The schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n; that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and /kuhl'r/, not /kit'@n/ and /kuhl'@r/. Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream dictionaries). The case-blindness is a feature, not a bug. The Jargon Lexicon ****************** {= [^A-Za-z] (see\n) =} <@-party> /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet address] n.

Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth/Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance.\npl.n.

Soundalike slang: Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting. It is considered particularly\nif the phrase is bent so as to include some other slang word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine `Dr. Dobb's Journal' is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr. Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'. Terms of this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers: Boston Herald American => Horrid (or Harried) American Boston Globe => Boston Glob San Francisco Chronicle => the Crocknicle New York Times => New York Slime However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples include: Prime Time => Slime Time Data General => Dirty Genitals Government Property - Do Not Duplicate (seen on keys) => Government Duplicity - Do Not Propagate for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins Margaret Jacks Hall => Marginal Hacks Hall This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque whereas hacker rhyming slang is intentionally transparent. The -P convention: turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from the LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate (a Boolean-valued function). The question should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't. (See T and NIL.) At dinnertime: Q: \"Foodp?\" A: \"Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.\" or \"T!\" Q: \"State-of-the-world-P?\" A: (Straight) \"I'm about to go home.\" A: (Humorous) \"Yes, the world has a state.\" On the phone to Florida: Q: \"State-p Florida?\" A: \"Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?\" [One of the best of these is a Gosperism (i.e., due to Bill Gosper). When we were at a Chinese restaurant, he wanted to know whether someone would like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup. His inquiry was: \"Split-p soup?\" --GLS] Overgeneralization: A very conspicuous feature of hackerspeak is the frequency with which names of program tools, command language primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them. Thus, (to cite one of the best-known examples) UNIX hackers often\nfor things rather than *searching* for them. Many of the lexicon entries are generalizations of exactly this kind. Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well. Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform cases (or vice versa). For example, because porous => porosity generous => generosity hackers happily generalize: mysterious => mysteriosity ferrous => ferrocity obvious => obviosity dubious => dubiosity Also, note that all nouns can be verbed. e.g.: \"All nouns can be verbed\", \"I'll mouse it up\", \"Hang on while I clipboard it over\", \"I'm grepping the files\". English as a whole is already heading in this direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are simply a bit ahead of the curve. Similarly, all verbs can be nouned. Thus: win => winnitude, winnage disgust => disgustitude hack => hackification Finally, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural forms. Anything ending in x may form plurals in -xen (see\nand\nin the main text). Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this way; ex. `soxen' for a bunch of socks. Other funny plurals are `frobbotzim' for the plural of\n(see main text) and `Unices' and `Tenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Tenexes'; see\n,\nin main text). But note that `Unixen' and `Tenexen' are *never* used; it has been suggested that this is because -ix and -ex are latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural. The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is generalization of an inflectional rule which (in English) is either an import or a fossil (such as Hebrew plural in `-im', or the Anglo-Saxon plural in `en') to cases where it isn't normally considered to apply. This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware of what they are doing when they distort the language. It is grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness. Spoken inarticulations: Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where their referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on a comm link or in email. Another expression sometimes heard is \"Complain!\", meaning \"I have a complaint!\" Of the five listed constructions, verb doubling, peculiar noun formations, and (especially!) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but rhyming slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large universities, and the P convention is found only where LISPers flourish. Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood as members of sets of comparatives. This is especially true of the adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality of code. Here is an approximately correct spectrum: MONSTROSITY BRAIN-DAMAGE SCREW BUG LOSE MISFEATURE CROCK KLUGE HACK WIN FEATURE ELEGANCE PERFECTION The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never actually attained. Coinages for describing\nseem to call forth the very finest in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that \"\nhave more words for equipment failures than Inuit have for snow\", or than Yiddish has for obnoxious people. Hacker Speech Style =================== Features extremely precise diction, careful word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use of contractions or `street slang'. Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued --- but an underlying seriousness and intelligence is essential. One should use just enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as `in the culture'; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude are considered tacky and the mark of a loser. This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical fields. Unlike the jargon construction methods, it is fairly constant throughout hackerdom. It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions --- or, at least, the people they're talking to are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they've done so much coding that distinguishes between if (going) { and if (!going) { that when they parse the question \"Aren't you going?\" it seems to be asking the opposite question from \"Are you going?\", and so merits an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part weren't there (in some other languages, including Chinese and Japanese, the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't arise). Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French `si' or German `doch' with which one could unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question. For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use a double negative even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows it. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an affirmative knowing it will be mis-parsed as a negative tends to disturb them. Hacker Writing Style ==================== Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parens, much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if \"Jim is going\" is a phrase, and so is \"Bill runs\" and \"Spock groks\", then hackers generally prefer to write: \"Jim is going\", \"Bill runs\", and \"Spock groks\". This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes) but it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussing programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of code extra characters can be a real pain in the neck. For example: First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -,\" then... is different from First do \"foo -acrZ tempo | bar -\", then... from a computer's point of view. While the first is correct according to the stylebooks and would probably be parsed correctly by the a human recipient, the second is unambiguous. The Jargon File follows hackish usage consistently throughout. Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great Britain, though the older style (which became established for typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there. Hart's Rules and the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors call it `new' or `logical' style quoting. Another hacker quirk about quoting style is a tendency to distinguish between `marking' quotes and \"speech\" quotes; that is, to use British-style single quotes for emphasis and reserve double quotes for actual reports of speach or text included from elsewhere. Interestingly, some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes thoroughly enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with USENET -- ESR]. One further permutation that is definitely *not* standard is a hackish tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes in pairs; that is, 'like this'. This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some programming languages. There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or lose information they can be discarded without a second thought. It is notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example, in vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even when constructed to appear slangy and loose. There is another respect in which hackish usage often parallels British usage; it tends to choose British spellings whenever these seem more phonetically consistent than the American ones. For example, a hacker is likely to insist on (British-style) `signalling' rather than American-standard `signaling' on the grounds that the latter ought to be pronounced /sig'nay'ling/ rather than /sig'n@-ling/. Similarly, `travelling' is preferred to `traveling'. Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available. One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and this becomes such a synesthetic reflex that a person who goes to caps-lock while in\n(see main text) may be asked to \"stop shouting, please, you're hurting my ears!\". Also, it is common to use bracketing with asterisks to signify emphasis, as in \"What the *hell*?\" (mote that this interferes with the common use of asterisk suffix is a footnote mark). An alternative form uses paired slash and backslash: \"What the \\hell/?\". The latter is never used in text documents, as many formatters treat backslash as an\nand may do inappropriate things with the following text. Also note that there is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this*, (which emphasizes the phrase as a whole) and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a very young child or mentallly impaired person). In a formula, `*' signifies multiplication, and two asterisks in a row are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN). Thus, one might write `2 ** 8 = 256'. Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead `2 ^ 8 = 256'. This goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII `up-arrow' that later became caret; this was picked up by Kemeny & Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the bc(1) and dc(1) UNIX tools that have probably done most to reinforce the convention on USENET. The notation is mildly confusing to C programmers, because `^' means logical\nin C. Despite this, it was favored 3--1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of USENET. It is used consistently in this text. Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN). This is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long. The tilde (`~') is commonly used in its mathematical sense of `approximately'; that is, `~50' means \"about fifty\". Underlining is often suggested by substituting underscores for spaces and prepending and appending one underscore to the underlined phrase. Example: \"It is often alleged that Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ in response to Robert Heinlein's earlier _Starship_Troopers_\" On USENET and in the\nworld common C boolean operators (`|, !, ==, !=, >, <') are often combined with English by analogy with mainstream usage of &. The Pascal not-equals, `<>', is also recognized. The use of prefix `!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common; thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'. Another habit is that of using enclosure to genericize a term; this derives from conventions used in\n. Uses like the following are common: So this\nwalks into a bar one day, and... In flat-ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see <> used in exactly this way to bracket words which themselves have entries in the File. This isn't done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that the reader needs specially to be aware that the term has a jargon meaning and might wish to refer to its entry. One quirk that shows up frequently in the\nstyle of UNIX hackers in particular is a tendency for some things which are normally all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning of sentences. It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation (the \"spelling\") and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an appropriate reflex because UNIX and C both distinguish cases and confusing them can lead to lossage). Another way of dealing with this is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of sentences. Finally, it should be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English. Partly this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP ((which uses deeply nested parentheses (like this) in its syntax) (a lot (see?))), but it has also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation. One area where hackish conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux is the marking of included material from earlier messages --- what would be called `block quotations' in ordinary English. From the usual typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra indent) there derived the notation of included text being indented by one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under UNIX and many other environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent. Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages, this way so people had to paste in copy manually. BSD `Mail(1)' was the first message agent to support inclusion, and early USENETters emulated its style. But the TAB character tended to push included text too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions), leading to ugly wraparounds. After a brief period of confusion (during which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading \">\" or \"> \" became standard, perhaps because the character suggests movement to the right (alternatively, it may derve from the \">\" that some V7 UNIX mailers use to quote leading instances of \"From\" in text). Inclusions within inclusions keep their > leaders, so the `nesting level' of a quotation is visuallly apparent. Now, it was rapidly observed that the practice of including text helped solve what had been a major nuisance on USENET: the fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order. Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even consist entirely of, \"No, that's wrong\", or \"I agree\" or the like. It was hard to see who was responding to what. Consequently, in about 1984, new news posting software was created with a facility to automatically include the text of a previous article, marked with \"> \" or whatever the poster chose. The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines. The result has been that, now, careless posters post articles containing the *entire* text of a preceding article, *followed* only by \"No, that's wrong\" or \"I agree\". Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease, and there soon appeared newsreaders software designed to let the reader skip over included text if desired. Today, some posting software rejects articles containing too many lines beginning with \">\", but this too has led to undesirable workarounds (in particular, the deliberate use of nonstandard quote characters, which are visually confusing). Because the default mailers supplied with UNIX and other operating systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still alive; however, >-inclusion is now clearly the preferred form in both netnews and mail. However, practice is still evolving. One variant style reported uses the leader \"| \" in place of \"> \" for extended quotations where original variations in indentation are being retained. One also sees different styles of quoting a number of authors in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses information) is \"> \" for everyone, another (the most common) is \"> > > > \", \"> > > \", etc. (or \">>>> \", \">>> \", etc., depending on line length and nesting depth) reflecting the original order of messages, and yet another is to use a different character for each author, say \"> \", \": \", \"| \", \"} \" (preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of messages is still apparent). Occasionally one sees a \"# \" leader used for quotations from *authoritative* sources such as standards documents; the intended connotation is to the root prompt. International Style =================== Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad. Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of English slang (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File versions!) the local variations are interesting, and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers. There are some references to `Commonwealth English'. These are intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia, India, etc., though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage). There is also an entry on COMMONWEALTH HACKISH, which see. Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia are reported to often use a mixture of English and their native languages for technical conversation. Occasionally they develop idioms in their English usage which are influenced by their native-language styles. Some of these are reported here. A note or two on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they are parallel with and comprehensible to English-speakers. UNIX Conventions ================ References such as `malloc(3)' and `patch(1)' are to UNIX facilities (some of which, such as patch(1), are actually freeware distributed over USENET). The UNIX manuals use `foo(n)' to refer to item foo in section (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls, n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where present) is system administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7 have changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to from any of the entries. Pronunciation Guide =================== Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listing for all entries that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English nor obvious compounds of same. Slashes bracket a phonetic pronunciation to be interpreted using the following conventions: 1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an apostrophe or back-apostrophe follows each accented syllable (the back apostrophe marks a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables). 2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English. The letter \"g\" is always hard (as in \"got\" rather than \"giant\"); \"ch\" is soft (\"church\" rather than \"chemist\"). The letter \"j\" is the sound that occurs twice in \"judge\". The letter \"s\" is always as in \"pass\", never a z sound (but it is sometimes doubled at the end of syllables to emphasize this). The digraph `kh' is the guttural of `loch' or `l'chaim'. 3. Vowels are represented as follows: a back, that ah father, palm ar far, mark aw flaw, caught ay bake, rain e less, men ee easy, ski eir their, software i trip, hit ie life, sky o cot, top oh flow, sew oo loot, through or more, door ow out, how oy boy, coin uh but, some u put, foot y yet yoo few [y]oo oo with optional fronting as in `news' (noos or nyoos) An at-sign is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded vowels (the one that is often written with an upside-down `e'). The schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n; that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and /kuhl'r/, not /kit'@n/ and /kuhl'@r/. Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream dictionaries). The case-blindness is a feature, not a bug. The Jargon Lexicon ****************** {= [^A-Za-z] (see\n) =} <@-party> /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet address] n.

Mathewson Ten Speed Press \u00a9 Copyright 1980 J.A. Diaz Publications Out of print\nChapter 1\nAN OVERVIEW ALCOHOL FUEL\nThere is nothing new in the use of alcohol as a motor fuel. In 1872, when Nikolaus Otto invented the internal combustion engine, gasoline was not available. Ethyl alcohol at 180-190 proof was the specified fuel. The model \"T\" Ford was designed to run on the available crude gasolines, alcohol, or any combination of the two. Alcohols in general and ethanol, in particular, make excellent motor fuels. The reason alcohol fuel has not been fully exploited is that, up until now, gasoline has been cheap, available, and easy to produce. However, crude oil is getting scarce, and the historic price differential between alcohol and gasoline is getting narrower. Currently there is a big push to find and develop alternative sources of energy so that dwindling reserves of crude oil and other fossil fuels may be conserved. As Edward Teller, one of this country's leading physicists points out: \"No single prescription exists for a solution to the energy problem. Energy conservation is not enough. Petroleum is not enough. Coal is not enough. Nuclear energy is not enough. Solar and geothermal energy are not enough. New ideas and developments will not be enough by themselves. Only the proper combination of all of these will suffice.\" Alcohol fuel can be an important part of the solution, but it is by no means a panacea. If all of the available agricultural surplus were converted to ethanol, alcohol would supply less than 5% of our motor fuel needs. Add the possibility of converting cellulose residues to ethanol and general biomass to methanol, and the most optimistic total falls short of 10% of our present needs! However, this is a very important 5 or 10% because it can be renewed each year, and each gallon of alcohol produced will save a gallon of oil.\nUSES OF ALCOHOL FUEL\nOne very important fact about alcohol fuel should be stressed. Alcohol is an excellent alternative motor fuel for gasoline engines. It is not a suitable alternative for home heating or for essentially stationary power requirements. The production of alcohol consumes energy. Exactly how much depends on the feedstock (raw material) and the efficiency of the distillation process. In a small operation, it would not be uncommon to expend 30-40,000 Btu per gallon of ethanol. It would be more sensible, in a home heating situation, to use whatever fuel you would use to run the still directly rather than using it to produce alcohol. The real advantage of alcohol is that it can be burned in the millions of existing vehicles with little or no modification. Alcohol fuel should only be considered for the jobs it can do best.\nOTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS\nThis book is about the small scale production of ethanol for use as a motor fuel. However, before becoming committed to ethanol, there are other alternatives that should be considered. The first that comes to mind is methanol, or \"wood\" alcohol. Like ethanol, methanol is a viable substitute for gasoline, and it can be produced from a wide variety of renewable biological resources. Methanol, however, is not as easy to produce on a small scale. The simplest and oldest method of producing methanol is by the destructive distillation (pyrolysis) of wood. The process is nothing more than heating the wood residues in a \"dry\" distillation apparatus and collecting the methanol at the other end. As such, the process requires relatively simple equipment and should be suitable for small scale production. The problem, then, is the fact that along with the methanol a considerable amount of impurities are produced that include acetone, acetic acid, and a number of other substances. These by-products are difficult and expensive to remove, and, if left in the methanol, they will quickly corrode an engine. Simply put, the small scale production of methanol by destructive distillation requires a large enough plant to justify the equipment and energy necessary to remove the impurities. If you happen to have a large source of suitable hardwood and are prepared to make the necessary capital investment, methanol production by this method might be considered. Other processes for producing methanol from renewable resources, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, or conversion of cellulose and biomass, also exist. Again, the problem is that these methods are only feasible on a very large scale. Methane gas has also been considered as a motor fuel. Methane is generated, for example, by the action of bacteria on manure. The problem here is that any methane production facility must be large enough to justify the equipment and energy required to compress the gas for storage. Also, methane has a very low heat value (energy\ncontent per unit of weight) and engine conversion is necessary. Methane is better suited to stationary power requirements than for use as a motor fuel. Still, if you have a situation where a large amount of manure or other suitable biomass is available, methane generation should be considered. Natural gas, propane, and butane are also possible motor fuels. However, since all of them are basically petroleum related, they cannot be considered as renewable resources. Much research has been done to find better processes for separating water into hydrogen and oxygen in order to obtain the hydrogen for use as a fuel. To date no process has been developed that does not consume more energy than can be returned when the hydrogen is burned. Aside from alcohol and, perhaps, methane, there seems to be no other suitable alternative fuel that can be made from renewable resources and utilized in existing motor vehicles. Other means of powering vehicles, such as electricity, involve the development and production of completely new vehicles. What seems to be needed is a vehicle that can utilize a wide variety of fuels such as coal, wood, alcohol, gasoline, kerosene, corn cobs or whatever might be available--for instance, something similar, to the 1897 Stanley Steamer! But, in the meantime, ethanol is the best solution for a motor fuel from renewable resources that can be produced easily on a small scale.\nChapter 2\nBASIC FUEL THEORY CHEMICAL COMPOSITION\nAlcohol and gasoline, despite the fact that they are from different chemical classes, are remarkably similar. Gasoline is mostly a mixture of \"hydrocarbons\". Hydrocarbons are a group of chemical substances composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This is a very large chemical class containing many thousands of substances. Most of the fuels we use such as coal, gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, butane, propane, etc. are chiefly hydrocarbons. Referring to Figure 2-1, the simplest member of this group is methane which consists of a single carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Next comes ethane with two carbons and six hydrogens. Propane has three carbons and butane has four. The substances just named are gases under ordinary conditions. As we add more carbons to the hydrocarbon molecule, the chemicals formed become liquids: pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and so on. As we continue with even more complex molecules, the substances get progressively oilier, waxier and finally solid. Figure 2-1: CHEMICAL STRUCTURES\nAlcohols can be thought of as hydrocarbons in which one of the hydrogen atoms has been replaced by a \"hydroxyl group\" which consists of a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom. Thus methane becomes the simplest alcohol, methanol. Ethane becomes ethanol, propane becomes propanol and so on. Like hydrocarbons, there are many alcohols of ever increasing complexity.\nCOMBUSTION PROPERTIES\nOne of the most important properties of a fuel is the amount of energy obtained from it when it is burned. Referring to Figure 2-2, note that the hydrocarbon octane, which represents an \"ideal\" gasoline, contains no oxygen. In comparison, all of the alcohols contain an oxygen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl radical. When the alcohol is burned, the hydroxyl combines with a hydrogen atom to form a molecule of water. Thus, the oxygen contained in the alcohol contributes nothing to the fuel value. Figure 2-2: PHYSICAL PROPERTIES of ALCOHOL and GASOLINE\nThe relative atomic weights of the atoms involved are: hydrogen, 1 ; carbon, 12; and oxygen, 16. Since methyl alcohol has an atomic weight of 32, half the molecule cannot be \"burned\" and does not contribute any fuel value. As expected, methanol has less than half the heat value (expressed in Btu/lb) of gasoline. Ethanol, with 35% oxygen, is slightly better with 60% of the heat value of gasoline. If the heating value of methyl and ethyl alcohol were considered alone, they would appear to be poor choices as motor fuels. However, other redeeming qualities such as \"latent heat of vaporization\" and anti-knock values make alcohol fuels superior, in some ways, to gasoline. When a fuel is burned, a certain amount of air is required for complete combustion. When the quantity of air and the quantity of fuel are exactly balanced, the fuel air mixture is said to be \"stoichiometrically\" correct. Again referring to Figure 2-2, the stoichiometric ratio for gasoline is 15:1 or 15 pounds of air for each pound of gasoline. The figures for methyl and ethyl alcohol are 6.45:1 and 9:1 respectively. On a practical level, this means that to burn alcohol effectively, the fuel jets in the carburetor must be changed or adjusted to provide 2.3 pounds of methanol or 1.66 pounds of ethanol for each 15 pounds of air. Referring to the last entry in Figure 2-2, an interesting fact is that if we provide the correct stoichiometric mixture and then compare on the basis of the energy (in Btu's) contained in each cubic foot of the different fuel/air mixtures, the fuels are almost identical: gasoline 94.8 Btu per cubic foot; methanol 94.5 and ethanol 94.7! This means that gasoline and alcohol are about equal in what is called \"volumetric efficiency\" when burned in a correctly adjusted engine.\nVOLATILITY\nAnother important quality in a motor fuel is \"volatility\", or the ability to be vaporized. As previously noted, methyl alcohol contains less than half the heat value of gasoline and ethyl alcohol contains only about\n60%. The next higher alcohol, propyl alcohol with three carbon atoms, contains only 26.6% oxygen and thus about 74% of the heat value of gasoline. It is apparent that the more complex the alcohol, the closer its heat value comes to that of gasoline. Cetyl alcohol (Figure 2-1), for example, contains only about 6.6% oxygen and thus has about 90% of the heat value of gasoline. However, this alcohol is a solid wax! It can't be conveniently vaporized and mixed with air in an engine and so is useless as a motor fuel. Consequently, in considering alcohol fuels, a compromise must be made between heat value and volatility. Closely related to volatility is a quality called \"latent heat of vaporization\". When a liquid is at its boiling point, a certain amount of additional heat is needed to change the liquid to a gas. This additional heat is the latent heat of vaporization, expressed in Btu/lb in Figure 2-2. This effect is one of the principles behind refrigeration and the reason that water evaporating from your skin feels cool. Referring to Figure 2-2, gasoline has a latent heat of about 140 Btu/lb; methanol, 474 Btu/lb; and ethanol, 361 Btu/lb. In an engine, vaporization of the gasoline fuel/air mixture results in a temperature drop of about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Under similar conditions, the temperature drop for ethyl alcohol will be more than twice that of gasoline, and for methanol the drop will be over three times as great. These temperature drops result in a considerably greater \"mass density\" of the fuel entering the engine for alcohol as compared to gasoline. The result is a greatly increased efficiency for alcohol fuels. To visualize why, remember that at a given pressure, the amount of space a gas occupies is directly proportional to the temperature. For example, if one pound of a gas fits into a certain container at a given pressure and the temperature is cut in half, the container will now hold two pounds of the gas at the same pressure. In an engine, a stoichiometric mixture of methanol and air would be over three times colder than the same gasoline/air mixture. This means that there is now over three times (by weight) as much methanol in the cylinder. Now, even though methanol has only half the heat value of gasoline, the net gain in \"volumetric mass efficiency\" is over three times. So, for example, if the gasoline/air mixture in a given engine cylinder produces 100 Btu on each stroke, the same engine would produce 150 Btu per stroke with methanol. This power gain due to increased volumetric mass efficiency is the primary reason for the popularity of methyl alcohol as a racing fuel. With ethanol the effect isn't quite as dramatic, but the greater heat value partially offsets the lower latent heat. Overall, this power increase with alcohol fuels considerably mitigates the liability of low heat value. However, the increased cooling due to latent heat sometimes creates a problem in an engine converted to run on alcohol. Once vaporized, a certain amount of heat is required to keep the fuel from condensing back to the liquid state before it reaches the cylinder. To accomplish this, an engine is designed to provide this heat to the intake manifold.\nAlcohol, because of its greater latent heat, requires more heat than gasoline. This is one of the reasons that racing engines have short path manifolds and multiple carburetors. The shorter the distance the fuel must travel to the cylinder, the less chance of condensation and fuel distribution problems. On a practical level, most engines that have been converted to alcohol supply enough heat once they are warmed up. The main problem, as with high performance racing engines, is in starting a cold engine. This problem and the related fuel distribution problem will be discussed later in more detail.\nOCTANE RATINGS\nIf a certain fuel is burned in an engine in which the compression ratio can be varied and this ratio is gradually increased, a point will be reached when the fuel will detonate prematurely. This is because as a gas is compressed, heat is generated. If the explosive fuel/air mixture in an engine cylinder is compressed enough, the resulting heat will cause it to detonate. Since gasoline engines are designed so that the mixture is detonated by the spark plug at the beginning of the downward movement of the piston following the compression stroke, preignition or \"knock\" occurring during the compression stroke is undesirable. Indeed, severe knock can quickly overstress and destroy an engine. Since greater compression ratios in an engine mean increased power per stroke and greater efficiency, the ability of a fuel to resist premature detonation is a desirable quality. The \"octane\" numbers assigned to fuels are based on the pure hydrocarbon, octane, which is considered to be 100. At the other end of the scale, n-heptane is considered to have an octane rating of zero. The octane number of an unknown fuel is based on the percentage volume of a mixture of octane and n-heptane that matches it in preignition characteristics. In practice, these tests are conducted in a special test engine with variable compression. As noted in Figure 2-2, alcohols have a relatively high anti-knock or octane rating. As noted in Figure 2-3, alcohols have the ability to raise considerably the octane ratings of gasolines with which they are mixed. The effect is greatest on the poorer grades of gasoline. A 25% blend of ethanol and 40 octane gasoline will have a net increase of almost 30 points! This increase is one of the major advantages of \"gasohol\". The ability to increase octane rating means that: (1) a lower (therefore cheaper) grade of gasoline can be used to obtain a fuel with a certain octane rating; and (2) the use of traditional pollution producing anti-knock additives such as tetraethyl lead can be eliminated. The addition of about 10-15% ethanol to unleaded gasoline raises the octane rating enough so that it can be burned in high compression engines that previously could not use unleaded fuel. This use of ethanol is not new, of course, because ethanol was the original gasoline additive for increasing the octane rating. The term \"ethyl\" used to describe a high-test gasoline comes from ethyl alcohol, not tetraethyl lead!\nFigure 2-3: OCTANE INCREASE of ALCOHOL/GASOLINE BLENDS\nWATER INJECTION\nDuring World War II, the military made extensive use of water injection in high performance piston aircraft engines. Later, water injection was used by both civilian and military jet aircraft to provide extra thrust, principally on takeoff. Even today, water injection systems are available that can be installed in automobiles. The fact is that, within certain limits, these systems actually do increase power. Referring back to Figure 2-2, note that the latent heat of vaporization for gasoline is about 140 Btu/lb and for ethanol about 361 Btu/lb. Water has a latent heat of about 700 Btu/lb! Therefore, if a little water is injected into the carburetor in the form of an ultra-fine mist, the latent heat of the water will cool the charge and increase volumetric efficiency. In addition, when the charge is fired in the cylinder, the water will turn to high-pressure steam and provide additional power due to the pressure exerted by the steam. There are definite limits, however, to the amount of water that can be injected. Too much will cause excessive cooling and misfiring. The use of water injection with a gasoline fueled engine requires a separate metering and injection system because water and gasoline do not mix. Ethanol and water, however, do mix and the benefits of water injection can be had simply by adding the desired amount of water to the alcohol in the fuel tank.\nEXHAUST COMPOSITION\nIn theory, a hydrocarbon fuel when burned should produce only water and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) as exhaust gases. Carbon dioxide, of course, is completely non-poisonous being the gas we exhale when we breathe, the bubbles in carbonated beverages, and the gas plants turn back into oxygen during the photosynthesis cycle. However, such ideal combustion rarely occurs even in the most perfectly adjusted engine. What is actually produced is a large amount\nof poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) and other complex (and undesirable) emissions arising from impurities like sulfur and additives such as lead or phosphorus. Pure alcohol when burned under ideal conditions also produces, in theory, only carbon dioxide and water. Again, in practice, varying amounts of carbon monoxide are also produced. However, the amounts of carbon monoxide are usually much lower than with gasoline. In addition, alcohol fuel will contain no sulfur and no additives, and will not produce the related, undesirable combustion by-products. Pure alcohol fuels are extremely clean burning. Many studies have been made to determine whether alcohol/gasoline blends have any positive effect on emissions. In general, the data show that no great changes occur in blends of 20% or less. What happens is simply that in a 10% alcohol/gasoline blend, for example, about 10% of the gasoline emissions are replaced with alcohol emissions. Since alcohol does burn considerably cleaner, the amount of emission improvement is proportional to the amount of alcohol in the blend. Pure alcohol, as an anti-pollution fuel, would easily meet and exceed all emission requirements without the need for exotic and costly exhaust plumbing and catalytic converters. With alcohol blends, the chief advantage would be in the use of ethanol to replace lead and other undesirable compounds used to raise the octane number.\nENGINE PERFORMANCE - STRAIGHT ALCOHOL\nHaving looked at a few of the basic factors which influence the performance of fuels in an engine, let us now examine some actual engine tests. Figure 2-4 is a plot of 198 proof (99%) ethyl alcohol as compared to gasoline. \"Mean Effective Pressure\" in the graph is a direct indication of the power produced. The increased mean effective pressure (M.E.P.) of alcohol at all mixture ratios is the most noticeable difference between the two fuels. This increase in M.E.P. is due mainly to the greater volumetric efficiency that results from the high latent heat of vaporization of ethanol and the resulting greater mass density of the fuel/air mixture.\nFigure 2-4: ENGINE PERFORMANCE of ETHANOL vs GASOLINE Note that the M.E.P. of ethanol increases with mixtures having up to 40% excess fuel, whereas for gasoline, the maximum pressure is reached at 20% excess fuel. It would seem that to achieve maximum power from an alcohol-burning engine there would be a temptation to burn very rich mixtures. Fuel economy aside, it should be noted that the rich mixtures necessary to obtain maximum M.E.P. are accompanied by incomplete burning of the fuel and the resultant lowering of overall thermal efficiency. The lean limits for alcohol and gasoline, therefore, are about the same, and both fuels develop maximum thermal efficiency at about 15% excess air. With mixtures leaner than 15% both fuels loose thermal efficiency. Figure 2-5: HORSEPOWER COMPARISON of ETHANOL vs GASOLINE Figure 2-5 compares engine horsepower and air/fuel ratios for ethanol and gasoline in a six cylinder engine. The fuels in this case were 190\nproof (95%) ethanol and \"regular\" gasoline having a specific gravity of 0.745. In the tests, air was supplied to the intake manifold at a constant 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the carburetor needle valve was adjusted to provide the desired fuel/air ratios. The 2/3 and 1/3 loads were established by adjusting the throttle to give the same manifold pressure for both fuels. The smaller air/fuel ratios for ethanol in comparison with gasoline are evident. In this test with the air supplied at the same temperature for both fuels, the correct fuel/air mixture should produce about 2% more power from gasoline than ethanol. However, alcohol, with its greater latent heat, requires more manifold heat to remain completely vaporized. In another test where this additional heat was supplied, the correct alcohol/air mixture gave 8.6% more power with ethanol! Note also that the test depicted in Figure 2-5 was run with alcohol that contained 5% water. This benefit of water injection probably inflated the alcohol power results to a certain degree. However, the main point illustrated is that the two fuels are remarkably similar in performance in a correctly adjusted engine.\nENGINE PERFORMANCE - ALCOHOL BLENDS\nAlthough alcohol blends can be made from both ethanol and methanol, the primary interest seems to be in the direction of ethanol. Methanol and gasoline have a limited miscibility (mixability) while ethanol and gasoline can be mixed in all proportions. Economic reasons also dictate the interest in ethanol since it is more readily made from renewable resources. In addition, ethanol is a slightly superior motor fuel alternative under most conditions. Economics aside, a major advantage of blends is that up to a certain concentration (somewhere between 10 and 20%) they can be used with absolutely no modification of the engine. Many studies on how the various blends affect engine performance are contradictory. The recent \"Two Million Mile\" test in Nebraska, claims slightly higher fuel economy. Other tests claim a slight decrease. Some tests claim slightly better emissions, others claim no significant change. In relation to power output, the tests are equally ambiguous. However, when all the data is sifted, the overall conclusion is that in the areas of fuel economy, emissions, and performance there just isn't any real difference. Figure 2-3, as discussed under Octane Ratings, illustrates another major advantage of alcohol blends, namely the ability of alcohol to raise the anti-knock quality of the gasoline with which it is mixed. This means, of course, that lower, cheaper grades of gasoline can be used to obtain a fuel with the desired octane rating, and the use of pollution producing additives can be eliminated. This is a significant advantage from the economic standpoint because the manufacture of high-octane\nblending stocks is expensive. Also, as previously mentioned, it is possible to raise the octane rating of unleaded gasoline so that it can be used in engines that previously required high-test leaded gasoline. Alcohol blends do have one relatively minor drawback. The presence of even small amounts of water in the blend will cause a portion of the alcohol and gasoline to separate. At room temperature, less than 1% water can do the damage. As the temperature is lowered, amounts as small as 0.01% can cause separation. However, various substances such as benzene (benzol), acetone, and butyl alcohol can be added to the blend to increase water tolerance. Closed fuel systems, now in use, prevent moisture from forming inside the gas tank. Oil companies, given the proper incentive, could dry out their storage facilities and pipelines. Also, extensive use of alcohol blends over the past 50 years is ample evidence that the problem can be solved.\nChapter 3\nUTILIZATION OF ALCOHOL FUELS\nMETHODS OF UTILIZATION\nAlcohol fuels may be utilized in three basic ways: as a blend with gasoline; as a straight, unblended fuel; or as an alcohol/water mixture in an injection system. Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages.\nALCOHOL BLENDS\nAlcohol blends have the advantage that up to a 10, 20 or even 25% concentration of alcohol may be used without modification to the engine. The actual concentration that may be used varies with each engine type, but generally a four-cylinder engine will tolerate a stronger blend than a six or eight. Small single-cylinder engines, such as lawn mowers, can often be run on pure alcohol by merely adjusting the mixture control screw. Even with larger engines, slight modification such as adjusting the carburetor and, perhaps, advancing the timing a little may allow the use of blends in the 25-40% range. If you are producing your own blend, you have the advantage of being able to use the cheapest gasoline available and ending up with a good, high octane fuel.The disadvantage is that the alcohol you use must be perfectly dry. As will be discussed in the section on distillation, the highest concentration of alcohol that can be achieved by ordinary methods is 190 proof or 95%. In order to blend the alcohol with gasoline, the remaining 5% water must be removed. Several methods of removing this residual water will be discussed in Chapter 12, and one of them may be practical for you. However, drying the alcohol does require a separate manufacturing step and the expenditure of additional energy.\nPURE ALCOHOL\nThe advantages of burning relatively pure 80-95% alcohol are several. First of all, because the drying step is unnecessary, you should be able to produce the fuel for less than the cost of gasoline. Secondly, there will be little, if any performance penalty, and by leaving 5-15% or more water in the alcohol you also gain the benefits of water injection. The only disadvantage is the trouble and expense of modifying your engine(s) to burn alcohol and the lack of dual-fuel capability.The principal engine modification is the enlargement of the carburetor jet(s). If you are a reasonably competent mechanic, you should be able to do the job in a couple of hours at a very small cost.In addition to the carburetor jets, there is also the problem of cold starting. As mentioned earlier, alcohol has a higher latent heat of vaporization than gasoline and requires more manifold heat to keep the mixture in the vapor state. With most engines there will be no problem that can't be solved by installing a higher temperature thermostat since the engine runs fine as soon as it is warmed up. However, the engine will be difficult to start, especially in cold weather. The easiest solution to this problem is simply to start the engine on gasoline and, after it has warmed up, switch to alcohol. To accomplish this, merely install a small gasoline tank located, perhaps, under the hood and a selector valve mounted in some convenient location near the driver.It is my experience that it is also desirable to replace the automatic choke with a manual control. Also, switching back to gasoline prior to shutting down the engine will aid in restarting. A more complex solution to this problem would be to install a priming pump and manifold heater glow plugs similar to those found on diesel engines. Other alternatives are to preheat the fuel or squirt an easily volatized liquid such as pentane into the carburetor. The addition of about 8% pentane directly to the alcohol in the fuel tank will also solve starting problems in below zero weather.Another problem, also related to latent heat, is that of fuel distribution. Larger engines are more likely to encounter this problem than small ones. What happens is that there is insufficient heat to keep the fuel vaporized and some of it liquefies before it reaches the outer cylinders. This causes misfires and general poor performance. Simple solutions include insulating the intake manifold or installing a higher temperature thermostat. Heating the fuel before it enters the carburetor also helps, as does heating the intake air. The ultimate solution is, usually, to install multiple carburetors and a short-path manifold. However, you are likely to encounter this problem only in engines that are, by some design fault, prone to the same poor fuel distribution with gasoline.It must be stressed that, although most engines are easily converted to alcohol, each engine is different. Some people have been able to successfully run Volkswagens and Hondas on alcohol merely by adjusting the jets and playing with the timing a little. Others, especially those with older, ultra-high performance V-8 engines, have had to resort to more extensive modifications.\nAlcohol engine modification is a relatively \"rediscovered\" field. To the best of my knowledge, there is no comprehensive information on the modification of specific modern engines, and there are no manufacturers making conversion kits. (nb.This\u00a0was written in 1978)\nWith all the interest in alcohol fuels, however, this should change in the near future. At present, though, it seems that modifications must be made on an individual basis.For those with special engines, there is good news and bad. Turbocharged engines present no special conversion problems once the jets, etc. have been enlarged. Alcohol and turbochargers then work very well together. Fuel injected engines are another matter. To convert them can be a simple adjustment of the metering pump, or it can be virtually impossible. Very little data seems to be available in this area.DIESEL ENGINESContrary to the opinion of most \"experts\", diesel engines can be run on pure alcohol. The main problem is in the lubrication of the injectors. This is solved by the addition of 5-20% vegetable oil (or other suitable lubricant) to the alcohol. It is also possible to make a diesel \"gasohol\" with up to 80% alcohol. Since alcohol and oil will not mix when water is present, both the alcohol and the oil must be anhydrous. Different engines may also require adjustment of the metering pump for optimum performance. Diesel engines, especially turbocharged diesels, may also be run with an alcohol/water injection system as described later.\nENGINE MODIFICATION\nThe following are some specific guidelines to assist in the modification of a carburetor. Remember that there are many different types and makes of carburetors, and that a certain amount of experimentation will be necessary.First, of course, you will have to remove the carburetor from the engine, clean it, and disassemble it to a point where you can remove metering jet(s). This will involve removing the air horn from the float valve and disconnecting any linkage. Next you must locate the main jet (or jets on a multi-throat model). Most carburetors have removable jets. They are almost always brass and are threaded into place.With the jet removed, the next step is to measure its diameter. This is best done with a micrometer. You will want to enlarge the area of the jet about 27% for ethanol and 40% for methanol. Suppose, for example, your jet is 0.054\" in diameter. The formula for the area of a circle is 3.14 (pi) times the square of the radius. The radius is half the diameter, so we multiply 0.027 x 0.027 x 3.14 to get an area of 0.002289 square inches. Multiply this times 1.27 (for a 27% enlargement) and we get 0.00291 square inches. Working the formula in reverse we get a diameter of 0.06087 inches. This is close to a #53 drill which is slightly too small. Since it is easier to enlarge a hole than to make one smaller, a wise choice for the first trial in this instance would be a #53 drill. Carefully drill out the jet, reassemble the carburetor, and reinstall it on the vehicle. The vehicle should then be run on alcohol as a test. Start the engine and slowly enrich the mixture (using the idle screw adjustment) until the engine starts to stall. Then adjust the idle until the roughness evens out. Take the vehicle for a short test drive, and then pull the spark plugs. If the tips are white, the mixture is too lean, and the main jet will have to be further enlarged. If they are wet, the mixture is too rich, and you have made the jets too large. In addition, if the mixture is too lean, the engine will backfire and miss.It will also burn the valves if left in this condition. On the other hand, if the hole is too large, the mixture will be too rich and you will waste fuel. It may be necessary to make several trials before the perfect jet size is found for your particular engine. In addition to the main jet, some carburetors will also require a slight enlargement of the idle circuit jet. This is accomplished in the same manner as above except that a smaller percentage of enlargement will usually suffice. Note that this modification isn't always necessary.\nOften merely backing out the idle adjustment screw will be enough.If the engine still doesn't run properly, there are several other things you can try such as advancing the timing a little, disconnecting the vacuum advance line, and closing the spark plug gaps a little. If you want to go the whole route, you can increase the engine's compression by milling the head and installing high compression pistons because the alcohol's high anti-knock qualities will allow compression ratios to 10:1.\nFinally, if you have an engine where it is impossible to modify the carburetor, for one reason or another, (an excess of emission \"plumbing\", for example) you can usually replace your carburetor with an earlier model. Usually, the older the carburetor, the easier it is to convert. Also, it is possible to purchase adjustable jets for many carburetors, or your carburetor may already have such jets. Adjustable jets make it easier to change from alcohol to gasoline and vice versa should the need arise.\nALCOHOL INJECTION\nAlcohol injection is a third alternative for the utilization of alcohol fuel. It is similar to water injection except that alcohol or an alcohol water mixture is injected into the engine. Since the water/alcohol injection mixture ratio can be as low as 50/50%, first run product from a simple still can be used. This is a considerable saving because most of the energy used in alcohol production is expended in the distillation stage to obtain 95% alcohol. Another advantage is that engines with an injection system still retain complete dual fuel capability. Finally, alcohol injection can be used with fuel-injected, turbocharged, and even diesel engines.\nBASIC INJECTION SYSTEM\nThe alcohol/water mixture is contained in a separate tank and is fed, under a couple pounds pressure, to a misting nozzle located at the throat of the carburetor. The mixture is metered into the carburetor airstream where it mixes with the air and is taken into the engine. There are many ways of metering the alcohol/water mixture. For example, it can be done by mechanically linking a metering valve to the throttle. Other methods include using combinations of vacuum and/or manifold pressure. Whatever system is used, the metering system should work in parallel with the throttle. That is, the flow of alcohol/water mixture should increase as the load increases. Figure 3-2 diagrams a similar system for turbocharged engines. This is an extremely simple system. The alcohol/water tank is pressurized by bleed air from the compressor on the turbocharger. The mixture is metered into the turbocharger airstream by an orifice.\nThe size of the orifice is determined by individual engine requirement. The metering system operates with the turbocharger. As the boost increases, more pressure is supplied to the tank and, thus, more mixture to the engine.On a diesel tractor rated at 125 horsepower and consuming 8-1/2 gallons of fuel per hour, the injection system produced the same power with only six gallons of diesel fuel and two gallons of a 50% alcohol/water mixture. This is an overall saving of 6% in fuel consumption and a saving of almost 30% in diesel fuel. Other benefits include trouble-free, automatic operation, increase in available power, lowering of engine operating temperatures, and prolonged engine life.[\nChapter 4\nETHANOL PRODUCTION - GENERAL DISCUSSIONRAW MATERIALS\nEthyl alcohol may be made by the fermentation process from three basic types of raw materials, called \"feedstock\".The three basic types of feedstock are:\n(1 ) SACCHARINE (sugar containing) materials in which the carbohydrate (the actual substance from which the alcohol is made) is present in the form of simple, directly fermentable six and twelve carbon sugar molecules such as glucose, fructose, and maltose. Such materials include sugar cane, sugar beets, fruit (fresh or dried), citrus molasses, cane sorghum, whey and skim milk.\n(2) STARCHY MATERIALS that contain more complex carbohydrates such as starch and inulin that can be broken down into the simpler six and twelve carbon sugars by hydrolysis with acid or by the action of enzymes in a process called malting. Such materials include corn, grain sorghum, barley, wheat, potatoes, sweet potatoes, jerusalem artichokes, cacti, manioc, arrowroot, and so on.\n(3) CELLULOSE MATERIALS such as wood, wood waste, paper, straw, corn stalks, corn cobs, cotton, etc., which contain material that can be hydrolyzed with acid, enzymes or otherwise converted into fermentable sugars called glucose.\nMANUFACTURING STEPS\nCertain materials require less processing than others. Generally, small scale production is easiest (and most economical in terms of labor and energy consumption) from the saccharine materials. However, starchy materials usually produce the most alcohol on a weight/weight basis, and cellulose materials are the cheapest.Manufacturing alcohol from saccharine feedstocks generally requires:\n(1) extraction or crushing to make the sugars available to the yeast enzymes during fermentation:\n(2) dilution. which is only required with certain materials;\n(3) fermentation; and\nStarchy materials require the steps of:\n(1) milling to free the starchy material from, for example, grain kernels;\n(2) dilution;\n(3) cooking to dissolve and \"gelatinize\" the starch; and\n(4) conversion of the starch to fermentable sugars by malting, enzymes, or acid hydrolysis in addition to the steps of fermentation and distillation. Cellulose materials are similar to starchy materials in that they must be converted prior to fermentation.\nPROCESS DESIGN\nThere are a great many variables in the manufacture of ethanol. Even materials from the same basic group can require radically different processing. The following chapters cover the individual manufacturing steps for processing each of the three main groups of feedstock. In addition, Chapter 10 contains \"recipes\" and individual processing requirements for specific materials from each of the three groups.The reader is urged to study all of the information presented before attempting to choose a specific process for a material.\nChapter 5\nPROCESSING STEPS COMMON TO ALL MATERIALS\nDILUTION\nDilution is simply the addition of water to adjust the amount of sugar in the mash or (ultimately) the amount of alcohol in the beer. It is necessary because the yeast, used later in the fermentation process, can be killed by too great a concentration of alcohol. Also, during the mashing and conversion of starchy material, dilution is necessary to make the mash easier to stir and handle. The object of dilution is to end up with a beer as close to (but, not more than) 10% alcohol when fermentation is complete. The optimum dilution, then, is a compromise between the highest alcohol concentration and the point where the particular yeast strain being used will be killed.Optimum dilution requirements for each material are listed in Chapter 10. A rule of thumb for an unknown material, though, is that the final alcohol concentration will be about half the sugar content prior to fermentation. To determine the amount of fermentable sugar in a mash, it is best to have the material tested by a laboratory. If this is not possible, the sugar content can be estimated with a hydrometer. The use of hydrometers and tables for converting specific gravity readings to approximate sugar content are covered later in this chapter. It should be noted that any solution being tested with a hydrometer must be filtered to remove any undissolved solids. Otherwise the readings will be inaccurate. Sugar content of a solution can also be determined with the use of an optical instrument called a sugar refractometer. These devices, however, cost several hundred dollars.Since the use of a hydrometer to measure sugar content of a mash is, at best, an approximation, the amount of dilution can be \"fine tuned\" by measuring the alcohol content of the beer after fermentation. A hydrometer is used for this measurement also, but the readings are much more accurate. Naturally, if the alcohol content of the beer is less than the toleration level of the yeast you are using, the mash is overdiluted.\npH CONTROL\nThe pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution expressed on a scale of 1-14. Neutral is pH 7, pH 1-7 is acid, and pH 7-14 is alkaline. The pH is most conveniently measured with test papers that change color according to the pH of the solution being tested. These papers are available from swimming pool supply houses, garden shops, and laboratory supply companies.Control of pH during the mashing and fermentation process is important for two reasons: The growth of harmful bacteria is retarded by acid solutions, and yeast will grow only in an (slightly) acid solution.Most grain mashes have a naturally acid pH of between 5.4 and 5.6 after malting or conversion has been accomplished. Other materials, notably saccharine substances like molasses and fruit pressings, have a naturally alkaline pH and must be acidified prior to fermentation.The principal bacterial contaminants in a distillery are those that form lactic acid. Although the production of fuel alcohol is not concerned with the taste of the product, any lactic acid formed subtracts from the yield of alcohol. The production of lactic acid and other contaminants should therefore be avoided as much as possible. The development of these micro-organisms is severely repressed at pH values under 5.0. Above 5.0 their growth is rapid. The optimum pH range then is 4.8 to 5.0. Anything below about 4.1 to 4.4 is detrimental to other (desirable) processes taking place during the mashing and fermentation. Consequently, the pH should be checked during the cooking and conversion. If it is much above 5.0, it should be reduced by the addition of acid.The acid most commonly used is sulfuric, although any mineral acid is perfectly suitable. Hydrochloric (muriatic) acid, for example, is available from swimming pool suppliers. The acid should be added cautiously, the mash stirred, and the pH checked, because it is very important not to add too much. If you happen to add a little too much, the pH can be raised with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) solution or with ordinary lime. But after a certain point, this is useless and the mash must be scrapped.While adjustment during mashing is desirable, the proper pH during fermentation is absolutely essential. As soon as the pH in fermentation falls below about 4.11 the fermentation stops. If this occurs prior to complete conversion of the sugars, the yield will be low. On the other hand, yeast needs a slightly acid environment in order to grow. Consequently, the pH should be kept between 4.8 and 5.0 for optimum results.There are two ways of adjusting pH. The first, as discussed, is the addition of acid. The second, and probably the best, is the addition of the naturally acid residues left from a previous distillation. These residues are called \"stillage\", and adding them to the mash is called \"backslopping\". Backslopping is discussed in more detail in the next section.\nIt should be stressed that the pH should be checked periodically during the fermentation as well as before. Certain fermentations will produce substances that alter the pH during the fermentation. Once the pH goes beyond the optimum range, attempts to salvage the process by adding acid or caustic soda do more harm than good. So keep a close watch and adjust before the pH goes out of range.\nBACKSLOPPING\nBackslopping, or the addition of still residues from the previous batch, has several advantages. First (as discussed in the previous section) is the adjustment of the pH to control bacteria growth. Second, the stillage provides nutrients that are needed by the yeast for rapid growth. The third reason is that the stillage provides a \"buffering\" action.Grain mashes and starchy material generally provide enough nutrients for the growth of the yeast. Other materials, notably molasses and other saccharine materials, often do not. The addition of stillage can provide these nutrients where they are needed.The buffer capacity of the mash is important. When an acid and a base are mixed together, they react violently to produce a salt. Buffering can be thought of as a barrier between the acid and the base that allows only limited contact and thus moderates the reaction.\nGrain mashes are generally well buffered between pH 5.0 to 6.0, poorly buffered between 4.4 and 5.07 and well buffered between 3.5 and 4.4. The addition of stillage aids in buffering the mash between 4.4 and 5.0. This provides stability and generally higher yields than mashes without stillage.Different materials can tolerate differing amounts of backslopping. It is possible to have too much of a good thing, and too much backslopping can be detrimental. The limits for various materials are discussed in Chapter 10.\nCLEANLINESS\nThe cleaning of fermenting tubs, pipes, and the like is extremely important. If mash and fermentation residues are allowed to accumulate, bacterial contamination will be rampant and will greatly reduce alcohol yield.Cleaning of the mashing and fermentation apparatus is usually done with steam in commercial operations. However, in a small plant, a thorough washing with disinfectant is usually adequate. Any disinfecting cleaner can be used, but, in the interest of economy, it is best to buy formaldehyde solution from a chemical supply house. For use it should be diluted 20:1 or more. Be advised that formaldehyde is a horribly foul smelling chemical that is intensely irritating to the skin, nose and eyes. The fumes also should not be inhaled. An alternate to formaldehyde is ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) solution, but the same cautions apply.After disinfecting with formaldehyde or ammonia, the apparatus should be thoroughly washed out with clear water. It is best to clean equipment after every batch, but in some climates and at certain times of the year when the bacteria count is low, cleaning every second or third time might be all right. In any event, at the first sign of problems, a thorough cleaning is absolutely necessary.\nHYDROMETERS\nHydrometer\nHydrometers are little floats with calibrated stems used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid. The most familiar example is the device used to check battery charge or anti-freeze protection.\nSugar Content vs Specific Gravity\nHydrometers can be calibrated in a number of different scales, depending on their purpose. The most common calibration is for specific gravity. Water has a specific gravity of 1.000. Liquids lighter than water have specific gravities less than 1.000, and those heavier, greater than 1.000. The hydrometer can be used to measure the approximate dissolved solids in a mash or the concentration of alcohol before or after distillation. For measuring the solids dissolved in a mash the hydrometer is calibrated in degrees \"Balling\". One degree on this scale is equal to about 1% dissolved solids. Other hydrometers can be purchased to show alcohol content in proof or percent. To obtain accurate measurements, a set of hydrometers, each covering a small range, is better than one hydrometer covering a large range. Hydrometers can be purchased from any laboratory supply house. So that you do not have to purchase several sets, Figures 5-2 and 3 convert sugar and alcohol content to specific gravity.\nBecause liquids change density with changes in temperature, corrections must be made for readings taken at temperatures other than that for which the hydrometer is calibrated. More often than not, the temperature of the solution you are testing will not be the same as the hydrometer calibration. Figure 5-4 is a correction table for non-standard temperatures. Note that this table is very accurate for determining the correction for aqueous ethanol solutions and less accurate for sugar or dissolved solids concentration.An alternate method of determining sugar content is the use of a sugar refractometer. These instruments are available from laboratory supply houses, but are expensive. However, the readings are very accurate.\nSpecific gravity can also be determined by weighing exactly one liter of the liquid at the proper temperature. The weight in grams, divided by 1000 will be the specific gravity. Due to the difficulty of measuring exactly one liter of the solution being tested, the weighing method is usually not as accurate as the method using a hydrometer.\nChapter 6\nSTEPS SPECIFIC TO SACCHARINE MATERIALS\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nAs stated earlier, saccharine materials require the least processing of any of the ethanol feedstocks. Referring to Figure 4-1, it can be seen that molasses and other sugar-containing syrups need only to be diluted and pH adjusted prior to fermentation. Other materials, such as grapes and other fruits, need to be either crushed or extracted to make the sugar readily accessible to the yeast enzymes.\nIn addition to extraction, the requirements of pH control, dilution, backslopping, and cleanliness as discussed in Chapter 5 also apply.\nRecipes for specific materials are contained in Chapter 10.\nEXTRACTION\nPrior to fermentation, saccharine materials, such as fruits, beets, etc., are usually put through an extraction process. This means that the sugar-containing juice is separated from the rest of the material . This is usually done in a press like those used for crushing grapes or making cider. Extraction, per se, is not absolutely necessary. The materials can also be simply crushed to expose the juices for the fermentation process. However, with most distillation equipment, the solids will have to be removed prior to going into the still.There are certain problems and considerations associated with either extraction or crushing. Extraction in a press, at best, leaves an appreciable amount of fermentable material behind.\nTypically, only 75% of the sugars can be extracted from apples and about 80% from grapes. One technique that can be used with press extraction to increase the yield is to take the residue from the first pressing, soak it in a minimum amount of water to dissolve more of the sugar, and then press it again. However, this method creates additional dilution which lowers the alcohol content of the fermented mash (called \"beer\") requiring more energy and time in the distillation process.\nIf a fruit juice contains, for example, 10% sugar, the final alcohol concentration going to the still will be about 5%. Any water used to wash additional sugar from the residue will further dilute this final concentration. The lower the alcohol concentration, the more water must be removed from the alcohol during distillation. However, in many instances, the greater total amount of alcohol gained justifies the additional dilution.Crushing the material instead of extracting it in a press leaves all the sugar available for fermentation, although the material usually must be strained prior to distillation. Again, some of the valuable liquid will be retained in the residue and the only solution is to wash it with a little water. If you are using a simple pot still, such as described in this book, filtering the residue isn't absolutely necessary as long as the still pot is cleaned out after each run. In this case, the crushing method is superior.Certain materials such as sweet corn stalks, sugar cane, and the like, require heavy hydraulic presses to effectively extract the juice. The alternate process here is to shred the material and then heat it with as little water as possible to dissolve out the sugar. Note that to obtain complete recovery of the sugar, the process described must be repeated several times. Again, a point is reached where dilution offsets the amount of sugar released and some compromise must be made. Note also that two extractions of one gallon each will dissolve more sugar than a single two gallon extraction.\ned. note: There is a lot of information here, so be sure to read and re-read this book thoroughly, and gain a basic understanding of the following processes of preparing materials and fermentation.\u00a0 But, If you have specific questions, you may write to me and I will try to help you. But write to me via ETHANOL FOR FUEL, http://www.topica.com/lists/robertwarren\na new newsletter for those of you already on your way to fuel independence. Click on the above\u00a0link, and you can post and read messages from all my other customers who have purchased my still plans and are building their own still, and making their own alcohol.\nAlso, the stills described in this book are more difficult and expensive than the Charles 803. A good page to start to understand this still is found at Principals of Operation .\nChapter 7\nPROCESSING STEPS SPECIFIC TO STARCHY MATERIALS\nPREPARATION OF STARCHY MATERIALS\nStarchy materials fall into two main categories:\n(1) materials, such as grains, in which the starch is encased or protected by grain hulls; and\n(2) those materials, such as potatoes, where the starch is more readily available. Milling or grinding the material to expose the starch is necessary for the former group, but not the latter. Otherwise, all starchy materials require a certain amount of cooking and conversion of the starch to sugar prior to fermentation.There are two basic methods of conversion. The first uses malt or an extract of the enzymes contained in malt and the second uses dilute acid in a process called \"acid hydrolysis\".\nMILLING\nGrains and similar starchy materials must be milled to expose the starches to the cooking, conversion and fermentation processes. The ideal is to grind the material as fine as possible without producing an excessive amount of flour. This is because fine (flour) particles are difficult to remove if the material must be filtered prior to distillation. Again, if you are using a simple pot still, the material need not be filtered and the presence of fine flour particles is not objectionable.Large amounts of flour can also make the mash too viscous (thick) and hard to handle. This is only objectionable if it must be pumped from container to container or otherwise handled. If you are doing everything in the same pot, the viscousness can often be tolerated. Otherwise, premalting, as discussed later, will solve the problem.Almost any kind of grain-milling equipment can be used, or the grain can be milled by your local feed plant. Unfortunately, there is no alternate process, and if you are going to use grain as your feedstock, it will have to be milled.\nCOOKING\nCooking is necessary for all starchy materials. The object is first to dissolve all the water soluble starches and then, as much as possible, gelatinize them.In commercial operations, cooking is almost always done with steam, under pressure, and usually in a continuous process. Water boils at 212 deg Fahrenheit at sea level and at a lower temperature as altitude increases. By using pressure cooking equipment, higher temperatures and shorter cooking times can be obtained. At 150 pounds pressure, for example, grain starches can be cooked in six minutes or less. Large scale pressure cooking equipment is expensive and, in this manual, the cooking times for various materials will be given for the \"atmospheric\" process where temperatures are in the 208-212 deg range. Cooking times for different materials are listed under the individual feedstocks in Chapter 10.\nBecause a lot of energy is needed to boil the water used in the cooking process, it is best to cook with as little water as possible. Then, after cooking, additional water may be added to dilute the mash to optimum concentration for fermentation. If the additional water is added at a time when it is desirable to cool the mash, for example after cooking and prior to conversion, cooling time is saved. Most grains can be cooked with as little as 15-20 gallons of water per bushel. Note that when cooking with minimum water, special attention must be given to stirring the mash. Otherwise lumping and burning may occur.New methods of cooking are being developed that help to conserve energy. The most interesting is a method that combines milling and cooking into one operation without the use of water. The process uses heat generated by friction in the milling process to simultaneously cook the grain. It is all done in a specially designed grain mill.\nCONVERSION\nConversion is the process of converting starch to fermentable sugars. It can be accomplished either by the use of malt, extracts of the enzymes contained in malt, or by the treatment of the starch (or cellulose) with acid in a process called \"acid hydrolysis\". Each method is discussed separately.\nMALTING\nStarch can be converted to fermentable sugars by the action of enzymes in malt. When the seeds of any cereal grain are moistened and allowed to sprout, certain enzymes (amylases) are produced which have the ability to convert starch to a form of fermentable sugar called maltose. All cereal grains produce these enzymes to a greater or lesser degree. However, barley produces by far the most and is usually the most economical to use.You can either purchase dried, ground barley malt, or you can produce your own from the grain. However, undried or \"green\" malt, such as that you might produce yourself, will not keep unless dried. On a small scale, it is often better to use the commercial product.In converting starch to sugar, malt enzymes exert two forms of chemical activity: liquefaction and saccharification. The intensities of these two activities depend on the temperature of the mash. The liquefying power is greatest at about 158 deg Fahrenheit. It begins to weaken at 175 and ceases at about 200. The saccharifying (sugar making) power is strongest between 120-130 deg F. and is destroyed completely at 175 deg. Both of these actions are desirable. Therefore a compromise must be made. The conversion process is therefore usually begun after the cooked mash is allowed to cool to about 150 deg F. The material is held at this temperature for a certain length of time (depending on the material) and then allowed to cool to the optimum fermenting temperature.The average malting recipe calls for the use of between half to 1 pound of dried malt for each 10 pounds of grain. Again, specific recipes are covered later. The dried malt is usually mixed with warm water at a ratio of about 2.5 pounds per gallon to form a slurry. This slurry should be mixed about an hour ahead of time and added to the mash when it cools to the proper temperature.Because barley malt is expensive, usually more expensive than the material it is used to convert, it is best to use as little as possible. The minimum amount can be determined after several trial conversions. To do this, make a trial malting using the amounts listed in Chapter 10. Then take a little of the converted mash and filter it through a cheesecloth or some similar material. Place a little of the filtered liquid in a white dish and add several drops of a solution composed of 5 grams potassium iodide and 5 grams of iodine crystals in one quart of (distilled) water. Any blue color produced indicates the presence of unconverted starch. Naturally, if the test indicates no blue color, the next trial should be run with less malt and vice-versa. The test solution can be compounded by your local druggist or the chemicals can be purchased from any laboratory supply house.\nPREMALTING:\nDuring the cooking process, the starch in the grain is gelatinized. When the mash is cooled, it may become too thick to be stirred and handled effectively during the malting operation. The technique of premalting cures this problem by taking advantage of the liquefying properties of malt prior to the conversion. To premalt, simply add about 10% of the total malt weight to the mash prior to cooking. This causes sufficient liquefaction to facilitate handling the mash during subsequent operations. It also helps to prevent thermal destruction of the malt enzymes later on and so reduces the production of undesirable by-products. After cooking, the remaining 90% of the malt slurry is added, and the conversion is continued as usual.\nPREPARATION OF MALT\nThe following is a basic process for making malt, for those who prefer to prepare their own. Any grain can be used to make malt, but as stated before, barley is by far the best.However, if you are working with corn, for example, you can simply set aside about 20% of the grain, prepare a malt as described below, and use it in the same way you would use barley malt. The same is true of similar materials.Malt is simply sprouted grain. The basic requirements for sprouting are moisture, warmth, and darkness. Grain can be sprouted in anything from a five-gallon plastic pail to a 55-gallon drum. The container should either have small holes poked in the bottom or, with larger containers, a valve protected by a screen or mesh that will allow water to drain but retain the material being sprouted.Begin by soaking the grain until the kernels can be crushed between the fingers and the inside is soft. This takes about 8-12 hours for barley and considerably longer for corn. Then drain the water. Thereafter, sprinkle the grain several times a day with warm water. The object is to keep the grain moist but not wet. If too wet, the grain will rot. After a watering, the water will work its way down through the grain and out the holes (or valve) in the container. The sprouting will generate some heat. The optimum temperature for sprouting is about 80 deg F. but the most enzymes seem to be produced at about 60 deg F. When sprouting in large containers, be careful that the grain doesn't get too warm. If it does, it can be spread out on a concrete floor in a dark place and the sprouting continued. Small containers will not have the problem of too much heat.Sprouting will take about 4 days. The malt is ready when the sprout is about a half inch long.\nPrior to use, the malt will have to be crushed. This can be done in a mill or, on a small scale, a heavy duty garbage disposal can be adapted. It is also possible to use an ordinary blender or food processor.Fresh, undried malt is called \"green\" malt. it Must be used immediately or dried because it will rot if stored wet. It should be used in the same manner as dried malt, and it is not usually necessary to adjust the recipe to allow for the green malt's moisture content because the green malt is slightly more potent.\nENZYME CONVERSION\nThe enzymes contained in malt are available commercially from several manufacturers. The procedures for using them are very similar to malt conversion. In addition, the use of enzyme extracts is usually superior to malt.First of all, the enzyme extracts are usually cheaper. They are also specifically designed for the job at hand, and they generally produce more predictable results and higher yields.The three basic types of commercially available enzymes are alpha, beta, and gluco amylases. Alpha amylases randomly split the starch molecules to produce a type of sugar called dextrose. Beta amylases act similarly to produce maltose. Together, these two enzymes can convert about 85% of the starch to fermentable sugar. Gluco amylases can reduce the remaining starches, and the use of all three can achieve almost total conversion of the starch.The two principal manufacturers of enzymes suitable for starch conversion are Miles Laboratories and Nova Laboratories, as listed in the appendix. Enzymes are used in much the same manner as malt. However, because different enzymes require slightly different pH, times, and temperatures, it is best to follow the recommendations of the manufacturer. A typical recipe for the use of Miles Laboratories \"Taka-Therm\" and \"Diazyme L-100\" for the conversion of corn is included in Chapter 10.\nACID HYDROLYSIS\nStarch (and cellulose) may also be converted to fermentable sugars by the action of acid.This process is relatively simple, but it requires acid proof equipment, high temperatures, and the handling of acid. For these reasons, it is not really recommended for small scale production.Basically, dilute mineral acid (usually sulfuric) is added to the grain slurry prior to cooking at a concentration of 1-4% as calculated on a weight/weight basis. The mash is then cooked at a temperature of about 350 deg F.\nCooking and conversion of the starch take place simultaneously. The mash is then immediately neutralized with calcium hydroxide (lime), or some other base, and fermented in the usual manner.The high temperatures essential in this process are obtained by the use of pressure cooking. The steam pressure required is about 150 pounds per square inch. This, together with the necessity for acid proof equipment, make this process unsuitable for small scale use. However, it is an excellent process for large operations because cooking and fermentation times are short and the method is readily adaptable to continuous operation.\nMASH COOLING\nMalting is conducted at a temperature of about 145-150 deg F. As is discussed later, fermentation is commenced at an optimum temperature of 70-80 deg Fahrenheit. Between the two steps the mash must be cooled.One of the biggest problems affecting alcohol yield is bacterial contamination of the mash either before or during fermentation. The chief protection against this is the pH or acidity control of the mashing and fermentation operations. However, even with perfect pH control bacterial infections can set in. This happens mostly during the cooling stage between mashing and fermentation.If bacterial contamination becomes a problem, the only solution (other than the obvious need for cleanliness) is to shorten the cooling time as much as possible. The less time at the temperatures conducive to bacteria growth the better. Therefore, it might become necessary to make a cooling coil as illustrated in Chapter 13. The cooling coil is the best long term solution, but if the problem only occurs occasionally, as during the summer months, a plastic bag full of ice and suspended in the mash might do the trick. Just be sure the plastic bag doesn't leak and dilute your mash!\nChapter 8\nPROCESSING STEPS SPECIFIC TO CELLULOSE MATERIALS\nCELLULOSE CONVERSION\nCellulose feedstocks, which include a wide variety of material from corn stalks, wood, straw, and cotton, to old newspapers (paper) and trash, are potentially good sources of alcohol. If fully converted, for example, a ton of old newspapers would yield up to 70 gallons of alcohol. Cellulose materials are also extremely cheap and, often, free.Cellulose is converted by either enzymes or acid hydrolysis. Nova Laboratories produces special enzymes called \"Cellulast\" and \"Cellobiase 250L\" for conversion of cellulose to fermentable glucose. Other manufacturers make similar products. The acid process involves either strong acid and relatively low temperatures, or weak acid and high temperatures. The strong acid process has the problem that the glucose is destroyed almost as fast as it is formed unless the contact time with the acid is very brief. The weak process requires acid proof pressure cooking equipment as described earlier. Again, for the obvious reasons, these methods are not recommended on a small scale.The main problem with cellulose as an ethanol feedstock is getting at the cellulose itself. In a plant, cellulose is encased in a substance called \"lignin\" in much the same way that a steel reinforcing rod is encased in concrete. Lignin is the substance that gives wood its strength. To get at the cellulose, the lignin must be dissolved away. The paper industry uses substances like sulfur dioxide, calcium bisulfite, sodium sulfate, sodium sulfide, and sodium hydroxide (lye) to dissolve lignin. Concentrated mineral acid, mentioned earlier, also dissolves lignin. Unfortunately, as it is dissolving the lignin, the strong acid also converts and then destroys the glucose.Commercial processes are being developed to process cellulose into alcohol with the use of strong acid without destroying the cellulose. However, the process is complicated and economically feasible only on a very large scale.\nThe only alternative to dissolving the lignin is to reduce the cellulose material to as fine a state as possible so that at least some of the cellulose may be recovered. This is done by powdering, grinding or pressing. The yield of cellulose is directly proportional to how finely the starting material is reduced.Other cellulose materials are somewhat easier to process than those with high lignin content. Some forms of paper, like newspaper, are almost pure cellulose and are easily converted by either the enzyme or acid process.Also, in order for a plant to produce cellulose, it must first produce glucose, which is the sugar we are trying to obtain. Therefore, plants that are processed while they are still wet and green have the advantage of having fermentable sugar already available. These materials can be simply fermented without conversion and considered as low-yield saccharine feedstocks.\nChapter 9\nYEAST AND FERMENTATION\nYeast is an organism belonging to the vegetable family. The yeast itself does not take a direct part in the fermentation process, but it secretes a complex of enzymes that act upon the sugar and convert it to alcohol and carbon dioxide gas.The yeast used in alcoholic fermentation is a special strain bred to be tolerant to variations in pH and resistant to alcohol. In the past, distilleries bred and propagated their own yeast strains. The yeast was kept alive in cultures and grown in batches of ever-increasing size to be used in the fermenters. Keeping yeast alive and growing cultures is a tricky business that requires precise control of temperature, nutrients, and the like. However, a simplified method is described later. Fortunately, special active dry yeast is available. To use it, you merely add warm water to reactivate it and then add it to the mash in the fermenter. Two pounds is sufficient for 1000 gallons of mash. It is available from Universal Foods Corporation as listed in the appendix. This yeast should be rehydrated for 15 minutes prior to use at a temperature of 100-105 deg Fahrenheit, or it can be added dry to the fermentation tank prior to filling.In a pinch, it is possible to use ordinary baker's yeast from your grocer's shelf. However, this yeast is not bred for alcohol tolerance, and you will probably not get the yields associated with the distiller's yeast.\nYEAST PROPAGATION\nIt is possible to grow and propagate your own yeast cultures if you observe certain precautions. Above all, the conditions must be absolutely sterile. Ordinary boiling water does not kill all of the bacteria present. It is necessary to use a pressure cooker. Make a solution of (proportionately) one cup sugar, one cup flour and two quarts water. Place the solution in a pressure cooker and boil at elevated pressure for at least 45 minutes. Without opening the pressure cooker, cool the solution to about room temperature. Then open the container and add a cake of baker's or distiller's yeast. Close the container and keep it in the refrigerator. The yeast will slowly grow. Some carbon dioxide will be given off, so be sure to leave the vent open. If desired, the yeast slurry can be transferred to jars. Just be sure they are sterile and remember to poke a small hole in the lid to let the carbon dioxide escape.To use the yeast culture, merely remove a teaspoon or so, place it in another (sterile) container, feed it some sugar and warm it to room temperature. When it becomes active, it is ready for the fermenter. If at any time your refrigerated culture goes bad (due to bacterial contamination) it must be thrown out and the procedure started again. Also, yeast cultures should not be frozen.\nFERMENTATION\nAll that is necessary to begin fermentation is to mix the activated yeast and the cooled, pH-adjusted mash in the fermentation tank. Aside from the considerations of pH as discussed earlier, the most important thing during the fermentation is temperature control. When the fermentation begins, carbon dioxide gas will be given off. At the height of fermentation, the mash will literally \"boil\" from the carbon dioxide produced. The reaction also produces some heat. The optimum temperature for the fermentation process is between 70-85 deg F., and it is desirable not to let the temperature go much above 90-95 deg F. Cooling is readily done with the use of ice bags, as discussed earlier, or by the use of a cooling coil. A less desirable method of controlling temperature is to dilute the mash.The actual time required to ferment a mash varies with the material being fermented, the pH, temperature, and several other factors. It can take from one to four days. You will know that the fermentation is complete when the mash ceases bubbling and the yeast cake, which forms on top, sinks to the bottom. At this point, the fermented liquor is known as \"beer\" and it is ready to be distilled.It is advantageous to distill the beer as soon as possible. Occasionally, if it is allowed to sit, it will turn to vinegar. Vinegar is alcohol that has been oxidized to acetic acid. Certain enzymes present after fermentation act as catalysts and allow any air present in the mash solution to react with the alcohol to form acetic acid. In fact, if you want to produce vinegar, all you have to do to start the reaction is to bubble air through the fermented mash. Once the vinegar reaction has set in, the mash is lost. There is no cure. The only prevention is to separate the beer from the mash sediment and distill it as soon after fermentation is complete as possible.\nIt is also advantageous to use a fermentation lock as described in Chapter 13, to prevent alcohol vapors from escaping the fermenter. Otherwise, the CO2 gas can carry with it a considerable amount of alcohol. Note that the small, glass fermentation locks available from wine-making supply houses are suitable, at most) for a 5-gallon container. Larger containers must have proportionately larger fermentation locks or a dangerous amount of pressure will build and the vessel could explode.It is permissible to open the fermenter to check progress and take samples for pH analysis, etc. as long as care is taken not to introduce bacteria that could contaminate the mash.\nFERMENTATION BY-PRODUCTS\nThe principle products of fermentation are alcohol, carbon dioxide, and fermentation residue. The alcohol is distilled from the beer and used as fuel . The carbon dioxide gas in large distilleries is usually compressed or made into dry ice. Another use for the gas would be to pipe it into a greenhouse. The plants will then use it in the photosynthesis cycle, removing the carbon and giving off oxygen. Lacking a use for the carbon dioxide, it can be simply vented into the air as it is totally non-polluting and non-toxic.What will be left is a lot of water and solids. A portion of the water can be used for backslopping. The remaining solids contain proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats, and yeast cells. All of the nutrition value of the original feedstock, except the starch or sugar that has been turned into alcohol, survives intact. It may be fed to cattle, or if suitably processed it can be used for human consumption. However, in the wet state, it will keep for a maximum of 3-5 days depending on conditions. After this it will begin to rot. Therefore, for long term storage these residues (stillage) must be dried. This can be done by straining out the solids and spreading them in a thin layer to dry in the sun, by use of rotary grain dryers, or similar equipment.\nNOTE OF CAUTION\nAlcohol produced for human consumption is made under special conditions and purified to a high degree. Ethanol that is produced according to the procedures in this book will contain fusel oils (high boiling alcohols), aldehydes, and ketones. None of these chemicals affect fuel performance but, if ingested, could cause fatal poisoning at worst or a horrible hangover at best. In addition, if the distillation equipment used later on is not tinned copper or stainless steel, many toxic metal oxides can be introduced to the alcohol. Solder, for example, contains a lot of lead and can react to form poisonous lead oxides. So besides being illegal, drinking your fuel could be hazardous to your health!\nChapter 10\nINDIVIDUAL RAW MATERIALS\nThis chapter contains specific processing information and recipes for individual raw materials. If a material you are interested in using is not listed, you can usually approximate an appropriate process by using the information about a similar material. Note that feedstock materials are not consistent in the amount of fermentable materials, moisture content, and many other factors. The figures given here are averages. More specific information about particular materials can be obtained from your state agricultural service, or the material in question can be tested by an agricultural laboratory for a modest fee.Remember, then, the following information is intended only as a guide.\nSUGAR/STARCH CONTENT vs ALCOHOL\nOn the average, the amount of alcohol that can be produced from a given feedstock will be about half (on a weight/weight basis) of the convertible starch or sugar content. Ethanol weighs about 6.6 pounds per gallon. A ton of grapes, for example, with a 15% sugar content is capable (assuming 100% extraction) of producing about 150 pounds or 22.7 gallons of alcohol. Corn, with 66% convertible starch should produce 660 pounds or 100 gallons. Remember, this is only an approximation and actual yield depends on many interrelated factors.\nSACCHARINE MATERIALS\nThe process of fermenting saccharine materials is relatively simple and straightforward. The steps involved are usually:\n(1) extracting or crushing,\n(2) pH adjustment through acid or backslopping, and\n(3) fermentation.\nDilution is usually not necessary because the extracted juices often contain less than the 20% maximum of fermentable material. Exceptions to the above are the various types of molasses that do not require extraction, but usually require dilution.\nFRUITS\nThe following are some fruits and their average sugar content: grapes, 15.0%;\nbananas, 13.8%;\n"}, {"score": 376.36002, "uuid": "0dc828cf-4a71-573f-ae9d-bbda1902fe72", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1814wb-82-10211", "target_hostname": "www.the-mom-blog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.the-mom-blog.com/2010_07_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 2.0014497e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>The</em> Mom Blog: July 2010", "snippet": "Last year I didn&#x27;t have <em>a</em> <em>food</em> <em>processor</em> large enough so I mashed all my berries by hand with <em>a</em> potato masher - it took forever, but <em>the</em> results were amazing.

He was puzzled and asked the man, 'Why are you spending so much time carving that bird into a beam that will be covered by the roof? No one will ever see it.' And the workman replied, 'Because God sees.'\nI closed the book, feeling the missing piece fall into place.\nIt was almost as if I heard God whispering to me, 'I see you, Charlotte.

Take, for example, Xiao Long Bao\u2014the soup-filled dumplings hailing from Shanghai that have since been popularized throughout the world. Even referring to them as \"dumplings\" is enough to set off some food scholars who insist that they are distinct from what we traditionally classify as dumplings. The question is, what does it mean to be authentic and more precisely, is it even possible for authenticity to be preserved across the many barriers of language mapping, social custom, and regional tastes?\nFirst, a bit of history: Generally thought to have been invented in the late 19th century, possibly as early as the years preceding the Guang Xu period (1875-1908) of Qing China, xiao long bao hail from the town of Nan Xiang in what is now Shanghai's Jiading district. There, they are called xiao long man tou (\"little basket steamed bread\")*. So the rumor goes, the first XLB were sold out of a shop owned by a Mr. Huang Mingxian, who was driven to innovate them due to the increased competition of new vendors attracted to the crowds his famous steamed buns brought in. Mr. Huang may have adapted the soup bun form, as the much larger but similarly shaped Yangzhou tang bao (\"soup bun\")** might indicate, but its unlikely that he invented them all his own.\n* For reasons of clarity, xiao long bao will be the term predominately used throughout the article unless otherwise necessary. Soup dumpling and XLB will be used when convenient. In Southern China, mantou, a foodstuff native to and imported from the country's North, is used to describe synonymously with bao zi to describe steamed with bread with a filling . Hence, xiao long man tou.\n** Its not entirely clear whether the giant soup buns are a recent invention or not.\nThis lore is probably condensed history. I spoke with Fuchsia Dunlop , the West's foremost expert on Chinese cuisine, who explained, \"I don't think anyone would say that Nan Xiang was the first place in the region to do the soupy dumplings because there are other versions which offer to go back much longer.\"*** Internationalized by Taiwanese chain Din Tai Fung, xiao long bao are today one of 83 folk arts protected by the Shanghai government.\n*** For her part, Dunlop suggests that XLB were probably invented closer to the turn of the (20th) century rather then the 1870s. Her two sources agree on this.\nWhat Makes A Dumpling?\nIn the West, \"dumpling\" is a term used to define a wide range of boiled, dough-based foods ranging from gnocchi to the simmered balls of biscuit dough in chicken 'n' dumplings to matzoh balls and pirogi. The term has been reapplied to a wide variety of similar boiled or steamed dough-based snacks from Asia without cooking method, technical composition, or wrapping style taken into account. Unlike western dumplings, Asian dumplings unanimously have fillings. However, in China, no single, all encompassing term for the concept exists. To give you a sense of the confusion, it's like lumping omelets and meringue cookies into a single, undifferentiated category simply because they are both made with beaten eggs. It's thus a logical fallacy to assume or imply a one-to-one mapping of the Western word \"dumpling\" and any Mandarin word for common forms of stuffed dough-based snacks.\nLet's take a look at a few key categories.\nJiao zi refers to a foodstuff of vegetables and/or meat wrapped in unleavened, pleated dough that is traditionally accompanied by a vinegar dipping sauce. (Guo tie, zheng jiao, and shui jiao are some variations.) This is most often what Westerners picture when they say \"dumpling\"; many dictionaries translate the word accordingly.\nServed in soup or sometimes a puddle of chili oil, hun tun (\"wontons\"), described by Dunlop as \"probably China's most ancient dumpling\", are related but distinct, generally made with square wrappers that are less formal in their pleating and sealing.\nDim Sum gaau (Cantonese for \"jiao\") are also distinct from either hun tun or jiao zi. Wonton wrappers often contain eggs and are square, jiao zi's are circular, and gauu thin to the point of translucency.\nPurse-shaped bao zi (roughly translated as \"wrapped around thing\") are made with a fluffy, sweet, yeast-leavened dough housing sweet or savory fillings and are regarded as their own species: steamed buns.\nFurther complicating matters, jiao zi wrappers can be made with leavened dough, as in Hebei province in central China. In the North, this is not uncommon either. Form, too, is essential: jiao zi are horn-shaped, hun tun larger and triangular or circular, and gaau tinier. Perhaps the most important thing to understand about dumplings, and buns too, is that any attempt to be definitive will ultimately fail. Fresh complications and intricacies inevitably arise.\nSo are Xiao Long Bao Dumplings?\nXiao long bao from Shanghai Cafe Deluxe . [Photograph: J. Kenji Alt-Lopez]\nIn New York, we tend to think of soup dumplings**** in narrow terms: little bao zi babies with thin jiao zi-esque wrappers. But no definitive form exists. In an article for CNNGo , preeminent Shanghai food critic Shen Hongfei explained that what are popularly marketed as xiao long bao are in fact \"Nanjing tang bao ... [these are] the soup-filled dumplings with very thin skin.\" For a proper xiao long bao, chef Antnight hony Zhao agrees, \"the skin should be a bit thicker then tang bao, but not as thick as in sheng jian [bao],\" and the filling meatier. When our conversation veered towards variations in style, Dunlop said, \"it may be that it's a kind of Western obsession. I can't say that definitively, it just seems that there are just different variations, and the Nan Xiang [style] has become very famous because it's an extremely touristy area.\"\n**** Contrary to the claims of a certain notoriously grumpy critic, there does indeed exist a word in Mandarin, \"\u6c64\" (\"tang\"), that translates into soup. At least according to my copy of the Common Press' Concise English-Chinese Dictionary (3rd edition), purchased in a Shanghai book store (which has to count for something here.)\nAs far as English terms are concerned, it seems acceptable to call something that is doughier a bun and something with a thinner wrapping a dumpling. So the argument goes, if bao zi have leavened dough, which is almost always true, but xiao long bao\u2014or the form Westerners are familiar with\u2014don't, then they are dumplings, not buns. However, if we are going to equate dumpling with jiao zi, then we ought to be clear. Leavened or unleavened dough, xiao long bao are not jiao zi, which are always horn shaped. Like other bao zi, XLB are purse shaped. As an all encompassing term for these related foodstuffs, dumpling doesn't do justice, failing to take into account the particulars and gray zones endemic to the Chinese perspective.\nIndeed, we already are dealing with an issue of translation between the microcultures of China. Bao zi were, for all intents and purposes, a foreign foodstuff to rice eating southern China. Imported from the wheat consuming north, they were already facing cultural reappropriation before making their way to our distant shores.\nThe problem with getting all riled up over whether \"soup dumpling\" is a misnomer or not is that translation is never clean. A dumpling means something different to a Chinese-American than it does to an Anglo-American eating in a Chinese restaurant or a Polish-American making pirogi. Food is constantly being re-contextualized, consumed and informed by people under new circumstances. Lost in all this white noise is the fact that \"dumpling\" is an English word with roots in Low German, used to describe a befuddling variety of unrelated foods.\nWhat Is Authenticity?\nThe soup dumpling obsession springs from the drive towards authenticity\u2014and particularly the prioritization of \"informed consumption\"\u2014which emphasizes experiencing cuisine in its original and unadulterated context; an attempt to remove \"the Other\" from our dining experience. Xiao long bao pointedly address the issue of how much influence the culture of origin should maintain. To what degree should we accommodate the original perspective? Should cultures deal with systematic and interruptive differences in classification through accommodation or correction?\nAs Dunlop pointed out, \"there are different ways of classifying things [in Chinese cuisine]. You can classify things by the kind of flour, the kind of starch used in the wrapper. Or by the shape, or by the filling, or by the cooking method. In daily life, it's not something people think about.\" Authenticity would demand that we strictly adhere to the system of origin. If food is the primary conduit through which we experience culture, then this is probably the right path.\nWhat this train of thought doesn't account for is that we are not, no matter the lengths, ever eating xiao long bao in the unadulterated context. Even at a stall in an unregulated Hongkou district night market, you are still, and maybe more than ever, a lao wei (\"foreigner\"). Authenticity in food is an illusion.\nIs this damnation? Not quite. Refusing to incorporate the external perspective devalues the culture of origin, limiting us to experiences we are already familiar with. When blogging about her dilemma over how to translate \u8c46\u8150 (\"do fu\") into English, Dunlop wrote: \"As someone writing about Chinese food and culinary culture, shouldn't I be advocating a Chinese-derived term when describing a foodstuff that has its origins in China? I suddenly noticed how many of the terms used by English speakers for Asian foods are derived from the Japanese.\" The problem with working from the secondary perspective is that the individual is presented with an already re-interpreted picture.\nIn his 1989 Vogue Magazine essay \"True Choucrote\", Jeffery Steingarten offers us a more elastic definition of authenticity. Writing about his pursuit of the most authentic choucroute garnie a l'Alsacienne (Alatian pork with sauerkraut), the critic advises: \"... if it could have been made in Alsace by a traditional cook, it is authentic. When my chart gave me permission, I choose what most pleased my tastes ... Authenticity seems more a matter of ranges and limitations than of outright prescriptions.\"\nHowever, in spite of Steingarten's guidelines, authenticity in food remains reductionist and misleading, at its worst favoring a crystallized illusion. It's a culinary imperialism that treats restaurants like reservations, where \"ethnic\" people cook food in ways that have not changed since time immemorial\u2014and always will. While recognizing its positive contributions, Dunlop noted, \"Authenticity should never be an argument for conservatism. Cuisines are always about where they are now\u2014they've always evolved through contact, through absorption of new ingredients, through contact with new people.\"\nMa po do fu, a misunderstood dish? [Photograph: J. Kenji Alt-Lopez ]\nIn his Shanghai cuisine primer Culinary Nostalgia , Mark Swislocki, referencing 1950s reporter Chen Mengyin, wrote, \"what passes for Sichuan cuisine today only took shape relatively recently, probably no more then 250 years ago.\" A flush of immigrants and new ingredients changed the game. Today, anything less than searing heat is considered a misrepresentation (it isn't). But when digging into that ma po do fu, you aren't thinking about how those chilies, which give the dish its vital kick, were originally brought over from the New World by European merchants. They have become synonymous with Sichuanese cuisine to the point of being one of its defining elements\u2014talk about evolution through contact with new people!\nIt's hard to find a more poignant example of the flaws inherent to the authenticity model.\nSuch \"defining\" foods are often mythologized, and in the process shed the complexity of their historical origins. Take pizza, brought over to the United States, as anybody could tell you, by Italian immigrants. Some Americans even make pilgrimages to Naples in search of more authentic pizza. But this was a two way street\u2014remember, the first tomatoes had to be imported from the New World.\nFusing Authentic Cuisines\nCemented into our culture as they are, restaurants are a modern invention. And it is becoming increasingly clear that, when presented in the authenticity paradigm, they limit our perception of what a cuisine can be. To suggest that a dish can only be made in one way, if it is to be true to its culture, ignores historical reality: If most people eat and ate at home, how can everyone possibly be eating the same thing? Do all New Yorkers only eat Brooklyn-style plain slices? It's a radical oversimplification. The concept of authenticity, as contemporarily pushed, ignores the malleable nature of food, framing it as static and unchanging.\nOnly, the problem is that food made with some notion of \"authenticity\" in mind is often made better; with more attention, love and respect. The best foods in the world are those that were developed by generations of home cooks and restaurant chefs who developed intricate systems of flavor with limited regionally-based resources. It's unreasonable to expect a single modern cook to invent a brand new cuisine or dish that can compete with, say, dumplings or pizza. In self-conscious modern \"fusion\" cuisines, cooking food spuriously often means appealing to the worst aspects of our palates and, in catering to cultural ignorance, stripping a cuisine of its eccentricities, producing a culinary minstrel show\u2014an edible farce.\nIn an interview with Eatocracy , chef Ming Tsai stated, \"it's adapted for the wrong reasons, to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public.\" Valuing authenticity affords greater diversity. It's easy to imagine the Chinese as one monolithic people when you imagine them all eating the cloyingly sweet General Tso's chicken. But, as Dunlop has pointed out, China is a continent unto itself, with a continuous stream of culture dating back to the Han dynasty and drawing on sources as ancient as the Bronze Age's Xia. With 1,226 miles between them, Shanghai and Chengdu, both culturally a part of Southern China, are twice as far apart as Berlin and London are. Step outside those bounds and the distances get enormous. Despite China's massive scale and population, for many foreigners, its cuisine and all of its varied traditions are compressed into one air-tight serving.\nA lot of New Yorkers would boast that you can't find good pizza anywhere outside of New York\u2014even 225 miles away in Boston. In contrast, Taiwan\u2014where the perceived international standard for xiao long bao was established at Din Tai Fung by a Shanxi immigrant\u2014is 430 miles away from Shanghai.\nFor the average American, minor technical differences don't matter much. But shouldn't they? Willful cultural ignorance is nothing to boast about. Yet, Dunlop concedes the inevitability of simplification and reconciliation: \"I could try to run a one-woman campaign for dou fu or beancurd, but this might be at the cost of winning converts to the pleasures of Chinese food, which is, after all, the main point of what I do.\" It's a position to consider. What's more important: celebrating the playful joys of soup dumplings or getting into fits over translation? The way the obsession\u2014giving the linguistic issue precedence over the culinary concern\u2014is manifested suggests a distracted focus; an objectification of food into cultural capital.\nWhat's the verdict? Food doesn't have to be \"authentic\" to be delicious\u2014though it certainly helps to maintain the spirit of the cuisine. Delimiting a food like pizza with an artificial certification of authenticity (like the standards set by the Vera Pizza Napoletana society) ignores its origins on the trade routes, a place of birth shared by a great deal of our favorite foods. Some Americans become obsessed with eating chilies, learning to love spicy in an effort to experience more authentic cuisine\u2014all the while forgetting where peppers first came from. That aside, the concept has undoubtedly pushed food forward in this nation, exposing millions to new flavors and ingredients they'd otherwise never experience. But maybe it's time we moved beyond authentic, towards a more malleable, and perhaps delicious, cuisine.\nAbout the author: Chris Crowley is a former Serious Eats intern and he author of the Bronx Eats column.

In both cases the projects are national initiatives which are strongly pushed by the respective governments.\nIn terms of their current size the projects are also comparable: Uruguay has so far distributed approximately 400,000 XOs and is currently adding 100,000 more laptops to its secondary school system. Peru on the other hand has distributed slightly less than 300,000 XOs to date and recently announced its intent to add another 300,000 over the coming year.\nThis however is where the similarities end. Uruguay\u2019s 400,000 XOs result in full saturation of the country\u2019s public primary school system whereas Peru\u2019s 300,000 only cover a small double-digit percentage of its primary school pupils. This example already demonstrates what I consider to be a key difference between the two countries: the size of the challenge to make \u201cone laptop per child\u201d a reality.\nOf course it\u2019s not just the size of the population (Uruguay: 3.5 million, Peru: 29 million) which makes a big difference here. In many ways Peru\u2019s population is also more varied than Uruguay\u2019s as exemplified by the fact that Peru has two official languages: Spanish and the indigenous Quechua.\nWhen it comes to the current state of the education system Peru is also in a different situation than Uruguay. Whereas Uruguay\u2019s literacy rate is 98%, Peru\u2019s is estimated to be between 90% and 92% with rural areas being closer to 80% where children often also don\u2019t have the opportunity to proceed beyond the first few years of primary school.\nLast but not least Peru\u2019s geography \u2013 being roughly seven times larger than Uruguay and consisting of the desert coast, high Andes mountain ranges, and inaccessible jungle \u2013 and the associated difficulties of building and maintaining infrastructure such as roads, an electricity grid or Internet connectivity also present additional challenges to a project such as Una laptop por ni\u00f1o.\nIt\u2019s within this context that Peru first announced that it was interested in OLPC in 2007. Similarly to Uruguay and Paraguay the first step was a small pilot project with 60 XOs which started in the village of Arahuay in May 2007. What is important to note at this point is that Una laptop por ni\u00f1o was originally specifically targeted at rural multi-grade schools with a single teacher. While this focus has shifted in the recent past I feel it is worth pointing out that within an already difficult environment Peru certainly picked the most challenging target schools one can possibly imagine.\n1. Infrastructure\nCharger and non-connected network plug\nAs already indicated in the introduction the setup and subsequent maintenance of any sort of technical or logistical infrastructure faces tough challenges given Peru\u2019s geography.\nOn the technical side these challenges certainly haven\u2019t been adequately addressed as a recent evaluation by the Inter-American Development Bank found that almost 5% of the schools which have already received XOs don\u2019t even have electricity yet. In terms of Internet access only 1.4% of the schools are connected at the moment. It\u2019s clear that such a situation makes the implementation of a 1-to-1 computing in education project very hard indeed.\nThe fact that laptops were distributed to schools without electricity points to several underlying issues. The first one is that the Ministry of Education\u2019s data on the infrastructure available at schools doesn\u2019t seem to be up to date and accurate enough. One example is that a school with a single outlet in the principal\u2019s office is officially listed as having electricity yet obviously this isn\u2019t going to be enough to power several dozen laptops.\nSecondly it seems like not enough time was spent on planning the implementation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. An example in this area is the way Peru handles the activation and anti-theft system on the XO laptops. Uruguay keeps a database of which child owns which specific laptop (identified by its serial number) which allows for laptops to be remotely disabled when they\u2019re reported stolen. Peru\u2019s database however only includes information as to which batches of laptops were sent to which schools. This lack of granular information means that an anti-theft system such as the one used in Uruguay simply can\u2019t be implemented.\nSome of these problems might also be explained by how the implementation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is organized. Whereas Uruguay, Paraguay, and most other countries have separate entities focusing on their OLPC efforts in Peru it\u2019s only one of several initiatives that the Ministry of Education\u2019s DIGETE (Direcci\u00f3n General de Tecnolog\u00edas Educativas \u2013 Directorate General of Educational Technologies) is tasked with. In combination with a relatively small number of staff this results in seemingly not enough time and resources being available for Una laptop por ni\u00f1o.\nOverall it\u2019s quite obvious that the infrastructure within which Peru\u2019s OLPC project is taking place leaves much to be desired. Whether it\u2019s very obvious problems such as the lack of electricity at schools which received XOs or less obvious ones such as the lack of a central database matching pupils to laptops it\u2019s clear that they will negatively impact the project and make things significantly harder.\nOne of 45,000 solar panels\nMany of these issues seem to be the result of planning oversights and while these can undoubtedly be corrected it will require a significant overhaul of the whole strategy as well as the availability of additional resources. A first step into that direction was the purchase of 45,000 solar panels which are currently being distributed to schools without electricity access. While this will certainly improve the situation in many cases it\u2019s still not a perfect solution given that many of the schools are located in regions with extended rainy seasons which will render solar panels useless for extended periods of time.\n2. Maintenance\nWhen it comes to maintenance Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is very much relying on existing infrastructure and responsibilities within the education system to deal with XOs that aren\u2019t working.\nOn the lowest level teachers receive some basic training to deal with issues such as failures of the activation system or other software problems which can be fixed relatively easily. If a problem that can\u2019t be solved at the school itself is encountered, the next level of support is provided by the local UGEL (Unidades de Gesti\u00f3n Educativa Local \u2013 Local Education Management Unit). On this level, generally one person who is responsible for all technology-related education projects has received additional training to deal with more complex software issues as well as simple hardware repairs.\nThe next step up the ladder is the DRE (Direccion Regional de Educacion \u2013 Regional Directorate of Education) which provides a stock of spare XOs which can be used as replacement units or as a source for spare parts. Only if none of these entities is able to fix the laptop, is it then sent to a central repair facility in Lima.\nUna laptop por ni\u00f1o repair center\nWhile this system might look good on paper it runs into a variety of issues in practice. The first problem is that many teachers don\u2019t have a USB flash drive which allows them to store the data needed to fix simple software issues. Secondly these repairs also seem to overwhelm teachers, many of whom had never used a computer before they received their XO. The fact that the commands required to fix common issues are in English, in combination with the lack of handouts or digital guides, provides another barrier.\nAs a result many laptops remain unusable once they\u2019re broken as teachers aren\u2019t able to repair them themselves and when their schools are located in remote regions, it might take several weeks or months until they can be handed over to the respective UGEL. Similarly the UGELs and DREs often don\u2019t have the spare parts or extra machines to deal with breakages either, and getting new stock from Lima often takes more than three months.\nThe overall result of this situation is that broken machines don\u2019t get reported and don\u2019t get replaced, which means that there are pupils who often have to share their XO with someone else rather than having their own laptop. While I\u2019m not aware of any larger evaluation of this situation, my own experiences as well as those of people I talked to indicate that this is indeed a country-wide problem.\nIn the end Una laptop por ni\u00f1o demonstrates that even a theoretically well planned maintenance system can run into serious issues in practice. The lack of USB flash drives for teachers for example may seem like a neglectable detail at first but it has a significant impact on the whole system.\n3. Content and Materials\nUsing the XO to learn about geometry\nWhen it comes to content and materials Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s approach is similar to Paraguay as the focus is very much set on how to use the existing Activities on the XOs to teach certain subject material, rather than developing new interactive learning content. Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s Web site provides about a dozen or so guides which cover how to use the laptops to teach topics such as geometry, writing poems, and dental hygiene.\nAdditionally DIGETE has also produced several manuals and guides which focus on how to use the XO laptop, what functionalities the various Activities provide, and similar topics.\nOther materials which could be very useful for teachers include the \u201cLa laptop XO en la aula\u201d (\u201cThe XO laptop in the classroom\u201d) manual which was independently written by Sdenka Z. Salas, a teacher in the South of Peru, and contains a lot advice and suggestions on how to use the various Sugar Activities for teaching.\nThe problem is that neither the teachers \u2013 nor the teacher trainer \u2013 who I spoke to were aware of the availability of these materials. Since almost none of them have Internet access at school and only very few of them have USB flash drives there is no way for them to access the content and materials that DIGETE and others \u2013 such as for example the OLPC projects in Uruguay and Paraguay \u2013 create.\nGuide for teacher training\nIn my opinion this issue really exemplifies why ICT4E projects that don\u2019t provide its participants and stakeholders with Internet access are very hard to implement. Of course there are other offline distribution methods such as USB flash drives and printed materials. However in most cases these alternatives require an additional logistics infrastructure and associated resources compared to being able to point people to a Web site and ask them to check it regularly as part of training efforts.\nIn light of these circumstances Una laptop por ni\u00f1o recently purchased large quantities of USB flash drives \u2013 several hundred thousand from what I gather \u2013 to distribute to teachers and pupils. These USB flash drives will come preloaded with a selection of educational content, most likely the documents which are currently available on Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s Web site. This would provide teachers but also pupils and parents with a baseline of materials to build on. At the same time it would enable teachers and administrators to independently exchange materials which they could access in Internet caf\u00e9s or while they\u2019re visiting local or regional offices.\nIt\u2019s clear however that until these USB flash drives are distributed, the grand majority of Peruvian teachers simply will not have access to any content and materials that help them integrate the laptops in the teaching process. As a result the overall impact and usefulness of the few resources that are available today is very small.\n4. Community involvement\nUnlike its counterpart in Uruguay, Una laptop por ni\u00f1o so far hasn\u2019t created a broader community of people and organizations involved with the country\u2019s OLPC efforts. This isn\u2019t necessarily due to a lack of interest by the broader society but rather seems to be the result of a lack of support for people and groups who are independent of the Ministry of Education.\nOne group that does exist is Sugar Labs Peru which is based in and around the southern city of Puno and consists of several teachers as well as software developers. Sugar Labs Peru is involved in a variety of activities such as creating manuals for teachers on how to use the XO in a classroom and organizing workshops focused around Sugar Activities.\nAnother effort that is somewhat community related is OLPC\u2019s Intern program in Peru. The program regularly enables mostly North American students to support teachers in schools with XOs over the course of several weeks.\nXO bag designed by Peruvian volunteers\nOther individuals and groups who had been interested in contributing to Una laptop por ni\u00f1o in various ways were often discouraged by a lack of support from DIGETE. One such example are students from one of Lima\u2019s private universities who were interested in working on thesis and research projects but ended up going into another direction after their repeated requests for information and official support remained without a reply.\nHence it comes as no surprise that overall the number of people outside the traditional education system contributing to Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is relatively small. Given the limited resources available to DIGETE and the need for a broad variety of support measures \u2013 and the impact they have in countries such as Uruguay \u2013 this is a shame and an example of a missed opportunity. Again, this is an area were improvements are still possible, however it seems that a lot of the initial good will and desire to support the initiative might have been lost already.\n5. Teacher training\nAs mentioned in the introduction as well as the subsequent articles about OLPC in Uruguay and Paraguay I consider teacher training to be a key component of a successful ICT4E initiative. Similarly to Paraguay I was again lucky enough to be able to attend a teacher training session during my stay in Peru.\nIn general teacher training in Peru consists of two components: One training session which ideally takes place before the laptops are handed out and then a yearly refresher course. The training that I observed was a voluntary 2-day refresher for teachers who had received the XOs roughly one year earlier.\nThe initial training consists of 40 hours during a week-long course. Given that many teachers have never used a laptop before the training starts with the very basics such as how to turn on the XO, how to keep it charged, how to navigate using the touchpad, how to type on the keyboard, etc. Since a significant amount of time is spent on these topics there is little left to discuss the educational use of the laptops in the school setting.\nVoluntary refresher training course\nIn the refresher course which I attended again a lot of time was dedicated to dealing with fundamental questions about how to resolve minor software issues and learning how to use some of the Activities. While some ideas on how to use the laptops to teach certain subject matter were discussed overall again too little attention seemed to be given on how to integrate the laptop with the curriculum that teachers need to get through.\nThe lack of quality teacher training, combined with the aforementioned lack of support materials and manuals or the ability of teachers to exchange ideas or access content online, results in teachers being inadequately prepared to use XO laptops in the classroom.\nThe effect of this situation is that if teachers use the laptops they mostly ask pupils to transcribe a text from the blackboard or school book in their word processor. Similarly in many cases the use of the XOs seems to drop off significantly two or three months after they are first handed out. This can be interpreted as a sign that the novelty factor is wearing off without teachers seeing a purpose in really using the laptops in schools.\nTeacher training could be a way to compensate for many of the infrastructure and content related deficits and difficulties that exist for Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. However in its current state it doesn\u2019t seem to be able to convince the majority of teachers that the laptops are a valuable tool for learning let alone address these additional complexities.\nIt is worth pointing out that progress in an environment where many teachers have never used a computer before will undoubtedly be slow. However a more intensive initial training combined with regular follow-ups as well as support in the form of manuals could go a long way in enabling teachers to effectively start using the laptops inside the classroom.\n6. Evaluation\nEarly IADB evaluation report\nIn terms of evaluation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o the most significant effort is being undertaking by a consortium consisting of the Peruvian Ministry of Education, the Inter-American Development Bank, and GRADE , a Peruvian NGO. The first preliminary report (in Spanish) from that evaluation was recently released and the results are quite sobering.\nSimilarly to what I outlined above the evaluation for example found that there\u2019s a strong demand for better and more extensive training and technical as well as educational support for teachers. As a likely result of the lack of these supportive measures the use of the laptops drops off significantly after two to three months. The study also indicates that the learning outcomes by pupils who had received a laptop aren\u2019t significantly different to their peers. Additionally it also revealed that only slightly more than half of the pupils are allowed to take the laptops home thereby significantly reducing the potential amount of time that the pupils can use them. Overall the two main vectors that one might consider positive at this point are that pupils\u2019 abilities to use computers has increased and that parents and teachers have a more positive attitude towards schools.\nApart from that ongoing effort some Peruvian researchers previously also published results from independent evaluations that they worked on. While these are obviously based on a much smaller sample of schools, about a dozen or so in some cases, their findings are in many ways quite similar to the IADB evaluation. One such example is a report by Carlos David Laura of Peru\u2019s Economic and Social Research Consortium (CIES) which found that teacher training is lacking and that pupils\u2019 learning achievement hadn\u2019t improved.\nOne lesson to be learned from Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is that small independent evaluations can often provide first indications and vectors about how an ICT4E project is going before larger and longer-term studies are available. In this sense they can provide a much needed external monitoring tool which provides information and insight which can be the basis for modifying implementation details and strategies.\nOverall the efforts in Peru are a good example of the value that both small, short-term and large, long-term evaluations can provide to ICT4E initiatives. Of course considering its size one would expect to see more independent efforts looking into both the educational as well as social impacts of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. However as described in the community involvement section this also requires institutional support which at least in some cases wasn\u2019t provided in Peru.\nSummary and Outlook\nUndoubtedly Peru\u2019s Una laptop por ni\u00f1o offers many valuable lessons for ICT4E projects however in the grand majority of cases these will be how NOT to do something. There is no doubt that of the three South American countries I visited, Peru is the most physically challenging environment for a nation-wide 1-to-1 computing in education project. Even with a perfect implementation this would be a difficult undertaking, and with the plethora of issues and problems that the project\u2019s execution has exposed, the results and impacts \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 are bound to be underwhelming.\nThis is not to say that everything about Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is bad. It has undoubtedly opened enormous possibilities for thousands of teachers and pupils which will come up with interesting and creative ways to use the XOs and learn a lot in the process. Yet there\u2019s no doubt that the majority of teachers and pupils as well as other stakeholder such as administrators and parents will hardly see any benefit from the initiative.\nWhile not necessarily directly related to the early lackluster evaluation results, it is interesting to see that in mid-2010 DIGETE significantly changed the strategy of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. While the main target until then had been rural multi-grade schools with a single teacher, the upcoming 300,000 XOs will be distributed to larger and often urban schools. At the same time this phase of the project will no longer be traditional 1-to-1 computing. The new XO laptops will be used to set up CRTs (Centro de Recursos Tecnol\u00f3gicos \u2013 Center for Technology Resources) \u2013 basically mobile computer labs \u2013 at every remaining primary school in the country. This is indeed a very intriguing development, and I\u2019m sure many people will closely watch how this new strategy works out compared to the old one.\nOLPC in Peru is part of an overview of OLPC in South America , a first-hand report of XO laptop deployments in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru by Christoph Derndorfer.\nDon\u2019t miss a moment of the action!\nSubscribe now and get the latest articles from Educational Technology Debate sent directly to your inbox.\n"}, {"score": 369.0552, "uuid": "ca2171b5-d310-55c2-984f-094bf8466f78", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1714wb-85-31286", "target_hostname": "edutechdebate.org", "target_uri": "https://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/", "page_rank": 1.3192306e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "OLPC in Peru: <em>A</em> Problematic Una Laptop Por Ni\u00f1o Program \u00ab Educational Technology", "snippet": "This example already demonstrates <em>what</em> I consider to be <em>a</em> key <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> two countries: <em>the</em> size of <em>the</em> challenge to make \u201cone laptop per child\u201d <em>a</em> reality.

Only if none of these entities is able to fix the laptop, is it then sent to a central repair facility in Lima.\nUna laptop por ni\u00f1o repair center\nWhile this system might look good on paper it runs into a variety of issues in practice. The first problem is that many teachers don\u2019t have a USB flash drive which allows them to store the data needed to fix simple software issues. Secondly these repairs also seem to overwhelm teachers, many of whom had never used a computer before they received their XO. The fact that the commands required to fix common issues are in English, in combination with the lack of handouts or digital guides, provides another barrier.\nAs a result many laptops remain unusable once they\u2019re broken as teachers aren\u2019t able to repair them themselves and when their schools are located in remote regions, it might take several weeks or months until they can be handed over to the respective UGEL. Similarly the UGELs and DREs often don\u2019t have the spare parts or extra machines to deal with breakages either, and getting new stock from Lima often takes more than three months.\nThe overall result of this situation is that broken machines don\u2019t get reported and don\u2019t get replaced, which means that there are pupils who often have to share their XO with someone else rather than having their own laptop. While I\u2019m not aware of any larger evaluation of this situation, my own experiences as well as those of people I talked to indicate that this is indeed a country-wide problem.\nIn the end Una laptop por ni\u00f1o demonstrates that even a theoretically well planned maintenance system can run into serious issues in practice. The lack of USB flash drives for teachers for example may seem like a neglectable detail at first but it has a significant impact on the whole system.\n3. Content and Materials\nUsing the XO to learn about geometry\nWhen it comes to content and materials Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s approach is similar to Paraguay as the focus is very much set on how to use the existing Activities on the XOs to teach certain subject material, rather than developing new interactive learning content. Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s Web site provides about a dozen or so guides which cover how to use the laptops to teach topics such as geometry, writing poems, and dental hygiene.\nAdditionally DIGETE has also produced several manuals and guides which focus on how to use the XO laptop, what functionalities the various Activities provide, and similar topics.\nOther materials which could be very useful for teachers include the \u201cLa laptop XO en la aula\u201d (\u201cThe XO laptop in the classroom\u201d) manual which was independently written by Sdenka Z. Salas, a teacher in the South of Peru, and contains a lot advice and suggestions on how to use the various Sugar Activities for teaching.\nThe problem is that neither the teachers \u2013 nor the teacher trainer \u2013 who I spoke to were aware of the availability of these materials. Since almost none of them have Internet access at school and only very few of them have USB flash drives there is no way for them to access the content and materials that DIGETE and others \u2013 such as for example the OLPC projects in Uruguay and Paraguay \u2013 create.\nGuide for teacher training\nIn my opinion this issue really exemplifies why ICT4E projects that don\u2019t provide its participants and stakeholders with Internet access are very hard to implement. Of course there are other offline distribution methods such as USB flash drives and printed materials. However in most cases these alternatives require an additional logistics infrastructure and associated resources compared to being able to point people to a Web site and ask them to check it regularly as part of training efforts.\nIn light of these circumstances Una laptop por ni\u00f1o recently purchased large quantities of USB flash drives \u2013 several hundred thousand from what I gather \u2013 to distribute to teachers and pupils. These USB flash drives will come preloaded with a selection of educational content, most likely the documents which are currently available on Una laptop por ni\u00f1o\u2019s Web site. This would provide teachers but also pupils and parents with a baseline of materials to build on. At the same time it would enable teachers and administrators to independently exchange materials which they could access in Internet caf\u00e9s or while they\u2019re visiting local or regional offices.\nIt\u2019s clear however that until these USB flash drives are distributed, the grand majority of Peruvian teachers simply will not have access to any content and materials that help them integrate the laptops in the teaching process. As a result the overall impact and usefulness of the few resources that are available today is very small.\n4. Community involvement\nUnlike its counterpart in Uruguay, Una laptop por ni\u00f1o so far hasn\u2019t created a broader community of people and organizations involved with the country\u2019s OLPC efforts. This isn\u2019t necessarily due to a lack of interest by the broader society but rather seems to be the result of a lack of support for people and groups who are independent of the Ministry of Education.\nOne group that does exist is Sugar Labs Peru which is based in and around the southern city of Puno and consists of several teachers as well as software developers. Sugar Labs Peru is involved in a variety of activities such as creating manuals for teachers on how to use the XO in a classroom and organizing workshops focused around Sugar Activities.\nAnother effort that is somewhat community related is OLPC\u2019s Intern program in Peru. The program regularly enables mostly North American students to support teachers in schools with XOs over the course of several weeks.\nXO bag designed by Peruvian volunteers\nOther individuals and groups who had been interested in contributing to Una laptop por ni\u00f1o in various ways were often discouraged by a lack of support from DIGETE. One such example are students from one of Lima\u2019s private universities who were interested in working on thesis and research projects but ended up going into another direction after their repeated requests for information and official support remained without a reply.\nHence it comes as no surprise that overall the number of people outside the traditional education system contributing to Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is relatively small. Given the limited resources available to DIGETE and the need for a broad variety of support measures \u2013 and the impact they have in countries such as Uruguay \u2013 this is a shame and an example of a missed opportunity. Again, this is an area were improvements are still possible, however it seems that a lot of the initial good will and desire to support the initiative might have been lost already.\n5. Teacher training\nAs mentioned in the introduction as well as the subsequent articles about OLPC in Uruguay and Paraguay I consider teacher training to be a key component of a successful ICT4E initiative. Similarly to Paraguay I was again lucky enough to be able to attend a teacher training session during my stay in Peru.\nIn general teacher training in Peru consists of two components: One training session which ideally takes place before the laptops are handed out and then a yearly refresher course. The training that I observed was a voluntary 2-day refresher for teachers who had received the XOs roughly one year earlier.\nThe initial training consists of 40 hours during a week-long course. Given that many teachers have never used a laptop before the training starts with the very basics such as how to turn on the XO, how to keep it charged, how to navigate using the touchpad, how to type on the keyboard, etc. Since a significant amount of time is spent on these topics there is little left to discuss the educational use of the laptops in the school setting.\nVoluntary refresher training course\nIn the refresher course which I attended again a lot of time was dedicated to dealing with fundamental questions about how to resolve minor software issues and learning how to use some of the Activities. While some ideas on how to use the laptops to teach certain subject matter were discussed overall again too little attention seemed to be given on how to integrate the laptop with the curriculum that teachers need to get through.\nThe lack of quality teacher training, combined with the aforementioned lack of support materials and manuals or the ability of teachers to exchange ideas or access content online, results in teachers being inadequately prepared to use XO laptops in the classroom.\nThe effect of this situation is that if teachers use the laptops they mostly ask pupils to transcribe a text from the blackboard or school book in their word processor. Similarly in many cases the use of the XOs seems to drop off significantly two or three months after they are first handed out. This can be interpreted as a sign that the novelty factor is wearing off without teachers seeing a purpose in really using the laptops in schools.\nTeacher training could be a way to compensate for many of the infrastructure and content related deficits and difficulties that exist for Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. However in its current state it doesn\u2019t seem to be able to convince the majority of teachers that the laptops are a valuable tool for learning let alone address these additional complexities.\nIt is worth pointing out that progress in an environment where many teachers have never used a computer before will undoubtedly be slow. However a more intensive initial training combined with regular follow-ups as well as support in the form of manuals could go a long way in enabling teachers to effectively start using the laptops inside the classroom.\n6. Evaluation\nEarly IADB evaluation report\nIn terms of evaluation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o the most significant effort is being undertaking by a consortium consisting of the Peruvian Ministry of Education, the Inter-American Development Bank, and GRADE , a Peruvian NGO. The first preliminary report (in Spanish) from that evaluation was recently released and the results are quite sobering.\nSimilarly to what I outlined above the evaluation for example found that there\u2019s a strong demand for better and more extensive training and technical as well as educational support for teachers. As a likely result of the lack of these supportive measures the use of the laptops drops off significantly after two to three months. The study also indicates that the learning outcomes by pupils who had received a laptop aren\u2019t significantly different to their peers. Additionally it also revealed that only slightly more than half of the pupils are allowed to take the laptops home thereby significantly reducing the potential amount of time that the pupils can use them. Overall the two main vectors that one might consider positive at this point are that pupils\u2019 abilities to use computers has increased and that parents and teachers have a more positive attitude towards schools.\nApart from that ongoing effort some Peruvian researchers previously also published results from independent evaluations that they worked on. While these are obviously based on a much smaller sample of schools, about a dozen or so in some cases, their findings are in many ways quite similar to the IADB evaluation. One such example is a report by Carlos David Laura of Peru\u2019s Economic and Social Research Consortium (CIES) which found that teacher training is lacking and that pupils\u2019 learning achievement hadn\u2019t improved.\nOne lesson to be learned from Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is that small independent evaluations can often provide first indications and vectors about how an ICT4E project is going before larger and longer-term studies are available. In this sense they can provide a much needed external monitoring tool which provides information and insight which can be the basis for modifying implementation details and strategies.\nOverall the efforts in Peru are a good example of the value that both small, short-term and large, long-term evaluations can provide to ICT4E initiatives. Of course considering its size one would expect to see more independent efforts looking into both the educational as well as social impacts of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. However as described in the community involvement section this also requires institutional support which at least in some cases wasn\u2019t provided in Peru.\nSummary and Outlook\nUndoubtedly Peru\u2019s Una laptop por ni\u00f1o offers many valuable lessons for ICT4E projects however in the grand majority of cases these will be how NOT to do something. There is no doubt that of the three South American countries I visited, Peru is the most physically challenging environment for a nation-wide 1-to-1 computing in education project. Even with a perfect implementation this would be a difficult undertaking, and with the plethora of issues and problems that the project\u2019s execution has exposed, the results and impacts \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 are bound to be underwhelming.\nThis is not to say that everything about Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is bad. It has undoubtedly opened enormous possibilities for thousands of teachers and pupils which will come up with interesting and creative ways to use the XOs and learn a lot in the process. Yet there\u2019s no doubt that the majority of teachers and pupils as well as other stakeholder such as administrators and parents will hardly see any benefit from the initiative.\nWhile not necessarily directly related to the early lackluster evaluation results, it is interesting to see that in mid-2010 DIGETE significantly changed the strategy of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. While the main target until then had been rural multi-grade schools with a single teacher, the upcoming 300,000 XOs will be distributed to larger and often urban schools. At the same time this phase of the project will no longer be traditional 1-to-1 computing. The new XO laptops will be used to set up CRTs (Centro de Recursos Tecnol\u00f3gicos \u2013 Center for Technology Resources) \u2013 basically mobile computer labs \u2013 at every remaining primary school in the country. This is indeed a very intriguing development, and I\u2019m sure many people will closely watch how this new strategy works out compared to the old one.\nOLPC in Peru is part of an overview of OLPC in South America , a first-hand report of XO laptop deployments in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru by Christoph Derndorfer.\nDon\u2019t miss a moment of the action!\nSubscribe now and get the latest articles from Educational Technology Debate sent directly to your inbox.\n"}], [{"score": 368.9885, "uuid": "3854a39d-979a-5789-bdbe-63f7971f0e9e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1711wb-31-09527", "target_hostname": "edutechdebate.org", "target_uri": "http://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/", "page_rank": 1.3048198e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "OLPC in Peru: <em>A</em> Problematic Una Laptop Por Ni\u00f1o Program \u00ab Educational Technology", "snippet": "This example already demonstrates <em>what</em> I consider to be <em>a</em> key <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> two countries: <em>the</em> size of <em>the</em> challenge to make \u201cone laptop per child\u201d <em>a</em> reality. Of course it\u2019s not just <em>the</em> size of <em>the</em> population (Uruguay: 3.5 million, Peru: 29 million) which makes <em>a</em> big <em>difference</em> here.", "explanation": null, "document": "Christoph Derndorfer\n.\nAt first sight the Peruvian OLPC project \u201c Una laptop por ni\u00f1o \u201d is quite similar to Uruguay\u2019 Plan Ceibal . In both cases the projects are national initiatives which are strongly pushed by the respective governments.\nIn terms of their current size the projects are also comparable: Uruguay has so far distributed approximately 400,000 XOs and is currently adding 100,000 more laptops to its secondary school system. Peru on the other hand has distributed slightly less than 300,000 XOs to date and recently announced its intent to add another 300,000 over the coming year.\nThis however is where the similarities end. Uruguay\u2019s 400,000 XOs result in full saturation of the country\u2019s public primary school system whereas Peru\u2019s 300,000 only cover a small double-digit percentage of its primary school pupils. This example already demonstrates what I consider to be a key difference between the two countries: the size of the challenge to make \u201cone laptop per child\u201d a reality.\nOf course it\u2019s not just the size of the population (Uruguay: 3.5 million, Peru: 29 million) which makes a big difference here. In many ways Peru\u2019s population is also more varied than Uruguay\u2019s as exemplified by the fact that Peru has two official languages: Spanish and the indigenous Quechua.\nWhen it comes to the current state of the education system Peru is also in a different situation than Uruguay. Whereas Uruguay\u2019s literacy rate is 98%, Peru\u2019s is estimated to be between 90% and 92% with rural areas being closer to 80% where children often also don\u2019t have the opportunity to proceed beyond the first few years of primary school.\nLast but not least Peru\u2019s geography \u2013 being roughly seven times larger than Uruguay and consisting of the desert coast, high Andes mountain ranges, and inaccessible jungle \u2013 and the associated difficulties of building and maintaining infrastructure such as roads, an electricity grid or Internet connectivity also present additional challenges to a project such as Una laptop por ni\u00f1o.\nIt\u2019s within this context that Peru first announced that it was interested in OLPC in 2007. Similarly to Uruguay and Paraguay the first step was a small pilot project with 60 XOs which started in the village of Arahuay in May 2007. What is important to note at this point is that Una laptop por ni\u00f1o was originally specifically targeted at rural multi-grade schools with a single teacher. While this focus has shifted in the recent past I feel it is worth pointing out that within an already difficult environment Peru certainly picked the most challenging target schools one can possibly imagine.\n1. Infrastructure\nCharger and non-connected network plug\nAs already indicated in the introduction the setup and subsequent maintenance of any sort of technical or logistical infrastructure faces tough challenges given Peru\u2019s geography.\nOn the technical side these challenges certainly haven\u2019t been adequately addressed as a recent evaluation by the Inter-American Development Bank found that almost 5% of the schools which have already received XOs don\u2019t even have electricity yet. In terms of Internet access only 1.4% of the schools are connected at the moment. It\u2019s clear that such a situation makes the implementation of a 1-to-1 computing in education project very hard indeed.\nThe fact that laptops were distributed to schools without electricity points to several underlying issues. The first one is that the Ministry of Education\u2019s data on the infrastructure available at schools doesn\u2019t seem to be up to date and accurate enough. One example is that a school with a single outlet in the principal\u2019s office is officially listed as having electricity yet obviously this isn\u2019t going to be enough to power several dozen laptops.\nSecondly it seems like not enough time was spent on planning the implementation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. An example in this area is the way Peru handles the activation and anti-theft system on the XO laptops. Uruguay keeps a database of which child owns which specific laptop (identified by its serial number) which allows for laptops to be remotely disabled when they\u2019re reported stolen. Peru\u2019s database however only includes information as to which batches of laptops were sent to which schools. This lack of granular information means that an anti-theft system such as the one used in Uruguay simply can\u2019t be implemented.\nSome of these problems might also be explained by how the implementation of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is organized. Whereas Uruguay, Paraguay, and most other countries have separate entities focusing on their OLPC efforts in Peru it\u2019s only one of several initiatives that the Ministry of Education\u2019s DIGETE (Direcci\u00f3n General de Tecnolog\u00edas Educativas \u2013 Directorate General of Educational Technologies) is tasked with. In combination with a relatively small number of staff this results in seemingly not enough time and resources being available for Una laptop por ni\u00f1o.\nOverall it\u2019s quite obvious that the infrastructure within which Peru\u2019s OLPC project is taking place leaves much to be desired. Whether it\u2019s very obvious problems such as the lack of electricity at schools which received XOs or less obvious ones such as the lack of a central database matching pupils to laptops it\u2019s clear that they will negatively impact the project and make things significantly harder.\nOne of 45,000 solar panels\nMany of these issues seem to be the result of planning oversights and while these can undoubtedly be corrected it will require a significant overhaul of the whole strategy as well as the availability of additional resources. A first step into that direction was the purchase of 45,000 solar panels which are currently being distributed to schools without electricity access. While this will certainly improve the situation in many cases it\u2019s still not a perfect solution given that many of the schools are located in regions with extended rainy seasons which will render solar panels useless for extended periods of time.\n2. Maintenance\nWhen it comes to maintenance Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is very much relying on existing infrastructure and responsibilities within the education system to deal with XOs that aren\u2019t working.\nOn the lowest level teachers receive some basic training to deal with issues such as failures of the activation system or other software problems which can be fixed relatively easily. If a problem that can\u2019t be solved at the school itself is encountered, the next level of support is provided by the local UGEL (Unidades de Gesti\u00f3n Educativa Local \u2013 Local Education Management Unit). On this level, generally one person who is responsible for all technology-related education projects has received additional training to deal with more complex software issues as well as simple hardware repairs.\nThe next step up the ladder is the DRE (Direccion Regional de Educacion \u2013 Regional Directorate of Education) which provides a stock of spare XOs which can be used as replacement units or as a source for spare parts. Only if none of these entities is able to fix the laptop, is it then sent to a central repair facility in Lima.\nUna laptop por ni\u00f1o repair center\nWhile this system might look good on paper it runs into a variety of issues in practice. The first problem is that many teachers don\u2019t have a USB flash drive which allows them to store the data needed to fix simple software issues. Secondly these repairs also seem to overwhelm teachers, many of whom had never used a computer before they received their XO. The fact that the commands required to fix common issues are in English, in combination with the lack of handouts or digital guides, provides another barrier.\nAs a result many laptops remain unusable once they\u2019re broken as teachers aren\u2019t able to repair them themselves and when their schools are located in remote regions, it might take several weeks or months until they can be handed over to the respective UGEL. Similarly the UGELs and DREs often don\u2019t have the spare parts or extra machines to deal with breakages either, and getting new stock from Lima often takes more than three months.\nThe overall result of this situation is that broken machines don\u2019t get reported and don\u2019t get replaced, which means that there are pupils who often have to share their XO with someone else rather than having their own laptop. While I\u2019m not aware of any larger evaluation of this situation, my own experiences as well as those of people I talked to indicate that this is indeed a country-wide problem.\nIn the end Una laptop por ni\u00f1o demonstrates that even a theoretically well planned maintenance system can run into serious issues in practice.

However as described in the community involvement section this also requires institutional support which at least in some cases wasn\u2019t provided in Peru.\nSummary and Outlook\nUndoubtedly Peru\u2019s Una laptop por ni\u00f1o offers many valuable lessons for ICT4E projects however in the grand majority of cases these will be how NOT to do something. There is no doubt that of the three South American countries I visited, Peru is the most physically challenging environment for a nation-wide 1-to-1 computing in education project. Even with a perfect implementation this would be a difficult undertaking, and with the plethora of issues and problems that the project\u2019s execution has exposed, the results and impacts \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 are bound to be underwhelming.\nThis is not to say that everything about Una laptop por ni\u00f1o is bad. It has undoubtedly opened enormous possibilities for thousands of teachers and pupils which will come up with interesting and creative ways to use the XOs and learn a lot in the process. Yet there\u2019s no doubt that the majority of teachers and pupils as well as other stakeholder such as administrators and parents will hardly see any benefit from the initiative.\nWhile not necessarily directly related to the early lackluster evaluation results, it is interesting to see that in mid-2010 DIGETE significantly changed the strategy of Una laptop por ni\u00f1o. While the main target until then had been rural multi-grade schools with a single teacher, the upcoming 300,000 XOs will be distributed to larger and often urban schools. At the same time this phase of the project will no longer be traditional 1-to-1 computing. The new XO laptops will be used to set up CRTs (Centro de Recursos Tecnol\u00f3gicos \u2013 Center for Technology Resources) \u2013 basically mobile computer labs \u2013 at every remaining primary school in the country. This is indeed a very intriguing development, and I\u2019m sure many people will closely watch how this new strategy works out compared to the old one.\nOLPC in Peru is part of an overview of OLPC in South America , a first-hand report of XO laptop deployments in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru by Christoph Derndorfer.\nDon\u2019t miss a moment of the action!\nSubscribe now and get the latest articles from Educational Technology Debate sent directly to your inbox.\n"}, {"score": 352.98553, "uuid": "b18ee079-7f80-52a2-bdd1-7cde8b7f3cb5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-40-28170", "target_hostname": "www.sbcanning.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sbcanning.com/2011/01/mustards-and-snow-storm-in-our-nations.html", "page_rank": 1.1734255e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": ": Mustard&#x27;s and <em>the</em> snow storm in our Nation&#x27;s Capitol", "snippet": "Powdered and Liquid Pectin are not all <em>the</em> same.

The flights were smooth and the turbulence was at a minimum. We arrived, my dad and I, to Washington DC to find out that this evening they are expecting five inches of snow. Not what I wanted to hear! I just left sunny and beautiful Santa Barbara for 37 degrees and nasty weather. Do you think if I click my heels together three times I could get out of here and back to Oz? Or someplace warmer? We will only be here a few days and I will try to make the best of it!\nNow I believe that I have spoke to soon. Tonight, Wednesday, at 5pm I left our nations capitol after hours of business meetings headed for Arlington Virginia which is about 10 miles south. Four hours later, white knuckles, and three episodes of politely telling my father to be quiet so that I could focus in the \"white out\" of snow, we made it back to our hotel. (Clicking my heels, Clicking my heels.)\nOn another note, over the last few days I have been thinking a lot about what I want to do for the month of February with regard to canning. I have been doing some research and finding that my pantry is missing some essential ingredients that I am still purchasing at the store. Those are condiments. The ketchup, mustard, marinades, sauces, and dips that fill the inner doors of my refrigerator that always seem to sit there because it was a brand on sale and it wasn't very good. So I have decided that it is time for me to donate those bottles to others and create my own pantry of condiments with flavors I create and can put up for later.\nMy first recipe venture was in pursuit of mustard. I have had some experience with this condiment in the past as I have made the Beer mustard and it's posted on my recipe list. It was a whole grain mustard and had a bit of kick but I want some different flavors to offer. Below are five new recipes that I found over various sites and books that I will be working on in February. I will post the pictures and outcomes later. But here are the recipes.\nSri Lanken Mustard\n6 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds\n4 cloves garlic, diced\n1 & 1/2 inch slice ginger, peeled and diced\n1 cup apple cider vinegar\n3 teaspoons cayenne powder\n3 1/2 teaspoons sea salt\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric\n4 teaspoons sugar\nPlace mustard seeds, garlic and ginger in a bowl or jar and cover with the vinegar. Let stand for 24 hours at room temperature. Place vinegar mixture in blender, add cayenne, salt, turmeric and sugar and blend until a creamy consistency is reached. You can add a bit more vinegar if it is too dry. Once you have blended it ladle into jars leaving 1/2\" headspace and water bath for 15 minutes.

Hofstadter is best-known for his book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach (GEB for short). In his latest book, I am a Strange Loop, he visits once again many of the themes originally presented in that book.\nThe interview below was conducted in September 2007 and was originally published, in Hebrew, in the online culture magazine Haayal Hakore .\nThe interview was conducted by Tal Cohen and Yarden Nir-Buchbinder.\nThe first part of I am a Strange Loop reads like a condensed version of GEB, by explaining the idea of consciousness as a strange loop. However, unlike in GEB, you do not discuss AI in this book. Are you disappointed with the way cognitive/AI research has advanced in the past three decades? Did you, like many other researchers of the time, believe that intelligent machines are \u201cjust around the corner\u201d? And if so, do you still believe it will happen, eventually?\nI certainly did not believe intelligent machines were just around the corner when I wrote GEB. [Chapter 19] of GEB makes that very clear indeed.\nAm I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI in the past 30 years or so? Not at all. To the contrary, I would have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching human intelligence \u2014 it would have made me fear that our minds and souls were not deep. Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity, and I certainly don't want (and never wanted) that to happen.\nI am a deep admirer of humanity at its finest and deepest and most powerful \u2014 of great people such as Helen Keller, Albert Einstein, Ella Fitzgerald, Albert Schweitzer, Frederic Chopin, Raoul Wallenberg, Fats Waller, and on and on. I find endless depth in such people (many more are listed on [chapter 17] of I Am a Strange Loop), and I would hate to think that all that beauty and profundity and goodness could be captured \u2014 even approximated in any way at all! \u2014 in the horribly rigid computational devices of our era.\nDo I still believe it will happen someday? I can't say for sure, but I suppose it will eventually, yes. I wouldn't want to be around then, though. Such a world would be too alien for me. I prefer living in a world where computers are still very very stupid. And I get a huge kick out of laughing at the hilariously unpredictable inflexibility of the computer models of mental processes that my doctoral students and I co-design. It helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind.\nIndeed, I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to go in our quest for AI. I think of this seemingly \u201cpessimistic\u201d view of mine as being in fact a profound kind of optimism, whereas the seemingly \u201coptimistic\u201d visions of Ray Kurzweil and others strike me as actually being a deeply pessimistic view of the nature of the human mind. (I say all this much more poetically on p. 522 of Le Ton beau de Marot , by the way.)\nWe'll return to Kurzweil soon.\nYou use the word \u201csoul\u201d, rather than consciousness. While you clearly qualified the term to remove any religious connotations, avoiding such connotations is not really possible; \u201csoul\u201d is a very loaded symbol in this respect. Why did you choose to use it, and not, for example, \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d or any of several other, less-loaded alternatives?\nI used the word \u201csoul\u201d because, out of all the various words that one might use \u2014 \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201cintentionality\u201d, \u201cmind\u201d, and so forth \u2014 it is the one that I think most evocatively suggests the deep mystery of first-person existence that any philosophically inclined person must wonder about many times during their life. But I think that the first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d is just as evocative a word for the same thing. I could also have used the word \u201cspirit\u201d, I guess, but that, too, would have seemed loaded with religious flavor to many readers.\nThe point is, whenever one talks about what life is, from the inside, one gets very close to what religion itself is all about. It therefore shouldn't be too big a surprise that I appropriated a religion-flavored word to talk about a deep mystery that is so close to the very core of religion.\nOne of the most surprising arguments in the book (it has in fact appeared in his previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is the idea that the soul outlives the body by having its copies, or \u201csoul-shards\u201d, exist in many brains \u2014 the brains of other people, who have known the deceased; perhaps a stronger variation of the idea that a person lives so long as others remember him.\nYou present a compelling argument for the notion of a soul surviving its physical body by being spread across multiple brains; the more a person is familiar to others, the better his soul is \u201cpresent\u201d in their brain, too. How will you respond to the claim that the \u201cpresence\u201d of one soul in another soul's brain is merely a simulation mechanism, developed by the evolution process as a means to improve survival? (Being able to predict what members of your clan are about to do can certainly be a powerful survival tool.)\nMy argument in I Am a Strange Loop is spelled out clearly. If a person's soul is truly a pattern, then it can be realized in different media. Wherever that pattern exists in a sufficiently fine-grained way, then it is, by my definition, the soul itself and not some kind of \u201cmere simulation\u201d of it.\n\u201cMere simulation\u201d is a phrase that sounds suspiciously like John Searle when he is contemptuously deriding AI in his usual flippant fashion. However, as I see it, there is no black-and-white dividing line between \u201cmere simulations\u201d of a complex entity and full realizations of it \u2014 there are just lots and lots of shades of gray all along the way. This spectrum is pointed out in many places in my books, including the three marvelous short stories by Stanislaw Lem included in The Mind's I.\nWe'll get back to Lem's books, too...\nIf indeed a soul can survive by being present in other brains, then certain souls survive for many centuries after their primary brain is gone. You provide an example with Frederic Chopin, saying that \u201cChopin, the actual person, survives so much in our world, even today\u201d.\nA common saying is that authors are \u201cimmortalized\u201d by their books. Your notion of soul-shards casts a whole new light on this idea, suggesting that authors (and artists, such as musicians) truly extend the survival of their soul by making their works well-known. In this sense, it seems like your own books make a huge effort to familiarize the readers with your inner life, the making of your soul; for example, where most authors would have written \u201cMy fabric was greatly influenced by many people, from Niels Bohr to Charlie Brown\u201d, you provide a detailed list of over 45 names. The book (and your previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is peppered with scores of anecdotes about your personal life. As a reader, I certainly feel like I know you much better than I know most other authors, certainly authors of non-fiction works. Can this be viewed as an attempt to entrench shards of your soul in the minds of your readers? Is this your shot at immortality?\nI am not shooting at immortality through my books, no. Nor do I think Chopin was shooting at immortality through his music. That strikes me as a very selfish goal, and I don't think Chopin was particularly selfish. I would also say that I think that music comes much closer to capturing the essence of a composer's soul than do a writer's ideas capture the writer's soul. Perhaps some very emotional ideas that I express in my books can get across a bit of the essence of my soul to some readers, but I think that Chopin's music probably does a lot better job (and the same holds, of course, for many composers).\nI personally don't have any thoughts about \u201cshooting for immortality\u201d when I write. I try to write simply in order to get ideas out there that I believe in and find fascinating, because I'd like to let other people be able share those ideas. But intellectual ideas alone, no matter how fascinating they are, are not enough to transmit a soul across brains. Perhaps, as I say, my autobiographical passages \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 get tiny shards of my soul across to some people. But such autobiographical story-telling is not nearly as effective a means of soul-transmission as is living with someone you love for many years of your lives, and sharing profound life goals with them \u2014 that's for sure!\nScientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil presents a different take at immortality, a more physical one. Like you, Kurzweil views the soul as \u201csoftware\u201d that can be executed on different \u201chardware\u201d. He further believes that in a relatively short while, we will have electronic hardware which is the equivalent of the human brain (which you eloquently characterize as a \u201cuniversal machine\u201d, capable as \u201cexecuting\u201d any \u201csoul software\u201d). Once such hardware is available, Kurzweil believes immortality would have been reached: by \u201cdownloading\u201d our soul-software onto electronic brains (\u201cGiant Electronic Brains\u201d?), we will become immortals, able to create backups of our souls to be restored in case of disaster, and able to shift our physical location anywhere in the speed of a software download.\nDo you share Kurzweil's view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future? Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality \u2014 will the software running on the electronic brain be the same \u201cI\u201d?\nI think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death. I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity, but I think it badly distorts his vision. As I see it, Kurzweil's desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity.\nI think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast (Moore's Law, etc.) that inevitably, within a few decades, hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable. A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human's mind with perfect accuracy, because trillions of tiny \u201cnanobots\u201d will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the \u201cwiring details\u201d of that particular brain, which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron-firings, and presto \u2014 that individual's mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium. (This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece \u201cA Conversation with Einstein's Brain\u201d toward the end of The Mind's I, actually, with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything \u2014 it's all done in the pages of a huge book, with a human being playing the role of the processor.)\nThe cover of Kurzweil's book.\nRather ironically, this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI, because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it's a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media. And thus, says Kurzweil, we will have achieved immortal souls that live on (and potentially forever) in superfast computational hardware \u2014 and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus \u201cuploaded\u201d into superfast hardware and hence he expects (or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects) to become literally immortal \u2014 and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal, with just little shards of his soul remaining, but with his whole soul preserved forever.\nWell, the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy; it has to live in a vastly complex world, and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls, commingling with them just as we do here on earth. To be sure, Kurzweil sees those things as no problem, either \u2014 we'll have virtual worlds galore, \u201cup there\u201d in Cyberheaven, and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware. And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways.\nWell, to me, this \u201cglorious\u201d new world would be the end of humanity as we know it. If such a vision comes to pass, it certainly would spell the end of human life. Once again, I don't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass. But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time. How long? I just don't know. Centuries, at least. But I don't know. I'm not a futurologist in the least. But Kurzweil is far more \u201coptimistic\u201d (i.e., depressingly pessimistic, from my perspective) about the pace at which all these world-shaking changes will take place.\nIn any case, the vision that Kurzweil offers (and other very smart people offer it too, such as Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, perhaps Marvin Minsky, and many others \u2014 usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen-age sci-fi addicts, I have to say) is repugnant to me. On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian, but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy. \u201cMe, me, me!\u201d is how it sounds to me \u2014 \u201cI want to live forever!\u201d But who knows? I don't even like thinking about this nutty technology-glorifying scenario, now usually called \u201cThe Singularity\u201d (also called by some \u201cThe Rapture of the Nerds\u201d \u2014 a great phrase!) \u2014 it just gives me the creeps. Sorry!\nAnother surprising argument in the book is the almost Zennish claim that the soul is nothing but an illusion; an illusion that exists because it hallucinates itself. Perhaps we can say that Hofstadter's answer to the psychophysical problem is simply, \u201cThere is no problem, because there is no psycho. We just imagine it\u201d \u2014 and the fact we imagine it is what leads, in fact, to the psycho's existence. This is the heart of the strange loop that lends its name to the book. The illusion stems from the brain's need to create an internal representation of its surrounding (for survival purposes), and part of this representation necessarily includes the brain itself, the \u201cI\u201d, a mechanism that represents itself and thereby leads to its very existence. Clearly, not every brain represents itself with equal level of detail; animals, for example, represent the world in their brain in an inferior manner, and hence their self-representation \u2014 including their \u201cI\u201d, or their \u201csoul\u201d \u2014 is inferior; perhaps one could say that they hallucinate less... (Before you criticize the idea, please bear in mind that this brief outline probably does it a disservice; you'll have to read the book to fully understand this theory, even if you disagree.)\nFor the sake of discussion, Hofstadter came up with a \u201cscale\u201d for measuring the \u201csoul level\u201d of different brains: the Huneker scale. It is named after James Huneker, a music critic who said, in the early 1900's, that \u201cSmall-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers,\u201d should not attempt playing a certain piano piece by Chopin.\nYou claim that an \u201cI\u201d is nothing but a myth, a hallucination perceived by a hallucination. Certainly, from this point of view, one can assume that there is nothing sacred about souls. Yet you seem to hold souls as sacred, being, for example, a vegetarian. Aren't those views somewhat conflicting? If a soul is not real, and is nothing but the high-level result of bio-chemical processes, why care about the survival of other souls (and in particular \u201clow-huneker\u201d souls)?\nI can't explain this completely rationally. Sure, my brain falls for the universal myth of the \u201cI\u201d \u2014 the great hallucination, if you prefer \u2014 just as powerfully as does any other human brain. And this hallucination inevitably gives rise to compassion and empathy (yes, merely empathy for other hallucinations, if you will, but that's just how it is). At some point, in any case, my compassion for other \u201cbeings\u201d led me very naturally to finding it unacceptable to destroy other sentient beings (or other hallucinations, if you prefer), such as cows and pigs and lambs and fish and chickens, in order to consume their flesh, even if I knew that their (hallucinated) sentience wasn't quite as high as the (hallucinated) sentience of human beings.\nWhere or on what basis to draw the line? How many hunekers merit respect? I didn't know exactly. I decided once to draw the line between mammals and the rest of the animal world, and I stayed with that decision for about twenty years. Recently, however \u2014 just a couple of years ago, while I was writing I Am a Strange Loop, and thus being forced (by myself) to think all these issues through very intensely once again \u2014 I \u201clowered\u201d my personal line, and I stopped eating animals of any sort or \u201csize\u201d. I feel more at ease with myself this way, although I do suspect, at times, that I may have gone a little too far. But I'd rather give a too-large tip to a server than a too-small one, and this is analogous. I'd rather err on the side of generosity than on the other side, so I'm vegetarian. (However, I don't worry about the souls of tomatoes, as I point out in Chapter 1 of I Am a Strange Loop.)\nNear the end of the book, you discuss performances of Bach's music. Are there any modern performers that you esteem in particular? How about variations on Bach? Playing Bach in jazz-style is very common, for example.\nI don't pay all that much attention to who is performing classical music, because for me most top-notch performers sound very similar to each other. There are of course subtle differences between great performers, but what counts most for me is the composer's sequence of notes and harmonies, and that's always there, just about perfectly. Small variations on how the notes and harmonies are produced can have small effects, but that's all. Classical music is about the profound meanings put there by the composer, not about subtle tweaks on it brought out by the performer. At least that's how I see it.\nYou know how much I love analogies \u2014 well, here's one. To me, hearing lots of great performers perform the same piece (and I once had just such an experience \u2014 I was at a music festival in Aspen, Colorado where a whole bunch of stunningly talented young pianists performed the very beautiful first movement of the Schumann piano concerto one after the other, and I listened for a couple of hours, and it was fascinating) is like watching the greatest slalom-skiers in the world on television as they compete against each other in the Olympics. They're all unbelievably great at what they do, and they all come down the very long hill within a second or two of each other, sometimes separated by only tenths or hundredths of a second! The differences between them are almost microscopic, in the end. They are all beautiful to watch but I can't tell one from the other. If somebody told me that they were all the same person wearing different-color uniforms, I wouldn't shout \u201cImpossible!\u201d Would you?\nMind you, this takes nothing away from such people's enormous talent, but it just says that many different gifted people can carry out nearly indistinguishable marvelous feats that I myself could never aspire to do at all. What they do is hugely impressive, but the differences between the performances of these hugely gifted and hard-working individuals are not all that great. And as in skiing, so in performance of classical music.\nIncidentally, to be very clear on this, I would say it's a totally different ballgame when it comes to jazz and popular music, because in those cases liberties galore are taken by all performers \u2014 inserting one's own personality is the name of the game! \u201cThe very same song\u201d as sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra can be unbelievably different (and of course this vast difference is also due in large part to the musicians in the bands accompanying the singers, as well as to the vastly different arrangements). In jazz and popular music, who is playing or singing counts enormously much for me. It makes all the difference in the world. But in classical music, who is performing counts for far far less, as long as we are dealing with a highly talented performer.\nI have to add that literary translation is a lot more like jazz or pop music than it is like performance of classical music, because once again, the personality of the translator becomes an intrinsic and central part of the \u201cvoice\u201d that is speaking. That is inevitable, and it is why translation is such a deep and important art.\nTranslation is another subject in which Hofstadter finds great interest, ever since he helped translate GEB to French. Translation is the key subject of Le Ton beau de Marot, and Hofstadter returns to it in this interview's final question. In fact, he uses this question to tie everything together:\nWhen presenting questions about the soul, I am a Strange Loop (like several of the articles in The Mind's I) draws on science-fiction themes, such as teleportation. Yet the list of influential people in your life includes no SF authors, and the only SF character in that list is Captain Nemo. Do you read science fiction at all? What are your thoughts on this genre?\nWhen I was around ten or twelve, I liked science fiction (I still vividly recall some aspects of the novel Red Planet by Robert Heinlein) and found it very stimulating, but after a while I grew tired of it. Nonetheless, I do admire a few science-fiction authors, such as Robert L. Forward (who was a professional physicist \u2014 he's the author of Dragon's Egg, to which I devote nearly a whole chapter in Le Ton beau de Marot) and Stanislaw Lem (author of The Cyberiad , among many other books, from which two wonderful short pieces in The Mind's I are taken \u2014 and his separate piece Non Serviam is also included in The Mind's I). But even Lem, despite all his scientific subtlety and philosophical insight, occasionally troubles me (I remember I once read some long novel by him that I couldn't stand!). The problem is that too many liberties are taken and one can't really believe in the scenarios any more.\nI guess I am pretty old-fashioned in my literary tastes. I like a powerful, believable novel, such as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, by Khaled Hosseini, which both take place in Afghanistan, and of course The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and Vikram Seth's wonderful novel-in-verse The Golden Gate.\nThat last novel, by the way, was inspired by Pushkin's spectacular novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. I was in fact led to Eugene Onegin by meeting Seth for a coffee some twenty years ago in a Palo Alto bookstore and learning on that occasion about how he had been deeply inspired by Charles Johnston's English rendition of EO, and shortly thereafter I eagerly gobbled down several English translations of EO (including Johnston's, of course), in the process falling deeply in love with James Falen's intoxicatingly beautiful version of EO. That love affair then inevitably led me, a few years later, to tackling the Russian original \u2014 and to my utter astonishment, I wound up memorizing huge chunks of it (as do the Russians themselves), and then translating the entire novel-in-verse into English verse myself. That year-long adventure was one of the most wonderful episodes of my entire life, and I tell the whole story in my Translator's Preface to that book.\nTranslating EO into my own style of English verse, and seeing it in other people's styles in English, French, German, Italian, etc., gave me lots of metaphors for thinking about the human soul and how it can survive in other media \u2014 after all, here was the \u201csoul of Russian literature\u201d (for that's truly how Russians conceive of Eugene Onegin, although non-Russians don't generally know that) being transplanted into a radically different medium and yet surviving beautifully in, say, James Falen's or Babette Deutsch's anglicizations (and possibly in mine as well, but I can't be objective on that score).\nI often wondered about the hypothetical sci-fi scenario in which all traces of the Russian original were destroyed, so that all that was left of Eugene Onegin was, say, James Falen's English version of it \u2014 would Eugene Onegin have survived? And my answer always was a categorical and unmitigated \u201cYes!\u201d And that's how I think about the survival of human souls in other human brains \u2014 it's just that the \u201ctranslations\u201d of souls aren't nearly as high-quality as Falen's is of Pushkin's original. That's too bad, but it's life. You take what you can get.\nPushkin puts it this way, in stanza 38 of Chapter II of Eugene Onegin, in my translation (he's speaking of the young would-be poet named Lensky, who is in a cemetery standing near the graves of his parents and brooding poetically about life's all-too-fleeting nature):\nAnd there he, on the the stark, dark marker\nAtop his parents' graves, shed tears,\nAnd praised their ashes \u2014 darker, starker.\nAlas, life reaps too fast its years;\nAll flesh is grass. Each generation,\nAt heaven's hidden motivation,\nArises, blooms, and falls from grace;\nAnother quickly takes its place.\nAnd thus our race, rash and impetuous,\nAscends and has its day, then raves\nAnd hastens toward ancestral graves.\nAll too soon, death's sting will get to us;\nAye, how our children's children rush\nAnd push us from this world's sweet crush.\nNotice, by the way, the captial \u201cA\u201d at the beginning of each line \u2014 just a whim of mine that I indulged myself in (and which, I think, improved the stanza's quality, since this extra self-imposed constraint forced me to pay incredibly close attention to each and every word choice in each and every line to make everything flow effortlessly despite the constraint).\nAnd here, just for the sake of comparison, is James Falen's marvelously mellifluous and lyrical version of that same stanza:\nAnd then with verse of quickened sadness\nHe honored too, in tears and pain,\nHis parents' dust... their memory's gladness...\nAlas! Upon life's furrowed plain \u2014\nA harvest brief, each generation,\nBy fate's mysterious dispensation,\nArises, ripens, and must fall;\nThen others too must heed the call.\nFor thus our giddy race gains power:\nIt waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,\nThen crowds its forebears toward the grave.\nAnd we as well shall face that hour\nWhen one fine day our grandsons true\nStraight out of life will crowd us too!\nI hope that by comparing these two English versions of the Russian original, you can get a sense for how \u201cthe same pattern\u201d exists in them all \u2014 two of them in the medium or substrate of English, and one of them (unseen here) in the substrate of Russian. To me, this is a wonderful metaphor for soul transplantation.\nNew Reviews Notification\nTo receive notifications as new reviews are published, consider registering .

Hofstadter is best-known for his book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach (GEB for short). In his latest book, I am a Strange Loop, he visits once again many of the themes originally presented in that book.\nThe interview below was conducted in September 2007 and was originally published, in Hebrew, in the online culture magazine Haayal Hakore .\nThe interview was conducted by Tal Cohen and Yarden Nir-Buchbinder.\nThe first part of I am a Strange Loop reads like a condensed version of GEB, by explaining the idea of consciousness as a strange loop. However, unlike in GEB, you do not discuss AI in this book. Are you disappointed with the way cognitive/AI research has advanced in the past three decades? Did you, like many other researchers of the time, believe that intelligent machines are \u201cjust around the corner\u201d? And if so, do you still believe it will happen, eventually?\nI certainly did not believe intelligent machines were just around the corner when I wrote GEB. [Chapter 19] of GEB makes that very clear indeed.\nAm I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI in the past 30 years or so? Not at all. To the contrary, I would have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching human intelligence \u2014 it would have made me fear that our minds and souls were not deep. Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity, and I certainly don't want (and never wanted) that to happen.\nI am a deep admirer of humanity at its finest and deepest and most powerful \u2014 of great people such as Helen Keller, Albert Einstein, Ella Fitzgerald, Albert Schweitzer, Frederic Chopin, Raoul Wallenberg, Fats Waller, and on and on. I find endless depth in such people (many more are listed on [chapter 17] of I Am a Strange Loop), and I would hate to think that all that beauty and profundity and goodness could be captured \u2014 even approximated in any way at all! \u2014 in the horribly rigid computational devices of our era.\nDo I still believe it will happen someday? I can't say for sure, but I suppose it will eventually, yes. I wouldn't want to be around then, though. Such a world would be too alien for me. I prefer living in a world where computers are still very very stupid. And I get a huge kick out of laughing at the hilariously unpredictable inflexibility of the computer models of mental processes that my doctoral students and I co-design. It helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind.\nIndeed, I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to go in our quest for AI. I think of this seemingly \u201cpessimistic\u201d view of mine as being in fact a profound kind of optimism, whereas the seemingly \u201coptimistic\u201d visions of Ray Kurzweil and others strike me as actually being a deeply pessimistic view of the nature of the human mind. (I say all this much more poetically on p. 522 of Le Ton beau de Marot , by the way.)\nWe'll return to Kurzweil soon.\nYou use the word \u201csoul\u201d, rather than consciousness. While you clearly qualified the term to remove any religious connotations, avoiding such connotations is not really possible; \u201csoul\u201d is a very loaded symbol in this respect. Why did you choose to use it, and not, for example, \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d or any of several other, less-loaded alternatives?\nI used the word \u201csoul\u201d because, out of all the various words that one might use \u2014 \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201cintentionality\u201d, \u201cmind\u201d, and so forth \u2014 it is the one that I think most evocatively suggests the deep mystery of first-person existence that any philosophically inclined person must wonder about many times during their life. But I think that the first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d is just as evocative a word for the same thing. I could also have used the word \u201cspirit\u201d, I guess, but that, too, would have seemed loaded with religious flavor to many readers.\nThe point is, whenever one talks about what life is, from the inside, one gets very close to what religion itself is all about. It therefore shouldn't be too big a surprise that I appropriated a religion-flavored word to talk about a deep mystery that is so close to the very core of religion.\nOne of the most surprising arguments in the book (it has in fact appeared in his previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is the idea that the soul outlives the body by having its copies, or \u201csoul-shards\u201d, exist in many brains \u2014 the brains of other people, who have known the deceased; perhaps a stronger variation of the idea that a person lives so long as others remember him.\nYou present a compelling argument for the notion of a soul surviving its physical body by being spread across multiple brains; the more a person is familiar to others, the better his soul is \u201cpresent\u201d in their brain, too. How will you respond to the claim that the \u201cpresence\u201d of one soul in another soul's brain is merely a simulation mechanism, developed by the evolution process as a means to improve survival? (Being able to predict what members of your clan are about to do can certainly be a powerful survival tool.)\nMy argument in I Am a Strange Loop is spelled out clearly. If a person's soul is truly a pattern, then it can be realized in different media. Wherever that pattern exists in a sufficiently fine-grained way, then it is, by my definition, the soul itself and not some kind of \u201cmere simulation\u201d of it.\n\u201cMere simulation\u201d is a phrase that sounds suspiciously like John Searle when he is contemptuously deriding AI in his usual flippant fashion. However, as I see it, there is no black-and-white dividing line between \u201cmere simulations\u201d of a complex entity and full realizations of it \u2014 there are just lots and lots of shades of gray all along the way. This spectrum is pointed out in many places in my books, including the three marvelous short stories by Stanislaw Lem included in The Mind's I.\nWe'll get back to Lem's books, too...\nIf indeed a soul can survive by being present in other brains, then certain souls survive for many centuries after their primary brain is gone. You provide an example with Frederic Chopin, saying that \u201cChopin, the actual person, survives so much in our world, even today\u201d.\nA common saying is that authors are \u201cimmortalized\u201d by their books. Your notion of soul-shards casts a whole new light on this idea, suggesting that authors (and artists, such as musicians) truly extend the survival of their soul by making their works well-known. In this sense, it seems like your own books make a huge effort to familiarize the readers with your inner life, the making of your soul; for example, where most authors would have written \u201cMy fabric was greatly influenced by many people, from Niels Bohr to Charlie Brown\u201d, you provide a detailed list of over 45 names. The book (and your previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is peppered with scores of anecdotes about your personal life. As a reader, I certainly feel like I know you much better than I know most other authors, certainly authors of non-fiction works. Can this be viewed as an attempt to entrench shards of your soul in the minds of your readers? Is this your shot at immortality?\nI am not shooting at immortality through my books, no. Nor do I think Chopin was shooting at immortality through his music. That strikes me as a very selfish goal, and I don't think Chopin was particularly selfish. I would also say that I think that music comes much closer to capturing the essence of a composer's soul than do a writer's ideas capture the writer's soul. Perhaps some very emotional ideas that I express in my books can get across a bit of the essence of my soul to some readers, but I think that Chopin's music probably does a lot better job (and the same holds, of course, for many composers).\nI personally don't have any thoughts about \u201cshooting for immortality\u201d when I write. I try to write simply in order to get ideas out there that I believe in and find fascinating, because I'd like to let other people be able share those ideas. But intellectual ideas alone, no matter how fascinating they are, are not enough to transmit a soul across brains. Perhaps, as I say, my autobiographical passages \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 get tiny shards of my soul across to some people. But such autobiographical story-telling is not nearly as effective a means of soul-transmission as is living with someone you love for many years of your lives, and sharing profound life goals with them \u2014 that's for sure!\nScientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil presents a different take at immortality, a more physical one. Like you, Kurzweil views the soul as \u201csoftware\u201d that can be executed on different \u201chardware\u201d. He further believes that in a relatively short while, we will have electronic hardware which is the equivalent of the human brain (which you eloquently characterize as a \u201cuniversal machine\u201d, capable as \u201cexecuting\u201d any \u201csoul software\u201d). Once such hardware is available, Kurzweil believes immortality would have been reached: by \u201cdownloading\u201d our soul-software onto electronic brains (\u201cGiant Electronic Brains\u201d?), we will become immortals, able to create backups of our souls to be restored in case of disaster, and able to shift our physical location anywhere in the speed of a software download.\nDo you share Kurzweil's view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future? Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality \u2014 will the software running on the electronic brain be the same \u201cI\u201d?\nI think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death. I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity, but I think it badly distorts his vision. As I see it, Kurzweil's desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity.\nI think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast (Moore's Law, etc.) that inevitably, within a few decades, hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable. A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human's mind with perfect accuracy, because trillions of tiny \u201cnanobots\u201d will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the \u201cwiring details\u201d of that particular brain, which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron-firings, and presto \u2014 that individual's mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium. (This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece \u201cA Conversation with Einstein's Brain\u201d toward the end of The Mind's I, actually, with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything \u2014 it's all done in the pages of a huge book, with a human being playing the role of the processor.)\nThe cover of Kurzweil's book.\nRather ironically, this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI, because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it's a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media. And thus, says Kurzweil, we will have achieved immortal souls that live on (and potentially forever) in superfast computational hardware \u2014 and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus \u201cuploaded\u201d into superfast hardware and hence he expects (or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects) to become literally immortal \u2014 and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal, with just little shards of his soul remaining, but with his whole soul preserved forever.\nWell, the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy; it has to live in a vastly complex world, and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls, commingling with them just as we do here on earth. To be sure, Kurzweil sees those things as no problem, either \u2014 we'll have virtual worlds galore, \u201cup there\u201d in Cyberheaven, and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware. And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways.\nWell, to me, this \u201cglorious\u201d new world would be the end of humanity as we know it. If such a vision comes to pass, it certainly would spell the end of human life. Once again, I don't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass. But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time. How long? I just don't know. Centuries, at least. But I don't know. I'm not a futurologist in the least. But Kurzweil is far more \u201coptimistic\u201d (i.e., depressingly pessimistic, from my perspective) about the pace at which all these world-shaking changes will take place.\nIn any case, the vision that Kurzweil offers (and other very smart people offer it too, such as Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, perhaps Marvin Minsky, and many others \u2014 usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen-age sci-fi addicts, I have to say) is repugnant to me. On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian, but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy. \u201cMe, me, me!\u201d is how it sounds to me \u2014 \u201cI want to live forever!\u201d But who knows? I don't even like thinking about this nutty technology-glorifying scenario, now usually called \u201cThe Singularity\u201d (also called by some \u201cThe Rapture of the Nerds\u201d \u2014 a great phrase!) \u2014 it just gives me the creeps. Sorry!\nAnother surprising argument in the book is the almost Zennish claim that the soul is nothing but an illusion; an illusion that exists because it hallucinates itself. Perhaps we can say that Hofstadter's answer to the psychophysical problem is simply, \u201cThere is no problem, because there is no psycho. We just imagine it\u201d \u2014 and the fact we imagine it is what leads, in fact, to the psycho's existence. This is the heart of the strange loop that lends its name to the book. The illusion stems from the brain's need to create an internal representation of its surrounding (for survival purposes), and part of this representation necessarily includes the brain itself, the \u201cI\u201d, a mechanism that represents itself and thereby leads to its very existence. Clearly, not every brain represents itself with equal level of detail; animals, for example, represent the world in their brain in an inferior manner, and hence their self-representation \u2014 including their \u201cI\u201d, or their \u201csoul\u201d \u2014 is inferior; perhaps one could say that they hallucinate less... (Before you criticize the idea, please bear in mind that this brief outline probably does it a disservice; you'll have to read the book to fully understand this theory, even if you disagree.)\nFor the sake of discussion, Hofstadter came up with a \u201cscale\u201d for measuring the \u201csoul level\u201d of different brains: the Huneker scale. It is named after James Huneker, a music critic who said, in the early 1900's, that \u201cSmall-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers,\u201d should not attempt playing a certain piano piece by Chopin.\nYou claim that an \u201cI\u201d is nothing but a myth, a hallucination perceived by a hallucination. Certainly, from this point of view, one can assume that there is nothing sacred about souls. Yet you seem to hold souls as sacred, being, for example, a vegetarian. Aren't those views somewhat conflicting? If a soul is not real, and is nothing but the high-level result of bio-chemical processes, why care about the survival of other souls (and in particular \u201clow-huneker\u201d souls)?\nI can't explain this completely rationally. Sure, my brain falls for the universal myth of the \u201cI\u201d \u2014 the great hallucination, if you prefer \u2014 just as powerfully as does any other human brain. And this hallucination inevitably gives rise to compassion and empathy (yes, merely empathy for other hallucinations, if you will, but that's just how it is). At some point, in any case, my compassion for other \u201cbeings\u201d led me very naturally to finding it unacceptable to destroy other sentient beings (or other hallucinations, if you prefer), such as cows and pigs and lambs and fish and chickens, in order to consume their flesh, even if I knew that their (hallucinated) sentience wasn't quite as high as the (hallucinated) sentience of human beings.\nWhere or on what basis to draw the line? How many hunekers merit respect? I didn't know exactly. I decided once to draw the line between mammals and the rest of the animal world, and I stayed with that decision for about twenty years. Recently, however \u2014 just a couple of years ago, while I was writing I Am a Strange Loop, and thus being forced (by myself) to think all these issues through very intensely once again \u2014 I \u201clowered\u201d my personal line, and I stopped eating animals of any sort or \u201csize\u201d. I feel more at ease with myself this way, although I do suspect, at times, that I may have gone a little too far. But I'd rather give a too-large tip to a server than a too-small one, and this is analogous. I'd rather err on the side of generosity than on the other side, so I'm vegetarian. (However, I don't worry about the souls of tomatoes, as I point out in Chapter 1 of I Am a Strange Loop.)\nNear the end of the book, you discuss performances of Bach's music. Are there any modern performers that you esteem in particular? How about variations on Bach? Playing Bach in jazz-style is very common, for example.\nI don't pay all that much attention to who is performing classical music, because for me most top-notch performers sound very similar to each other. There are of course subtle differences between great performers, but what counts most for me is the composer's sequence of notes and harmonies, and that's always there, just about perfectly. Small variations on how the notes and harmonies are produced can have small effects, but that's all. Classical music is about the profound meanings put there by the composer, not about subtle tweaks on it brought out by the performer. At least that's how I see it.\nYou know how much I love analogies \u2014 well, here's one. To me, hearing lots of great performers perform the same piece (and I once had just such an experience \u2014 I was at a music festival in Aspen, Colorado where a whole bunch of stunningly talented young pianists performed the very beautiful first movement of the Schumann piano concerto one after the other, and I listened for a couple of hours, and it was fascinating) is like watching the greatest slalom-skiers in the world on television as they compete against each other in the Olympics. They're all unbelievably great at what they do, and they all come down the very long hill within a second or two of each other, sometimes separated by only tenths or hundredths of a second! The differences between them are almost microscopic, in the end. They are all beautiful to watch but I can't tell one from the other. If somebody told me that they were all the same person wearing different-color uniforms, I wouldn't shout \u201cImpossible!\u201d Would you?\nMind you, this takes nothing away from such people's enormous talent, but it just says that many different gifted people can carry out nearly indistinguishable marvelous feats that I myself could never aspire to do at all. What they do is hugely impressive, but the differences between the performances of these hugely gifted and hard-working individuals are not all that great. And as in skiing, so in performance of classical music.\nIncidentally, to be very clear on this, I would say it's a totally different ballgame when it comes to jazz and popular music, because in those cases liberties galore are taken by all performers \u2014 inserting one's own personality is the name of the game! \u201cThe very same song\u201d as sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra can be unbelievably different (and of course this vast difference is also due in large part to the musicians in the bands accompanying the singers, as well as to the vastly different arrangements). In jazz and popular music, who is playing or singing counts enormously much for me. It makes all the difference in the world. But in classical music, who is performing counts for far far less, as long as we are dealing with a highly talented performer.\nI have to add that literary translation is a lot more like jazz or pop music than it is like performance of classical music, because once again, the personality of the translator becomes an intrinsic and central part of the \u201cvoice\u201d that is speaking. That is inevitable, and it is why translation is such a deep and important art.\nTranslation is another subject in which Hofstadter finds great interest, ever since he helped translate GEB to French. Translation is the key subject of Le Ton beau de Marot, and Hofstadter returns to it in this interview's final question. In fact, he uses this question to tie everything together:\nWhen presenting questions about the soul, I am a Strange Loop (like several of the articles in The Mind's I) draws on science-fiction themes, such as teleportation. Yet the list of influential people in your life includes no SF authors, and the only SF character in that list is Captain Nemo. Do you read science fiction at all? What are your thoughts on this genre?\nWhen I was around ten or twelve, I liked science fiction (I still vividly recall some aspects of the novel Red Planet by Robert Heinlein) and found it very stimulating, but after a while I grew tired of it. Nonetheless, I do admire a few science-fiction authors, such as Robert L. Forward (who was a professional physicist \u2014 he's the author of Dragon's Egg, to which I devote nearly a whole chapter in Le Ton beau de Marot) and Stanislaw Lem (author of The Cyberiad , among many other books, from which two wonderful short pieces in The Mind's I are taken \u2014 and his separate piece Non Serviam is also included in The Mind's I). But even Lem, despite all his scientific subtlety and philosophical insight, occasionally troubles me (I remember I once read some long novel by him that I couldn't stand!). The problem is that too many liberties are taken and one can't really believe in the scenarios any more.\nI guess I am pretty old-fashioned in my literary tastes. I like a powerful, believable novel, such as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, by Khaled Hosseini, which both take place in Afghanistan, and of course The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and Vikram Seth's wonderful novel-in-verse The Golden Gate.\nThat last novel, by the way, was inspired by Pushkin's spectacular novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. I was in fact led to Eugene Onegin by meeting Seth for a coffee some twenty years ago in a Palo Alto bookstore and learning on that occasion about how he had been deeply inspired by Charles Johnston's English rendition of EO, and shortly thereafter I eagerly gobbled down several English translations of EO (including Johnston's, of course), in the process falling deeply in love with James Falen's intoxicatingly beautiful version of EO. That love affair then inevitably led me, a few years later, to tackling the Russian original \u2014 and to my utter astonishment, I wound up memorizing huge chunks of it (as do the Russians themselves), and then translating the entire novel-in-verse into English verse myself. That year-long adventure was one of the most wonderful episodes of my entire life, and I tell the whole story in my Translator's Preface to that book.\nTranslating EO into my own style of English verse, and seeing it in other people's styles in English, French, German, Italian, etc., gave me lots of metaphors for thinking about the human soul and how it can survive in other media \u2014 after all, here was the \u201csoul of Russian literature\u201d (for that's truly how Russians conceive of Eugene Onegin, although non-Russians don't generally know that) being transplanted into a radically different medium and yet surviving beautifully in, say, James Falen's or Babette Deutsch's anglicizations (and possibly in mine as well, but I can't be objective on that score).\nI often wondered about the hypothetical sci-fi scenario in which all traces of the Russian original were destroyed, so that all that was left of Eugene Onegin was, say, James Falen's English version of it \u2014 would Eugene Onegin have survived? And my answer always was a categorical and unmitigated \u201cYes!\u201d And that's how I think about the survival of human souls in other human brains \u2014 it's just that the \u201ctranslations\u201d of souls aren't nearly as high-quality as Falen's is of Pushkin's original. That's too bad, but it's life. You take what you can get.\nPushkin puts it this way, in stanza 38 of Chapter II of Eugene Onegin, in my translation (he's speaking of the young would-be poet named Lensky, who is in a cemetery standing near the graves of his parents and brooding poetically about life's all-too-fleeting nature):\nAnd there he, on the the stark, dark marker\nAtop his parents' graves, shed tears,\nAnd praised their ashes \u2014 darker, starker.\nAlas, life reaps too fast its years;\nAll flesh is grass. Each generation,\nAt heaven's hidden motivation,\nArises, blooms, and falls from grace;\nAnother quickly takes its place.\nAnd thus our race, rash and impetuous,\nAscends and has its day, then raves\nAnd hastens toward ancestral graves.\nAll too soon, death's sting will get to us;\nAye, how our children's children rush\nAnd push us from this world's sweet crush.\nNotice, by the way, the captial \u201cA\u201d at the beginning of each line \u2014 just a whim of mine that I indulged myself in (and which, I think, improved the stanza's quality, since this extra self-imposed constraint forced me to pay incredibly close attention to each and every word choice in each and every line to make everything flow effortlessly despite the constraint).\nAnd here, just for the sake of comparison, is James Falen's marvelously mellifluous and lyrical version of that same stanza:\nAnd then with verse of quickened sadness\nHe honored too, in tears and pain,\nHis parents' dust... their memory's gladness...\nAlas! Upon life's furrowed plain \u2014\nA harvest brief, each generation,\nBy fate's mysterious dispensation,\nArises, ripens, and must fall;\nThen others too must heed the call.\nFor thus our giddy race gains power:\nIt waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,\nThen crowds its forebears toward the grave.\nAnd we as well shall face that hour\nWhen one fine day our grandsons true\nStraight out of life will crowd us too!\nI hope that by comparing these two English versions of the Russian original, you can get a sense for how \u201cthe same pattern\u201d exists in them all \u2014 two of them in the medium or substrate of English, and one of them (unseen here) in the substrate of Russian. To me, this is a wonderful metaphor for soul transplantation.\nNew Reviews Notification\nTo receive notifications as new reviews are published, consider registering .

Hofstadter is best-known for his book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach (GEB for short). In his latest book, I am a Strange Loop, he visits once again many of the themes originally presented in that book.\nThe interview below was conducted in September 2007 and was originally published, in Hebrew, in the online culture magazine Haayal Hakore .\nThe interview was conducted by Tal Cohen and Yarden Nir-Buchbinder.\nThe first part of I am a Strange Loop reads like a condensed version of GEB, by explaining the idea of consciousness as a strange loop. However, unlike in GEB, you do not discuss AI in this book. Are you disappointed with the way cognitive/AI research has advanced in the past three decades? Did you, like many other researchers of the time, believe that intelligent machines are \u201cjust around the corner\u201d? And if so, do you still believe it will happen, eventually?\nI certainly did not believe intelligent machines were just around the corner when I wrote GEB. [Chapter 19] of GEB makes that very clear indeed.\nAm I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI in the past 30 years or so? Not at all. To the contrary, I would have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching human intelligence \u2014 it would have made me fear that our minds and souls were not deep. Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity, and I certainly don't want (and never wanted) that to happen.\nI am a deep admirer of humanity at its finest and deepest and most powerful \u2014 of great people such as Helen Keller, Albert Einstein, Ella Fitzgerald, Albert Schweitzer, Frederic Chopin, Raoul Wallenberg, Fats Waller, and on and on. I find endless depth in such people (many more are listed on [chapter 17] of I Am a Strange Loop), and I would hate to think that all that beauty and profundity and goodness could be captured \u2014 even approximated in any way at all! \u2014 in the horribly rigid computational devices of our era.\nDo I still believe it will happen someday? I can't say for sure, but I suppose it will eventually, yes. I wouldn't want to be around then, though. Such a world would be too alien for me. I prefer living in a world where computers are still very very stupid. And I get a huge kick out of laughing at the hilariously unpredictable inflexibility of the computer models of mental processes that my doctoral students and I co-design. It helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind.\nIndeed, I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to go in our quest for AI. I think of this seemingly \u201cpessimistic\u201d view of mine as being in fact a profound kind of optimism, whereas the seemingly \u201coptimistic\u201d visions of Ray Kurzweil and others strike me as actually being a deeply pessimistic view of the nature of the human mind. (I say all this much more poetically on p. 522 of Le Ton beau de Marot , by the way.)\nWe'll return to Kurzweil soon.\nYou use the word \u201csoul\u201d, rather than consciousness. While you clearly qualified the term to remove any religious connotations, avoiding such connotations is not really possible; \u201csoul\u201d is a very loaded symbol in this respect. Why did you choose to use it, and not, for example, \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d or any of several other, less-loaded alternatives?\nI used the word \u201csoul\u201d because, out of all the various words that one might use \u2014 \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201cintentionality\u201d, \u201cmind\u201d, and so forth \u2014 it is the one that I think most evocatively suggests the deep mystery of first-person existence that any philosophically inclined person must wonder about many times during their life. But I think that the first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d is just as evocative a word for the same thing. I could also have used the word \u201cspirit\u201d, I guess, but that, too, would have seemed loaded with religious flavor to many readers.\nThe point is, whenever one talks about what life is, from the inside, one gets very close to what religion itself is all about. It therefore shouldn't be too big a surprise that I appropriated a religion-flavored word to talk about a deep mystery that is so close to the very core of religion.\nOne of the most surprising arguments in the book (it has in fact appeared in his previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is the idea that the soul outlives the body by having its copies, or \u201csoul-shards\u201d, exist in many brains \u2014 the brains of other people, who have known the deceased; perhaps a stronger variation of the idea that a person lives so long as others remember him.\nYou present a compelling argument for the notion of a soul surviving its physical body by being spread across multiple brains; the more a person is familiar to others, the better his soul is \u201cpresent\u201d in their brain, too. How will you respond to the claim that the \u201cpresence\u201d of one soul in another soul's brain is merely a simulation mechanism, developed by the evolution process as a means to improve survival? (Being able to predict what members of your clan are about to do can certainly be a powerful survival tool.)\nMy argument in I Am a Strange Loop is spelled out clearly. If a person's soul is truly a pattern, then it can be realized in different media. Wherever that pattern exists in a sufficiently fine-grained way, then it is, by my definition, the soul itself and not some kind of \u201cmere simulation\u201d of it.\n\u201cMere simulation\u201d is a phrase that sounds suspiciously like John Searle when he is contemptuously deriding AI in his usual flippant fashion. However, as I see it, there is no black-and-white dividing line between \u201cmere simulations\u201d of a complex entity and full realizations of it \u2014 there are just lots and lots of shades of gray all along the way. This spectrum is pointed out in many places in my books, including the three marvelous short stories by Stanislaw Lem included in The Mind's I.\nWe'll get back to Lem's books, too...\nIf indeed a soul can survive by being present in other brains, then certain souls survive for many centuries after their primary brain is gone. You provide an example with Frederic Chopin, saying that \u201cChopin, the actual person, survives so much in our world, even today\u201d.\nA common saying is that authors are \u201cimmortalized\u201d by their books. Your notion of soul-shards casts a whole new light on this idea, suggesting that authors (and artists, such as musicians) truly extend the survival of their soul by making their works well-known. In this sense, it seems like your own books make a huge effort to familiarize the readers with your inner life, the making of your soul; for example, where most authors would have written \u201cMy fabric was greatly influenced by many people, from Niels Bohr to Charlie Brown\u201d, you provide a detailed list of over 45 names. The book (and your previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is peppered with scores of anecdotes about your personal life. As a reader, I certainly feel like I know you much better than I know most other authors, certainly authors of non-fiction works. Can this be viewed as an attempt to entrench shards of your soul in the minds of your readers? Is this your shot at immortality?\nI am not shooting at immortality through my books, no. Nor do I think Chopin was shooting at immortality through his music. That strikes me as a very selfish goal, and I don't think Chopin was particularly selfish. I would also say that I think that music comes much closer to capturing the essence of a composer's soul than do a writer's ideas capture the writer's soul. Perhaps some very emotional ideas that I express in my books can get across a bit of the essence of my soul to some readers, but I think that Chopin's music probably does a lot better job (and the same holds, of course, for many composers).\nI personally don't have any thoughts about \u201cshooting for immortality\u201d when I write. I try to write simply in order to get ideas out there that I believe in and find fascinating, because I'd like to let other people be able share those ideas. But intellectual ideas alone, no matter how fascinating they are, are not enough to transmit a soul across brains. Perhaps, as I say, my autobiographical passages \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 get tiny shards of my soul across to some people. But such autobiographical story-telling is not nearly as effective a means of soul-transmission as is living with someone you love for many years of your lives, and sharing profound life goals with them \u2014 that's for sure!\nScientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil presents a different take at immortality, a more physical one. Like you, Kurzweil views the soul as \u201csoftware\u201d that can be executed on different \u201chardware\u201d. He further believes that in a relatively short while, we will have electronic hardware which is the equivalent of the human brain (which you eloquently characterize as a \u201cuniversal machine\u201d, capable as \u201cexecuting\u201d any \u201csoul software\u201d). Once such hardware is available, Kurzweil believes immortality would have been reached: by \u201cdownloading\u201d our soul-software onto electronic brains (\u201cGiant Electronic Brains\u201d?), we will become immortals, able to create backups of our souls to be restored in case of disaster, and able to shift our physical location anywhere in the speed of a software download.\nDo you share Kurzweil's view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future? Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality \u2014 will the software running on the electronic brain be the same \u201cI\u201d?\nI think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death. I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity, but I think it badly distorts his vision. As I see it, Kurzweil's desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity.\nI think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast (Moore's Law, etc.) that inevitably, within a few decades, hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable. A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human's mind with perfect accuracy, because trillions of tiny \u201cnanobots\u201d will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the \u201cwiring details\u201d of that particular brain, which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron-firings, and presto \u2014 that individual's mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium. (This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece \u201cA Conversation with Einstein's Brain\u201d toward the end of The Mind's I, actually, with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything \u2014 it's all done in the pages of a huge book, with a human being playing the role of the processor.)\nThe cover of Kurzweil's book.\nRather ironically, this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI, because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it's a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media. And thus, says Kurzweil, we will have achieved immortal souls that live on (and potentially forever) in superfast computational hardware \u2014 and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus \u201cuploaded\u201d into superfast hardware and hence he expects (or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects) to become literally immortal \u2014 and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal, with just little shards of his soul remaining, but with his whole soul preserved forever.\nWell, the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy; it has to live in a vastly complex world, and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls, commingling with them just as we do here on earth. To be sure, Kurzweil sees those things as no problem, either \u2014 we'll have virtual worlds galore, \u201cup there\u201d in Cyberheaven, and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware. And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways.\nWell, to me, this \u201cglorious\u201d new world would be the end of humanity as we know it. If such a vision comes to pass, it certainly would spell the end of human life. Once again, I don't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass. But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time. How long? I just don't know. Centuries, at least. But I don't know. I'm not a futurologist in the least. But Kurzweil is far more \u201coptimistic\u201d (i.e., depressingly pessimistic, from my perspective) about the pace at which all these world-shaking changes will take place.\nIn any case, the vision that Kurzweil offers (and other very smart people offer it too, such as Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, perhaps Marvin Minsky, and many others \u2014 usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen-age sci-fi addicts, I have to say) is repugnant to me. On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian, but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy. \u201cMe, me, me!\u201d is how it sounds to me \u2014 \u201cI want to live forever!\u201d But who knows? I don't even like thinking about this nutty technology-glorifying scenario, now usually called \u201cThe Singularity\u201d (also called by some \u201cThe Rapture of the Nerds\u201d \u2014 a great phrase!) \u2014 it just gives me the creeps. Sorry!\nAnother surprising argument in the book is the almost Zennish claim that the soul is nothing but an illusion; an illusion that exists because it hallucinates itself. Perhaps we can say that Hofstadter's answer to the psychophysical problem is simply, \u201cThere is no problem, because there is no psycho. We just imagine it\u201d \u2014 and the fact we imagine it is what leads, in fact, to the psycho's existence. This is the heart of the strange loop that lends its name to the book. The illusion stems from the brain's need to create an internal representation of its surrounding (for survival purposes), and part of this representation necessarily includes the brain itself, the \u201cI\u201d, a mechanism that represents itself and thereby leads to its very existence. Clearly, not every brain represents itself with equal level of detail; animals, for example, represent the world in their brain in an inferior manner, and hence their self-representation \u2014 including their \u201cI\u201d, or their \u201csoul\u201d \u2014 is inferior; perhaps one could say that they hallucinate less... (Before you criticize the idea, please bear in mind that this brief outline probably does it a disservice; you'll have to read the book to fully understand this theory, even if you disagree.)\nFor the sake of discussion, Hofstadter came up with a \u201cscale\u201d for measuring the \u201csoul level\u201d of different brains: the Huneker scale. It is named after James Huneker, a music critic who said, in the early 1900's, that \u201cSmall-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers,\u201d should not attempt playing a certain piano piece by Chopin.\nYou claim that an \u201cI\u201d is nothing but a myth, a hallucination perceived by a hallucination. Certainly, from this point of view, one can assume that there is nothing sacred about souls. Yet you seem to hold souls as sacred, being, for example, a vegetarian. Aren't those views somewhat conflicting? If a soul is not real, and is nothing but the high-level result of bio-chemical processes, why care about the survival of other souls (and in particular \u201clow-huneker\u201d souls)?\nI can't explain this completely rationally. Sure, my brain falls for the universal myth of the \u201cI\u201d \u2014 the great hallucination, if you prefer \u2014 just as powerfully as does any other human brain. And this hallucination inevitably gives rise to compassion and empathy (yes, merely empathy for other hallucinations, if you will, but that's just how it is). At some point, in any case, my compassion for other \u201cbeings\u201d led me very naturally to finding it unacceptable to destroy other sentient beings (or other hallucinations, if you prefer), such as cows and pigs and lambs and fish and chickens, in order to consume their flesh, even if I knew that their (hallucinated) sentience wasn't quite as high as the (hallucinated) sentience of human beings.\nWhere or on what basis to draw the line? How many hunekers merit respect? I didn't know exactly. I decided once to draw the line between mammals and the rest of the animal world, and I stayed with that decision for about twenty years. Recently, however \u2014 just a couple of years ago, while I was writing I Am a Strange Loop, and thus being forced (by myself) to think all these issues through very intensely once again \u2014 I \u201clowered\u201d my personal line, and I stopped eating animals of any sort or \u201csize\u201d. I feel more at ease with myself this way, although I do suspect, at times, that I may have gone a little too far. But I'd rather give a too-large tip to a server than a too-small one, and this is analogous. I'd rather err on the side of generosity than on the other side, so I'm vegetarian. (However, I don't worry about the souls of tomatoes, as I point out in Chapter 1 of I Am a Strange Loop.)\nNear the end of the book, you discuss performances of Bach's music. Are there any modern performers that you esteem in particular? How about variations on Bach? Playing Bach in jazz-style is very common, for example.\nI don't pay all that much attention to who is performing classical music, because for me most top-notch performers sound very similar to each other. There are of course subtle differences between great performers, but what counts most for me is the composer's sequence of notes and harmonies, and that's always there, just about perfectly. Small variations on how the notes and harmonies are produced can have small effects, but that's all. Classical music is about the profound meanings put there by the composer, not about subtle tweaks on it brought out by the performer. At least that's how I see it.\nYou know how much I love analogies \u2014 well, here's one. To me, hearing lots of great performers perform the same piece (and I once had just such an experience \u2014 I was at a music festival in Aspen, Colorado where a whole bunch of stunningly talented young pianists performed the very beautiful first movement of the Schumann piano concerto one after the other, and I listened for a couple of hours, and it was fascinating) is like watching the greatest slalom-skiers in the world on television as they compete against each other in the Olympics. They're all unbelievably great at what they do, and they all come down the very long hill within a second or two of each other, sometimes separated by only tenths or hundredths of a second! The differences between them are almost microscopic, in the end. They are all beautiful to watch but I can't tell one from the other. If somebody told me that they were all the same person wearing different-color uniforms, I wouldn't shout \u201cImpossible!\u201d Would you?\nMind you, this takes nothing away from such people's enormous talent, but it just says that many different gifted people can carry out nearly indistinguishable marvelous feats that I myself could never aspire to do at all. What they do is hugely impressive, but the differences between the performances of these hugely gifted and hard-working individuals are not all that great. And as in skiing, so in performance of classical music.\nIncidentally, to be very clear on this, I would say it's a totally different ballgame when it comes to jazz and popular music, because in those cases liberties galore are taken by all performers \u2014 inserting one's own personality is the name of the game! \u201cThe very same song\u201d as sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra can be unbelievably different (and of course this vast difference is also due in large part to the musicians in the bands accompanying the singers, as well as to the vastly different arrangements). In jazz and popular music, who is playing or singing counts enormously much for me. It makes all the difference in the world. But in classical music, who is performing counts for far far less, as long as we are dealing with a highly talented performer.\nI have to add that literary translation is a lot more like jazz or pop music than it is like performance of classical music, because once again, the personality of the translator becomes an intrinsic and central part of the \u201cvoice\u201d that is speaking. That is inevitable, and it is why translation is such a deep and important art.\nTranslation is another subject in which Hofstadter finds great interest, ever since he helped translate GEB to French. Translation is the key subject of Le Ton beau de Marot, and Hofstadter returns to it in this interview's final question. In fact, he uses this question to tie everything together:\nWhen presenting questions about the soul, I am a Strange Loop (like several of the articles in The Mind's I) draws on science-fiction themes, such as teleportation. Yet the list of influential people in your life includes no SF authors, and the only SF character in that list is Captain Nemo. Do you read science fiction at all? What are your thoughts on this genre?\nWhen I was around ten or twelve, I liked science fiction (I still vividly recall some aspects of the novel Red Planet by Robert Heinlein) and found it very stimulating, but after a while I grew tired of it. Nonetheless, I do admire a few science-fiction authors, such as Robert L. Forward (who was a professional physicist \u2014 he's the author of Dragon's Egg, to which I devote nearly a whole chapter in Le Ton beau de Marot) and Stanislaw Lem (author of The Cyberiad , among many other books, from which two wonderful short pieces in The Mind's I are taken \u2014 and his separate piece Non Serviam is also included in The Mind's I). But even Lem, despite all his scientific subtlety and philosophical insight, occasionally troubles me (I remember I once read some long novel by him that I couldn't stand!). The problem is that too many liberties are taken and one can't really believe in the scenarios any more.\nI guess I am pretty old-fashioned in my literary tastes. I like a powerful, believable novel, such as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, by Khaled Hosseini, which both take place in Afghanistan, and of course The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and Vikram Seth's wonderful novel-in-verse The Golden Gate.\nThat last novel, by the way, was inspired by Pushkin's spectacular novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. I was in fact led to Eugene Onegin by meeting Seth for a coffee some twenty years ago in a Palo Alto bookstore and learning on that occasion about how he had been deeply inspired by Charles Johnston's English rendition of EO, and shortly thereafter I eagerly gobbled down several English translations of EO (including Johnston's, of course), in the process falling deeply in love with James Falen's intoxicatingly beautiful version of EO. That love affair then inevitably led me, a few years later, to tackling the Russian original \u2014 and to my utter astonishment, I wound up memorizing huge chunks of it (as do the Russians themselves), and then translating the entire novel-in-verse into English verse myself. That year-long adventure was one of the most wonderful episodes of my entire life, and I tell the whole story in my Translator's Preface to that book.\nTranslating EO into my own style of English verse, and seeing it in other people's styles in English, French, German, Italian, etc., gave me lots of metaphors for thinking about the human soul and how it can survive in other media \u2014 after all, here was the \u201csoul of Russian literature\u201d (for that's truly how Russians conceive of Eugene Onegin, although non-Russians don't generally know that) being transplanted into a radically different medium and yet surviving beautifully in, say, James Falen's or Babette Deutsch's anglicizations (and possibly in mine as well, but I can't be objective on that score).\nI often wondered about the hypothetical sci-fi scenario in which all traces of the Russian original were destroyed, so that all that was left of Eugene Onegin was, say, James Falen's English version of it \u2014 would Eugene Onegin have survived? And my answer always was a categorical and unmitigated \u201cYes!\u201d And that's how I think about the survival of human souls in other human brains \u2014 it's just that the \u201ctranslations\u201d of souls aren't nearly as high-quality as Falen's is of Pushkin's original. That's too bad, but it's life. You take what you can get.\nPushkin puts it this way, in stanza 38 of Chapter II of Eugene Onegin, in my translation (he's speaking of the young would-be poet named Lensky, who is in a cemetery standing near the graves of his parents and brooding poetically about life's all-too-fleeting nature):\nAnd there he, on the the stark, dark marker\nAtop his parents' graves, shed tears,\nAnd praised their ashes \u2014 darker, starker.\nAlas, life reaps too fast its years;\nAll flesh is grass. Each generation,\nAt heaven's hidden motivation,\nArises, blooms, and falls from grace;\nAnother quickly takes its place.\nAnd thus our race, rash and impetuous,\nAscends and has its day, then raves\nAnd hastens toward ancestral graves.\nAll too soon, death's sting will get to us;\nAye, how our children's children rush\nAnd push us from this world's sweet crush.\nNotice, by the way, the captial \u201cA\u201d at the beginning of each line \u2014 just a whim of mine that I indulged myself in (and which, I think, improved the stanza's quality, since this extra self-imposed constraint forced me to pay incredibly close attention to each and every word choice in each and every line to make everything flow effortlessly despite the constraint).\nAnd here, just for the sake of comparison, is James Falen's marvelously mellifluous and lyrical version of that same stanza:\nAnd then with verse of quickened sadness\nHe honored too, in tears and pain,\nHis parents' dust... their memory's gladness...\nAlas! Upon life's furrowed plain \u2014\nA harvest brief, each generation,\nBy fate's mysterious dispensation,\nArises, ripens, and must fall;\nThen others too must heed the call.\nFor thus our giddy race gains power:\nIt waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,\nThen crowds its forebears toward the grave.\nAnd we as well shall face that hour\nWhen one fine day our grandsons true\nStraight out of life will crowd us too!\nI hope that by comparing these two English versions of the Russian original, you can get a sense for how \u201cthe same pattern\u201d exists in them all \u2014 two of them in the medium or substrate of English, and one of them (unseen here) in the substrate of Russian. To me, this is a wonderful metaphor for soul transplantation.\nNew Reviews Notification\nTo receive notifications as new reviews are published, consider registering .

In his latest book, I am a Strange Loop, he visits once again many of the themes originally presented in that book.\nThe interview below was conducted in September 2007 and was originally published, in Hebrew, in the online culture magazine Haayal Hakore .\nThe interview was conducted by Tal Cohen and Yarden Nir-Buchbinder.\nThe first part of I am a Strange Loop reads like a condensed version of GEB, by explaining the idea of consciousness as a strange loop. However, unlike in GEB, you do not discuss AI in this book. Are you disappointed with the way cognitive/AI research has advanced in the past three decades? Did you, like many other researchers of the time, believe that intelligent machines are \u201cjust around the corner\u201d? And if so, do you still believe it will happen, eventually?\nI certainly did not believe intelligent machines were just around the corner when I wrote GEB. [Chapter 19] of GEB makes that very clear indeed.\nAm I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI in the past 30 years or so? Not at all. To the contrary, I would have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching human intelligence \u2014 it would have made me fear that our minds and souls were not deep. Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity, and I certainly don't want (and never wanted) that to happen.\nI am a deep admirer of humanity at its finest and deepest and most powerful \u2014 of great people such as Helen Keller, Albert Einstein, Ella Fitzgerald, Albert Schweitzer, Frederic Chopin, Raoul Wallenberg, Fats Waller, and on and on. I find endless depth in such people (many more are listed on [chapter 17] of I Am a Strange Loop), and I would hate to think that all that beauty and profundity and goodness could be captured \u2014 even approximated in any way at all! \u2014 in the horribly rigid computational devices of our era.\nDo I still believe it will happen someday? I can't say for sure, but I suppose it will eventually, yes. I wouldn't want to be around then, though. Such a world would be too alien for me. I prefer living in a world where computers are still very very stupid. And I get a huge kick out of laughing at the hilariously unpredictable inflexibility of the computer models of mental processes that my doctoral students and I co-design. It helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind.\nIndeed, I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to go in our quest for AI. I think of this seemingly \u201cpessimistic\u201d view of mine as being in fact a profound kind of optimism, whereas the seemingly \u201coptimistic\u201d visions of Ray Kurzweil and others strike me as actually being a deeply pessimistic view of the nature of the human mind. (I say all this much more poetically on p. 522 of Le Ton beau de Marot , by the way.)\nWe'll return to Kurzweil soon.\nYou use the word \u201csoul\u201d, rather than consciousness. While you clearly qualified the term to remove any religious connotations, avoiding such connotations is not really possible; \u201csoul\u201d is a very loaded symbol in this respect. Why did you choose to use it, and not, for example, \u201cmind\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d or any of several other, less-loaded alternatives?\nI used the word \u201csoul\u201d because, out of all the various words that one might use \u2014 \u201cconsciousness\u201d, \u201cintentionality\u201d, \u201cmind\u201d, and so forth \u2014 it is the one that I think most evocatively suggests the deep mystery of first-person existence that any philosophically inclined person must wonder about many times during their life. But I think that the first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d is just as evocative a word for the same thing. I could also have used the word \u201cspirit\u201d, I guess, but that, too, would have seemed loaded with religious flavor to many readers.\nThe point is, whenever one talks about what life is, from the inside, one gets very close to what religion itself is all about. It therefore shouldn't be too big a surprise that I appropriated a religion-flavored word to talk about a deep mystery that is so close to the very core of religion.\nOne of the most surprising arguments in the book (it has in fact appeared in his previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is the idea that the soul outlives the body by having its copies, or \u201csoul-shards\u201d, exist in many brains \u2014 the brains of other people, who have known the deceased; perhaps a stronger variation of the idea that a person lives so long as others remember him.\nYou present a compelling argument for the notion of a soul surviving its physical body by being spread across multiple brains; the more a person is familiar to others, the better his soul is \u201cpresent\u201d in their brain, too. How will you respond to the claim that the \u201cpresence\u201d of one soul in another soul's brain is merely a simulation mechanism, developed by the evolution process as a means to improve survival? (Being able to predict what members of your clan are about to do can certainly be a powerful survival tool.)\nMy argument in I Am a Strange Loop is spelled out clearly. If a person's soul is truly a pattern, then it can be realized in different media. Wherever that pattern exists in a sufficiently fine-grained way, then it is, by my definition, the soul itself and not some kind of \u201cmere simulation\u201d of it.\n\u201cMere simulation\u201d is a phrase that sounds suspiciously like John Searle when he is contemptuously deriding AI in his usual flippant fashion. However, as I see it, there is no black-and-white dividing line between \u201cmere simulations\u201d of a complex entity and full realizations of it \u2014 there are just lots and lots of shades of gray all along the way. This spectrum is pointed out in many places in my books, including the three marvelous short stories by Stanislaw Lem included in The Mind's I.\nWe'll get back to Lem's books, too...\nIf indeed a soul can survive by being present in other brains, then certain souls survive for many centuries after their primary brain is gone. You provide an example with Frederic Chopin, saying that \u201cChopin, the actual person, survives so much in our world, even today\u201d.\nA common saying is that authors are \u201cimmortalized\u201d by their books. Your notion of soul-shards casts a whole new light on this idea, suggesting that authors (and artists, such as musicians) truly extend the survival of their soul by making their works well-known. In this sense, it seems like your own books make a huge effort to familiarize the readers with your inner life, the making of your soul; for example, where most authors would have written \u201cMy fabric was greatly influenced by many people, from Niels Bohr to Charlie Brown\u201d, you provide a detailed list of over 45 names. The book (and your previous book, Le Ton beau de Marot) is peppered with scores of anecdotes about your personal life. As a reader, I certainly feel like I know you much better than I know most other authors, certainly authors of non-fiction works. Can this be viewed as an attempt to entrench shards of your soul in the minds of your readers? Is this your shot at immortality?\nI am not shooting at immortality through my books, no. Nor do I think Chopin was shooting at immortality through his music. That strikes me as a very selfish goal, and I don't think Chopin was particularly selfish. I would also say that I think that music comes much closer to capturing the essence of a composer's soul than do a writer's ideas capture the writer's soul. Perhaps some very emotional ideas that I express in my books can get across a bit of the essence of my soul to some readers, but I think that Chopin's music probably does a lot better job (and the same holds, of course, for many composers).\nI personally don't have any thoughts about \u201cshooting for immortality\u201d when I write. I try to write simply in order to get ideas out there that I believe in and find fascinating, because I'd like to let other people be able share those ideas. But intellectual ideas alone, no matter how fascinating they are, are not enough to transmit a soul across brains. Perhaps, as I say, my autobiographical passages \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 get tiny shards of my soul across to some people. But such autobiographical story-telling is not nearly as effective a means of soul-transmission as is living with someone you love for many years of your lives, and sharing profound life goals with them \u2014 that's for sure!\nScientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil presents a different take at immortality, a more physical one. Like you, Kurzweil views the soul as \u201csoftware\u201d that can be executed on different \u201chardware\u201d. He further believes that in a relatively short while, we will have electronic hardware which is the equivalent of the human brain (which you eloquently characterize as a \u201cuniversal machine\u201d, capable as \u201cexecuting\u201d any \u201csoul software\u201d). Once such hardware is available, Kurzweil believes immortality would have been reached: by \u201cdownloading\u201d our soul-software onto electronic brains (\u201cGiant Electronic Brains\u201d?), we will become immortals, able to create backups of our souls to be restored in case of disaster, and able to shift our physical location anywhere in the speed of a software download.\nDo you share Kurzweil's view of hardware being able to execute human soul software within the foreseeable future? Do you agree with his view of this being the equivalent of immortality \u2014 will the software running on the electronic brain be the same \u201cI\u201d?\nI think Ray Kurzweil is terrified by his own mortality and deeply longs to avoid death. I understand this obsession of his and am even somehow touched by its ferocious intensity, but I think it badly distorts his vision. As I see it, Kurzweil's desperate hopes seriously cloud his scientific objectivity.\nI think Kurzweil sees technology as progressing so deterministically fast (Moore's Law, etc.) that inevitably, within a few decades, hardware will be so fast and nanotechnology so advanced that things unbelievable to us now will be easily doable. A key element in this whole vision is that no one will need to understand the mind or brain in order to copy a particular human's mind with perfect accuracy, because trillions of tiny \u201cnanobots\u201d will swarm through the bloodstream in the human brain and will report back all the \u201cwiring details\u201d of that particular brain, which at that point constitute a very complex table of data that can be fed into a universal computer program that executes neuron-firings, and presto \u2014 that individual's mind has been reinstantiated in an electronic medium. (This vision is quite reminiscent of the scenario painted in my piece \u201cA Conversation with Einstein's Brain\u201d toward the end of The Mind's I, actually, with the only difference being that there is no computer processing anything \u2014 it's all done in the pages of a huge book, with a human being playing the role of the processor.)\nThe cover of Kurzweil's book.\nRather ironically, this vision totally bypasses the need for cognitive science or AI, because all one needs is the detailed wiring plan of a brain and then it's a piece of cake to copy the brain in other media. And thus, says Kurzweil, we will have achieved immortal souls that live on (and potentially forever) in superfast computational hardware \u2014 and Kurzweil sees this happening so soon that he is banking on his own brain being thus \u201cuploaded\u201d into superfast hardware and hence he expects (or at least he loudly proclaims that he expects) to become literally immortal \u2014 and not in the way Chopin is quasi-immortal, with just little shards of his soul remaining, but with his whole soul preserved forever.\nWell, the problem is that a soul by itself would go crazy; it has to live in a vastly complex world, and it has to cohabit that world with many other souls, commingling with them just as we do here on earth. To be sure, Kurzweil sees those things as no problem, either \u2014 we'll have virtual worlds galore, \u201cup there\u201d in Cyberheaven, and of course there will be souls by the barrelful all running on the same hardware. And Kurzweil sees the new software souls as intermingling in all sorts of unanticipated and unimaginable ways.\nWell, to me, this \u201cglorious\u201d new world would be the end of humanity as we know it. If such a vision comes to pass, it certainly would spell the end of human life. Once again, I don't want to be there if such a vision should ever come to pass. But I doubt that it will come to pass for a very long time. How long? I just don't know. Centuries, at least. But I don't know. I'm not a futurologist in the least. But Kurzweil is far more \u201coptimistic\u201d (i.e., depressingly pessimistic, from my perspective) about the pace at which all these world-shaking changes will take place.\nIn any case, the vision that Kurzweil offers (and other very smart people offer it too, such as Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, perhaps Marvin Minsky, and many others \u2014 usually people who strike me as being overgrown teen-age sci-fi addicts, I have to say) is repugnant to me. On the surface it may sound very idealistic and utopian, but deep down I find it extremely selfish and greedy. \u201cMe, me, me!\u201d is how it sounds to me \u2014 \u201cI want to live forever!\u201d But who knows? I don't even like thinking about this nutty technology-glorifying scenario, now usually called \u201cThe Singularity\u201d (also called by some \u201cThe Rapture of the Nerds\u201d \u2014 a great phrase!) \u2014 it just gives me the creeps. Sorry!\nAnother surprising argument in the book is the almost Zennish claim that the soul is nothing but an illusion; an illusion that exists because it hallucinates itself. Perhaps we can say that Hofstadter's answer to the psychophysical problem is simply, \u201cThere is no problem, because there is no psycho. We just imagine it\u201d \u2014 and the fact we imagine it is what leads, in fact, to the psycho's existence. This is the heart of the strange loop that lends its name to the book. The illusion stems from the brain's need to create an internal representation of its surrounding (for survival purposes), and part of this representation necessarily includes the brain itself, the \u201cI\u201d, a mechanism that represents itself and thereby leads to its very existence. Clearly, not every brain represents itself with equal level of detail; animals, for example, represent the world in their brain in an inferior manner, and hence their self-representation \u2014 including their \u201cI\u201d, or their \u201csoul\u201d \u2014 is inferior; perhaps one could say that they hallucinate less... (Before you criticize the idea, please bear in mind that this brief outline probably does it a disservice; you'll have to read the book to fully understand this theory, even if you disagree.)\nFor the sake of discussion, Hofstadter came up with a \u201cscale\u201d for measuring the \u201csoul level\u201d of different brains: the Huneker scale. It is named after James Huneker, a music critic who said, in the early 1900's, that \u201cSmall-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers,\u201d should not attempt playing a certain piano piece by Chopin.\nYou claim that an \u201cI\u201d is nothing but a myth, a hallucination perceived by a hallucination. Certainly, from this point of view, one can assume that there is nothing sacred about souls. Yet you seem to hold souls as sacred, being, for example, a vegetarian. Aren't those views somewhat conflicting? If a soul is not real, and is nothing but the high-level result of bio-chemical processes, why care about the survival of other souls (and in particular \u201clow-huneker\u201d souls)?\nI can't explain this completely rationally. Sure, my brain falls for the universal myth of the \u201cI\u201d \u2014 the great hallucination, if you prefer \u2014 just as powerfully as does any other human brain. And this hallucination inevitably gives rise to compassion and empathy (yes, merely empathy for other hallucinations, if you will, but that's just how it is). At some point, in any case, my compassion for other \u201cbeings\u201d led me very naturally to finding it unacceptable to destroy other sentient beings (or other hallucinations, if you prefer), such as cows and pigs and lambs and fish and chickens, in order to consume their flesh, even if I knew that their (hallucinated) sentience wasn't quite as high as the (hallucinated) sentience of human beings.\nWhere or on what basis to draw the line? How many hunekers merit respect? I didn't know exactly. I decided once to draw the line between mammals and the rest of the animal world, and I stayed with that decision for about twenty years. Recently, however \u2014 just a couple of years ago, while I was writing I Am a Strange Loop, and thus being forced (by myself) to think all these issues through very intensely once again \u2014 I \u201clowered\u201d my personal line, and I stopped eating animals of any sort or \u201csize\u201d. I feel more at ease with myself this way, although I do suspect, at times, that I may have gone a little too far. But I'd rather give a too-large tip to a server than a too-small one, and this is analogous. I'd rather err on the side of generosity than on the other side, so I'm vegetarian. (However, I don't worry about the souls of tomatoes, as I point out in Chapter 1 of I Am a Strange Loop.)\nNear the end of the book, you discuss performances of Bach's music. Are there any modern performers that you esteem in particular? How about variations on Bach? Playing Bach in jazz-style is very common, for example.\nI don't pay all that much attention to who is performing classical music, because for me most top-notch performers sound very similar to each other. There are of course subtle differences between great performers, but what counts most for me is the composer's sequence of notes and harmonies, and that's always there, just about perfectly. Small variations on how the notes and harmonies are produced can have small effects, but that's all. Classical music is about the profound meanings put there by the composer, not about subtle tweaks on it brought out by the performer. At least that's how I see it.\nYou know how much I love analogies \u2014 well, here's one. To me, hearing lots of great performers perform the same piece (and I once had just such an experience \u2014 I was at a music festival in Aspen, Colorado where a whole bunch of stunningly talented young pianists performed the very beautiful first movement of the Schumann piano concerto one after the other, and I listened for a couple of hours, and it was fascinating) is like watching the greatest slalom-skiers in the world on television as they compete against each other in the Olympics. They're all unbelievably great at what they do, and they all come down the very long hill within a second or two of each other, sometimes separated by only tenths or hundredths of a second! The differences between them are almost microscopic, in the end. They are all beautiful to watch but I can't tell one from the other. If somebody told me that they were all the same person wearing different-color uniforms, I wouldn't shout \u201cImpossible!\u201d Would you?\nMind you, this takes nothing away from such people's enormous talent, but it just says that many different gifted people can carry out nearly indistinguishable marvelous feats that I myself could never aspire to do at all. What they do is hugely impressive, but the differences between the performances of these hugely gifted and hard-working individuals are not all that great. And as in skiing, so in performance of classical music.\nIncidentally, to be very clear on this, I would say it's a totally different ballgame when it comes to jazz and popular music, because in those cases liberties galore are taken by all performers \u2014 inserting one's own personality is the name of the game! \u201cThe very same song\u201d as sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra can be unbelievably different (and of course this vast difference is also due in large part to the musicians in the bands accompanying the singers, as well as to the vastly different arrangements). In jazz and popular music, who is playing or singing counts enormously much for me. It makes all the difference in the world. But in classical music, who is performing counts for far far less, as long as we are dealing with a highly talented performer.\nI have to add that literary translation is a lot more like jazz or pop music than it is like performance of classical music, because once again, the personality of the translator becomes an intrinsic and central part of the \u201cvoice\u201d that is speaking. That is inevitable, and it is why translation is such a deep and important art.\nTranslation is another subject in which Hofstadter finds great interest, ever since he helped translate GEB to French. Translation is the key subject of Le Ton beau de Marot, and Hofstadter returns to it in this interview's final question. In fact, he uses this question to tie everything together:\nWhen presenting questions about the soul, I am a Strange Loop (like several of the articles in The Mind's I) draws on science-fiction themes, such as teleportation. Yet the list of influential people in your life includes no SF authors, and the only SF character in that list is Captain Nemo. Do you read science fiction at all? What are your thoughts on this genre?\nWhen I was around ten or twelve, I liked science fiction (I still vividly recall some aspects of the novel Red Planet by Robert Heinlein) and found it very stimulating, but after a while I grew tired of it. Nonetheless, I do admire a few science-fiction authors, such as Robert L. Forward (who was a professional physicist \u2014 he's the author of Dragon's Egg, to which I devote nearly a whole chapter in Le Ton beau de Marot) and Stanislaw Lem (author of The Cyberiad , among many other books, from which two wonderful short pieces in The Mind's I are taken \u2014 and his separate piece Non Serviam is also included in The Mind's I). But even Lem, despite all his scientific subtlety and philosophical insight, occasionally troubles me (I remember I once read some long novel by him that I couldn't stand!). The problem is that too many liberties are taken and one can't really believe in the scenarios any more.\nI guess I am pretty old-fashioned in my literary tastes. I like a powerful, believable novel, such as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, by Khaled Hosseini, which both take place in Afghanistan, and of course The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and Vikram Seth's wonderful novel-in-verse The Golden Gate.\nThat last novel, by the way, was inspired by Pushkin's spectacular novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. I was in fact led to Eugene Onegin by meeting Seth for a coffee some twenty years ago in a Palo Alto bookstore and learning on that occasion about how he had been deeply inspired by Charles Johnston's English rendition of EO, and shortly thereafter I eagerly gobbled down several English translations of EO (including Johnston's, of course), in the process falling deeply in love with James Falen's intoxicatingly beautiful version of EO. That love affair then inevitably led me, a few years later, to tackling the Russian original \u2014 and to my utter astonishment, I wound up memorizing huge chunks of it (as do the Russians themselves), and then translating the entire novel-in-verse into English verse myself. That year-long adventure was one of the most wonderful episodes of my entire life, and I tell the whole story in my Translator's Preface to that book.\nTranslating EO into my own style of English verse, and seeing it in other people's styles in English, French, German, Italian, etc., gave me lots of metaphors for thinking about the human soul and how it can survive in other media \u2014 after all, here was the \u201csoul of Russian literature\u201d (for that's truly how Russians conceive of Eugene Onegin, although non-Russians don't generally know that) being transplanted into a radically different medium and yet surviving beautifully in, say, James Falen's or Babette Deutsch's anglicizations (and possibly in mine as well, but I can't be objective on that score).\nI often wondered about the hypothetical sci-fi scenario in which all traces of the Russian original were destroyed, so that all that was left of Eugene Onegin was, say, James Falen's English version of it \u2014 would Eugene Onegin have survived? And my answer always was a categorical and unmitigated \u201cYes!\u201d And that's how I think about the survival of human souls in other human brains \u2014 it's just that the \u201ctranslations\u201d of souls aren't nearly as high-quality as Falen's is of Pushkin's original. That's too bad, but it's life. You take what you can get.\nPushkin puts it this way, in stanza 38 of Chapter II of Eugene Onegin, in my translation (he's speaking of the young would-be poet named Lensky, who is in a cemetery standing near the graves of his parents and brooding poetically about life's all-too-fleeting nature):\nAnd there he, on the the stark, dark marker\nAtop his parents' graves, shed tears,\nAnd praised their ashes \u2014 darker, starker.\nAlas, life reaps too fast its years;\nAll flesh is grass. Each generation,\nAt heaven's hidden motivation,\nArises, blooms, and falls from grace;\nAnother quickly takes its place.\nAnd thus our race, rash and impetuous,\nAscends and has its day, then raves\nAnd hastens toward ancestral graves.\nAll too soon, death's sting will get to us;\nAye, how our children's children rush\nAnd push us from this world's sweet crush.\nNotice, by the way, the captial \u201cA\u201d at the beginning of each line \u2014 just a whim of mine that I indulged myself in (and which, I think, improved the stanza's quality, since this extra self-imposed constraint forced me to pay incredibly close attention to each and every word choice in each and every line to make everything flow effortlessly despite the constraint).\nAnd here, just for the sake of comparison, is James Falen's marvelously mellifluous and lyrical version of that same stanza:\nAnd then with verse of quickened sadness\nHe honored too, in tears and pain,\nHis parents' dust... their memory's gladness...\nAlas! Upon life's furrowed plain \u2014\nA harvest brief, each generation,\nBy fate's mysterious dispensation,\nArises, ripens, and must fall;\nThen others too must heed the call.\nFor thus our giddy race gains power:\nIt waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,\nThen crowds its forebears toward the grave.\nAnd we as well shall face that hour\nWhen one fine day our grandsons true\nStraight out of life will crowd us too!\nI hope that by comparing these two English versions of the Russian original, you can get a sense for how \u201cthe same pattern\u201d exists in them all \u2014 two of them in the medium or substrate of English, and one of them (unseen here) in the substrate of Russian. To me, this is a wonderful metaphor for soul transplantation.\nNew Reviews Notification\nTo receive notifications as new reviews are published, consider registering .

Are you supposed to cook it in a saucepan or in a bowl over boiling water? A chef on TV did it in a saucepan. When I did that I a got scrambled eggs in lemon juice.\nKenneth in New Orleans\nDear Kenneth,\nDefinitely use the bowl over simmering (not boiling) water because you have much more control over the heat. Eggs are drawn to heat like water is drawn to a sponge. Once they hit direct heat, as with the bottom of your saucepan, they turn solid.\nWith custards like lemon curd, the eggs should cook to just this side of solid. To get there you want them heated to between 170\u00baF. and 180\u00baF., but no higher. Having them over simmering water supplies the gentle heat you need for control and the slow cooking you want for a silky texture.\nYou want to keep the eggs moving every moment, so use an out-sized stainless steel bowl (about 8 quarts), which will let you whisk them constantly without overflow.\nUse the following as a hand-holder recipe for your second try at lemon curd. It's unusual in the way the butter goes into the curd.\nCREAMY LEMON CURD TART INSPIRED BY PIERRE HERME\nMakes an 11-inch tart serving 8 to 10\nLemon curd and the crust keep 4 days in the refrigerator, but assemble them no more than 8 hours ahead.\n30 minutes prep time; 20 minutes stove time; 15 minutes oven time\nNot your usual lemon curd, this is a billowing, silky cream with an extra tart snap to it. A combination of our favorite formula and a brilliant new idea, the recipe becomes a memorable tart in a gingersnap crust.\nFrance's Picasso of pastry, Pierre Herme, created an innovation for lemon curd. Instead of the usual cooking of lemon juice, sugar and eggs into a custard, and then melting butter into the mix, he cools down the custard to 140\u00baF. and in a blender whips in soft butter. At that temperature the butter doesn't fully melt so the curd becomes a lemon light cream.\nCook to cook: Prepare a large bowl of ice water, or fill the sink with ice water to cool down the bowl if the custard gets too hot. Also have handy a strainer and blender or food processor container. Most important: Never stop whisking the curd. If at any time it looks like the eggs are turning solid, immediately get it off the pot and into the cold water.\nLemon Curd\nFinely shredded zest of 3 lemons\n4 large eggs\nPinch salt\n3/4 cup, plus 2 tablespoons, freshly squeezed lemon juice (4 to 5 lemons), with pits removed\n2 -1/2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, softened\n1. Half fill a 6-quart pot with water. Set it over medium heat and bring the water to a simmer. Place the sugar and lemon zest in a large stainless steel bowl (about 8 quarts) that can be fitted into the pan without touching the water (pour some off if necessary). Off the heat, rub the sugar and zest together until sugar is moist, grainy and very aromatic (about 3 minutes). Whisk in the eggs and then the lemon juice.\n2. Fit the bowl atop the pan of water (make sure it's simmering not boiling). Cook, stirring with a whisk, until the curd thickens and reaches 180\u00baF. on an instant reading thermometer. The whole process could take 10 minutes.\nAs you cook the curd, whisking constantly, you'll see that first the curd is light and foamy, then the bubbles get larger, and finally, as the curd starts to thicken, the whisk leaves tracks. The curd is close to done. Keep whisking and checking the temperature.\n3. Once it reaches 180\u00baF., immediately scrape the curd into the strainer and strain it into the container of a blender or food processor. Let sit at room temperature until it reaches 140\u00baF. (about 10 minutes).\n4. With blender or food processor at high speed, add butter, several pieces at a time. Scrape down sides as you go. Once all the butter is used, blend for 4 minutes, pausing if needed. Refrigerate the lemon curd for several hours to four days before filling the crust.\nGingersnap Crust\n28 to 30 gingersnaps (I use the Mi-Del brand)\n1-1/2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger\n1/4 cup sugar\nPinch salt\n1 stick unsalted butter, melted\n1.Preheat oven to 350\u00ba F. In a food processor, grind the cookies to coarse crumbs. Turn them into a bowl, stirring in the ginger, sugar, salt, and butter. The mix should be moistened but not soaked with butter. If necessary, grind four or five more cookies and blend them in.\n2.Butter an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom Pack the cookie mixture into the bottom and sides of pan.\n3. Bake 10 minutes and cool to room temperature. Once cool, the crust can be wrapped airtight and held at room temperature 3 days.\n4. To serve, spread the lemon cream in the crust and chill 4 to 8 hours. Garnish with shreds of lemon peel.\nFollow The Splendid Table on Twitter: www.twitter.com/SplendidTable\nRecipes\nThe Splendid Table\u00ae's How To Eat Supper by Lynne Rossetto Kasper Dear Lynne, How do you create a stupendous lemon curd?

I get the other two (and sometimes three) kids wild. If my mother gave me five cents for every time I got the other kids wild, I would be a millionare (sic). The End.\nApparently, things went nothing but down hill from there. My brother typed the following on his personal stationery when he was sixteen years old. It was left on my parent\u2019s bed one evening. By the way, for those not familiar with the term \u201cnumismatist\u201d refers to a coin collector.\nHarry \u201cBuzz\u201d Waterston\n204 West 18th Street\nDeer Park, New York 11729\nI, Harry Neil Waterston, on this twenty-seventh day of the month of June, in the year 1964, do solemnly swear that never again will I baby-sit for my two sisters or any of their friends and/or relatives unless a set of qualifications which I shall mention later are fulfilled. I do declare this because:\n1. During the three years that I have been baby-sitting, I have suffered injustices directly or indirectly caused by my two sisters (i.e. tantrums, contempt for authority, and keeping me from the priveleges (sic) and pleasures any and all baby-sitters should enjoy).\n2. These injustices have been increased by the fact that for most of my three years sitting I have offered my services without benefit of\na wage, and because, in the arguments following my sisters frequent outbreaks of barbaric behavior, both my parents invariably take the side of my sisters, or simply abstain from all debate, in direct defiance of democratic ideals.\nThe qualifications, which must be fulfilled before I again take on the responsibilities of baby-sitting, are as follows:\n1. I must be given much more authority in disputes between me and my sisters, and my decision must prevail.\n2. I must be given the power to punish my sisters for any wrongdoing, as I see fit. This includes sending them to their rooms or adjusting their bedtimes.\n3. I must not be required to do any thing not normally required of any baby-sitter.\n4. I refuse to sacrifice my privleges (sic) and pleasures to my two sisters.\n5. I must be guaranteed an hourly wage, not to be adjusted or abolished except by both my consent and my parents.\nIf any one of these qualifications is not fulfilled, I refuse to sit again for the rest of my life.\nRespectfully submitted,\nHarry Neil Waterston\nP.S. THIS CAN VERY EASILY BE NOTARIZED AND TAKEN TO COURT!\nI would guess that the post script had to have been my parents\u2019 favorite part. The truth is I have no memory of causing Buzz such grief with my antics when he babysat. In fact, neither my sister, Janet, nor I remember much about growing up with him. He was not only seven years my senior, but was nine years ahead of me in school, having skipped two grades. He was out of the house, attending college in upstate New York, by the time I was nine years old.\nThere is only one time I do recall Buzzy babysitting us, and that was on a New\nYear\u2019s Eve when I was six. The carefully orchestrated night began in early\u00a0 evening with my mother inviting me to help her set up what she billed as \u201cgrown up hors d\u2019oeurves.\u201d There were three popular crackers in those days \u2013\u00a0 Ritz, Triscuits, and Wheat Thins. I laid them out carefully on a dinner plate, slightly overlapping and in concentric circles. My mother cut Swiss Jarlsburg and a block of creamy Muenster cheese into small cubes and let me spear each chunk with a colorful, frilly toothpick.\n\u201cWould you be willing to try smoked oysters?\u201d my mother asked, taking a tin from a nearby cabinet. I made a face, scrunching up my nose in disgust. \u201cWhy not taste just one and you don\u2019t have to finish it if you don\u2019t like it,\u201d she\nsuggested. As I thought this over, she sweetened the pot by adding, \u201cYou can open the can yourself.\u201d Anything smacking of grown-up behavior interested me. Once I\u2019d opened the oysters we drained the oily juice from the can and I dumped the plump little mollusks into a decorative bowl. My mother gamely stabbed one with a toothpick and popped it into her mouth. Emboldened, I followed suit. \u201cThis is good,\u201d I declared. Smiling, my mother ran a hand through my hair.\nTogether, we surveyed the table of snacks. \u201cThis is not like you and Daddy have,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d my mother asked. \u201cYou always have something hot. That you cook yourself,\u201d I said. My mother sighed audibly.\nShe thought for a moment, stood up and opened the cabinet again. \u201cHey, do you remember the hot artichoke dip I make when we have company? You love that,\u201d she said. I nodded enthusiastically. \u201cCan I help make it?\u201d I asked. \u201cSure,\u201d she said, pushing my shirt sleeves up over my elbows. She drained a can of\nartichoke hearts in the sink while I was allowed to grate the parmesan cheese over a piece of paper towel and to plop a few dollops of mayonnaise into the mouth of the blender. She added the cheese, minced garlic, the roughly chopped artichokes, salt and pepper into the blender and we pulsed the ingredients until they were nicely combined. My mother scraped the dip into an oven-proof baking dish and I sprinkled the top with rust-colored paprika. \u201cYour brother will just have to warm this up in the oven for twenty minutes. I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind,\u201d my mother said. She patted my bottom and told me to head upstairs to get into my pajamas.\nI went up to my room, changed, and began to read Winnie the Pooh. The plan was for Janet and me to go to sleep at our usual bedtime, and then Buzz would wake us a little before midnight so we could watch the great ball descend, click juice glasses, and yell \u201cHappy New Year!\u201d at the top of our lungs. At 11:30 that night, Buzz heated up the artichoke dip and thoughtfully laid out the food on folding trays in the den. He turned the television on and flipped the channels until he found the annual New Year\u2019s Eve countdown with Dick Clark as master of ceremonies. Then he entered our darkened bedroom to wake us. He found us like rag dolls, deep with sleep, and tried repeatedly to rouse us from our stupors. Janet finally sat up momentarily, only to flop back down in a lifeless heap. At five to midnight, Buzz gave up and returned to the den, ate three quarters of a pound of cheese, half the smoked oysters, and most of the artichoke dip while wearily watching the ball go down over Times Square. My parents arrived home to find him nursing a stomachache and composing a long, angry letter destined for them.\nBaked Artichoke Dip\nMakes about 1 \u00bd cups of dip\nIn the old days, before the advent of the food processor, we would make this in a blender. But I think the processor does a better job, so that\u2019s what I use now.\n1 \u2013 14 ounce can artichoke hearts, drained well\n1 large garlic clove, finely minced\n\u00be cup finely grated parmesan cheese\n\u00bd cup Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\u00bc teaspoon paprika\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Coarsely chop the artichoke hearts and drop them into the bowl of a food processor. Add garlic, mayonnaise, parmesan cheese, a pinch of salt and a healthy grinding of fresh black pepper. Process until well combined, about 5 seconds. Spoon mixture into a small oven-proof baking dish. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake for 20 minutes.

I can\u2019t wait for tomorrow. The recipes I have seen use fresh coconut. Is there any difference between using shredded and fresh coconut (besides the amount of work fresh coconut takes)? Thanks!\nCrunchy Betty\nFrom everything I\u2019ve read, nope. There is not much difference between fresh and shredded. I\u2019ve read a few sites saying that shredded/dried coconut retains all of the same goodness that\u2019s in fresh. SUCH a bonus there!\nhttp://laffytaffydaphne.blogspot.com/ Rebekah\nAre you serious? That\u2019s all there is to it?? I love making Thai curries and I am excited to see how this works!\nmw\nAre you sure the stuff on the top is coconut oil, as opposed to coconut *cream*? (ie, fattier, but not necessarily just oil.)\nJust asking! I have no idea, myself. But you get the same kind of creamy \u201clid\u201d on top with canned coconut milk too.\nCrunchy Betty\nSee, I really super fretted about whether to call it cream or oil. It TASTES like coconut oil \u2026 only just a little more creamy. Which maybe makes it cream? I have no idea. I was juts thinking, what is cream but mostly fat? And what is fat but oil? So \u2026 yeah.\nWhatever you want to call it, it\u2019s uber delicious and so skin-softening, too.\nhttp://califia7.blogspot.com/ Shonneky\nYou really are just the BEST when it comes to these tips and recipes. Thanks so much for taking the time to do this! I use coconut milk on my hair so I love the fact that I can make my own!\nCrunchy Betty\nOoooooooh! On the latest post about the castille/coconut shampoo, would you mind telling us all how you use it on your hair? I am DYING to know. And it may be a great alternative/addition to the \u201csorta \u2018poo\u201d we have going now.\nCan\u2019t wait to hear!\nTLE\nIn Asia, coconut milk is common in curries and to make coconut rice. I prefer it as my hair conditioner. Beats the strong smell of apple cider vinegar. I soak the shredded coconut and use a cloth to squeeze the milk (but now i have learnt about losing the \u2018oil\u2019\n). And simply use the milk to rinse hair, after baking soda or castile soap.Hair. IS. SO. SUPER. SOFT.SHINY. SMOOTH!\nSome find it greasy but it wears off in a day. So those with frizzy dry hair, your perfect natural solution is coconut milk! ;D If less conditioning effect is preferred,, you can use the milk from the subsequent processing/ squeesing, as effective, just a little less \u2018oily\u2019\n)\nBATHE!!!! I can\u2019t wait to try this and BATHE in it!!\nCrunchy Betty\nUm, guess what? (You\u2019ll see the newest post about the shampoo) But it makes the most incredible bubbles when mixed with castille. I haven\u2019t done any real tests to see how long the bubbles actually last, but I mixed up a little bowl full of bubbles with it today and it was HUGE!\nI think we may have found a homemade bubble bath that actually works like we expect it to.\nLucy\nWhat a fabulous idea. I love all things coconut! Totally going to make this into a coconut shake like the ones I used to drink in Thailand.\nShannon\nLucy Can we have the coconut shake recipe!!!!!! It sounds great!\nhttp://vanessasmith.webs.com/ Vanessa\nMakes me wonder if your could use it in ice cream? Mmmmm\u2026Like, you could stick the honey.yogurt, coconut milk combo in the freezer, and it would probably come out as a really nice ice cream.\nNow I want ice cream\u2026\n~Ness\nKarlita\nI love my ice cream maker. Add a bit of cream for the fat so the ice cream is creamy and I bet that would be delicious\nhttp://waistline32.wordpress.com Fidelle\nYes! In the Philippines our ice cream is made with equal parts cow\u2019s (or carabao\u2019s milk) and coconut milk.\nA lot of us are lactose intolerant so coconut milk is easier on the gut \u2026 and on the pocket!\nDairy, by the way, is very expensive in my country. Which is ok for me since we have lots of coconuts.\nAlso, I try to minimize bovine products since cattle-farming is not exactly sustainable.\nExcept maybe for your honey, yogurt and coconut dream ice cream. yuuuuummmmm!\nkaseyleilani\nI bet I could get the BF to drink this. He loves milk but he\u2019s lactose intolerant. This might just be the solution I was looking for! Are there any other benefits to making it yourself vs buying it? Is it cheaper (#1 priority for a college kid, of course)?\nI have visions of coconut milk & strawberries swirling in my head. Doesn\u2019t that just scream \u2018summer\u2019?\nCrunchy Betty\nIt is very, very cheaper. And I\u2019m lactose intolerant, too, so this was, like, just incredible to learn how cheaply I can make it! It\u2019s definitely better when you add in the vanilla extract and a tad bit of honey, too. (My neighbor also said he thought a little sprinkle of nutmeg on top would be divine. And it was.)\nCoconut milk, strawberries, honey, and mint.\nOH. MY. WORD.\nhttp://www.theeducatedlife.com Clara\nYou had me at coconut!!! You.Are.Amazing.

I am going to make some asap!\nMargie\n\u201cIf you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain\u201d\u2026 I made coconut milk a few days ago and have been singing this ever since. To the point where my husband now has it stuck in his head. hahaha The recipe said to cook it though so I faithfully cooked it and I think that\u2019s what made it turn brownish instead\u2026 I need to stop following random recipes like a big dumb sheep. oh well. tastes good in a smoothie! I added banana, strawberries, ground flax, honey, and cinnamon. Oh. My. Land. liquid breakfast of champions.\nCrunchy Betty\nHahahaha. I\u2019ll have you know, I read this comment earlier today when I didn\u2019t have time to respond, and I\u2019ve had that darned song stuck in my head ALL EVENING. Thank you very much. Tell your husband I feel his pain.\nI can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d want to cook it, but it\u2019s weird that it turned red. Really weird. Reminds me of the other day when I cut potatoes and had to leave them on the counter for 10 minutes to take care of something urgently. Came back, and they were a dark pinkish red. More than I\u2019ve ever seen potatoes turn. Weirdness.\nMargie\nThe worst part is I only know the first three lines\u2026 I might have to listen to it on youtube to get closure. The hubby is all excited about me making coconut milk, he\u2019s lactose intolerant and has been using almond milk, so he wants to try this out. It\u2019s nice to get the support when I\u2019m admittedly going a little hogwild trying to live more crunchtastically. He still insists on his old spice body wash. It\u2019s such an overpowering smell. That is a fortress I\u2019m determined to conquer.\nMargie\nMy husband\u2019s response to my comment about his body wash was, \u201cGreat, now all your hippie friends on here are going to boo me.\u201d\nYes we will, my love, because when men use Old Spice, somewhere butterflies wilt, kittens cry and maple trees lose their will to live.\nShannon\nhahahahahah Magie that is funny! My DH uses old spice too, maybe he would like the \u2018poo for his body wash, for Adam it is the bubbles that he needs (with his man pod body puff\nhttp://franticallysimple.com simply heidi\nThis sounds amazing! Any idea how it compares in price to canned?\nCrunchy Betty\nCanned (or boxed, as it comes so often these days) cannot compare to the frugalness that this is. I SO should\u2019ve done the math here. It might\u2019ve persuaded more people to try.\nHere\u2019s some VERY rough math right now: First, a 32-oz carton of SO Delicious coconut milk is around $4 at the store. 32 oz is 4 cups.\nThe bag of coconut I bought was something like $5 (I see it goes for $7 a pound at Mountain Rose Herbs, so let\u2019s use that instead).\nAccording to a really awesome weight conversion chart that lists out weights of foods to cups, there are 7 cups of shredded coconut in a pound.\nThat makes each 4-cup batch of coconut milk exactly 50 cents each, if we\u2019re using the $7 a pound price.\nAnd that\u2019s on the HIGH end. If we went by what I paid for my pound, it would be 36 cents per 32 ounces.\nA savings of $3.64 cents. Per carton.\nCRAZY!\nAwesome \u2013 thanks!\nhttp://www.makeitbakeitbuyitfakeit.blogspot.com Stephanie\nOh man, and here I thought the secret of life was butter! You are rockin\u2019 my DIY world with this!\nhttp://www.ecobeautysecrets.com Vivi\nI LOVE the taste of fresh coconut\u2026 I\u2019ll probably drink it before enough is left for my hair\u2026 But won\u2019t coconut milk raise bad cholesterol? I would love to blend it with blueberries but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna have my LDL levels shooting up. :\u2019(\nCrunchy Betty\nIt\u2019s so late here right now and my eyes are crossing with sleepiness, so I can\u2019t answer as coherently as I would like. Long story short, I\u2019ve read several studies that showed coconut oil actually lowers LDL (and that the composition of the oil is such that, even though it\u2019s a saturated fat, it\u2019s really good for you \u2026 as are a few other saturated fats). It\u2019s just important not to eat hydrogenated coconut oil, which, of course, you\u2019re not doing if you\u2019re drinking coconut milk made from water and shredded coconut.\nTry doing a few searches on \u201ccoconut oil raised LDL\u201d and \u201ccoconut oil cholesterol benefits.\u201d See what you think!\nhttp://www.ecobeautysecrets.com Vivi\nYeah, found lots of positive info about coconut oil reducing LDL but not much on coconut milk. Unfortunately, though, I started consulting a naturopath/nutritionist the other day and she put me on a Blood Type diet. I\u2019m a Type A and my diet seems very restrictive. It takes out most of the things that I usually crave for, coconut milk and oil being some of them.\nI feel like crying but I\u2019ll give this a try for 3 weeks.\nWEFA\nI feel soooo bad for you! You should check out a movie called \u201cFat Head\u201d thats free on hulu or can watch on netflix, and check out westonaprice.org (nourishing tradtions type diet) and marksdailyapple.com. (primal blueprint which is now what my family eats, and my husband is in a wheelchair and seen great progress with it) Trust what your body craves, our bodies have been evolving this way to help us live longer, Doctors and nutritionists seem to forget that, in lieu of getting paid to say what ever brings in more money (veggie oils, and grain-based food pyramid jump out.)\nhttp://www.ecobeautysecrets.com Vivi\nThe \u201cwhat your body craves is what you body needs\u201d seem to apply well to my hubby but I think I\u2019ll get a heart attack at 45 if I follow my cravings \u2019cause I used to crave for unhealthy stuff all the time, lol\u2026 Like creme brulee\u2019, steak, creme brulee, steak.. that sort of craving. So far, I\u2019ve seen some improvements on my health after the detox and now I\u2019m retuning to normal food but healthier. I guess my body just needed to unclog all the dirty pipes inside \u2019cause previously it seemed that nothing from what I ate really got absorbed. I\u2019m currently following something similar to the primal blueprint (my nutritionist doesn\u2019t know about this, she thinks I\u2019m still on detox) and so far I\u2019m feeling great! I\u2019m glad it\u2019s working well for your husband, too.\ntracy\nplease please please look at marks daily apple and the primal blueprint it will change your life!\nBecky\nDid you also know that if you dry the leftover coconut solids in the oven or a dehydrator or something, and reblend them a little, you have COCONUT FLOUR!!!! Coolness! That stuff is expensive! I only need a few tablespoons for the occasional recipe, so here it is! Yea for Coconut! Yea for Crunchy Betty!!!\nKarinSDCA\nVery cool!!!\nmissdaze\nohh, so good. I just tried this and it is very good. Even my husband loved it. He asked me, \u201choney could you make me some hot cocoa with this??\u201d. Sure thing. First batch gone before it even cooled. So I made another to cool, and drink later. Only reused the coconut two or three times, because it was looking a little watery for me. Also made the dry shampoo by grinding oats, and the coconut butter deoderant. All in about an hour. Crunchy Girl you are my hero!\nJennifer\nThis is perfect! I don\u2019t buy canned coconut milk any more because of BPA in cans and the extra ingredients in the canned stuff. But I love it. Now, I can make it myself! Thank you Crunchy Betty!\nRebecca\nI use this recipe too but I have also added an alteration to the cheesecloth straining method. I use a french press for coffee. It works sooo well and is instantaneous. I don\u2019t have to pour and wait for it to strain, pour and wait for for it to strain\u2026you get the picture. I also never burn my hands wringing that last little bit out.\nhttp://laffytaffydaphne.blogspot.com/ Rebekah\nYou are brilliant. THANK YOU.\nTrish\nI love me some coconut milk. Its fabulous in many ways, fancy little drinks.\nHeres a great treat you can make with the cream from the top\nIngredients\n1 Tbsp (or to taste) of Steviva Blend\n1 tsp. Vanilla Extract (I use organic, non alcoholic)\ndash of organic Cinnamon\nDirections\nPlace coconut milk upside down in refrigerator, preferably overnight. Better if you make a few batches of coconut milk so you ge ta decent yield of the cream.\nScoop just the solid cream portion into a medium size bowl, being careful not to scoop out any of the liquidfied milk. Save the liquid for a smoothie. Add to cream in bowl,\n1tbsp stevia blend or sweetner of your choice, Vanilla Extract and dash of Cinnamon. Whisk until smooth.\n(its really yummy on cakes and other sweets in place of dairy)\nTrish\nthat is Coconut Whipped Cream, sorry I didn\u2019t leave a \u201ctitle\u201d for the recipe\nVasilisa\nI made this today and I\u2019m obsessed. I used it as a moisturizer/toner after washing my face by dabbing it on my skin with a cotton ball. It was very moisturizing and not at all greasy. I highly recommend it!\nBrianna\nI\u2019m making coconut milk from my fresh (well, I deshelled it and froze it, so fresh-frozen) coconut right now. My boyfriend\u2019s grating it for me\n. I\u2019m going to try making the sorta-poo\u2026and maybe some curry\u2026.and a smoothie\u2026or two. Wish me luck!\nJulie\nExcellent! I live in/around a lot of woods, so my favorite trick is to go outside and pick a bunch of wine berries to blend in. They\u2019re not quite as sweet as blueberries, so it gives the c. milk a really amazing, slightly tart flavor (just watch out for seeds). The black mulberries are starting to come in to, so they\u2019re my next adventure, and it\u2019s all FREE!!\nCrunchy_Mama\nHow well does this freeze? I\u2019m busy mama and I like to make things in batches and freeze them if I can. I really want to make the shampoo, but I can\u2019t see myself making coconut milk every week so I can wash my hair. I\u2019d be more faithful to it if I could just thaw it out and add the soap\u2026\nRebecca\nCoconut milk freezes great. Pour it into an ice cube tray and dump the cubes into a baggie for easy access.\nAmber\nLet me preface this with the simple facts that one, I\u2019m new at crunchy. Two, I\u2019m an idiot. I thought if the bagged coconut would make great milk, imagine how phenomenal a fresh coconut would be\u2026.. (again.. idiot). I have cursed a blue streak today and there\u2019s a good possibility my neighbors will have me committed.\nI couldn\u2019t crack my coconut. It didn\u2019t have a hull, it had armor. If I could have found my husband\u2019s reciprocating saw and a blade for metal, I would have made short work of it. Instead, it ended up with a massive war between The Big Idiot and The Coconut.\nI ended up using a sledgehammer. Let me rephrase\u2026 I did not wrap the stupid coconut in a towel first.. I placed it on my back porch and started whacking with a sledgehammer. I missed the first few times. My neighbors saw a fat woman, chasing a coconut with a sledgehammer, and cussing. Once I wrapped it in a towel and took out my frustration.. two whacks, pulverized coconut.\nAnd NOW I can finally make the milk. So folks.. learn from my mistake. Trust CrunchyBetty. If she says it is good and easier this way, it is. Otherwise, your neighbors walk over and ask you if you\u2019ve been drinking your lunch again.\nhttp://vanessasmith.webs.com/ Vanessa\nYou know what? I did the same thing, lmao. Except I got a young coconut because they\u2019re supposed to taste better. First we spent an hour carving the husk off, and then came the actual coconut. Ugh. Another hour was spent trying to whack that sucker open. Unexpectedly we found the eye with a drill and we were consequently covered in coconut water (yuck). Finally, three hours later, we managed to crack it open (btw, you\u2019ll notice that I kept saying \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 it was a joint effort with me and my grandmother. At one point, it stopped being a project and we donned war paint and machetes).\nTurns out young coconut is too slimy to use to turn into milk, and it doesn\u2019t taste too good either. I threw it in the blender with some yogurt and clay and made a mask. My skin turned out rather nice.\nNext time, I will buy bagged, shredded coconut.\nhttp://waistline32.wordpress.com Fidelle\nLove your comment! Super funny!\nMature brown coconut is called \u201cniyog\u201d in Filipino. Young green coconuts are called \u201cbuko\u201d. Shredded (or noodled) young coconut is yummy in a fruit salad.\nI ask the vendors in cart to shred or \u201cnoodle\u201d the buko so I can drink it with the coconut water. So refreshing when chilled! No sugar \u2013 just pure goodness. My mom puts a little sugar on hers, though. I take its as part of a cleanse. I also drink it to rehydrate after boxing.\nAs a midwife, I recommend it to all women to help prevent UTI. Before resorting to expensive (and harmful!) antibiotics, I recommend it to pregnant women with in the early stages of UTI. This is like a tropical version of your cranberry juice, which we don\u2019t have in our country.\nLauren @ DessertsByLauren.com\nLOL I just ordered a coconut from Fresh Direct. \u00a0But I watch food network all the time and I know how to open a coconut. \u00a0First, drill 2 holes in the \u201ceyes\u201d of the coconut and drain out the water. \u00a0Then pop in the oven at 375\u00ba for about 15 minutes. \u00a0Then the coconut will crack easily. \u00a0Peel the skin with a veggie peeler and cut up the coconut. \u00a0I watched Alton Brown make a coconut cake the other day and this is how he got the meat out of the coconut. \u00a0He made coconut milk (using cows milk), coconut cream, and coconut extract with it.\nhttp://ahandmadelife.blogspot.com/ Heather\nThis is brilliant. I\u2019ve been wanting to find a way to avoid buying cans of coconut milk, can\u2019t wait to give this a try. Thank you for sharing it.\nKarinSDCA\nI found unsweetened shredded coconut in BULK last weekend on a road trip!!!! I was super ecstatic and my non-crunchy friend was less than impressed. LOL The funny thing is I couldn\u2019t remember what I actually wanted it FOR, but I knew I wanted it. I filled a bag and have been trying to recall why for a week now. SOOOO happy I found this blog entry again!!!!!!!!\nTrisarahtops7\nWait, the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of coconut milk? I thought that\u2019s what the recipe was for\u2026\u2026. or did you mean 1/2 coconut?\nCrunchy Betty\nHa! Nice catch. Typo on my end. Apparently I\u2019d just typed \u201cmilk\u201d after \u201ccoconut\u201d WAY too many times. The recipe calls for 1/2 c. shredded coconut. Editing that puppy out.

Homemade coconut milk, however, is something I grew up with \u2013 my roots are in the Caribbean. Check my post on how to bust and milk a coconut. So I\u2019ve been making coconut milk almost every day. Two questions:\n1. What to do with the coconut flour?\n2. Why did my last two batches turn into gloppy gloop after 24 hours? I immediately refrigerated the milk in glass bottles. The only thing I can think of is that the coconuts were not as fresh as the previous ones.\nThanks, enjoyed your blog!\nOdddlycrunchy\nShannon\nYou can bake with coconut flour!

Today I am going to briefly discuss a few new projects that the VLC team is working on, that will be beneficial to the playback of high-definition movies in the future. I personally just got a Blu-Ray disc writer for the holiday season and plan to use it to author family stuff with a high-definition camcorder, like the Panasonic SD900 in the future! Past versions prior to VLC 1.1.13 didn't have Blu-Ray playback support even for Unencrypted discs i.e Independent video productions from AVCHD camcorders, etc. What is this important? In the Internet age with all of these cool AVCHD camcorders more and more people want to \"professionally\" author their own home films at a fraction of the cost, so logically it only makes sense to want to support playback of home Blu-Ray discs.\nThe Story of the MPAA and the Blu-Ray Controversy\nUnfortunately, on the flipside the MPAA has made great strides to prevent would be \"pirates\" from decrypting commercial discs with AACS and BD+ copy protection. In doing so though they have also made it NEARLY impossible to reverse engineer the specification for legit playback and home video purposes. This in my opinion is more of a crime then stringent \"copy protection\" mechanism and supersedes the entire AACS or BD+ controversy, which is separate entity in and of itself. The VLC team on the other hand is working effortlessly to make that reality and supporting them will only help with this half of the puzzle in the future. What are your thoughts? Are you looking forward to having Blu-Ray playback support in the future? Is the industry doing everyone a disservice by locking us into proprietary standards with codecs for the sake of \"control\"? I am always interested in hearing your opinions. If not then it is still food for thought. I will be back next week or the week after with a new unrelated entry. Until then I am providing you with a link, so that you can snag the latest version of libbluray 0.2.1 and playback early movies recorded with your new AVCDHD camcorder on your computer assuming your Linux distro does not have support for these packages yet!

The main piece of trivia associated with the show (apart from the fact that most of the backing tracks on the Monkees albums were not played by the Monkees at all, but by a band called Candy Store Prophets) was that the mother of guitarist Mike Nesmith (the one in the hat) invented correction fluid and it is a genuine rags-to-riches story.\nJust after World War Two Bette Nesmith Graham was a single mother who was employed as a typist, but she was also something of an artist. She knew that artists often painted over their mistakes and so she figured it must be possible to develop a type of paint to mask typing errors. She experimented at home, mixing her concoctions in a food blender, and her early efforts were soon in demand in the office where she worked. She set up a cottage industry, making and selling her product, which was originally called Mistake Out, but which she later renamed Liquid Paper. That cottage industry boomed and not long before her death in 1980, she sold the company for 47.5 million dollars.\nAnd it was probably the perfect time to sell, for as the eighties advanced the typewriter became an endangered species, driven out by the unstoppable march of the far more efficient word processor. Sales of correction fluid plummeted as on-screen editing became the norm. The typewriter had come up against a rival it simply could not fight off and, just as CDs all but put an end to vinyl records and the arrival of the tea bag caused mass redundancies among the nation's tealeaf readers, the old Remmington was consigned to the attic, another victim of progress.\nThose who jumped ship from mechanical to electronic typing found the changeover fairly easy to deal with. The keyboard set up was pretty much the same and it was simply a matter of typing onto a screen rather than paper. But diving straight into something new because the basic functions are easy to perform is perhaps not the best route as there are always hidden glitches that could pop up, so some form of proper grounding is the best way forward.\nA good example that has perplexed many a novice is the Overtype function. Our novice may have familiarised himself with the basics of Word and can type away quite merrily, but then one day it happens. He returns to a paragraph he has already typed to insert some text he missed out (say, putting the word 'Wednesday' after 'Sheffield'). He has done this many times before so he positions the cursor in the required place and types. Instead of pushing the existing type along as he had expected, however, he is aghast to see that the fresh typing is actually deleting the existing text as he types. Thinking, and hoping, that this was some sort of one-off glitch, he continues, re-typing the text that has just been deleted. No joy; the cursor continues to gobble up his copy like Pacman.\nWhat he has done is press the Insert key by accident. This puts the cursor into Overtype mode and, as the name suggests, anything typed in the middle of existing text will delete that text as it goes. The solution is simplicity itself; he has to press the Insert key again and his typing will push the existing text along like before, but as our novice does not know this, he is flummoxed. When the Overtype function is activated the letters OVR are highlighted in a box on the status bar at the bottom of the screen, so it is possible to tell what will happen to existing text before you type in the middle of it.\nI have to say that in many years of using Word I have never had occasion to use the Overtype function and that key was quite redundant, apart from occasional accidental strikes. Then I discovered that it is possible to change the function of the Insert key quite easily, and transform it into a Paste button that will perform the same task as pressing Ctrl + V. To do this in pre-2007 versions of Word, go to Tools/Options and click on the Edit tab. Check the Use INS Key For Paste box then click OK.\nFor Word 2007 go to Office/Word Options and click Advanced. Scroll down to Cut, Copy and Paste. Check the Use Insert Key for Paste box. And click OK.\nAnd there you have it; a paste shortcut and no more overtype confusion. Bear in mind, however, that if you do change the function of the Insert key, any unintended strikes of it will dump the contents of the clipboard into your document, although this is easily dealt with by clicking Undo.\nAuthor is a freelance copywriter.

Done properly, it's superior to a commercial diet.\nWhy bother with cooking?\nPros\nControl over the quality of ingredients unlike with commercial food\nUse of real bones, not commercial bone meal or recreating bones via eggshell powder and trace minerals etc.\nIf you have concerns about salmonella & e.coli in raw meat, cooking takes care of it.\nCons\nUncertainty about supplementation amount due to lack of comprehensive information at this time as to what is lost in the cooking process\nCooking changes the nutrients in meat; at the very least, there is reduction in the levels of fat, taurine, and water-soluble vitamins and minerals as well as enzyme activity.\nHow do I cook for my cats?\nStart with your choice of whole rabbit, chicken, game hen, turkey, etc. Stick to whole animals and birds, as different parts of an animal/bird have different nutrient composition. \u00a0Include all organs. \u00a0Per lb of meat add in 1 Tablespoon of vegetables at the very end so as not to cook them to mush.\nCooking method:\n* Bake it in the oven - Coat the outside of the meat (skin) with ghee or butter. Depending on your oven and altitude, you will need to adjust baking time.\u00a0 Bake covered at 350F for 3 hours (some people have told me it took 5 hours in their oven, YMMV). Remove cover and bake for an additional 15 - 30 minutes to crisp the outside a bit. Along with chicken or any meat broth (without onions), add to a food processor or blender. Grind/blend and serve.\n* Pressure cooker - uses less water than crockpot.\u00a0 You can use the plate/base/trivet that comes with the cooker to place the meat.\u00a0 This way less water will be required and the meat will not burn.\u00a0 Please note time required for cooking will vary widely based on the type of cooker you have, so these are very general guidelines.\nAlthough I've come across similar timings at various sites saying a whole chicken will cook in 20-25 minutes, depending on how many chickens will be coooked at one time, the lbs of pressure, etc. you can expect it to take as much as 1 - 1.5 hours before the bones will be soft enough to grind and as long as 2 hours if you want them to turn to mush.\u00a0 Cornish game hen takes a lot less time but rabbit, venison, and lamb can take longer because the bones are harder. Add in 1-2 teaspoons real (not from a bottle) lemon juice (apple cider vinegar can be used as a substitute) in the pressure cooker for every 4 to 5 lbs of meat to help this process along.\nIf your pressure cooker takes longer than a couple of hours to cook say 2 whole chickens around 4 lbs each, rather than cooking the living daylights out of the meat, it's better to remove the meat off the bones as soon as it's possible to do so, and continue to cook the bones in the same water.\n* Crockpot - In general, same as with pressure cooker with 2 differences - when the meat and bones are put in, add water till the meat is covered.\u00a0 In addition to more water, there's one more big difference - a crock pot typically could take approximately 7-8 hours (note -- some members have told me they had to cook for 12 hours), after which one can then leave unplugged overnight for another 7-8 hours.\u00a0 As with pressure cookers, time can vary greatly.\nFor both pressure cooker and crockpot, bones are usually soft enough to mash with a potato masher or back of a spoon.\u00a0 Even better, to be on the safe side, run cooked bones, all the meat, organs, and broth/liquid through a blender or food processor. No special meat grinder is needed. \u00a0If you wish to get a meat grinder, a hand-crank grinder works quite well.\nWhat about supplementation?\nHere's an example using USDA information on raw chicken thighs - meat and skin (no listing for whole chicken):\nhttp://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c20Bm.html\nAs a comparison, the exact same amount of cooked thighs skin and meat contains:\nhttp://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c20Bq.html\nPresumably the method of cooking would make a difference. Baking could possibly cause different amounts of nutrient loss than say using a crock pot or pressure cooking (closest to what they have listed as \"stewing\").\nIn the above comparison, the protein amount is a tad higher presumably due to moisture loss, but everything else is pretty much lower in cooked vs raw chicken thighs e.g. fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E.\u00a0 By saving the liquid if using crock pot or pressure cooker, this issue becomes less critical. \u00a0How much so is anyone's guess.\nAlso, water-soluble B vitamins as well as Macro minerals - Ca, Mag, Phos, etc. are lower for cooked meat. They don't list all the trace minerals but what they do doesn't seem to be all that different.\nSo basically you'd have to supplement more with a cooked diet. How much would determine on cooking method and type of meat, but the above data is the best objective guideline I could find. \u00a0For pork loin, as an example, comparing Vitamin B amts for raw:\nVs cooked - http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/pork-products/2252/2\nThere is not quite 1/2 of the B vitamin amount left after cooking. We don't know if they include cooking water in it or not. So many unknowns:(\nAs for taurine, since it's not supposedly as critical for humans (we can produce it in our bodies from other amino acids), it's not listed at the USDA site. However one academic paper ( Spitze et al 2004 ) found baking caused a 60% loss in taurine and boiling led to 80% loss.\nAll this of course is for meat and skin alone, which is tricky enough. To complicate matters, there is no published information at least not that I have been able to find on what happens to bones after cooking. In other words, are macro and trace mineral amounts affected? How does it change structurally? All unanswered questions at this point. For what it's worth, no commercial canned or dry food contains bones. All contain either calcium carbonate or Di/Tricalcium phosphate plus trace minerals to mimic bones.\nNot to discourage home-cooking, but since we don't quite exactly what is lost in the cooking process, adding it back in is a bit tricky. \u00a0One can follow the recipes in the raw area of the site as a base and be more aggressive with supplementation of taurine and B-complex. \u00a0For each type of meat, consult the USDA/nutritiondata site and compare values of all items for raw vs cooked. \u00a0A cooked diet is still head-and-shoulders above a commercial diet , so go for it :)\nIn-between options - if you're not quite ready to rawfeed just yet, here are some baby steps:\n* Mix of raw and cooked, that is, feed a mix of raw meat and organs mixed with cooked bones, all blended up:\nRemove raw meat from bones, but then instead of discarding the bones, cook the bones alone. Grind the meat raw and the bones in cooked form. Cooked bones are very easy to grind in a regular blender/mixer. * Quick sear at feeding time:\nPrepare the cats' raw mix, and at feeding time, heat up ghee or any animal fat in a pan such as bacon, add in the mix, and do a quick sear (i.e. 10-15 seconds, 30 seconds max) on each side or even on just one side. Serve with the cooked side up so your cats can get the aroma of cooked meat. Over time, decrease cooking time until your cats are on all-raw.\n* Serving\u00a0warmed, but not cooked meat: (thanks to Clarence's mom Brenda for this great idea which allows one to use a raw recipe, and not have to worry about loss of nutrients due to baking/stewing):\nAt feeding time, measure out each kitty's meal onto an oven-safe plate. \u00a0Place plates into a toaster oven for about 2 minutes. Any longer would cook the meat, and like many other cats Brenda's like their food warmed but not cooked. Initially if your cats refuse this, you can leave their dishes in the oven for just a few seconds longer to bake the meat.\nRemove the plates from the toaster oven, and let them cool for 1-2 minutes.\nAdd taurine, fish/krill oil, and any other supplements, and serve to your feline masters.\nLast Updated on Monday, 27 June 2011 19:01\n\u00a9 1997-2011 Sandy Arora, Holisticat.

Although the information here might not apply to so me of the smaller or more remote towns, I suspect it will apply to much of the UK. On the other hand I should give is that Brighton is a particularly liberal, free-spirited sort of place that gets a lot of foreign visitors: consequently I may have a view of Britain as a slightly more \"open-minded \" place than other parts of Britain actually are. One particular warning I feel compelled to give is that I have no experience living in London which, being a major world city, has unique rules and idiosyncracies of its own. So if that's where you're moving, caveat emptor: for any given statement I make you should mentally append \"it may be different in London.\"\nAlso keep in mind the information here reflects a particular point of time (specifically, April '93 when I moved to Brighton, until the present, January '95). I have no doubt that that many of the facts and certainly the prices will all sound very quaint in one or two years' time. I put all costs in US dollars for the purpose of simplicity. The exhange rate I use is $1.50 to the UK pound, which it hovered around (plus or minus 2 cents) during most of the time I lived in the UK. Note that even though the \"last modified\" date that I give at the beginning of this FAQ may show a more recent date, it does not mean that I updated the prices at that time.\nThis FAQ is written by a single author. Ordinarily FAQs are compendiums of wisdom on subjects relevant to a large number of people on matters for which there are generally agreed-upon answers, but this is not the case with this FAQ. This is a highly specialized topic, and includes discussion of matters that are of a subjective nature. It has not been exhaustively researched like a Frommer's Guide to be equally true for all Americans from all sorts of regions and socio-economic levels; rather it's the sort of guide where the reader should figure out whether my viewpoint is one they're likely to share based on the way I say things. On the other hand, subjects of a more factual nature (like electrical products) have benefitted from numerous suggestions and corrections I have received by email responses, which I welcome and for which I am very grateful (see the acknowledgements section at the end).\nI've received many positive responses on the accuracy of this FAQ from many people for whom it is relevant, that is, Americans who have lived, will be living, or currently are living in the UK. Occasionally I get a critical (sometimes nasty) reply from someone saying that I generalize too much, that I am inaccurate or excessively critical in my assessment of life in the UK. Interestly enough, such comments almost invariably come from people with no stake whatsoever in the matter of what it's like being an American living in the UK, but British readers who saw the FAQ posted on the USENET groups uk.misc or soc.culture.british and read it just to see what a Yank has to say about their country. If you are such a reader please think twice about sending me your criticisms, since the perceptions that are true for you may not be true for someone who grew up in America.\nI left the UK in April 1995 and have been living in Chicago since.\nBack to list of questions...\nCan I run US-made electrical devices (appliances, stereos, computers) in the UK?\nBing! You've just asked the very most Frequently Asked Question regarding a move to the UK. The UK, of course, has a completely different electrical standard than the US (in terms of voltage, current available, frequency, and physical plugs). There is a lot of information to consider here, at di fferent levels of technicality; there are no quick answers to some problems, so please read carefully. A warning: the advice given here is based on my own experience, and the information I have recieved from informed individuals. None of it should be considered the advice of a professio nally qualified electrician. I cannot be held responsible for any accidents or lawsuits that occur from following the advice contained in this FAQ.\nIn my view, your best start is to find a store that deals primarily in selling foreign electronics goods, and get a friendly salesman to explain the ins and outs of power conversion. Such shops (found only in large cities, I'm afraid) will be listed under \"Export shops\" in the yellow pages; you might also try \"Freight Forwarding\" and ask where such shops may be found in that area. Another idea is to ask people who work at specialty shops for Asians and Indians (food shops, video stores); they may know of a local export shop.\nThere are four matters relating to using US appliances in the UK\nthe voltage ( US = 120V, UK = 240V )\nthe number of watts the product draws (different for each product)\nthe frequency ( US = 60 Hz, UK = 50 Hz )\nthe plug on the power cord\nBack to list of questions...\nHow can I convert?\nTo have a US item run under UK current you need to buy a transformer, a product that you plug into the wall and has a US-style jack at the other end. The transformer will \"step down\" in voltage from 240 to 120v. From there you may want to plug in a US-style power strip and provide current for sev eral products.\nNext you need to consider how many watts your transformer is providing (all transformers should clearly indicate this). The more wattage required by the electrical item(s), the bigger (and more expensive) the transformer will need to be. Add up all the watts that every one of the components wi ll draw that will be turned on at the same time, then throw in 20-25 extra watts for good measure, and that's about the size you need. So if you have three stereo components drawing 30 watts each, get a transformer than delivers about 120 watts. Don't try to draw more than what the transformer pr ovides: you will be risking the health of you and your electronic components!\nNow, on to the frequency of the product, a subject which is notorious for causing great confusion. UK outlets provide a frequency of 50 Hz. Transformers do not provide a conversion to US 60 Hz; you are stuck with UK 50 Hz. The only electrical products that need concern you regarding this frequency mismatch are products that contain motors (i.e. things that run fans, spin wheels, rotate things, etc.). But...there are two kinds of motors that will be found inside electrical products, and one type is affected by the frequency, while the other is not.\nSynchronous motors are affected by the frequency mismatch. When such a motor made for 60 Hz receives 50 Hz, it runs at 5/6 speed. You will generally find that any product that contains a motor that runs at high speed (e.g. hair dryer), or must drive something with great force (e. g. power drill) will be a synchronous motor.\nDC motors are not affected by the frequency mismatch, because the motor runs on DC (for which frequency is irrelevant) and the DC current is supplied internally by the product. Thus, as long as the product gets current from a proper transformer, the motor inside will run at the correc t speed. Generally, any product which requires only a small motor (e.g. Walkman cassette player, computer disc drive) uses its own low-voltage (5 or 12 volts) DC motor.\nYou may ask: \"So if I don't particularly mind that a product with a synchronous motor is running at 5/6 speed, can I run it safely anyway?\" The answer is \"probably.\" I have been warned that some products (rare, and perhaps even illegal by UL standards) are rated for no lower than 60 Hz, and w ill overheat when supplied with 50 Hz. The only way you can be sure is to find out the minimum frequency that the product may be run at (which should be 50), for which may need a trained electrician if the manual doesn't say so. But if the item is a modern product by a company with a good reputat ion, you probably needen't worry.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat are the differences in power plugs/jacks in US and UK?\nThere is only one type of plug in common use in the UK, a three prong plug, larger than the US three-prong equivalent. A schematic below (which requires a monospaced font to be viewed correctly) illustrates the differences between the blades of the two plugs:\nUS:             UK: o | | | - -\nThere is an older, two prong plug which apparently is still in use in older dwellings that haven't been updated, but I have never seen them, even in quite old fashioned cottages. So if a salesman selling you UK/US adapters tells you need to need to be equally prepared for both kinds o f plugs, he's wrong.\nThe UK plug also differs from the US one in that a fuse is contained inside. Until recently, when you purchased an electrical product often times it would have no plug at the end of the power cord, which you'd have to buy separately and attach yourself. The practice has recently been discontin ued (supposedly abolished by law), so you will may not even encounter the problem. While we're on that subject, you'll also discover that most UK electrical outlets have switches on them, like the switch on a power strip. And, like all other switches in the UK (such as those used for room lights) the effect of the position of the switch is opposite that of the US: down means on, up means off!\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat features should I look for a transformer?\nGo for good quality here. The small products that are made for the vacation traveler, sold at department stores and places like Radio Shack are not just poor quality, they aren't even transformers at all. They try to simulate a transformer with capacitors, and they can 'short-circuit', blowing up whatever they are powering. You know you are being conned when you see a so-called \"1600 watt transformer\" the size of a portable electric shaver, weighing 16 oz and costing $20: a true 1600 watt transformer is far larger, heavier and more expensive (see below).\nGo instead to an export shop, if you can find one. They tend to carry a wide range of authentic transformers. Look at the back of every one of your electrical items you plan to bring to the UK, write down its power consumption in watts, and take this list to the vendor, and see what he/she rec ommends.\nMany commercial transformers I have seen only provide a two-prong US jack, i.e., no ground, so you'll have to look harder to find one with a ground, i.e., three prongs. People with some expertise have told me that it can be very risky to bypass the ground plug (with one of those three-to-two-pr ong adapters) when using products that require a ground.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhere can I get a transformer, and for how much?\nFirst of all, you might consider whether it might not be better to wait until getting to the UK to buy transformers. There's not much of a market in the US for converters, since there is only one electrical standard in the US and Canada. Europe seems to be a little more aware of the existence of different electrical standards in the world, and thus stores probably have better availability and wider selection. Furthermore, for some reason professional electrical equipment used at building sites in the UK use the US standard of 110v, which means there is a market here for 240-to-110V transf ormers capable of delivering a LOT of power. Also, keep in mind that all transformers are very heavy: my own 1000 watt converter is about 4x4x4 inches in size, and about 35 lbs in weight (so you'll have to ship it rather than take it on the plane with you). On the other hand, they may be cheape r in the US (see prices below).\nUK sources\nThere is a electronic parts catalogue sales company in Britain called RS Components which deals in transformers; they deal with the public through a mail order company called Electromail, P.O. Box 33, Corby, Northants, NN1 79EL (telephone 0536 204555, fax 0536 405555). I hear that a 500w c onverter costs $105.\nA company in the northwest, in Runcorn called Spenfields will make up transformers to order. The cost for a 1250 watt transformer with two US-type 2 or 3 pin plugs is $328. They take about 7 days to make up. The phone number is 0928 572578.\nI'm told that a hardware chain store in Britain called Ryness sells transformers, but I have no further information on this.\nMaplins supply a range of transformers: Maplins Electronics plc, PO Box 777, RAYLEIGH, Essex SS6 8LU, Tel. 01702 552961. Their catalogue can be obtained at the UK bookseller chain W.H.Smith.\nUS sources\nMagellons Essentials for the Traveler (Santa Barbara, CA), 1-800-962-4943 (they have an extensive catalog). A 1000w transformer is listed as costing $118.50, and a 1500 watt at $169.50.\nAppliances Overseas, in New York City.\nRainco of Dallas, TX (800 779 0502) (fax 214 242 0243) sell transformers similar to those in the Magellon catalog.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat items should I not bring?\nEasily replaced items that draw vast amounts of current are unwise to bring because the cost of the transformer you will need for them will probably be several times more than the cost of buying the product anew in the UK! For any given item, take a look at the number of watts they require, consid er the cost of transformers you'll need to convert them. It may be much more economical to replace them with the same items bought in UK stores. This may sound expensive, but if you settle for a cheaper food processor to replace your industrial-strength Cuisinart, it won't be bad at all. And bes ides, you don't want industrial-strength commercial transformers sitting on your kitchen and bathroom counters, do you? Here is a list of some items you should just decide to leave at home:\nHair driers\nKitchen appliances with motors: blenders, food processors, coffee grinders\nAny other item with a high speed motor, e.g. power drills\nYour US-made LP record turntables or cassette decks may contain synchronous motors, in which case they will run at 5/6 speed, or about 3.2 musical semitones too flat (yes, bad enough that it will ruin the music: even John Cage's 4'33\" will come out lasting 55\" too long!). Battery powered Walkm an cassette players will be fine, though, even when run with the AC cord.\nYour American-bought TV sets, Video Cassette machines, and the cassettes that are made to play on them, are likely to be of little use to you. If you bring both your TV and VCR from home, the only thing you will be able to do with them (after you've bought the gigantic transformer you' ll need to convert the watts) is watch American-made video tapes on your VCR. You will not be able to watch British TV broadcasts, or British-made video tapes, nor will you be able to hook up a British-made VCR to that TV set. This is because both British TV sets and VCRs (yes, both) run on a different video standard than in the US: the standard in the US is NTSC, while in the UK it is PAL. Don't be confused by the fact that the physical cassette is called \"VHS\" and looks just like the ones back home: they are the same cassette, but the information is encoded on them d ifferently. If you want to throw a lot of money at the problem, you can buy both TVs and VCRs that can run PAL or NTSC at the flick of a switch; I've seen these for great cost at export shops.\nBeware of \"amateur advice\" in this area...people will tell you completely false things that they have never tested themselves, or information that was true five years ago. A few people have told me that an NTSC VCR will play on a PAL TV set (you don't get the color, but you will get bl ack and white), but frankly I wouldn't bank on it.\nDigital radios (car radios, Hi-Fi tuners) may not work, since the channel step in the UK is in units of 9kHz, while in the US it is 10. So your US-made radio may \"miss\" all the right frequencies.\nSome people are so attached to US-style refrigerators and washer/driers (and I can't say I blame them) that they buy special US products that can run on UK current and have them shipped to the UK. I've seen such things in export shops, and I hear that they are available at US Army bases in the UK as well. But save yourself supreme embarrassment and measure the doors and hallways of the house you will be living in; will the products fit through the door? One reason that the UK version of these products are smaller is due to a smaller sized door standard.\nWhat items should I bring?\nProvided you use the proper transformer, you can expect these items to work in the UK.\nCD players. Manufacturers make them so the motors are internally supplied with the correct frequency.\nPersonal Computers. The motors in their disk drives are internally supplied with the correct frequency.\nIf you're lucky, perhaps the item you want to bring runs on both standards of current and frequency. The good news is that more and more products are being built this way, especially consumer stereo items, and computers. You can find out if you have such a product by looking near the spot where the power cord comes out: if it says something like \"AC 100-240, 50/60 Hz\", you are in luck. You won't need a transformer at all, just a plug converter. Make sure to check this for every product that needs to be plugged in. Good news for Apple Macintosh users: everything after the M ac Plus was made in this fashion (although check the back to make absolutely sure).\nIf it turns out you have several such products, you could get a mere plug converter, plug in a US power strip to it, and then plug all your components in (although you do not want a power strip with a surge protector, since it will freak over receiving 240v). Of course this practice is very risky: someone who is not aware of what this strip is being used for may mistakenly plug in a US product that does not handle its own conversion, and you'll fry it (and maybe yourself). Caution is advised!\nBack to list of questions...\nWill phone items (modem, answering machine) work?\nYes, provided you supply the correct adapter for the different standard of phone plug and the correct power, modems, answering machines and extension cables will work on the British phone system. (I am not sure if phones themselves will work.) However, I should point out that it is technically il legal to do so. The only products which may legally be hooked up to the phone lines are those with a special BT green sticker of approval.\nBuying the correct adapter can be tricky. Believe it or not, it is a rather frequent occurrence to buy a US-UK adapter and have it not work because it is incorrectly made! Apparantly, US telephones use pins 3 and 4 in their jacks, while British ones use 2 and 5, and companies who make connectors will actually get this wrong. I have only heard of this happening with connectors purchased in the UK; the US-made US-UK adapter that I bought at an export shop worked fine.\nThe British phone ring poses a rather obscure problem to US-made answering machines. The US phone ring goes \"ring (pause) ring (pause)\" while the UK one goes \"ring-ring (pause) ring-ring (pause).\" Unfortunately the US-made answering machine will regard each double-ring as two single rings, and thus the answering mechanism will kick in sooner. If your phone is far away from you, you may find it frustrating to have the machine kick in before you get to the phone (I certainly do). You are best off if you own a machine that lets you control the number of phone rings before answering to a high number like eight. Or, you could simply buy one made in the UK, although I don't think they are as well made or as full of as many features as ones available in the US.\nThey're just starting to get fancy phone services such as call-waiting here. You'll have to inquire how to turn such features off if necessary (i.e. for modems).\nHow should I transport my belongings to the UK?\nIntro\nBing again! This is the second most frequently asked question. People living abroad for a while tend to want to bring a larger amount of possessions with them than can be brought along as luggage on the plane. Here's a guide to the various methods for doing so. One bit of advice: before selec ting any one company, call around and compare prices. You'll be surprised how much they vary!\nBack to list of questions...\nFreight Forwarding\nI start with the method I used, which I decided to be the best value for the money of all the available methods. I engaged a \"Freight Forwarding\" service, which performed the services of enclosing my items with a crate, insuring it, shipping it by sea, and arranging for an equivalent UK firm to re ceive the crate (thus there are two companies with which you make a financial transaction). These kinds of firms are probably available only in port cities, unfortunately (on a coast, or one of the Great Lakes, or maybe even the Mississippi River).\nOne advantage is that almost anything can be shipped by this method: sofas, refrigerators, even automobiles are handled by these companies. In the warehouse of the company I used I saw a Mercedes being prepared for delivery, and a crate of household belongings the size of a medium sized bedroo m!\nThe crate I shipped contained 3 boxes of books, 3 boxes of household items, a large box of clothing, a button accordian, and two mountain bikes in their boxes. The crate measured 38 CF (cubic feet). The overall cost of this shipment, from start to finish, came to about $896, which we found a tolerable price to pay. Here's how the costs broke down, more or less:\nCharges on the US end:\n$3.75 per CF basic cost\n$1.90 per CF to build the crate\n$75 handling charge\n$7.50 communications charge\nInsurance costs 3% of the total estimated value of the belongings (which we calculated to be $8284).\nCharges on the UK end (in US dollars):\n$1.50 per CF\nCustoms charge ($81)\nDelivery from London to Brighton ($105)\nThe UK company would accept only money order or cash as a form of payment. Regarding crating the items: another option is to have them put your stuff on a pallet and shrink-wrap the whole thing; they call this \"palletizing\". Presumably that means they don't try to stack stuff on your shipment (b ut how can you be sure?). The cost for this was a flat rate of $20. We felt much safer using the crate method. The Freight Forwarding company will require a fairly detailed packing list of the items in your shipment, with an estimated value for each. Your shipment will be submitted to inspection by customs authorities at the UK end. This could range from them merely examining your packing list, possibly taking a quick peek under to lid to see if it looks believable, to a full examinaton of every item in your crate. The receiving freight company acts on your behalf at the custo ms ceremony, but you can attend if you want to take the trip into London (or wherever). See another section of this FAQ for details about customs and paying import duty .\nOur stuff (coming from California) had to go through the Panama Canal to get to England. It was estimated to take one month to deliver; in reality it came to just about two! No doubt it will be quicker if your shipment is leaving from any of the other coasts, or via the St. Lawrence Seaway, bu t keep in mind that sometimes your crate sits around in a warehouse for a while (weeks, maybe) before they find which vessel it will go on. There was virtually no damage to any of our belongings, and the customs ceremony was completely unremarkable.\nThe cost of shipping that Mercedes, by the way...I asked...was around $900, which struck me as tolerable. That was probably not including crating and insurance, though.\nBack to list of questions...\nUPS\nSounded very expensive, but definitely quick. They were very discouraging about shipping anything which might be assessed an import duty. The number for UPS International shipping is 800-325-0365.\nBack to list of questions...\nAir Freight\nStandard airlines such as United have a separate freight shipping service, and you can even make sure it goes on the same plane as you're traveling on. It's expensive, but not as much as I'd thought. You wouldn't want to ship a whole household, but smaller fragile items, or things you have to hav e immediately might be handled this way. Charges are obscure: they use a formula that takes into account both weight and size. One agent mentioned $2.83 per pound as a sort of ballpark figure. Virgin Atlantic charges $2.50 per kilogram up to 100kg, $2 per kilogram if it's over 100kg.\nBack to list of questions...\nExtra baggage on passanger flight\nBetween $76-85 for each extra checked piece not exceeding 62\" (height, depth, width added together) and 70lbs. If larger than 62\": $152.00. If heavier than 70 lbs: $228.00. Bicycles have a special arrangement where they are treated as a standard extra item ($76) even if over 62\". If your bike is over 70lbs, I recommend getting your money back from the guy who sold it to you.\nNote that if you are sending computer or other fragile equipment this way, the airline does NOT insure it in any way against damage. If you decide to ship a computer this way anyway, to be safe, use the original box with the original packing materials. If you don't have these, there are packin g companies that make made-to-order injected-form packing for any item (we did this on a Mac monitor and CPU at the cost of $70).\nBack to list of questions...\nMoving Vans (Mayflower, Bekins, etc.)\nThe costs quoted to me by these companies sounded very high. I was told that a 250-lb box of stuff could run $700-$1250 depending on size and dimensions. It appears that the companies engage a freight forwarding company to do their work for them, the very thing you can do on your own (see earlier ). The advantage is of course that they will handle the delivery door-to-door from US to UK. If your new employer in the UK is picking up moving costs (they call it \"removals\" in the UK), this might be the easiest way to do things.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat should I do with my possessions in the US while I'm away? (This section has been written since I've returned to the U.S., so you get the benefit of learning from my errors :-)\nMy time in the UK lasted 2 years, and I wasn't a homeowner at the time that I took the job, so I had to do something with all my belongings. Furthermore, I had no inkling what part of the US I'd be living in when I returned. If any of this applies to you, you may find the following useful.\nHow should I store my possessions?\nIt cost us about $600 a year to keep our US household (1 bedroom) in a storage locker (Public Storage). This, actually, was a bargain compared to other storage locker services we could have tried. Make sure to shop around for the best deal; you may find widely varying rates! So two years cost us $1200. Sound like a lot? Read ahead.\nWe ended up relocating to Chicago, and the stuff was stored in California. The cost of moving our stuff (United Van Lines) was almost $3000...more than twice the cost of two years of storage. When the stuff finally arrived, we had mixed feelings about lots of the stuff. We wanted to get rid of several boxes of books. There were boxes of clothes that had come to be of little use to us at the time we moved, and now were 100% useless. We had pieces of furniture, cheap stuff, that was heavy and we no longer wanted. We should have tried to sell a lot of that stuff before we moved...or tried to sell it before United put it on their truck.\nWe made two huge financial mistakes. First, we didn't get a binding estimate on the move, because the United people have to see the stuff up close, and it just seemed like too much cost and trouble to fly out there just to watch them make an estimate. Second, we considered flying out to try to sell off the stuff, but that too sounded like too much cost and trouble. Wrong on both counts...the $400 (at most) plane ticket would have been a tiny fraction of that total bill. And in the case of the estimate, we might have gotten off with paying around half that amount... they usually underestimate (salesman wants his commission), and when the driver discovers the shipment is 1500 pounds over estimate, well that's his tough luck.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat stuff should I sell or throw away?\nThis is one of those highly personal questions, but I'll try to shed some light on it for you. Unless your car has some special value to you, sell it. Anyone with good economic sense will tell you why: it will simply depreciate sitting out there in a driveway. (It will also cause you anguish abroad as you worry about all the parts that are gumming up with disuse.) If you can get a good price for it, sell it, put the money in the bank and let it earn interest, and don't touch it until you come back. Presto, you've got money to buy another car.\nI'll add another remark about cars. If you are either selling your car or storing it in a garage or driveway, you will probably be either slimming your insurance coverage down to basic theft and vandalism, or dropping it altogether. Now here's where you can really get ripped off when you come back. If you do drop your insurance, and then want insurance again, you're viewed as \"trouble\" by the insurance company because you haven't had any car insurance in the last six months. The mindset of insurance companies is (and there's nothing you can do to change it) that if you were without insurance for a while, there is probably some sinister reason behind it...you lost your license, you killed someone in an accident...yep, they think pretty negatively. There is nothing in their \"system\" to account for someone going abroad for a year to work. The upshot is that the cost of your insurance may double in the first year that you return to the US. So my advice to you is to have a talk with your current carrier, and ask them what options you have for staying on the books in their company.\nIf you happen to be an academic and you have lots of books, take a hard look at taking this opportunity to unload as much as you think you don't actually need. The weight of boxes of books really adds up and makes a moving bill huge rather quickly.\nCruddy furniture that you bought cheap and you don't like particularly even now. You'll hate the sight of it when you come back. Unless you think you're going to be flat broke when you come back, sell it or give it away.\nI also had lots of files of papers that I could have gotten rid of. The one area that I'd suggest caution in is anything with sentimental value...this stuff is what you'll be glad to see again one day.\nBack to list of questions...\nHow much of my stuff should I take?\nAssuming you are only making a temporary move to the UK, there will no doubt come the time when you agonize over what things you should leave behind and what you should take. Obviously this is a personal matter, but here is some advice based on my experience.\nIf you particularly like to cook, take your favorite cookware with you. You'll hit yourself for having to pay all over again (at higher prices) for the favorite cast iron saucepan that you use for making spaghetti sauce, say. Don't bother taking silverware and plates, since rented accomodation s are frequently furnished with such in the UK (see elsewhere ). A good idea is to make photocopies of your favorite recipes rather than bringing several enormous cookbooks with you (and for that matter, bring US measuring spoons and measuring cups with you, since they'll b e impossible to find in the UK). As far as kitchen appliances are concerned see elsewhere for reasons why you should not bother bringing them.\nUse common sense about your clothes. There's nothing profoundly different about the way they dress in the UK (except perhaps for women's shoes, which have 2-3\" platforms these days), so bring whatever it is you need and like to wear. Clothes are more expensive here, and good-quality c lothing is more widely available in the US, so if you can afford it, go on a shopping spree before you leave.\nBooks are a very personal matter, but also one involving common sense. If you're an academic or technical person, you should of course bring the books that you need to have for your work, since replacing them will cost far more than shipping them. As for novels and other books for passing the time, I'd suggest leaving them all home, since there will be plenty of things you will want to buy in the UK. But as for music, I'd say bring all your most beloved CDs and cassettes, since they are relatively small and overpriced in the UK.\nIf you're going to be running any of your US electrical products in the UK, take plenty of electrical adapters, power strips, extension cords, and equivalent items for telephones as warranted; they will all come in handy.\nIf you are moving to the UK permanently, you may wonder whether to bring large items such as furniture and cars, or sell them before you leave. This is not an area in which I have any personal experience. On the one hand, cars are extremely expensive here, so the possibility that you could sav e money exists. On the other hand, consider that a car with the wheel on the \"wrong\" side is trickier to drive, less safe, and will have lower resell value in the UK. Of course, if you are taking the kind of job where a company car is provided for you, you're all set. If your furniture is high q uality stuff, it too may actually be economical to have it shipped rather than replace it at high cost here.\nA slightly different question is \"what should I bring on the plane with me, to have immediately on arrival?\" If you are planning to use your US-made answering machine and modem in the UK, that will be useful immediately, and will be easy to bring. If these and other such products need power co nversion, you'll need a transformer right away; but given the immense size and weight, it may be best to purchase this after you arrive in the UK.\nBack to list of questions...\nWill I have to pay import duties, VAT, etc. on items I bring into theUK?\nFirst of all, the following is non-official information based on heresay and unverified personal experience. For official information, try the US Dept. of Commerce (202-482-3748).\nAnything you bring into the UK, whether with you on the plane, or shipped separately is fair game for the customs officials to inspect, and possibly liable for import duty. Newly purchased goods (defined as items less than 6 months old) are the only things that you need to worry about: customs can charge you an import duty of 17.5% on these items. A sales slip or purchase invoice is considered the proof of the age of the item, so have these on hand if you think you might get asked about anything. There is probably little to worry about if you are bringing in household-type items (\"per sonal effects\") and you can prove that you're coming over to live and work in the UK for an extended period of time. However, if you are bringing in a bunch of new looking products in their original boxes (like a personal computer system), I'd say your chances of being asked some questions are goo d.\nAs you enter customs (after getting your stuff off of the baggage carousel), you'll see two lanes to exit from, one for where you have nothing to declare, and one where you have to declare. I've heard that the rules say that items you intend to reexport (return to the US) are exempt from duty ( which is why regular tourists don't get charged for cameras and such). So newly purchased items pertaining to your job (say, a new Mac Powerbook) can probably be considered exempt. I suspect that customs mainly concern themselves with snagging people who bring in non-duty-free alcohol and cigaret tes, drug smugglers, and people transporting merchandise for resale (like ten Mac Powerbooks, say).\nOur passage through customs and immigration was completely unremarkable, despite having six large pieces of luggage. However, we did see two parties being submitted to extensive baggage searches (down to examining individual scraps of paper). Sad to say, I have read that people with darker ski n get stopped more frequently in UK customs.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat sorts of documents should I bring with me?\nThe following are suggestions of documents it might be good to bring just in case you need them:\nBirth certificate (in case you need to apply for a new passport)\nMarriage certificate (esp. if you and your spouse have different last names)\nLast set of dental X-rays (although see the Health section on dentists )\nResults of last medical exam\nPhotocopies of your university diplomas (might be needed when applying for jobs)\nSome bank statements showing a solid banking history and a nice fat balance\nA letter from your bank manager testifying to your sterling history at their bank\nA similar letter from your previous landlord\nA utility bill proving the address of your residence in the US\nYour US Driver's license (and make sure it's not due to expire while you're abroad)\nIf you're working on a degree back in the US and want to do research in a British library, get a letter from your adviser or department chair, and this will assist you in getting a library card\nHow is health care in the UK?\nStatistics comparing the UK and US\nInfant mortality (deaths per 1000 live births):\nUK: 8\nUK: 73 (M), 79 (F)\nUS: 72 (M), 79 (F)\nFertility rate (children born per woman):\nUS and UK: 1.8\n(Source: 1992 CIA guide)\nWill I get health care for free?\nThe universal health coverage in the UK is known as the National Health Service, or NHS. According to a 1990 source, you are entitled to NHS coverage if:\n(1) you are from an EC country\n(2) you are from a country with a reciprocal health agreement with the UK\n(3) you are a student in a course lasting more than 6 months\n(4) you came to the UK with a work permit\n(5) you have refugee status or Exceptional Leave to Remain\n(6) you are the wife or child of a person in 1-5.\nIn my case (as an employed person in category 4), monthly payments towards NHS are taken out of my pay like a tax. This amount is $186 a month in my case. So I wouldn't exactly call it free, but it gives me medical coverage (there is no bill to settle when I visit a doctor) and covers drugs (e xcept for a nominal fee of $6.75 for each prescription, no matter how costly the drug).\nBack to list of questions...\nHow is the quality of health coverage?\nI've found little cause to complain about the health coverage here; it's been at least as good or better than the coverage I've gotten from membership in an HMO in the US. You get assigned a particular doctor, and mine is very sharp and professional. If you're suddenly ill you might have to be content see another available doctor rather than yours, which of course is no different from in the US. The system appears to not be so generous when it comes to surgery or special medical treatment: you get put on a waiting list that can go on for years. A couple we know whose child was put on a two-year waiting list for a tonsilectomy gave up in frustration and took a private route. Because this waiting list problem gets worse every year as the government makes bigger cuts, many Brits can be disparaging about their health care.\nMy wife Elena and I got to put the NHS to the test by having a baby while we were living here and feel we got excellent care. For example, the hospital enthusiastically admitted her early to watch her high blood pressure; she was able to stay in the hospital for three days following delivery si mply because she felt like it; and as part of the standard treatment, was given daily visits at home by a midwife for ten days afterwards. Our child-bearing friends in the US whose coverage is by HMO all had much less generous care (for example, being sent home the day of the delivery, even after having a caeserian).\nBack to list of questions...\nHow concerned are Brits about health and fitness?\nOn the whole, Brits seem less concerned about maximizing their personal health and fitness than Americans are. In fact (get ready for this one), they view America as a nation of \"health nuts,\" all consumed by the pursuit of the \"clean life\" and a fixation on having the perfect skin, body, legs, an d so on. Not long ago an article in a London paper on the Irish actor Stephen Rea remarked that, when Rea ordered mineral water (rather than beer) during the interview, it was telling proof that he'd \"gone Hollywood.\" The book \"Brit-Think/Amerithink\" has some funny material on this cultural diffe rence (details elsewhere ).\nHere are a few random observations on health in the UK. Although the movement for banning smoking in public places is gaining ground, it remains a more a minority sentiment in this country. Pubs are tremendously smoky, although thankfully, smoking is not allowed in movie theatres. Probably be cause Britain makes some of the best ales in the world, people drink a lot (3 or 4 pints an evening is not considered particularly excessive here), and they seem to start very young. The institution of The Pub is an omnipresent, essential public facility; for example, Universities will have not ju st one pub, but three or four spread over the campus. You will not see any oriental restaurants proudly displaying a \"No MSG\" sign, and waiters may consider the request unusual. There are many workout clubs, but you will not find many men in aerobics classes; the British sense of macho identity s eems to regard that as a domain for women. Magazines on childbirth, instead of glorifying more natural methods of childbirth, contain testimonials from women who were so glad they were drugged up for delivery: \"It was wonderful, I didn't feel a thing.\"\nAnd then there's the incredible amounts of grease and deep frying in their foods. In particular, there is the \"English Breakfast\" you will find served at every restaurant and Bed & Breakfast: greasy fried egg (although on alternate days, tolerable scrambled eggs), greasy sausage, greasy bacon, slices of bread fried in grease, hash browns fried in grease, plus the piece de resistance, the small half-tomato fried in grease. You have been warned.\nBack to list of questions...\nDentistry\nTechnically you can have dental care for free as part of your coverage under NHS. However, NHS is very stingy in the fees they're willing to pay dentists, making it not feasable for dentists to run a fully modern service on such income, so it is very rare to even find an NHS dentist. So you'll probably want to look for a private practice, not just for availability, but in order to get good quality care. One that I've heard recommended is called Denplan.\nIt might be advisable to spend a little extra effort finding a top quality dentist, since I suspect that the UK lags behind the US a bit in quality of dental care. Two US dentists I have talked to, including one who actually practiced in the UK for a while, tell me that \"preventative care,\" the cornerstone of US dentistry, is not as widely practiced in the UK. Many Brits still regard the dentist as someone you see only after something has actually gone wrong, rather than for \"checkups.\" A Brit actually asked me, with a straight face, \"what's the matter, do you have a bad tooth?\" when I asked that he recommend a dentist. If your stay in the UK is only temporary and you plan to have visits to the US from time to time, you might just make things easier (and give yourself peace of mind) and visit dentists when you're in the US. In fact, I insist that all dentists I see let me kee p my X-rays, since I never know where I'm going to visit a dentist next.\nBack to list of questions...\nHow expensive is it to live in the UK?\nThis is a tricky area. Sitting at home in the US and pondering your move to the UK, you may think it wise to make some calculation using the exchange rate, your salary, and the costs of items in the US to estimate how much it costs to live in the UK. It all turns out to be more subtle than tha t. Different things are expensive here. Once you get here, you'll eventually become accustomed to how much a pound can buy you. I can think of ways to describe the UK as cheaper or more costly than the US, depending on what you're talking about. In general however, I think the argument for call ing the UK a more expensive place is slightly stronger. Here is some information to help you decide.\nIf one thing makes the UK a more expensive place, it's certainly gasoline (petrol). If you expect to own a car in the UK (and with a quite good rail system, you might not need to), expect this to consume a much larger chunk of your income. If you won't be owning a car, you just may be one of those people who think the UK is a cheaper place than the US.\nManufactured goods such as CDs, books, clothes, computers, consumer electronics and appliances can be 25-50% more expensive than in the US; sometimes it seems like \"whatever it costs in dollars in the US, the cost in the UK will be the same number of pounds.\" This is changing, though; for examp le, prices on Macintosh computers dropped radically last year.\nRestaurants are slightly more expensive than in the US, but food bought at grocery stores is not; in fact, it is often cheaper.\nSalaries in the UK are for the most part lower than in the US. This is considered so patently true by most Brits that when preparing for an interview for a lectureship at a British university recently, I was advised to be ready to answer the question \"Why would you want to work here when you co uld earn a much larger salary working in the US?\" So it may very well be that the salary you will make as an X (engineer, lecturer, student) in the UK will provide less purchasing power than what you would make as an X in the US. If you are coming here for an academic job (see elsewhere ) and with a family, keep in mind that it'll be harder to get by on a single income (unless it's a senior lecturer position or better). It's even been said to me that an academic career pretty much rules out every buying anything better than a second-hand car.\nA recent source compared the cost of living in the US vs. the UK, in order to figure out how overseas employees would need to be paid. In March 92, the USA came out 14% less than the UK, but in March 93, the USA came out 4% more than the UK, for what it's worth.\nOverall it appears that the UK does tend to be more expensive than the US, but it is not \"impossible to live\" here (as the exaggerated estimates of US tourists who have stayed in expensive London hotels and restaurants might have you believe). Not all things that you'd think are expensive actua lly are; sometimes they are cheaper than in the US. Brits can be extraordinary penny pinchers, and prices for essential items are often low because otherwise nobody would buy them. Also, even if you find that you can afford less living here, you will adapt quickly, live as others do, and not even notice much of a change.\nA rather conspicuous source of increased expense in the UK is the nasty tax called VAT (Value Added Tax), which is 17.5%. This is like sales tax in the US, but it is usually figured into the listed price of an item, so you tend to be unaware of it. Just about everything (restaurant food, manuf actured goods, home heating fuel) is subject to VAT.\nVAT is not the only new sort of tax you'll need to cope with; a list of other little expenses to which you'll have to become accustomed, either as part of living in the UK or as part of living abroad, is shown below. Many of them are discussed in greater detail in other sections of this FAQ.\nVAT (17.5%)\nCouncil Tax (ca. $50/month or more; see elsewhere )\nNational Insurance (ca. $184 out of each paycheck; see elsewhere )\nIncome Tax, if you're paying it (20-27% of salary; see elsewhere\nTV License ($150/year for a color TV; B&W is cheaper...see elsewhere )\nCharges for local telephone calls (see elsewhere )\nInitial deposit paid for utilities services (ca. $150 each for gas/electricity, water, phone; see elsewhere )\nOne-time $45 fee for registering with the local police station in your neighborhood. The police give you a small identification booklet with your photo in it, like a low-budget passport. When you first arrive in the country, the authorities at immigration will instruct you how to go about this.\nPaying to keep your stuff in a storage locker in the US (see elsewhere )\nWays in which you may save money, on the other hand, are:\nFree health coverage\nNot needing a car if rail service is convenient\nCar provided by your company (if you're lucky)\nOne less tax to pay, since in the US you pay federal and state taxes.\nMore \"exotic\" vacations available for less money (e.g. a summer in the French countryside, a week in Paris, etc.)\nTo get right down to the nitty-gritty, here are the prices that things cost right now (summer 1994). Gasoline is sky-high (remember the US is the only country that does not add a separate tax to its gasoline), about $3.50 per US gallon. Dinner at a yuppie-style restaurant, with beer and a dess ert, runs about $30, while take-out Fish & Chips with a soda is only about $4. Renting a Ford Escort from Hertz for a week costs $252 (insurance included). A 2-3 mile trip in a cab is about $5.50. A medium-sized novel is $7.50. CDs are notoriously overpriced, from $21-27 each. A round-trip pla ne ticket (they call it \"return fare\") to Brussels in July is $153; a good bargain on a Paris return flight found in late August was $127. A ticket for a movie costs $6, and a videotape rental is $3.75. Some items at the store: potatoes are $.51/lb; peas $1.20/lb; green bell peppers $1.40/lb; ap ples and bananas $.60/lb; $1 for 6 eggs. A Sony 25\" TV is advertised for $750. A new, British-made (Rover) economy car costs $9000 (financing is 18.41% APR). A cheap futon/couch costs $277. A daily paper is $.75.\nTo follow the fluctuation of the value of the US dollar against the UK pound, see any major newspaper's financial section, or check the frequent VNS (Vogon News Service) posting on the USENET group soc.culture.british.\nBack to list of questions...\nHow can I get a bank account?\nA checking account (sometimes called a \"current account\") is an absolute necessity here, since (1) you will need a bank account to pay your bills, (2) most companies that require a monthly payment wish to be paid by auto-debit, and (3) your employer all but requires you to be paid by auto-deposit. Banking conveniences are pretty much the same as in the US: there are automatic tellers (ATMs) everywhere, you can pay with your ATM card auto-debit for just about anything (groceries, restaurants, department stores). There are ordinary banks, such as Barclay's and NatWest, and bank-like compani es called \"Building Societies\" (such as Abbey National) which are like \"Savings and Loans\" in the US. You probably want to use an ordinary bank.\nHowever, your ATM card is really useful only if it is also a \"check guarantee card.\" This essentially makes it good for credit and insures merchants against theft. Without that status it will be useless as a debit card, and perhaps more importantly no merchant will cash your check wit hout it (although it will be accepted as payment for bills over the mail). Therefore when you get an account you want to insist on getting a check guarantee card.\nAnd this one detail may turn out to be the biggest hassle you have to go through in the UK. Banks will happily open a plain savings and checking account with almost no questions, but they'll make getting the check guarantee card almost impossible because you have zero credit history in the UK. Unfortunately, no matter how sterling your credit history in the US is, no matter how amazing your assets and investments in the US are, they meaning NOTHING abroad, and help not one bit towards getting that important card.\nProbably the best way win the trust of the bank to give you this credit is to ask your employer (someone in the salaries office, say) to call the bank to vouch for you. They in fact may be motivated to do this because they are eager to find a way to auto deposit your paycheck. Some other thin gs that might help are:\nGet a fellow employee from your new job who has a bank account at the bank you want to write a letter on your behalf\nOpen the account with a HUGE initial deposit so that they will roll out the red carpet for you (however, there are limitations on the amount of money you can bring into the country with you...see an earlier part of this FAQ)\nGet someone from your bank at home to write you a letter telling how long you've been an excellent customer there, etc.\nShow them several bank statements from your US account demonstrating a nice, fat monthly balance.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat kind of housing will I find?\nThere's as much variety in housing in the UK as in the US, so there is no simple way of advising you on what kind of place you'll be living in. Keep in mind that flats in general can be old here (living in a 200 year old flat is no big deal), so they are likely to look more like Brownstones in NYC rather than pre-fab apartments in California.\nThe primary way flats are advertised are via Estate Agents (why call them \"Real\" Estate Agents when there are no \"Imaginary\" ones?). Go to their offices and ask to see a listing. They will drive you around to any of the properties that interest you. Advertisements for flats often give the price on a per-week basis, although you actually pay monthly. \"Hob\" (a hot plate) or \"cooker\" (synonymous with stove) are other words you will find in advertisements. By the way, many British stoves, even modest ones, have a open broiler on the top, which is a real treat: they grill steak and fish mu ch more effectively than the down-below broilers of US stoves.\nThere is a nasty property tax called the Council Tax, formerly known as the Poll Tax, which you are required to pay, even if you are merely renting the property. The tax is paid only 9 out of 12 months of the year. We pay $66 a month for our flat. Good news for students: there is a special p rovision that may make you exempt, depending on your living situation, so look into it before you pay it.\nFurnished flats are quite common in the UK. They will include living room (called the \"lounge\") furniture, a fridge and stove, a kitchen table, and kitchen cookware and utencils, and sometimes beds. You can bargain a bit with the landlord on the items that are included in t he furnishings (after all, you are paying more than for a non-furnished flat). Note that the kitchen cookware includes only enough items to cook basic meals. You'll have to outfit them with more to make your favorite recipes like fancy omlettes, stir-fried oriental dishes, etc.\nIn the part of the country I'm in, central heating is no longer considered a luxury. A flat with independent space heaters in every room rather than radiators fed from a central heating source should probably be considered fairly \"low rent.\" The lounge often has, even in a centrally-heated dwe lling, a small heater (usually gas) located where a fireplace used to be. These are a cherished, cozy item, although some are unfortunately festooned with tacky decorations or pseudo log-fire regalia. The lounge often has a door on it (to keep the heat in); strangely enough, these are sometimes m ade of an opaque glass rather than wood, like something you'd see in a hair salon.\nClothes washers are often included in a flat; it's not too demanding to include that as one of your requirements. UK clothes washing machines tend to be low-capacity and low-speed (they are smaller, usually kept underneath the kitchen counter, just like a dishwasher). Some of them, even ones o f fairly recent vintage, don't even use microprocessors, using instead a primitive mechanical programming system that clicks away like Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Also, many do not draw hot water from the household hot water supply; rather, they take cold water and heat it electrically in side the unit. The slow rate of heating the water means that each load can take over an hour to complete (but I'm told the ones in France take even longer). However, if you pay enough you can always buy as high-tech a washer as you like; but what you'll find in rental properties will tend to be t he more modest ones. Clothes driers and dishwashing machines are less-frequently included items in UK flats. See elsewhere about bringing washing machines and refrigerators from the US.\nUK home showers also merit some comment; compared to US showers, they run at a pathetic trickle. Take a nice long shower before you leave for the UK, it's the last decent one you'll have for a long time. Water pressure within the usual British household is obtained entirely by gravity. Unfortu nately, the hot-water storage tank is frequently at a location just below the shower head, so an \"electric shower\" (one that pumps and scalds the water as quickly as it can, which is not very) is found in most homes. I find rinsing my hair to take so long under our shower that it's easier to wash my hair while taking a bath, dousing my head with a pail of water. The quality of electric showers varies: one that costs $450 might be able to deliver a fair amount of water pressure, but in an average quality flat the shower will probably be cheap. At an even greater expense you can actually i nstall a pumping system that will give you a good US-style shower (it.s called a \"power shower\").\nThe day you move in to your new dwelling, MAKE SURE to have whomever is providing the flat show you how to turn on the central heating and water heater. The workings, appearance (a square box mounted on the side of the wall), and location (sometimes the kitchen) are completely different than in the US. Also it includes a device with several switches for controlling fuel efficiency. We spent our first weekend in our flat unable to take a hot bath because we didn't know where the water heater was!\nBack to list of questions...\nHow do I get utilities (gas, water, phone, etc)?\nGetting hooked up: The experience of getting water, gas and electricity bills for your dwelling is fairly straightforward and very much like in the USA. It is not nearly as difficult as getting a bank account (see elsewhere ), but you are stuck in a nasty Catch-22 because utility companies will no t give you access until you have a bank account, and bank accounts want a utility bill as proof of where you live. (I'll never forget when I pointed that out to a bank clerk and he responded by lighting up and saying, \"well yes, it is a bit like that, isn't it?\") After that is taken care of, they may require an initial deposit, since you will not have a previous history with a British utility company.\nIf you are on friendly terms with the previous tenant, it may be to your advantage to take over their old phone number, and other utility accounts, as it can save a lot of time, money and hassle in hookup.\nUtility bills are billed quarterly (every 3 months). Beware of your long distance calls to the US...you could be quietly running up a huge bill and not know it until your third month here!\nBack to list of questions...\nTelephones\nNote that every phone call, even local ones, costs money in the UK, and it is billed by the minute. If you use a modem with your phone (see elsewhere for information on bringing your phone-related products from home), note that it's costing you money to be logg ed in! However, a discount rate begins at 6 pm and continues until 8 am the next morning, so your nighttime login sessions won't be so bad.\nAs in the US, phone numbers consist of an area code (used only when dialing from outside the area) and a local number. Numbers are not standardized in length in the UK: the area code may have 3-4 numbers, the local number 6-7 numbers. Within the country, area codes always begin with a zero; c alling from another country to the UK, however, you omit the zero.\nFor directory information, you dial 192, for operator, 100, for phone sales 150, for emergency, 999. I am reminded of Homer Simpson's line \"Operator, give me the number for 911...\" :-)\nPhones: the BT (British Telecom) system appears to understand both 'touch tone' and 'pulse' dialing over most of the UK, as far as I understand. The physical phone in your home may one or the other, but even if it's pulse, it will respond to tones dialing from your modem or pocket dialer, if y ou have one. Pay phones: the standard BT pay phones are pulse dialers, but BT's competitor Mercury are touch tone dialers.\nUK Phone companies have just begun to offer fancy phone services such as call waiting, or message leaving and answering services.\nUniversity phones: at my university, off-campus dialing for many phones is disabled after 'business hours'. Very frustrating!\nSome British pay phones do not take coins at all; instead, they take a \"money card\" that you buy at shops with between 1 and 20 pounds of calls encoded on them.\nBack to list of questions... Long distance carriers\nI still use US Sprint as my long distance carrier, and my wife still uses MCI as hers...there are European access numbers for reaching their operators. (By the way, France and Germany are about to buy a 40% interest in US Sprint.) However, strangely enough, we recently discovered direct dialing f rom home is cheaper than our long distance carriers; but when you're at a public phone you may need your carrier. Warning: neither Sprint or MCI can place calls to Canada from the UK (I haven't the slightest idea why).\nBack to list of questions...\nTelevision\nYou may wish to buy a television and VCR (you certainly don't want to bring yours from the US...see elsewhere ), but it is rather common practice for people to rent them. If you shop around, you might find a TV/VCR combination for as cheap as $27/month. However, as you are a foreigner some shops may balk at renting you a set, and even then will probably require a deposit of around $150, so getting a TV may require some perseverance.\nThere's a joke that goes \"In America you have to have a license for a gun; in Britain, you have to have a license to watch TV.\" Laugh if you like, but it's literally true. You purchase a yearly license to watch TV from the Post Office (!), and it costs more for a color TV than a B&W one. The license helps pay for the BBC. Trucks prowl around your street from time to time and make surprise visits to see if you've paid up your license. They even have equipment that tells them if \"TV rays\" are coming from your living room. Go ahead, don't believe me...but this is completely true!\nBack to list of questions...\nHow should I manage my financial affairs back in the US?\nChances are you will have at least some bills you have to keep paying, so you will want to keep your US Bank account(s) open, and be able to write checks on those funds to pay your bills. Also, you probably have some monthly statements that you will need to monitor regularly. We changed our offic ial mailing address to our UK home for all such bills and statements and have had little difficulty receiving them (although it does seem to pose their computers a bit of a challenge).\nIf you have to move cash from the US to the UK, or if you will be living in the UK off of funds in a US bank account, using an AMEX (American Express) card is a good way to go. You tell them to set up your account in such a way that when you use your card at an AMEX cash station (which can be f ound in every large town in Europe), the checking account at your US bank gets debited. Or you can even use your bank's ATM card to do so. ATMs are everywhere, and if your card is on either the \"Cirrus\" or \"Plus\" networks (look at the back of the card), it will work. From either card, the conver sion is done at that day's exchange rate, and no more (unlike the money changing service such as Thomas Cook, who charge a fee for the transaction). You can also cash an ordinary American check at any AMEX office. I think AMEX limits the amount of transactions to a total of $1000/month, but it ma y depend on your account.\nGiven the difficulty with obtaining bank accounts (described elsewhere ), it should behoove you to apply for US credit cards before you leave the US, since you will have no credit history in the UK and may be flatly denied a credit card. Also take the trouble to go get PINs ( personal passwords) encoded on your cards. An AMEX card doesn't have one unless you get it put on, and you'll need to visit an AMEX office to do so.\nOnce you have a British bank account, you will also probably be able to draw US cash from US ATMs of off funds from your UK bank account during your trips to the US. Once again, look for the Cirrus and Plus network.\nHow much will I be taxed (in US and UK)?\nThese rules change every year!\nWhat I say in this section was true for us during the first year we lived here. Do not regard this information as current; the laws can change profoundly from year to year. Use it as an idea for what may be possible. It may be worth springing a $100 or so to et a qualified person to properly eva luate your situation. A British company that specializes in US/UK tax matters is Frank Hirth & Co., 8 Coldbath Square, Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 5HL, Tel 071 833 5500.\nUK taxes\nIf you are employed in the UK and drawing a salary, and you are going to be in the UK for two years or less, you may be exempted from paying income tax. Request a \"Claim for exemption from United Kingdom Income Tax\" form from H.M. Inspector of Taxes, and submit it to your salaries department, and taxes will not be deducted from your salary. Once you stay even one minute into the third year in the UK, however, Her Majesty will expect you to pay all two years of those back taxes to her.\nIf for some reason you do wish to pay income tax, the monthly deductions will be between 20-27% of your salary (mine was 20%).\nNational Insurance is a different affair. No-one is exempt from this, I believe. $186 per month is taken from each monthly paycheck I get.\nBack to list of questions...\nUS tax\nHere was how we figured our taxes at the end of fiscal year 1993 (keep in mind that the rules change each year, and depend heavily on what properties you own, what investments you have, and so on). If you spent at least 330 days of that fiscal year outside of the US and the total amount of income you earned that year (combined from all sources of income, regardless of country) was less than $70,000, that income is termed \"foreign earned income,\" and you will owe no taxes on it.\nBefore you leave, visit with a qualified tax accountant to find out exactly how you should handle things. Even if it costs you $100 or so, you might just be saving several thousand.\nWill I be able to stand food in the UK?\nIs store-bought food decent?\nAbsolutely ! Your local supermarket will carry very high quality goods and fresh produce in large quantities, so you should be able to eat and cook at home pretty much in whatever way you like. The produce is as fresh as the produce that most Americans eat. At my house we have no problem cookin g the way we like: Pad Thai, Baba Genugh, Szechuan chicken, salsa, mexican-style cornchips and guacamole (to name some particularly non-British selections). Vegetarians and Vegans will find many of the items they want at supermarkets, and (in Brighton, at least) there are natural foods stores. I f someone tells you that British markets have miserable food selections, their experience may be several years out of date (perhaps before Britain joined the E.C.). I'd have to say that the US has a bit of an edge on the quality of meat, however; beef products taste a little more \"grey\" here, and fish seldom seems as flavorful. One exception is bacon, which is much better in the UK (Brits are utterly appalled at the fatty, streaky stuff that is sold in the US under the name \"bacon\").\nBritish supermarkets (Sainsbury's, Waitrose) are about the same in size and appearance of the average American supermarket. The American chain Safeway, with the same insignia (although different ownership, I'm told) is also found in the UK.\nMany American brands of products you are accustomed to are sold here, and if not, the British/European version is usually equivalent in quality. If there is a particular brand of item that have you become so reliant on that you you have been never been able to tolerate a substitute (many peopl e feel this way about pharmacy items like decongestants and rash creams), you might want to stock up on them before you leave. Also, there are many foods that are particularly \"American,\" such as bagels, maple syrup and BBQ sauce, for which UK versions exist, but which taste not at all like the real thing. If these are important to you, plan to have friends bring them to you when they visit, or stock up on it on any of your visits home.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat's this about British food being bad?\nFirst of all, if you're the type of person who is not picky about what you eat, then you can skip this section!\nThis topic needs to be broken into three main areas: British Cuisine, British \"Fast Food,\" and standards of quality in British restaurants. First, British Cuisine. Although clearly not ideal for vegetarians, and rather high on fats and cholesterol, its quite delicious when prepared well. I hav e had wonderfully satisfying meals of finely seasoned roasts with delicious garnishes and sauces both at restaurants and friends' homes. So it is unfair to attribute the \"bad British food\" reputation to their cuisine, in my view.\nSecond, British Fast Food, by which I mean the food that is sold cheaply for lunch at pubs, \"caffs\" or small takeout shops. Here you are likely to discover at last that you really are in a foreign culture (having been fooled at first by the common language). The very names seem designed to send chills up American's spines: Sausage Roll, Steak and Kidney pudding, Bubble and Squeak, Green Mushy Peas, Cheese and Pineapple Toastie, and Pie and Mash. So here the problem is not really one of \"bad food\" but whether you are ever likely to develop a taste for their dishes.\nThe kind of eating establishment you will want to identify if you want to avoid such food is the caff. \"Caff\" is their pronounciation of the word that is spelled \"cafe,\" and that ought to give you a warning for starters. Caffs are the culinary equivalent of the pokey little antique shops that ret ired people in the US like to open in low-real-estate shopping zones in small towns. They are attempts to run restaurants as cheaply as possible in a small shop with only a small domestic kitchen stove, quickly prepared food (for example, egg sandwiches with white bread), and---no kidding---plasti c lawn chairs and tables for furniture. Although they are popular gathering spots for locals, you're not likely to get good food there.\nLastly, there are British restaurants, the area in which I cannot pull any punches or lay the blame on cultural relativism. As an American, you have simply been pampered by high standards. Sure, you'll find good UK restaurants and bad US restaurants, but the proportion is distinctly in favor of t he US. For confirmation, you'll find that most Brits who have travelled to America agree with this estimation. If you've ever been stunned to hear a Brit who visited the US talk about how much they loved eating at Denny's, of all places, you'll learn why after eating at a smattering of British restaurants. Of course, if the restaurant is expensive, you're probably okay; the advice I'm giv ing here is for moderately priced restaurants. Essentially you will have to be accustomed to having a lower success rate at finding satisfactory restaurants by chance: you can't just take a look at a place, size it up, and estimate its food quality with as much accuracy as you probably can in the US. Often you'll find the items on the menu to be as inspired and flavorful as TV-dinners, or in worst cases, cooked in grease that's been recycled too many times.\nAs I've pointed out elsewhere , the bad food is certainly not attributable to poor quality foodstuffs; the bad reputation is due entirely to the way in which it's prepared. I break this down into four causes:\nBrits can be notorious penny-pinchers. While Brits like good food as much as the next person, they don't think its worth shelling out the extra 10p to pay for it. Similarly, cooks are inclined to cut costs and cook quickly than take the trouble to make good cuisine.\nAn odd sense of what ingredients go together (you find pineapple, tuna and sweetcorn in the oddest places, even together sometimes)\nA dislike of strongly seasoned food; very little garlic or spices used, so things taste bland. Even a restaurant claiming to be Szechuan will serve barely-spiced food. You'll have much better luck at getting spicy food in Indian restaurants, however.\nMany British recipes involve astonishing amounts of frying in grease (see the description of the English Breakfast in the section on health ).\nBack to list of questions...\nWhere can I find the restaurants with the good food, then?\nBy now the picture must sound fairly grim, but it's not. While it is true that in a very small town or small villages outside of town you may find nothing but pubs, caffs and takeout shops, but if you're in the center of a large or mid-sized city you need not worry. You will definitely find a han dful of restaurants that serve well-prepared, tasteful dishes. Naturally, check your friends for recommended restaurants. But here are a few rules of thumb as you experiment in finding them on your own. Italian restaurants, for some reason, have a high success rate for delicious food, as good or better than the best Italian restaurants in the US; perhaps because most of the time the staff and owners are really Italians. Properly prepared Fish & Chips is probably many times better than what you ever had at home, but by no means expect to find good fare from any old Chip Shop (as they're c alled here), so ask around for where the best one is. Vegetarian restaurants are rare, but any of the larger cities will have one or two. There are good French restaurants here and there, and they're often not as costly as you'd think. Indian food can be fabulous, although since there are so man y Indian restaurants and takeout shops, the quality can be very uneven, so look around. Lastly, there are plenty of Burger Kings, MacDonalds, and Pizza Huts, and believe or not, you may get a hankering to eat there every now and then when you're in the mood to have some food that tastes \"like home.\"\nDo I want to get around by train, bus, or car?\nTrains and busses\nDespite the recent initiation of a privitization scheme, travel by rail (either for long-haul trips or for commuting) is still one of the most appealing and best-run aspects of the UK. Unless you live in a remote area, chances are that you will be able to catch some train between home and work if you choose to, and if close enough to a shopping area, do without a car altogether (I do). If you commute to London you can get there amazingly fast from most parts of the country. However, note that long trips can be quite costly. One-way from Plymouth to London was $52 each for some friends of mine recently (and it would be much more if they were traveling at rush hour); note that renting a car, although less convenient in some ways, is a much better bargain ($42/day). However, I get to work every day (about 5 miles away) for $1.40 round-trip. Busses are lumbering and slow. Yes, the double deckers look charming from the outside, but they are really bumpy inside, and if you're the sort who likes to get caught up on reading while you commute, it's unpleasant. For longer distances, busses (coaches) are cheaper than going by rail, but of course rail is always nicer than bus. Many trains make it very easy for bicyclists to bring their bikes on board, and a conductor will even open the door for you to help you in and out. This is the case with trains that are outfitted with a special car that contains a cage for this purpose. If you're old enough to remember the Beatle s movie \"A Hard Day's Night,\" one of the songs they sing on the train is performed in one of those cages!\nBack to list of questions...\nDo I want to drive in the UK?\nDriving on the left is a trick, but by no means a major challenge to the experienced US driver. Before you get behind the wheel, however, have someone explain the rules of a UK \"traffic circle\" or \"roundabout\" since they involve specific rules of who-goes-first which will not be intuitive to you (although there are traffic circles in some parts of the US, I don't believe the rules of precedence are defined). Better yet, take a drive with someone and have them explain what they are doing in a traffic circle. The book \"Coping with England\" (details elsewhere ) shows how it's done. Also the UK \"Highway Code\" is available for a small price at most bookstores. Reading it is advised, since there are many signs and road markings which are unknown to the US driver.\nA US license evidently allows you to drive on the road, since many (but not all) car rental companies will rent you their car with only a US license. No doubt if you stay in the UK for an extensive period of time you are obliged to get a UK drivers license eventually, but I don't have any infor mation on that. Passing the driver's test is sufficiently tricky that it is advised that you take a few driving lessons; on the bright side, however, your license will be good until you are 70 years old! If you expect to visit the continent, you may also wish to get an \"International License\" whi ch simply translates the information on your current license into 19 different languages.\nNote that many companies (not universities, unfortunately) provide \"company cars\" for employees, which you can use exactly as if it were you own car. It's one of the compensations for salaries being generally lower in the UK than in the US, and cars being so obscenely expensive.\nBack to list of questions...\nDo I want to be a pedestrian in the UK?\nI'm kidding; this is not really a Frequently Asked Question. But I'm not kidding when I say that being a pedestrian in the UK is noticably different than in the US. And I'm not talking about being careful about drivers being on the left (although you should); I'm talking about the attitu de drivers here have toward pedestrians.\nUnlike the US, where white lines are painted to indicate a crosswalk at practically every intersection, there are few such zones of safety in the UK; there are just rare \"zebra crossings\" (like on the Abbey Road album cover) with flashing lights that oblige the driver to stop. When there's no z ebra crossing at an intersection, drivers do not think you belong in the road (and will barrel down on you, expecting you to leap out of the way). The fact that they don't think you belong there even when your were there first, before the car arrived on the scene (say, if they ca me from around a blind corner), lends an air of uncivility to the experience of being a pedestrian.\nI thought I'd compare highway codes of our two countries to see if they were the source of this societal difference, and sure enough, my sources showed that in the US the burden is on the driver to watch out for pedestrians, while in the UK the burden is on the pedestrian to watch out for cars. Here's what a copy of the UK highway code which I purchased at a bookstore tells the pedestrian on the subject of crossing the road: \"If there is any traffic near, let it go past. When there is no traffic near, it is safe to cross. Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approach ing very quickly.\" Here's what the 1992 California Driver Handbook says to the driver about pedestrians: \"Pedestrians have the right-of-way at intersections, whether or not crosswalks are marked by painted white lines. . . . Always stop for pedestrians crossing at corners. Stop for anybody crossing the street. Do not pass a car from behind that has stopped at a crosswalk. A pedestrian you can't see may be crossing.\"\nYou might almost say that you don't need to worry all that much about which direction traffic is coming from, because you'll have to run like hell to avoid getting hit anyway.\nTo be fair about it, however, it must be observed that roads tend to be much smaller here than in the US. Consider that an average road in the UK may have been laid down in Roman or Medieval times, and with the cities that have grown around them have made widening impossible. As a result, ther e is very often simply no room to spare for the drivers, and even putting one foot in the road puts you at risk.\nSecond, I think that I underwent some minor attitude-modification on this subject. In the US, a pedestrian will see a giant bus or truck approaching, then walk into the crosswalk as though they were royalty, pretending not to notice the big vehicle which is now spending a few dollars of brake pad wear to stop for them. In the UK, the trucks and busses zoom past the pedestrians rather than stop up traffic waiting for them. Which makes more sense?\nBack to list of questions...\nDo I want to be a bicyclist in the UK?\nBecause of the narrowness of the roads, described immediately above, you will often find not only no bike lanes, but virtually no margin on the road at all to keep you safely out of traffic. Of course, it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk (pavement, they call it here), but I do it when I feel my l ife is endangered otherwise.\nThinking of taking bicycling trips, with camping gear, and so on? Well, before you do consider the fact that\nthe roads will be even more narrow in the countryside (like, only one extremely narrow lane)\nJune/July/August are the only months you can hope to have stretches of several days without rain\nwhile Britain is a relatively \"gentle\" landscape (the Rocky Mountains it ain't), you will still find plenty of steep hills to wear you out.\nBack to list of questions...\nIs internet easily accessable?\nAt universities, a system known as JANET (the one that brought you backwards email addresses, such as edu.berkeley.garnet) used to be primary network carrier, but now most universities have moved to becoming full-fledged members of the internet. Most machines have IP addresses and can be telnetted and ftp'd to and from. However, vestiges of JANET remain, and network communications can sometimes be a bit baroque as a result.\nUSENET newsfeeds are available at many universities, but not all the groups available in the US are available here. Most or all of the entire \"alt.\" hierarchy, for example, is not available at many sites.\nThere are internet providers which can be reached by dialup for a monthly charge. The prices I've heard sound very reasonable, but if you don't live in a town that has an access number, your phone bills will be huge. The company that seems to be the most popular is Demon Internet Services, pho ne 081-349 0063, email internet@demon.co.uk. You can probably find the names other companies by making a query on soc.culture.british or uk.misc.\nThe university I work at has dialup modems (although not very many), so I am able to work from home when it's necessary.\nBack to list of questions...\nCan I bring my pets into the UK?\nI have no firsthand information on this, but here is a small amount of information I have gathered from others over email. (If anyone would like to contribute more information, please write, as this seems to be a truely Frequently Asked Question.) The British are rather proud of having zero incid ences of rabies in their country, and are rather eager to keep it that way, so pets are screened with extreme care. One person wrote: \"All pets (dogs, cats, etc) must undergo a 6 month quarantine. You bring the animal in, check it into an approved quarantine kennel (you can visit the animal ther e) and if all goes well, take it out after the six months are up. It's very hard on the pets and it is also quite expensive to board them. With the advent of the chunnel, the policy may change but if it does, it won't be for some time yet.\" Another person wrote: \"A free guide is obtain able from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (Whitehall Place, LONDON SW1A, U.K., tel. 011 44 171 270 8080). Your cat must be quarantined in a registered cattery (i.e. approved by the Ministry for quarantine purposes). A list of rregistered catteries is included with the guide. The co st worked out at roughly $1500 per cat. Most of this cost is the cattery fees for the six months quarantine period.\"\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat kind of Visa/Permit do I need?\nIf you are going to the UK for some kind of legitimate employment lasting for six months or more, your UK employer should have gotten (or is currently getting for you) a Work Permit or Work Visa. If not, any time you spend over the six months you're allowed as a traveller will be technically illeg al, and you'll be thrown out as soon as Immigrations catches you. I know nothing about how student permits work, I'm afraid.\nMy wife accompanied me to the UK, and she was automatically (well, after a visit to a British Consulate in the US) granted a work permit as well. In fact, her work permit is less restrictive than mine: my permit is good only for the job for which I was hired, whereas hers gives her unrestricted freedom in the entire E.C. Not bad, being a spouse!\nMy work permit allows me to leave and re-enter the UK as many times as I wish. If your job renews you for a period extending beyond the originally requested duration of the job, they will need to reapply to the Home Office. This can take a long time, during which they take your passport from y ou (and your spouse...your spouse's passport, that is). But if something pressing requires you to travel out of the country, they will let you have it back temporarily.\nThe laws change constantly...call the British Consulate to find what the current rules are on these things.\nIn case you have (i.e. give birth to) a child while living in the UK (I did, so it's not too silly a thought!), here are some issues of citizenship that may interest you. If the mother and father are both American, the child can only be an American citizen; he or she does not get dual US/UK cit izenship simply because he or she was born in the UK. If someone you know tells you something to the contrary it's probably because they're unaware of the 1981/83 immigration laws that changed everything. For further information, you could call the Immigration and Nationality Department of the Ho me Office in the UK at 081-686-0688.\nBack to list of questions...\nWhat's it like living in the UK?\n\"What's it like living in the UK?\" has got to be the most preposterous question in this FAQ! I can't possibly cover all the aspects of life that will pertain to you, and even if I tried, I'd only be giving a personal perspective. Nonetheless, I've thrown together a few thoughts that may interest you.\nDo I want to move to the UK?\nNo doubt at some point you'll be forced to decide whether you really want to take this position, degree program, or whatever. Although this is a very personal issue, I can provide a tiny bit of food for thought.\nYou have a chance to live in another country for a while? Wow, what an opportunity! You want to pass up this possibly once-in-a-lifetime chance? I'm sure glad I didn't, is all I can say.\nWhat part of the UK will you be in? Just as you wouldn't want to live just anywhere in the US, the UK has its ups and downs. My firsthand experience consists solely of living in Brighton, but I've visited a handful of British cities, so I can pass on my impressions and echo what I've hear d from others; better yet, though, ask other Brits what places are like, and if it sounds doubtful, make a visit if you can. I think that if you're going to any of Brighton, Bath, Cambridge, Bristol, Sheffield and Edinburgh you can't go wrong; all fall within the range of \"very nice\" to \"fabulous\" in my book. I've found most of Cornwall and Devon to be very lovely, and I'd enjoy living there (not many big universities out that way, though). I've seen some pretty frightening-sounding descriptions of South Wales and Liverpool (in terms of them being industrial, economically hard hit, dirty ) that would make me think twice before living there. The weather in the so-called \"northern industrial cities\" (Birmingham, Sheffield and Manchester, more properly called the midlands cities) is said by many to get pretty grey and depressing in the winter (see David Lodge's books, described & elsewhere for some rather candid descriptions of Brimingham). You no doubt know of Northern Ireland's reputation, but in its defense, what is true about the larger cities (Belfast, Londonderry) is not necessarily true about the smaller towns (see Paul Theroux's book, elsewhere ). Before moving to London, try talking to a Londoner to find out about the many complications of living there. I love London for its many historical and cultural wonders, but with the way the residents complain about the crowds and traffic, I'm in no hurry to move there m yself.\nGoing with a partner (spouse, significant other, etc.) can be a great advantage, because even if you're working full time, living in a foreign country is a bit like being on a vacation. It's not only fun to share that with someone who you feel very comfortable with, and it's comforting to have a companion with your accent and set of cultural references. Warning: only if you are legally married to your partner will the British Consulate issue him or her a work permit to go along with yours (see elsewhere ). If you are unattached when you go, here's some food for thou ght: the wish to stay in the UK or Europe rather than return to the US may strike you (it strikes many Americans), and the best way to make that possible is to become a European Community citizen. If you marry someone here, I believe you acquire EC citizenship.\nBack to list of questions...\nHow much of a \"foreigner\" will I be?\nWhile its a matter of debate as to how culturally different the US is from the UK, in a certain sense all the English-speaking countries of the world comprise one vast extended culture. We're all aware of current events in each other's countries (although Brits are much more aware of what's going on in the US than the other way around), and we listen to each other's music and watch each other's movies. If Clint Eastwood or Emma Thompson have a new movie, it's a media sensation in both countries. So if you want a vastly different cultural experience, you ought to try a non-Englis h speaking country.\nI seldom see any evidence that Brits have any intrinsic dislike for Americans; I've experienced nothing but good will from people here. Mind you, they don't particularly want Britain to become \"like America,\" but they find it very interesting to know what's going on in the US. News coverage of US events is usually in a concerned, empathetic manner, as though they regard Americans as the cousins living \"over there.\"\nBritain is full of people from all over Europe, speaking different languages, so being a native English speaker makes you only a semi-foreigner. So there's little to worry about \"sticking out like a sore thumb\" as an American, unless you've got one of those expressionless, unmodulated, military-style voices (which Brits find irritating to listen to), or an extremely southern accent (which Brits find fascinating and charming).\nYour accent will even give you a number of advantages: friends on the phone recognize you before you even get two words out; people strike up conversations with you to find out what you think of their country and why you came; and because Brits tend to size each other up by the way they speak, you will be completely classless to them and they'll show you a little respect by default.\nHow foreign you feel in the UK may depend on what part of the US you are from and where you are going. I happen to think that there are greater cultural differences within the US than there are between certain parts of the US and certain parts of the UK. As an example of that, I found the experience of moving from west coast US to northeast US (many years ago) to be more of a culture shock than my move to the UK was. I suspect, for example, that someone from the deep south will find the UK more \"foreign\" than someone from Boston would. Also take into account socio-economic and educational issues, n ot just regional issues, in predicting whether you'll feel comfortable in the UK. There's a certain amount of affinity you share with someone who comes from a similar background as you, even though it may be from a different country.\nNonetheless, it will be a foreign culture to you in many ways. There are British words you may have never heard before (dodgy, pillock, punter, nappy), and different meanings of words you may have never encountered (suspenders, pants, braces, grass), and learning it all is part of the adventure. People grew up with completely different radio and TV shows, so there are a million cultural references that people make in conversation and TV that will have to be explained to you. Plus there are all the words and phrase whose usage that have a subtle, but definite difference. (My favorite is the phrase \"I don't mind\". In the US it means almost exclusively \"it won't annoy/bother me\"; in the UK it means this as well as \"it makes no difference to me.\" For example, someone asks \"do you want decaf or regular coffee,\" you could answer \"I don't mind\" in the UK.)\nSociety is run differently (for example, much more social services), so people have different expectati ons of, and attitudes toward the government. The UK has a completely different history of problems and national events that shape the way they view things that happen around them: it will be a major eye-opener to you to discover how unique your American point of view is. None of this can be expl ained to you, there's nothing you can prepare for: you'll experience it in your own way once you come here.\nThere are what Brits consider to be \"typically American\" traits. Most of these they regard with benign amusement (although they will seldom let on that they are having a laugh over you), a few with a little more annoyance. Here are the American stereotypes, like them or not:\nBragging, lacking modesty: proudly proclaiming one's accomplishments at work or school, or the fabulous vacation they've had\nBlundering into a situation without studying it first, making unwarranted snap judgments, being a \"gunslinger\"\nTalking with with your guard completely down, blurting out personal things to near-strangers (Debra Winger's character in \"Shadowlands\" was a good example of this)\nTalking loudly in public places to your friends so that everyone around can hear your private remarks (US students riding the tube, if you have to tell a story containing the sentence \"I was so drunk last night\", say it more quietly, okay?).\nEver hear Martha Stewart (a US media personality who gives advice on home decoration and entertaining)? She strikes me as a charicature of \"the typical American\" as Brits see them. It's downright embarrassing.\nWill you acquire an accent? If you acquire a full-blown British accent I'd say you were either working at it, or you are extremely impressionable. You probably will acquire, at most, the faintest trace of an accent.\nMake sure to get straight the difference between \"England\" and the \"United Kingdom\" (and furthermore \"Great Britain\" and the \"British Isles\", and even \"Europe\" for that matter).

It\u2019s about land.", "explanation": null, "document": "President and Chief Executive Officer\nRenewable Fuels Association\nAs prepared for delivery:\n\u201cWhile always volatile, the environment affecting alternative energy technologies has been in an acute state of turmoil and uncertainty. \u2026 The administration has embarked on an economic revival program based on massive budget cuts, new tax laws, and market oriented policies that have either totally eliminated, or put in great doubt, existing federal government commercialization programs and tax incentives.\u00a0 Last, but not least, press treatment of the alcohol fuels industry has been generally shallow and uniformed, and the general public is receiving an increasingly negative view of its value and potential.\u201d\nI should note here that I am quoting a memo to the RFA Board of Directors summarizing the state of the ethanol industry written by the first RFA President, Dave Hallberg, in 1981!\nDave went on to cite the inimitable comic strip character Pogo, \u201cWe are faced with insurmountable opportunities,\u201d concluding with a familiar sense of optimism that they would be realized.\nDave Hallberg was right in 1981.\u00a0 Those \u201cinsurmountable opportunities\u201d were realized in 1982 and every year since because RFA members, like Ron Miller, rose to the challenges of the moment while staying constantly and immutably focused on the future.\nThat has been the hallmark of the RFA and this industry for the past 30 years.\u00a0 When faced with great challenges, we unite, we do our homework, we build coalitions, we educate, we persevere, and we prevail.\nWhen the Reagan Administration tried to eliminate the federal ethanol program, we succeeded in extending it, and we have extended it four times since.\u00a0 When cities across the country were plagued by carbon monoxide pollution, we created an oxy-fuel program that moved ethanol from just an octane enhancer to a clean air tool and we effectively eradicated CO as a pollutant in major metropolitan areas.\u00a0 When MTBE was found contaminating the nation\u2019s drinking water, we ramped up production, opened new markets, and saved the nation\u2019s reformulated gasoline program that remains, today, the single most important and effective weapon in the fight against urban smog.\u00a0 After 9-11 shook the nation from its complacency about energy security, we worked with President Bush, Congress and the American Petroleum Institute to forge the most progressive renewable energy policy in the world by creating a Renewable Fuels Standard that required refiners, for the very first time, to utilize an increasing percentage of ethanol in gasoline.\u00a0\u00a0 And when that program proved successful, we worked with a whole new coalition of consumer groups and environmentalists to expand the RFS five-fold just two years later, forming the foundation of today\u2019s ethanol industry from which new technologies and new feedstocks can evolve.\nSo as I contemplate the state of the ethanol industry in 2011, I do so with the backdrop of history that assures me this industry can and will meet today\u2019s challenges as it has met every \u201cinsurmountable opportunity\u201d of the past, and that we will, once again prevail.\nBut make no mistake; the challenges facing our industry today are as vexing and complicated as any we have ever faced.\u00a0 We need to rise to these new challenges.\u00a0 We need to step up our game. \u00a0We need to build new bridges, forge new coalitions, and offer new ideas.\u00a0 We need to be flexible in our approach, disciplined in our message and recognize the limitations of government support in an era or unimaginable debt and competing priorities.\nAs we resolve to move forward, let\u2019s remember how far we have come.\nThe American ethanol industry is no longer a Midwest phenomenon.\u00a0 We are no longer biting at the ankles of the petroleum industry.\u00a0 We are now one-tenth of the nation\u2019s gasoline supply and we are growing.\nAs we gather here today, the US leads the world in ethanol production with 204 biorefineries in 29 states across the country.\u00a0 We produced more than 13 billion gallons of ethanol last year alone.\u00a0 It took the industry its first 16 years to produce 13 billion gallons of ethanol at all, let alone on an annual basis.\nThe American ethanol industry added $36 billion to household income and contributed $53 billion to the Gross Domestic Product.\u00a0 We contributed $7 billion in tax revenue to the federal treasury.\u00a0 We contributed another $4 billion to state coffers.\u00a0 And we can claim no small measure of credit for revitalizing our communities and providing the resources for education, infrastructure and emergency response needed across rural America.\nAnd in an era of chronic underemployment, the US ethanol industry last year helped employ more than 400,000 Americans, with more than 70,000 in direct employment at the plants, on farms, at construction companies, and elsewhere\u2013 good, high-paying jobs with benefits, opportunity for advancement and a secure future.\u00a0 These are jobs that won\u2019t be exported, jobs that build communities, jobs America needs.\n2010 was also the year the American ethanol industry entered the global marketplace in a big way.\u00a0 We exported a record 400 million gallons of ethanol last year, with product going to Europe, Canada, and Asia as well as, surprisingly, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 That\u2019s right; American ethanol is now being used to fuel the limos of Middle East oil sheiks and South American sugar barons.\n2010 also saw meaningful steps toward the commercialization of cellulosic and advanced ethanol.\u00a0 The Department of Energy awarded a loan guarantee for the first time to a cellulosic ethanol project that will use municipal solid waste to produce ethanol at a facility in Nevada.\u00a0 The Department of Agriculture recently surpassed DOE\u2019s effort by awarding three more loan guarantees to cellulosic ethanol projects in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\u00a0 Combined, these projects will result in more than 83 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production in the very near future.\nStill, the ethanol industry is not yet where we want to be, not where we need to be if this nation is ever to break its dependence on imported oil and take a more meaningful step toward a sustainable energy future that stimulates economic growth and gives Americans a choice at the gas pump.\nWe were recently reminded of the precarious position our nation\u2019s economic and energy security are in as a consequence of ours, and the world\u2019s, reliance on oil from the Persian Gulf.\u00a0 When a cry for freedom in Cairo can shoot oil prices skyrocketing because of angst that the 2 million barrels of oil a day that flow through the Suez Canal is threatened, we have a problem.\u00a0 But consider the consequences of further unrest across the canal.\u00a0 What would happen if the 50 million barrels a day that flow through the Strait of Hormuz were threatened?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen it before.\u00a0 We know the havoc of gas lines and the economic catastrophe that follows skyrocketing oil prices.\u00a0 Just recently, and not caused by political conflict, the record oil prices of 2008 created a worldwide economic tailspin from which we are just now beginning to emerge.\nWhen will Washington learn that the only way to truly extricate ourselves from the grip of foreign oil dependency is to have a committed, consistent and comprehensive energy policy that recognizes the power of innovation and the promise of renewable fuels?\nToday, Washington is consumed with putting its fiscal house in order - disorder created in no small part by the economic turmoil caused by the $140 per barrel oil price and the subsequent economic free fall.\u00a0 Congress and the President are facing a mountain of debt.\u00a0 The $1.5 trillion budget deficit now represents almost 10% of our GDP.\u00a0 And the astonishing $14 trillion national public debt is about equal to total GDP.\u00a0 Reigning in spending and balancing the budget will be the number one priority over the next several years.\u00a0 Capitol Hill is now ruled by bean counters and its affects will be seen in every bill moving through Congress.\nIf the President of the United States is willing to put heating assistance for poor Americans on the chopping block - if the Congress can cut NASA, funding for local police, rural development programs and food assistance for low income women, infants and children \u2013 then few programs will be spared.\u00a0 Everything is on the table; or should be.\nSeveral weeks ago, the Senate considered an amendment to strip certain tax incentives from the petroleum industry.\u00a0 Oil industry lobbyists cried foul, and the amendment failed.\u00a0 Apparently, despite the President\u2019s admonition in his State of the Union speech that these companies were doing just fine on their own, the Congress is not yet ready to end the subsidies that move energy investments overseas, export jobs and encourage development in more and more ecologically sensitive areas, whether it\u2019s the Gulf of Mexico or the pristine forests of Canada.\nCongress does appear ready to end the ethanol tax incentive program, however.\u00a0 At least, end it in its current form and cost.\u00a0 Last December, with the committed leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley and President Obama, the Congress extended, for one year, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit \u2013 VEETC.\u00a0 It is now set to expire at the end of this year.\u00a0 But the message from that debate was unambiguous.\u00a0 Our industry needs to work with Congress and the Administration to reform the tax incentive moving forward.\u00a0 We will.\u00a0 Indeed, I welcome a dialogue about the future of the ethanol tax incentive.\nBut that dialogue ought not to have a myopic focus on VEETC.\u00a0 We ought to be encouraging a more sophisticated conversation about all motor fuel tax policy \u2013 and all energy tax policy in general.\u00a0 We must address the permanency of tax incentives for very mature and profitable energy industries with the \u201cextenders game\u201d played with renewable energy technologies.\u00a0 We need to determine how best to insulate consumers and producers from the wild gyrations of the world oil market.\u00a0 We need to encourage investments in infrastructure and flex fuel vehicles such that consumers are finally empowered to make the energy choices right for them and their vehicles.\u00a0 And we need to be discussing how we can finally and assuredly commercialize new technologies using new feedstocks, and continue the evolution of the biofuels industry such that it is sustainable, both environmentally and economically.\nWe also we need to make sure that if the still emerging biofuels industry is doing its part to reduce government debt, then the entrenched petroleum subsidies are on the table as well.\u00a0 After all, it\u2019s more than just market access that will determine our future; it is market economics first and foremost.\nThere are lots of proposals to reform the ethanol tax incentive, and all should be properly vetted and fairly considered.\u00a0 We should avoid the pettiness of whose idea it is, and focus on what will be best for the industry and the taxpayer.\u00a0\u00a0 There are those who believe a refundable producer tax incentive will be more politically viable than a market based incentive. Some would limit the incentive only to gallons above the RFS obligations, or make it available to only mid-level ethanol blends and E85.\u00a0 Others believe we should phase down the incentive while phasing in mandates for FFVs and blender pumps.\u00a0 The environmentalists would like a carbon-based performance credit.\u00a0 And still others have proposed a variable tax incentive tied to the price of oil and/or crush margins that would provide a consumer safety net, assuring ethanol demand if the price of oil falls while reducing or eliminating the incentive when it\u2019s not needed to drive consumer demand.\nFrankly, each of these has both advantages and disadvantages.\u00a0 But we must allow a dispassionate debate, based on fact and market analysis, and guided by political reality.\u00a0 Ultimately, the arbiter will be Congress, and we will all have to live with the consequence.\nThere are also competing proposals as to how to best catalyze investment in cellulose and advanced ethanol technology.\u00a0 Is it a refundable investment tax credit, a performance contract that would reward successful technologies or simply a more aggressive Apollo-like government grant program to get plants built?\u00a0 The industry needs to rally around a specific proposal soon, or existing policy will be the default and investment may continue to languish.\nThe RFA is committed to fostering such a dialogue and providing a forum for cellulose and advanced ethanol companies to come together.\u00a0 We have formed the Advanced Ethanol Council to provide a unique and expert voice for policy makers, the media and the public on issues related to advanced and cellulosic ethanol.\nI can assure you that an expiration of the tax incentive is a very real possibility.\u00a0 Budget constraints, seemingly unavoidable gridlock and dysfunction, and the mixed messages Congress is hearing from the industry and agriculture these days may lead them to take no action at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Such an outcome would put the future of this industry in jeopardy.\u00a0 While this outcome is possible, it is by no means predestined.\nWe need to unite.\u00a0 We need to focus our agenda; this is not a time for a wish list.\u00a0 We need to develop the technical support Congress will demand.\u00a0 And we need to go to Capitol Hill, speaking AS one voice, educating the more than 100 new Members of Congress that are new to this debate and may only have learned about ethanol from the pages of the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 If we do that, as we have when facing the insurmountable opportunities of the past 30 years, we will succeed again.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t, we will miss a critical opportunity to move this nation further away from imported energy.\nBeyond the halls of Congress, there is also much work that needs to be done to expand markets.\u00a0 Last month, EPA announced its approval of E15 for 2001 and newer vehicles.\u00a0 That was great news.\u00a0 But much work still needs to be done to encourage gasoline marketers to offer E15 to consumers.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that work.\u00a0 The RFA is partnering with Growth Energy on health effects testing.\u00a0 That testing is complete and has been submitted to EPA.\u00a0 We anticipate that companies will be able to utilize that data in the fuel registration process that should begin soon.\nWe\u2019re also working with other stakeholders to eliminate state regulatory barriers to the use of higher level ethanol blends.\u00a0 Already, we believe several states, including Iowa, Ohio and Illinois, are ready to use E15 as soon as marketers begin blending.\nWe\u2019re awaiting EPA\u2019s final action on labeling E15, and we are hopeful the Agency will revise its proposed label, which we believe is unnecessarily alarmist and unsupported by the record.\u00a0 EPA can\u2019t justify a label that says \u201cthis fuel may damage other vehicles.\u201d\u00a0 Exempt lawn mowers if you need to, but there is NO evidence suggesting an issue with any vehicle.\u00a0 EPA\u2019s label must go.\nUltimately, EPA needs to make E15 available to all vehicles.\u00a0 2001 and newer cars represent approximately 60% of the vehicle fleet.\u00a0 And while that\u2019s a good start and it will grow as newer vehicles replace the legacy fleet, it still leaves far too many consumers without an option to use E15 and it undermines the potential marketplace impact of EPA\u2019s decision.\u00a0 The analysis the RFA released last fall, prepared by the highly regarded automotive engineering firm, Ricardo, clearly demonstrated there is NO reason not to approve the use of E15 for vehicles older than 2001.\u00a0 There is no difference in emissions control equipment, materials compatibility, driveability or regulatory construct between a 2001 vehicle and an older model that would justify denying the opportunity to use E15 to all consumers.\u00a0 Ronald Reagan did not passionately tell the Kremlin to \u201ctear down 60% of that wall.\u201d\u00a0 And we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with a partial waiver of our blend wall either.\u00a0 If E15 can power the cars at Daytona yesterday, it can power the carpools in suburban America tomorrow.\n2011 should be the year we begin to hammer away at the ethanol blend wall.\u00a0 But the obstacles to meaningful market penetration for E15 are great and not going away.\u00a0 The opponents to E15 use are highly motivated and well-funded.\u00a0 While I give little chance to the federal lawsuit to stop E15, efforts in Congress to reverse EPA\u2019s decision continue to mount.\u00a0 And the liability concerns of marketers related to misfueling shouldn\u2019t be summarily dismissed.\nThe RFA is going to continue to work with marketers to address their concerns.\u00a0 We\u2019ve jointly supported legislation with the Petroleum Marketers Association to provide a pathway forward.\u00a0 In Iowa, Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey is working with the industry and insurers to find a solution that may prove to be a model for other states.\u00a0 I applaud his effort and any others to address these concerns.\u00a0 Ultimately, moving beyond E10 is critical to us all.\u00a0 Without expanded market opportunities, it will be exponentially more challenging to secure investments in the next generation of ethanol technologies.\u00a0 We need markets.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the oil industry is fighting so hard.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have to fight back even harder.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t about weed whackers; it\u2019s about the future growth and increased market opportunities for your fuel.\nThat\u2019s also why the food vs. fuel canard, which has been recycled for 30 years now, will likely be resurrected with new vigor again this year.\u00a0 US farmers grew about 12 \u00bd \u00a0billion bushels of corn last year.\u00a0 It was the third largest corn crop in history and the fourth in a row more than 12 billion bushels.\u00a0 Yields exceeded 152 million bushels per acre, meaning we\u2019re growing twice as much corn on the same amount of land as we did when the RFA was formed.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 In large part because the increased demand for grain created by the ethanol industry is enabling innovation and driving increased productivity on the farm and in the labs of seed companies across the country.\u00a0 We need to start taking credit for it.\u00a0 And we need to tell people that it is innovation and advanced technology that hold the key to meaningful economic development in impoverished parts of the globe.\u00a0 The biggest threat to food supplies isn\u2019t biofuels, it\u2019s underinvestment in agriculture and, more significantly, it\u2019s skyrocketing energy costs.\u00a0 Energy touches every element of food production, marketing and distribution, from the fertilizer used to produce the crop to the plastic it\u2019s stored in to the diesel used to get it to the grocery store.\nYou all know there\u2019s less than 5 cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes and that only 20 cents of every food dollar goes to the farmer.\u00a0 What you may not know is that the grain used in U.S. ethanol production represents only 3% of the world\u2019s grain supply on a net basis and none of its food grain supply.\u00a0 Despite poor weather in Russia and elsewhere, world grain supply remains strong.\u00a0 The global supply of wheat, rice, and coarse grains is estimated at 2.67 billion tons, the second-largest supply ever\u2014trailing only last year, and by less than 1%.\u00a0 There is simply no justification for blaming ethanol for world food prices.\nBut enthusiastic Malthusians and other doomsday prognosticators will not be deterred.\u00a0 They will use recent crop reports to blame biofuels for food insecurities that have existed for decades.\u00a0 But the facts are on our side.\nA March 2010 report by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that \u201cAvailable evidence suggests that biofuels had a relatively small contribution to the 2008 spike in agricultural commodity prices.\u201d Even the World Bank, which in 2008 suggested biofuels was playing a large role in higher food prices, released an analysis in July 2010 that found \u201c\u2026the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought\u2026\u201d and that \u201c\u2026the use of commodities by financial investors may have been partly responsible for the 2007-08 spike.\u201d\u00a0 No kidding.\nThese influential institutions are seeing the light because we\u2019ve been floodlighting the facts.\u00a0 The fact is: \u00a0ethanol is just using the starch from the corn.\u00a0 The fact is: \u00a0the protein feed value is retained and used as a valuable livestock feed.\u00a0 And the fact is: the American ethanol industry produced a record 32.5 million metric tons of high value feed last year, representing nearly $4 billion to the industry\u2019s balance sheet and the equivalent of the total amount of grain consumed by all the cattle fed on feedlots across the country.\u00a0 Where\u2019s the food vs. fuel argument there?\nIronically, just as we hit the blend wall in 2010, we\u2019re also now running up against the feed wall, as domestic markets for DDG are becoming saturated.\u00a0 As a consequence, last year we saw a dramatic increase in DDG exports.\u00a0 In fact, one out of every four tons of distillers grains produced today is exported. US marketers shipped an estimated 9 million metric tons of DDGs to more than 50 countries across the globe, with a quarter of that going to China.\u00a0 The demand for protein and energy feeds generally and DDGs specifically will only continue to grow as the world economy recovers and Third World diets improve.\u00a0 At a DDG conference the RFA co-hosted with the US Grains Council last fall, the demand for DDGs was palpable as more and more international animal nutritionists and feeders recognized the value of the concentrated protein and energy in DDG.\nI remain convinced that refuting the food vs. fuel canard is as important to cellulosic ethanol producers as it is to grain processors.\u00a0 The reason is: The debate really isn\u2019t about food.\u00a0 It\u2019s about land.\u00a0 Already we\u2019ve seen some environmentalists criticizing cellulosic ethanol with as much vitriol as they commonly reserve for corn ethanol because of groundless concerns about land and water resources.\nWe\u2019ve made headway over the past year in our ongoing effort to return some semblance of rational thought to the indirect land use debate and ethanol\u2019s carbon scoring.\u00a0 You will recall that an environmental activist, Tim Searchinger, teed up the ILUC fervor in 2008 with a phony analysis suggesting that ethanol\u2019s carbon footprint was actually twice as bad as gasoline because when you used an acre of land in the production of biomass for ethanol, a corresponding acre of rainforest would be destroyed in the Amazon.\u00a0 Incredibly, regulators jumped on this faux science before it had been properly studied.\u00a0 The RFA has led the effort to force scientific scrutiny and last year we began to reap the reward.\nUsing the GREET model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, 13\u00a0 billion gallons of ethanol production last year reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from on-road vehicles by 22 million tons.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars and trucks off the road!\nEPA\u2019s final RFS rulemaking concluded that a typical grain ethanol plant, even with the ILUC penalty, is on average 21% better than gasoline.\u00a0 And if the ILUC penalty was removed, an average plant today would reflect a 48% reduction in carbon\u2014within a hair\u2019s breadth of the 50% threshold for advanced biofuels.\u00a0 In April, Purdue released a study using the same model employed by California that reduced ILUC to about 14 g/MJ, down from Searchinger\u2019s far-fetched 104 g/MJ.\u00a0 Over the summer, the DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Lab released a report showing \u201cminimal to zero\u201d ILUC\u00a0 resulted from American corn ethanol expansion between 2001 and 2008.\u00a0 Last fall, even the California Air Resources Board\u2019s expert working group essentially recommended cutting CARB\u2019s ILUC number in half.\u00a0 Facts are stubborn things.\u00a0 Last year, Brazil released data demonstrating that deforestation has dropped precipitously since 2004, and shows NO correlation to increased ethanol production in the U.S. whatsoever. In fact, Amazon deforestation rates in 2010 were at their lowest point since the Brazilian government began collecting data in 1988.\nBut we\u2019re not done yet! \u00a0Better data and analyses will undoubtedly show that ILUC from US biofuels expansion is insignificant, particularly when compared to the direct and indirect environmental impact of other fuels, like tar sands or lithium for electric cars, which have so far escaped any comparable level of scrutiny.\nResolving this issue successfully remains a priority.\u00a0 The ethanol brand has been tarnished by the inscrutable accusations of an environmental lobby intent upon undermining production agriculture.\u00a0 While carbon policy might be on hold in Washington DC for the moment, I continue to believe that future energy policy will be inextricably linked to carbon performance, and if biofuels are to claim their appropriate role in that future, we need to correct what is now an incomplete and inaccurate assessment.\n2011 will be an important year for the ethanol industry.\u00a0 We will be facing many challenges.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to reform the tax incentive.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to stimulate investments in cellulose and advanced ethanol production and finally see commercialization in this sector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to open E15 market opportunities and continue to encourage investments in blender pumps and E85 infrastructure.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to address the myriad of technical issues constantly facing a growing industry, from rail safety to octane certification to carbon scoring.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to respond to the growing chorus of naysayers, those that will exaggerate the impact of ethanol on food to those that misrepresent the effects of ethanol on marine engines.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll need to do all of this in a political environment more focused on cutting than spending.\nWe will have no chance whatsoever if divisions within the industry, across agriculture, and among biofuels continue to distract from the bigger picture.\u00a0 We need to spend less time arguing about who is right and more time doing what is right.\u00a0 As long as we\u2019re more focused on what trade association you belong to than what the right policy should be; as long as ranchers are pitted against farmers over the price of grain and food processors ignore the price of oil; as long as we\u2019re arguing the relative merits of a \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuel vs. an ethanol molecule and whether investments in infrastructure help or hurt; we\u2019re going to condemn our children to a future ever more reliant on imported petroleum.\nOne way or another, change is coming to this industry.\u00a0 The question is how will we respond?\u00a0 What will we do to make this change for the better?\nWe need to do what the RFA has done for 30 years \u2013 build bridges.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge wide enough for the entire biofuels industry to cross to a more sustainable energy future.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge to our customers and consumers so the road to increased ethanol use is paved with understanding.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge to lawmakers so that we end up with a motor fuel policy befitting a 21st century energy industry.\u00a0 And we need to stride confidently across this bridge with enough vision, strength and innovation to conquer the insurmountable opportunities of our time.\nThank you.\n"}, {"score": 293.0936, "uuid": "5ee63a2c-9411-5dfe-bc0f-46c4e175a324", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0112wb-50-05004", "target_hostname": "www.ethanolrfa.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ethanolrfa.org/exchange/entry/2011-state-of-the-industry-address/", "page_rank": 1.2365566e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "2011 State of <em>the</em> Industry Address | RFA: Renewable Fuels Association", "snippet": "I remain convinced that refuting <em>the</em> <em>food</em> <em>vs</em>. fuel canard <em>is</em> as important to cellulosic ethanol producers as it <em>is</em> to grain <em>processors</em>. <em>The</em> reason <em>is</em>: <em>The</em> debate really isn\u2019t about <em>food</em>. It\u2019s about land.", "explanation": null, "document": "President and Chief Executive Officer\nRenewable Fuels Association\nAs prepared for delivery:\n\u201cWhile always volatile, the environment affecting alternative energy technologies has been in an acute state of turmoil and uncertainty. \u2026 The administration has embarked on an economic revival program based on massive budget cuts, new tax laws, and market oriented policies that have either totally eliminated, or put in great doubt, existing federal government commercialization programs and tax incentives.\u00a0 Last, but not least, press treatment of the alcohol fuels industry has been generally shallow and uniformed, and the general public is receiving an increasingly negative view of its value and potential.\u201d\nI should note here that I am quoting a memo to the RFA Board of Directors summarizing the state of the ethanol industry written by the first RFA President, Dave Hallberg, in 1981!\nDave went on to cite the inimitable comic strip character Pogo, \u201cWe are faced with insurmountable opportunities,\u201d concluding with a familiar sense of optimism that they would be realized.\nDave Hallberg was right in 1981.\u00a0 Those \u201cinsurmountable opportunities\u201d were realized in 1982 and every year since because RFA members, like Ron Miller, rose to the challenges of the moment while staying constantly and immutably focused on the future.\nThat has been the hallmark of the RFA and this industry for the past 30 years.\u00a0 When faced with great challenges, we unite, we do our homework, we build coalitions, we educate, we persevere, and we prevail.\nWhen the Reagan Administration tried to eliminate the federal ethanol program, we succeeded in extending it, and we have extended it four times since.\u00a0 When cities across the country were plagued by carbon monoxide pollution, we created an oxy-fuel program that moved ethanol from just an octane enhancer to a clean air tool and we effectively eradicated CO as a pollutant in major metropolitan areas.\u00a0 When MTBE was found contaminating the nation\u2019s drinking water, we ramped up production, opened new markets, and saved the nation\u2019s reformulated gasoline program that remains, today, the single most important and effective weapon in the fight against urban smog.\u00a0 After 9-11 shook the nation from its complacency about energy security, we worked with President Bush, Congress and the American Petroleum Institute to forge the most progressive renewable energy policy in the world by creating a Renewable Fuels Standard that required refiners, for the very first time, to utilize an increasing percentage of ethanol in gasoline.\u00a0\u00a0 And when that program proved successful, we worked with a whole new coalition of consumer groups and environmentalists to expand the RFS five-fold just two years later, forming the foundation of today\u2019s ethanol industry from which new technologies and new feedstocks can evolve.\nSo as I contemplate the state of the ethanol industry in 2011, I do so with the backdrop of history that assures me this industry can and will meet today\u2019s challenges as it has met every \u201cinsurmountable opportunity\u201d of the past, and that we will, once again prevail.\nBut make no mistake; the challenges facing our industry today are as vexing and complicated as any we have ever faced.\u00a0 We need to rise to these new challenges.\u00a0 We need to step up our game. \u00a0We need to build new bridges, forge new coalitions, and offer new ideas.\u00a0 We need to be flexible in our approach, disciplined in our message and recognize the limitations of government support in an era or unimaginable debt and competing priorities.\nAs we resolve to move forward, let\u2019s remember how far we have come.\nThe American ethanol industry is no longer a Midwest phenomenon.\u00a0 We are no longer biting at the ankles of the petroleum industry.\u00a0 We are now one-tenth of the nation\u2019s gasoline supply and we are growing.\nAs we gather here today, the US leads the world in ethanol production with 204 biorefineries in 29 states across the country.\u00a0 We produced more than 13 billion gallons of ethanol last year alone.\u00a0 It took the industry its first 16 years to produce 13 billion gallons of ethanol at all, let alone on an annual basis.\nThe American ethanol industry added $36 billion to household income and contributed $53 billion to the Gross Domestic Product.\u00a0 We contributed $7 billion in tax revenue to the federal treasury.\u00a0 We contributed another $4 billion to state coffers.\u00a0 And we can claim no small measure of credit for revitalizing our communities and providing the resources for education, infrastructure and emergency response needed across rural America.\nAnd in an era of chronic underemployment, the US ethanol industry last year helped employ more than 400,000 Americans, with more than 70,000 in direct employment at the plants, on farms, at construction companies, and elsewhere\u2013 good, high-paying jobs with benefits, opportunity for advancement and a secure future.\u00a0 These are jobs that won\u2019t be exported, jobs that build communities, jobs America needs.\n2010 was also the year the American ethanol industry entered the global marketplace in a big way.\u00a0 We exported a record 400 million gallons of ethanol last year, with product going to Europe, Canada, and Asia as well as, surprisingly, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 That\u2019s right; American ethanol is now being used to fuel the limos of Middle East oil sheiks and South American sugar barons.\n2010 also saw meaningful steps toward the commercialization of cellulosic and advanced ethanol.\u00a0 The Department of Energy awarded a loan guarantee for the first time to a cellulosic ethanol project that will use municipal solid waste to produce ethanol at a facility in Nevada.\u00a0 The Department of Agriculture recently surpassed DOE\u2019s effort by awarding three more loan guarantees to cellulosic ethanol projects in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\u00a0 Combined, these projects will result in more than 83 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production in the very near future.\nStill, the ethanol industry is not yet where we want to be, not where we need to be if this nation is ever to break its dependence on imported oil and take a more meaningful step toward a sustainable energy future that stimulates economic growth and gives Americans a choice at the gas pump.\nWe were recently reminded of the precarious position our nation\u2019s economic and energy security are in as a consequence of ours, and the world\u2019s, reliance on oil from the Persian Gulf.\u00a0 When a cry for freedom in Cairo can shoot oil prices skyrocketing because of angst that the 2 million barrels of oil a day that flow through the Suez Canal is threatened, we have a problem.\u00a0 But consider the consequences of further unrest across the canal.\u00a0 What would happen if the 50 million barrels a day that flow through the Strait of Hormuz were threatened?\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen it before.\u00a0 We know the havoc of gas lines and the economic catastrophe that follows skyrocketing oil prices.\u00a0 Just recently, and not caused by political conflict, the record oil prices of 2008 created a worldwide economic tailspin from which we are just now beginning to emerge.\nWhen will Washington learn that the only way to truly extricate ourselves from the grip of foreign oil dependency is to have a committed, consistent and comprehensive energy policy that recognizes the power of innovation and the promise of renewable fuels?\nToday, Washington is consumed with putting its fiscal house in order - disorder created in no small part by the economic turmoil caused by the $140 per barrel oil price and the subsequent economic free fall.\u00a0 Congress and the President are facing a mountain of debt.\u00a0 The $1.5 trillion budget deficit now represents almost 10% of our GDP.\u00a0 And the astonishing $14 trillion national public debt is about equal to total GDP.\u00a0 Reigning in spending and balancing the budget will be the number one priority over the next several years.\u00a0 Capitol Hill is now ruled by bean counters and its affects will be seen in every bill moving through Congress.\nIf the President of the United States is willing to put heating assistance for poor Americans on the chopping block - if the Congress can cut NASA, funding for local police, rural development programs and food assistance for low income women, infants and children \u2013 then few programs will be spared.\u00a0 Everything is on the table; or should be.\nSeveral weeks ago, the Senate considered an amendment to strip certain tax incentives from the petroleum industry.\u00a0 Oil industry lobbyists cried foul, and the amendment failed.\u00a0 Apparently, despite the President\u2019s admonition in his State of the Union speech that these companies were doing just fine on their own, the Congress is not yet ready to end the subsidies that move energy investments overseas, export jobs and encourage development in more and more ecologically sensitive areas, whether it\u2019s the Gulf of Mexico or the pristine forests of Canada.\nCongress does appear ready to end the ethanol tax incentive program, however.\u00a0 At least, end it in its current form and cost.\u00a0 Last December, with the committed leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley and President Obama, the Congress extended, for one year, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit \u2013 VEETC.\u00a0 It is now set to expire at the end of this year.\u00a0 But the message from that debate was unambiguous.\u00a0 Our industry needs to work with Congress and the Administration to reform the tax incentive moving forward.\u00a0 We will.\u00a0 Indeed, I welcome a dialogue about the future of the ethanol tax incentive.\nBut that dialogue ought not to have a myopic focus on VEETC.\u00a0 We ought to be encouraging a more sophisticated conversation about all motor fuel tax policy \u2013 and all energy tax policy in general.\u00a0 We must address the permanency of tax incentives for very mature and profitable energy industries with the \u201cextenders game\u201d played with renewable energy technologies.\u00a0 We need to determine how best to insulate consumers and producers from the wild gyrations of the world oil market.\u00a0 We need to encourage investments in infrastructure and flex fuel vehicles such that consumers are finally empowered to make the energy choices right for them and their vehicles.\u00a0 And we need to be discussing how we can finally and assuredly commercialize new technologies using new feedstocks, and continue the evolution of the biofuels industry such that it is sustainable, both environmentally and economically.\nWe also we need to make sure that if the still emerging biofuels industry is doing its part to reduce government debt, then the entrenched petroleum subsidies are on the table as well.\u00a0 After all, it\u2019s more than just market access that will determine our future; it is market economics first and foremost.\nThere are lots of proposals to reform the ethanol tax incentive, and all should be properly vetted and fairly considered.\u00a0 We should avoid the pettiness of whose idea it is, and focus on what will be best for the industry and the taxpayer.\u00a0\u00a0 There are those who believe a refundable producer tax incentive will be more politically viable than a market based incentive. Some would limit the incentive only to gallons above the RFS obligations, or make it available to only mid-level ethanol blends and E85.\u00a0 Others believe we should phase down the incentive while phasing in mandates for FFVs and blender pumps.\u00a0 The environmentalists would like a carbon-based performance credit.\u00a0 And still others have proposed a variable tax incentive tied to the price of oil and/or crush margins that would provide a consumer safety net, assuring ethanol demand if the price of oil falls while reducing or eliminating the incentive when it\u2019s not needed to drive consumer demand.\nFrankly, each of these has both advantages and disadvantages.\u00a0 But we must allow a dispassionate debate, based on fact and market analysis, and guided by political reality.\u00a0 Ultimately, the arbiter will be Congress, and we will all have to live with the consequence.\nThere are also competing proposals as to how to best catalyze investment in cellulose and advanced ethanol technology.\u00a0 Is it a refundable investment tax credit, a performance contract that would reward successful technologies or simply a more aggressive Apollo-like government grant program to get plants built?\u00a0 The industry needs to rally around a specific proposal soon, or existing policy will be the default and investment may continue to languish.\nThe RFA is committed to fostering such a dialogue and providing a forum for cellulose and advanced ethanol companies to come together.\u00a0 We have formed the Advanced Ethanol Council to provide a unique and expert voice for policy makers, the media and the public on issues related to advanced and cellulosic ethanol.\nI can assure you that an expiration of the tax incentive is a very real possibility.\u00a0 Budget constraints, seemingly unavoidable gridlock and dysfunction, and the mixed messages Congress is hearing from the industry and agriculture these days may lead them to take no action at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Such an outcome would put the future of this industry in jeopardy.\u00a0 While this outcome is possible, it is by no means predestined.\nWe need to unite.\u00a0 We need to focus our agenda; this is not a time for a wish list.\u00a0 We need to develop the technical support Congress will demand.\u00a0 And we need to go to Capitol Hill, speaking AS one voice, educating the more than 100 new Members of Congress that are new to this debate and may only have learned about ethanol from the pages of the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 If we do that, as we have when facing the insurmountable opportunities of the past 30 years, we will succeed again.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t, we will miss a critical opportunity to move this nation further away from imported energy.\nBeyond the halls of Congress, there is also much work that needs to be done to expand markets.\u00a0 Last month, EPA announced its approval of E15 for 2001 and newer vehicles.\u00a0 That was great news.\u00a0 But much work still needs to be done to encourage gasoline marketers to offer E15 to consumers.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that work.\u00a0 The RFA is partnering with Growth Energy on health effects testing.\u00a0 That testing is complete and has been submitted to EPA.\u00a0 We anticipate that companies will be able to utilize that data in the fuel registration process that should begin soon.\nWe\u2019re also working with other stakeholders to eliminate state regulatory barriers to the use of higher level ethanol blends.\u00a0 Already, we believe several states, including Iowa, Ohio and Illinois, are ready to use E15 as soon as marketers begin blending.\nWe\u2019re awaiting EPA\u2019s final action on labeling E15, and we are hopeful the Agency will revise its proposed label, which we believe is unnecessarily alarmist and unsupported by the record.\u00a0 EPA can\u2019t justify a label that says \u201cthis fuel may damage other vehicles.\u201d\u00a0 Exempt lawn mowers if you need to, but there is NO evidence suggesting an issue with any vehicle.\u00a0 EPA\u2019s label must go.\nUltimately, EPA needs to make E15 available to all vehicles.\u00a0 2001 and newer cars represent approximately 60% of the vehicle fleet.\u00a0 And while that\u2019s a good start and it will grow as newer vehicles replace the legacy fleet, it still leaves far too many consumers without an option to use E15 and it undermines the potential marketplace impact of EPA\u2019s decision.\u00a0 The analysis the RFA released last fall, prepared by the highly regarded automotive engineering firm, Ricardo, clearly demonstrated there is NO reason not to approve the use of E15 for vehicles older than 2001.\u00a0 There is no difference in emissions control equipment, materials compatibility, driveability or regulatory construct between a 2001 vehicle and an older model that would justify denying the opportunity to use E15 to all consumers.\u00a0 Ronald Reagan did not passionately tell the Kremlin to \u201ctear down 60% of that wall.\u201d\u00a0 And we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with a partial waiver of our blend wall either.\u00a0 If E15 can power the cars at Daytona yesterday, it can power the carpools in suburban America tomorrow.\n2011 should be the year we begin to hammer away at the ethanol blend wall.\u00a0 But the obstacles to meaningful market penetration for E15 are great and not going away.\u00a0 The opponents to E15 use are highly motivated and well-funded.\u00a0 While I give little chance to the federal lawsuit to stop E15, efforts in Congress to reverse EPA\u2019s decision continue to mount.\u00a0 And the liability concerns of marketers related to misfueling shouldn\u2019t be summarily dismissed.\nThe RFA is going to continue to work with marketers to address their concerns.\u00a0 We\u2019ve jointly supported legislation with the Petroleum Marketers Association to provide a pathway forward.\u00a0 In Iowa, Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey is working with the industry and insurers to find a solution that may prove to be a model for other states.\u00a0 I applaud his effort and any others to address these concerns.\u00a0 Ultimately, moving beyond E10 is critical to us all.\u00a0 Without expanded market opportunities, it will be exponentially more challenging to secure investments in the next generation of ethanol technologies.\u00a0 We need markets.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the oil industry is fighting so hard.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have to fight back even harder.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t about weed whackers; it\u2019s about the future growth and increased market opportunities for your fuel.\nThat\u2019s also why the food vs. fuel canard, which has been recycled for 30 years now, will likely be resurrected with new vigor again this year.\u00a0 US farmers grew about 12 \u00bd \u00a0billion bushels of corn last year.\u00a0 It was the third largest corn crop in history and the fourth in a row more than 12 billion bushels.\u00a0 Yields exceeded 152 million bushels per acre, meaning we\u2019re growing twice as much corn on the same amount of land as we did when the RFA was formed.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 In large part because the increased demand for grain created by the ethanol industry is enabling innovation and driving increased productivity on the farm and in the labs of seed companies across the country.\u00a0 We need to start taking credit for it.\u00a0 And we need to tell people that it is innovation and advanced technology that hold the key to meaningful economic development in impoverished parts of the globe.\u00a0 The biggest threat to food supplies isn\u2019t biofuels, it\u2019s underinvestment in agriculture and, more significantly, it\u2019s skyrocketing energy costs.\u00a0 Energy touches every element of food production, marketing and distribution, from the fertilizer used to produce the crop to the plastic it\u2019s stored in to the diesel used to get it to the grocery store.\nYou all know there\u2019s less than 5 cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes and that only 20 cents of every food dollar goes to the farmer.\u00a0 What you may not know is that the grain used in U.S. ethanol production represents only 3% of the world\u2019s grain supply on a net basis and none of its food grain supply.\u00a0 Despite poor weather in Russia and elsewhere, world grain supply remains strong.\u00a0 The global supply of wheat, rice, and coarse grains is estimated at 2.67 billion tons, the second-largest supply ever\u2014trailing only last year, and by less than 1%.\u00a0 There is simply no justification for blaming ethanol for world food prices.\nBut enthusiastic Malthusians and other doomsday prognosticators will not be deterred.\u00a0 They will use recent crop reports to blame biofuels for food insecurities that have existed for decades.\u00a0 But the facts are on our side.\nA March 2010 report by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that \u201cAvailable evidence suggests that biofuels had a relatively small contribution to the 2008 spike in agricultural commodity prices.\u201d Even the World Bank, which in 2008 suggested biofuels was playing a large role in higher food prices, released an analysis in July 2010 that found \u201c\u2026the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought\u2026\u201d and that \u201c\u2026the use of commodities by financial investors may have been partly responsible for the 2007-08 spike.\u201d\u00a0 No kidding.\nThese influential institutions are seeing the light because we\u2019ve been floodlighting the facts.\u00a0 The fact is: \u00a0ethanol is just using the starch from the corn.\u00a0 The fact is: \u00a0the protein feed value is retained and used as a valuable livestock feed.\u00a0 And the fact is: the American ethanol industry produced a record 32.5 million metric tons of high value feed last year, representing nearly $4 billion to the industry\u2019s balance sheet and the equivalent of the total amount of grain consumed by all the cattle fed on feedlots across the country.\u00a0 Where\u2019s the food vs. fuel argument there?\nIronically, just as we hit the blend wall in 2010, we\u2019re also now running up against the feed wall, as domestic markets for DDG are becoming saturated.\u00a0 As a consequence, last year we saw a dramatic increase in DDG exports.\u00a0 In fact, one out of every four tons of distillers grains produced today is exported. US marketers shipped an estimated 9 million metric tons of DDGs to more than 50 countries across the globe, with a quarter of that going to China.\u00a0 The demand for protein and energy feeds generally and DDGs specifically will only continue to grow as the world economy recovers and Third World diets improve.\u00a0 At a DDG conference the RFA co-hosted with the US Grains Council last fall, the demand for DDGs was palpable as more and more international animal nutritionists and feeders recognized the value of the concentrated protein and energy in DDG.\nI remain convinced that refuting the food vs. fuel canard is as important to cellulosic ethanol producers as it is to grain processors.\u00a0 The reason is: The debate really isn\u2019t about food.\u00a0 It\u2019s about land.\u00a0 Already we\u2019ve seen some environmentalists criticizing cellulosic ethanol with as much vitriol as they commonly reserve for corn ethanol because of groundless concerns about land and water resources.\nWe\u2019ve made headway over the past year in our ongoing effort to return some semblance of rational thought to the indirect land use debate and ethanol\u2019s carbon scoring.\u00a0 You will recall that an environmental activist, Tim Searchinger, teed up the ILUC fervor in 2008 with a phony analysis suggesting that ethanol\u2019s carbon footprint was actually twice as bad as gasoline because when you used an acre of land in the production of biomass for ethanol, a corresponding acre of rainforest would be destroyed in the Amazon.\u00a0 Incredibly, regulators jumped on this faux science before it had been properly studied.\u00a0 The RFA has led the effort to force scientific scrutiny and last year we began to reap the reward.\nUsing the GREET model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, 13\u00a0 billion gallons of ethanol production last year reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from on-road vehicles by 22 million tons.\u00a0 That\u2019s the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars and trucks off the road!\nEPA\u2019s final RFS rulemaking concluded that a typical grain ethanol plant, even with the ILUC penalty, is on average 21% better than gasoline.\u00a0 And if the ILUC penalty was removed, an average plant today would reflect a 48% reduction in carbon\u2014within a hair\u2019s breadth of the 50% threshold for advanced biofuels.\u00a0 In April, Purdue released a study using the same model employed by California that reduced ILUC to about 14 g/MJ, down from Searchinger\u2019s far-fetched 104 g/MJ.\u00a0 Over the summer, the DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Lab released a report showing \u201cminimal to zero\u201d ILUC\u00a0 resulted from American corn ethanol expansion between 2001 and 2008.\u00a0 Last fall, even the California Air Resources Board\u2019s expert working group essentially recommended cutting CARB\u2019s ILUC number in half.\u00a0 Facts are stubborn things.\u00a0 Last year, Brazil released data demonstrating that deforestation has dropped precipitously since 2004, and shows NO correlation to increased ethanol production in the U.S. whatsoever. In fact, Amazon deforestation rates in 2010 were at their lowest point since the Brazilian government began collecting data in 1988.\nBut we\u2019re not done yet! \u00a0Better data and analyses will undoubtedly show that ILUC from US biofuels expansion is insignificant, particularly when compared to the direct and indirect environmental impact of other fuels, like tar sands or lithium for electric cars, which have so far escaped any comparable level of scrutiny.\nResolving this issue successfully remains a priority.\u00a0 The ethanol brand has been tarnished by the inscrutable accusations of an environmental lobby intent upon undermining production agriculture.\u00a0 While carbon policy might be on hold in Washington DC for the moment, I continue to believe that future energy policy will be inextricably linked to carbon performance, and if biofuels are to claim their appropriate role in that future, we need to correct what is now an incomplete and inaccurate assessment.\n2011 will be an important year for the ethanol industry.\u00a0 We will be facing many challenges.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to reform the tax incentive.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to stimulate investments in cellulose and advanced ethanol production and finally see commercialization in this sector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to open E15 market opportunities and continue to encourage investments in blender pumps and E85 infrastructure.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to address the myriad of technical issues constantly facing a growing industry, from rail safety to octane certification to carbon scoring.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to respond to the growing chorus of naysayers, those that will exaggerate the impact of ethanol on food to those that misrepresent the effects of ethanol on marine engines.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll need to do all of this in a political environment more focused on cutting than spending.\nWe will have no chance whatsoever if divisions within the industry, across agriculture, and among biofuels continue to distract from the bigger picture.\u00a0 We need to spend less time arguing about who is right and more time doing what is right.\u00a0 As long as we\u2019re more focused on what trade association you belong to than what the right policy should be; as long as ranchers are pitted against farmers over the price of grain and food processors ignore the price of oil; as long as we\u2019re arguing the relative merits of a \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuel vs. an ethanol molecule and whether investments in infrastructure help or hurt; we\u2019re going to condemn our children to a future ever more reliant on imported petroleum.\nOne way or another, change is coming to this industry.\u00a0 The question is how will we respond?\u00a0 What will we do to make this change for the better?\nWe need to do what the RFA has done for 30 years \u2013 build bridges.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge wide enough for the entire biofuels industry to cross to a more sustainable energy future.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge to our customers and consumers so the road to increased ethanol use is paved with understanding.\u00a0 We need to build a bridge to lawmakers so that we end up with a motor fuel policy befitting a 21st century energy industry.\u00a0 And we need to stride confidently across this bridge with enough vision, strength and innovation to conquer the insurmountable opportunities of our time.\nThank you.\n"}, {"score": 289.1726, "uuid": "8dc1f994-7faa-5f0b-a942-62829722bad9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300wb-00-12104", "target_hostname": "blog.bottger.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.bottger.com/recipes-everything-else/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.1773723e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "View from <em>the</em> Innside: recipes--everything else", "snippet": "Here\u2019s how I save and use <em>the</em> entire can: dump <em>the</em> chilies and sauce into <em>a</em> <em>blender</em> and puree, then run it through <em>a</em> <em>food</em> mill or strainer to get out <em>the</em> seeds and skin.", "explanation": null, "document": "An Albuquerque innkeeper takes you along!\nrecipes--everything else\nPumpkin flan--easy Thanksgiving dessert\nThis is from the November 2010 issue of Woman's Day Magazine that someone left at the Bottger Mansion of Old Town . \u00a0This has to be the easiest recipe ever. \u00a0If you're going to a potluck Thanksgiving dinner and want to take something different than pumpkin pie, this is easy to make well ahead of time. \u00a0No baking!

Do not overcrowd or burn. As beef is browned, remove and set aside. Continue browning the rest. It takes 30 minutes to give it rich flavor and brown color. Remove beef from Dutch oven and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees. Add vegetables to Dutch oven, toss to coat with drippings, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Remove vegetables and set aside.\nReturn beef to Dutch oven. Add salt and pepper and mix into beef. Sprinkle beef with flour and stir to mix well. Put Dutch oven into the oven and bake for 4 minutes; stir and bake another 4 minutes. This will put a little crust on the beef cubes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.\nTake Dutch oven out of the oven and put back on the burner. Over medium heat, add the vegetables and beef broth. Make a bouquet garni of the bay leaf, thyme, cloves and parsley sprigs (tied up in a cheesecloth bag) and add to the pot. Bring to a simmer.\nPut the stew back into the oven and bake, covered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove the bouquet garni and serve.\nKathy\u2019s notes: the recipe originally called for new potatoes, but they don\u2019t have enough starch. Russet potatoes will release starch as they cook and will give a nice thick broth for the stew.\nEasy coffee granita\nI found a recipe in an old Bon Appetit magazine for Coffee Bean Granita.\u00a0 It called for whole coffee beans which you put in boiling water and steep for 3 hours, then freeze, stirring every 45 minutes for 5 hours.\u00a0 I made the recipe as it said, and it was pretty good, but... too much trouble.\u00a0 So here I go again to see if I can make something just as good, maybe faster and easier.\nWhat is granita? Well, you know ice cream, which is made with cream, sugar, flavorings, and you make it in an ice cream freezer so it's very smooth and creamy.\u00a0 In other words, it's high calorie and high fat, but oh so good.\u00a0 Then there's sorbet, which is just fruit juice that's been processed like ice cream to have a smooth and creamy texture. Granita is like sorbet, except that you want it to have ice crystals in it, unlike ice cream or sorbet.\u00a0 Instead of making it in an ice cream freezer that turns continuously and keeps the ice crystals extremely small, you make granita in a bowl or pan, allowing the ice crystals to form around the edges.\u00a0 Then you stir it occasionally and new crystals form.\u00a0 By the time it's all frozen, you have a pan or bowl full of fine flavored ice crystals.\nMy hot tip: I wear a clip-on kitchen timer to remind me to get back into the kitchen and stir the granita.\u00a0 Otherwise, I'd forget about it and have a solid block of frozen coffee.\nBelow is the recipe, and on my third attempt I just did the entire thing in a 4-cup Pyrex glass measuring cup.\u00a0 My quicker and easier version was so close in taste to the original coffee bean granita, why would I do it the hard way?\nEasy Coffee Granita\n"}, {"score": 286.21338, "uuid": "52875ac2-7879-518b-a229-f6ebcac7bc49", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1409wb-19-02694", "target_hostname": "slice.seriouseats.com", "target_uri": "http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/10/the-pizza-lab-homemade-pizza-sauce-new-york-style-recipe.html", "page_rank": 1.2653488e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>The</em> Pizza Lab: Bringing New York Style Pizza Sauce Home | Slice Pizza Blog", "snippet": "I opted for those packed in juice, giving them <em>a</em> quick whir with my hand <em>blender</em> to puree them right after I added them to <em>the</em> pot (<em>a</em> <em>food</em> <em>processor</em> or <em>food</em> mill are equally effective, but harder-to-clean options).", "explanation": null, "document": "The Pizza Lab: Bringing New York Style Pizza Sauce Home\nPosted by J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt , October 7, 2010 at 2:00 PM\nMore tests, more results! Follow The Food Lab on Facebook or Twitter .\n[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]\nUnlike Neapolitan pies , which generally use a simple, uncooked sauce of fresh or canned tomatoes and salt, New York by-the-slice pies use a more heavily seasoned cooked sauce. The key to great NY-style sauce is the balance between sweetness, acidity, heat, with a definite herbal backbone and a texture that's thin enough enough to spread, but thick enough to keep your pizza from turning soggy during the de rigeur fold-and-carry.\nYou can pull off the easiest recipes in a New York minute: simply puree tomatoes with garlic, olive oil, and Italian seasoning then reduce it over a low flame. The results are not bad\u2014certainly a step-up from canned pizza sauces (which are inevitably too sweet and herb-heavy)\u2014but the goal here at the Pizza Lab is for something a little better than simply \"not bad.\" We're after great. Time to hit the kitchen.\nThe Fat\nMost pizza sauces start with a base of extra-virgin olive oil, which is fine, but there's a better option. Is there anyone in the blogospheric world who's yet to hear about Marcella Hazan's amazingly simple and delicious Tomato sauce with Onion and Butter ? Made by simply simmering tomatoes, butter, and a couple of onion halves (the onion gets discarded after cooking), it produces an exceptionally smooth, complex, and delicious sauce.\nFrench chefs have known for years that adding butter to a sauce can help round off the rough edges and give it a richer, fuller mouthfeel. My pizza sauce was no exception. Simply replacing half of the two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil I was using with unsalted butter added sweetness, complexity, and smoothness to my sauce without creating any extra work (I left some of the olive oil in for its peppery bite).\nI also decided to use Marcella's onion trick, further upping the sweetness.\nThe Herbs\nMost recipes call for either dried oregano, or a mix of dried \"Italian Seasoning,\" which is mostly dried oregano and basil. My immediate thought was: replace the dried with fresh. Imagine my surprise when after cooking two sauces side-by-side with dried oregano vs. fresh leaves, there was barely any difference at all.\nMany chef's assert that fresh herbs are superior to dried herbs, and they're right\u2014most of the time. Most herbs contain flavor compounds that are more volatile than water, which means that any drying process which removes water, also ends up removing flavor.\nBut it's not always the case, and here's why. Savory herbs that tend to grow in hot, relatively dry climates\u2014like oregano, for instance\u2014have flavor compounds that are relatively stable at high temperatures, and are well-contained within the leaf. They have to be, in order to withstand the high temperatures and lack of humidity in their natural environment. Other arid herbs like rosemary, marjoram, bay leaf, thyme, and sage fare similarly well in the drying process.\nI found that as long as I made sure to cook the herbs for long enough to soften their texture (I started by sauteeing them right from the beginning in the oil/butter mixture), the flavor I got out of them was just as good as using the real thing\u2014and a whole lot cheaper and easier.\nBasil, on the other hand, had to be added fresh. I tried adding it chopped right at the end as I would with most fresh herbs in order to maintain their flavor, but found that it wasn't right for pizza sauce. Better was to simply add whole sprigs of it while the sauce was simmering and remove them right at the end.\nThe Tomatoes\nFirst things first: I knew that I wanted to use canned tomatoes, since they are much more consistent year round (I shudder at the thought of making a fresh tomato sauce out of bland winter tomatoes). But which tomatoes should I use?\nAdam is currently in the process of working with Scott Wiener of Scott's Pizza Tours on discovering which brand of tomato is the best, but what about which type of tomato product to use? Pretty much every brand has five offerings:\nWhole Peeled Tomatoes are the least processed offering. Consisting of whole tomatoes that are peeled (either by steaming or being treated with lye), then packed either in tomato puree, or in tomato juice. Those packed in juice are less processed, and therefore more versatile (tomatoes packed in puree will always have a \"cooked\" flavor, even if you use them straight out of the can).\nDiced Tomatoes are whole peeled tomatoes that have been machine-diced, then again, packed in juice or puree. The main difference here is that frequently, diced tomatoes are treated with calcium chloride, a firming agent which helps the dice keep their shape in the can. The problem is, calcium chloride makes the tomatoes too firm. They don't break down properly when cooking. Look for brands with no calcium chloride (whole canned tomatoes occasionally also contain this firming agent, but its effects are not as strong on whole tomatoes).\nCrushed Tomatoes can vary wildly from brand to brand. There are actually no controls on the labeling of crushed tomatoes, so one brands \"crushed\" may be a chunky mash, while another's could be a nearly smooth puree. Because of this, it's generally better to avoid crushed products, opting instead to crush your own whole tomatoes.\nTomato Puree is a cooked and strained tomato product. It makes a good shortcut for quick cooking sauces, but your sauce will lack the complexity you get from slowly reducing a less processed tomato product. Leave the puree on the shelf.\nTomato Paste is concentrated tomato juice. After cooking fresh tomatoes, all of the larger solids are strained out, then the resulting juice is slowly cooked down to a moisture content of 76% or less. It's great for adding a strong umami backbone to stews and braises.\nSo diced tomatoes are too firm, crushed tomatoes are too inconsistent, and tomato puree and paste are too cooked, which left me with the whole canned tomatoes. I opted for those packed in juice, giving them a quick whir with my hand blender to puree them right after I added them to the pot (a food processor or food mill are equally effective, but harder-to-clean options).\nFixing Flavor\nNumerous studies have shown that where tomatoes are concerned, the best should have high levels of both acidity and sweetness. Canned tomatoes invariably have some citric acid added to them in order to up their acidity. Slowly reducing the pureed tomatoes on the stovetop not only creates new flavor compounds, adding complexity to the sauce, but it also gets rid of water content, intensifying the flavors that are already there. Why go slow instead of fast? There are two good reasons:\nFirst, if you aren't really careful, high heat can cause unwanted browning, created roasted, caramel notes in your sauce. This isn't a good thing. I tend not to be careful, so I hedge my bets by keeping the heat minimal.\nSecondly, I value my marriage and the tranquility that walls and ceilings free from splattered tomato sauce bring to it.\nAfter an hour of slow simmering, the sauce was nearly perfect, but was missing a couple of key elements. A little extra sugar helped to balance out the newly-intensified acidity, and a pinch of pepper flakes added a not-overwhelming heat. Cooking a new batch and adding the pepper flakes to saute in the butter/olive oil right from the beginning made it even better.\nIn the end I had a sauce with just the right balance of flavor for my New York style pies. Sweet, a little hot, and intensely savory, with a texture that helps it melt in beautifully with the cheese, the way a good NY-style pie should.\nBut what about the crust, you ask? Well it's late, my dog is snoring, and my wife needs to be taken for a walk or she'll pee the bed again,* so that'll have to be another kitchen experiment for another time.
