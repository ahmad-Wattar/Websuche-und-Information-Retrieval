What do you think? Should legislation requiring energy-efficient bulbs remain, or should it be overturned so we can buy any light bulb we want?\nResponses came quickly, and many focused on whether this is an appropriate topic for Federal legislation (a very good question in my opinion). I'm not going there, but thought I would address some of the other issues that were raised by 9News viewers on Facebook at Twitter. By the way, CFL's are not bulbs (technically they are lamps) but since people call them CFL bulbs I may do the same!\nCFLs cost too much\nCFLs pay for themselves over time in energy savings. At 12 cent per kWh for electricity, a 60 watt incandescent bulb costs 0.72 cents per hour to operate. An equivalent 14 watt CFL costs 0.168 cents per hour. At a cost of $1 for the CFL (Home Depot sells them in 4 packs for $3.97), the CFL pays for itself in 180 hours of use. \u00a0During a CFL's lifespan of 6,000 to 15,000 hours, it would save $33 to $83 in energy costs.\nCFLs contain mercury and, '..\nif you break one you need a hazmat crew for clean up.'\nA CFL contains about 5mg of mercury (1/6000th of an ounce). By comparison, a mercury based fever thermometer contains 100 to 600 tims as much mercury. According to the website www.CFLFacts.com , 'Because CFLs contain mercury they should be recycled instead of thrown in the normal trash. However, even if a relatively large number of CFLs are disposed of in landfills instead of being recycled, they will not significantly increase the amount of mercury in the waste stream. A report titled Mercury Programme, published by the United Nations Environmental Programme, estimated that in 2000 there were 145 metric tons of mercury added to the solid waste stream in the United States. If 200 million CFLs, each containing 5 mg of mercury were placed in the solid waste stream in one year, they would add only 1 metric ton, or less than 0.7% of the total annual mercury load in the waste stream.'\nBy the way, many retailers (including Home Depot) accept CFLs for recycling. Visit the EPA Website for more info.\nCFLs '...are all made in China, so they are not good for our economy'\nTrue, most CFLs are made in China and India. Of course the last major U.S. plant to make incandescent bulbs (in Winchester VA) closed in September 2010. And where do you think all of that oil we use (and could reduce) comes from?\nCFLs 'take a long time to warmup and don't give off good light'\nAccording to GE , 'The first compact fluorescent bulbs flickered when they were turned on because it took a few seconds for the ballast to produce enough electricity to excite the gas inside the bulb. Thanks to the refined technology in our new GE compact fluorescent bulbs, there is now no significant flicker (less than 1 second). However, these bulbs do require a short warm-up period before they reach full brightness, which is why they may appear dim when first turned on. Compact fluorescent bulbs are best used in fixtures that are left on for longer periods of time, rather than in fixtures that are turned off and on frequently.'\n"}, {"score": 2719.0303, "uuid": "79acb9a2-1ba2-58e3-9b33-74c7aad9907b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-81-10699", "target_hostname": "en.wikivisual.com", "target_uri": "http://en.wikivisual.com/index.php/Incandescent_light_bulb", "page_rank": 1.2650755e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> - Wikivisual", "snippet": "&quot;<em>Incandescent</em> <em>Bulbs</em> Return to the Cutting Edge&quot;. <em>Incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em> consist of a glass enclosure (the envelope, <em>or</em> <em>bulb</em>) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the <em>bulb</em>, through <em>which</em> an electric current <em>is</em> passed.", "explanation": null, "document": "File:Carbonfilament.jpg\nCarbon filament lamp (E27 socket, 220 volts , approx. 30 watts , left side: running with 100 volts)\nJoseph Wilson Swan (1828\u20131914) was a British physicist and chemist. In 1850, he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light. By the mid-1870s better pumps became available, and Swan returned to his experiments.\nWith the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent No 8 in 1880.<ref name=\"Incandescent Electric Lamp Pp 21-25\">Swan K R Sir Joseph Swan and the Invention of the Incandescent Electric Lamp. 1946 Longmans, Green and Co. Pp 21\u201325.</ref> On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime.<ref> \"Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Carbon Filament Incandescent\" Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

Edison filed his first patent application for \"Improvement In Electric Lights\" on October 14, 1878.<ref> U.S. Patent 0,214,636 </ref> After many experiments with platinum and other metal filaments, Edison returned to a carbon filament. The first successful test was on October 22, 1879,<ref>Paul Israel, Edison: a Life of Invention, Wiley (1998), page 186.</ref> and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by November 4, 1879, filed for a U.S. patent for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires.\"<ref name=Patent898> U.S. Patent 0,223,898 granted January 27, 1880</ref> Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways,\"<ref name=\"Patent898\"/> it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1200 hours.\nHiram S. Maxim started a lightbulb company in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of William Sawyer . His United States Electric Lighting Company was the second company, after Edison, to sell practical incandescent electric lamps. They made their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps at the Mercantile Safe Deposit Company in New York City in the fall of 1880, about six months after the Edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the steamer Columbia. In October 1880, Maxim patented a method of coating carbon filaments with hydrocarbons to extend their life. Lewis Latimer , his employee at the time, developed an improved method of heat-treating them which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes, such as the characteristic \"M\" shape of Maxim filaments. On January 17, 1882, Latimer received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons,\" an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments, which was purchased by the United States Electric Light Company. Latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports.<ref name=\"Fouch\u00e9\"/>\nIn Britain , the Edison and Swan companies merged into the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan , that was ultimately incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd ). Edison was initially against this combination, but after Swan sued him and won, Edison was eventually forced to cooperate, and the merger was made. Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.\nU.S. Patent 0,223,898 by Thomas Edison for an improved electric lamp, January 27, 1880\nIn 1882, the first recorded set of miniature incandescent lamps for lighting a Christmas tree was installed. These did not become common in homes for many years.\nThe United States Patent Office gave a ruling October 8, 1883, that Edison's patents were based on the prior art of William Sawyer and were invalid. Litigation continued for a number of years. Eventually on October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid.\nIn the 1890s, the Austrian inventor Carl Auer von Welsbach worked on metal-filament mantles, first with platinum wire, and then osmium , and produced an operating version in 1898. In 1898, he patented the osmium lamp and started marketing it in 1902, the first commercial metal filament incandescent lamp.\nIn 1897, German physicist and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp , a form of incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.\nIn 1903, Willis Whitnew invented a metal-coated carbon filament that would not blacken the inside of a light bulb.\nOn December 13, 1904, Hungarian S\u00e1ndor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a tungsten filament lamp, that lasted longer and gave a brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1905, so this type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries.<ref> \"The History of Tungsram\" (PDF). http://www.tungsram.hu/tungsram/downloads/tungsram/tu_short_history_1896-1996.pdf . </ref>\nIn 1906, the General Electric Company patented a method of making filaments from sintered tungsten and in 1911, used ductile tungsten wire for incandescent light bulbs. The tungsten filament outlasted all other types.\nIn 1913, Irving Langmuir found that filling a lamp with inert gas instead of a vacuum resulted in twice the luminous efficacy and reduction of bulb blackening. In 1924, Marvin Pipkin , an American chemist, patented a process for frosting the inside of lamp bulbs without weakening them, and in 1947, he patented a process for coating the inside of lamps with silica .\nIn 1930, Hungarian Imre Br\u00f3dy filled lamps with krypton gas in lieu of argon. He used krypton and/or xenon filling of bulbs. Since the new gas was expensive, he developed a process with his colleagues to obtain krypton from air. Production of krypton filled lamps based on his invention started at Ajka in 1937, in a factory co-designed by Pol\u00e1nyi and Hungarian-born physicist Egon Orowan .<ref> [1] </ref>\nBy 1964, improvements in efficiency and production of incandescent lamps had reduced the cost of providing a given quantity of light by a factor of thirty, compared with the cost at introduction of Edison's lighting system <ref name=\"GETP110\">Incandescent Lamps, Publication Number TP-110, General Electric Company, Nela Park, Cleveland, OH (1964) pg. 3</ref>\nConsumption of incandescent light bulbs grew rapidly in the United States. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filament were introduced, there were about 50 million lamp sockets in the United States. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).<ref name=Kane2001>Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress (2nd ed.), The Fairmont Press, Inc. 2001 ISBN 0-88173-378-4 page 37, table 2-1</ref>\nMain article: Phoebus cartel\nBetween 1924 and 1939, the international market for incandescent light bulbs was controlled by the Phoebus cartel, which dictated wholesale prices and whose members controlled most of the world market for lamps.[ citation needed ]\nFile:Wolfram-Halogengl\u00fchlampe.png\nXenon Halogen Lamp (105 W) with an E27 base, intended for direct replacement of a non-halogen bulb\nApproximately 90% of the power consumed by an incandescent light bulb is emitted as heat , rather than as visible light .<ref name=autogenerated2>page 23, table.</ref>\nThe effectiveness of an electric lighting source is determined by two factors, the relative visibility of electromagnetic radiation, and the rate at which the source converts electric power into electromagnetic radiation.\nLuminous efficacy of a light source is a ratio of the visible light energy emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power input to the lamp.<ref>IEEE Std. 100 definition of \"luminous efficacy\" pg. 647</ref> Visible light is measured in lumens , a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous efficacy of radiant energy is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye. The maximum efficacy possible is 683\u00a0lm/W for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometres wavelength, the peak sensitivity of the human eye. For white light, the maximum luminous efficacy is around 240 lumens per watt, but the exact value is not unique because the human eye can perceive many different mixtures of visible light as \"white\".\nThe chart below lists values of overall luminous efficacy and efficiency for several types of general service, 120-volt, 1000-hour lifespan incandescent bulb, and several idealized light sources.

Today, many people use fluorescent lamps in their homes and businesses for a variety of reasons. There are many different styles of fluorescent light bulbs to choose from, no matter what your needs might be. If you take the time to look at all the different varieties and learn about how you intend you use your fixtures, you might be able to determine which are best for your needs much easier.\nThe most common type of fluorescent light bulb that consumers use today is the CFL. CFL lamps are a smaller fluorescent bulb that was created to offer the same uses as an incandescent bulb, but with a fraction of the energy used. They are able to save people hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on electricity every single year no matter whether they are used for home or business. Traditional fluorescent strip fixtures, which are what most people think of when it comes to fluorescents, are not the only product out there. They are popular for many businesses and commercial uses, but limit what types of fixtures people are able to use. If you are looking for a hip, trendy design, one of the many other types of that might better suit your needs because you will have a larger selection of fixtures to choose from.\nThe main attraction of fluorescent light bulbs is that they do create a much more efficient means of illuminating your home. Typically, many people think of them to be unappealing because they think of the standard strip fixture. However, with circline lamps and other styles of fluorescent lamps available for your use, you might be surprised at how customizable your options really are. Fluorescent tubes are just as varied as your needs for them and they have so many useful applications in and around the home and the business that you are sure to find something that works for your needs.\nFluorescent light bulbs work by conducting an electric current through the tube that is filled with mercury and other inert gases. They require a ballast to work in most cases, except when it comes to compact fluorescent. They are screw-in based like incandescent, making them much more convenient and useable than many people might realize. Replacing even one bulb in your home or business with a CFL light can save up to $15 a year, and when you multiply that by the number of lamps that you have, that\u0092s a lot of money. In the end, it doesn\u0092t matter whether you\u0092re looking for CFL or any other types of fluorescent tubes. Either way, they are a great solution for all illumination needs, no matter how big or small those needs might be.

By comparison, older home thermometers contain 500 milligrams of mercury, and many manual thermostats contain up to 3,000 milligrams. It would take between 100 and 600 CFLs to equal those amounts.\nMercury is an essential, irreplaceable element in CFLs and is what allows the bulb to be an efficient light source. Mercury is an element that, if breathed and absorbed by the body, can cause neurological damage.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy assure us that CFLs are safe to use in your home. No mercury is released when the bulbs are in use, and they pose no danger to you or your family when used properly. However, CFLs are made of glass tubing and can break if dropped or roughly handled. Be careful when removing the lamp from its packaging, installing it or replacing it.\nIronically, CFLs present an opportunity to prevent mercury from entering our air, where it most affects our health. The highest source of mercury in our air comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal, the most common fuel used in the U.S. to produce electricity. Energy-efficient CFLs present an opportunity to prevent mercury emissions from entering the environment because they help to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants.\nA CFL uses 75 percent less energy than an incandescent light bulb and lasts up to 10 times longer. A power plant will emit 10 milligrams (mg) of mercury to produce the electricity needed to run an incandescent bulb compared to only 2.4 mg of mercury to run a CFL for the same time. That means that use of the CFL will actually prevent six to eight milligrams of mercury from entering the environment.\nWhat should I do if I break a bulb?\nThe risks to you and your family from breaking a CFL are small. The amount of mercury in a CFL is very small, about five milligrams, or the size of the tip of a ball point pen. In comparison, older thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury. It would take at least 100 CFLs to equal the amount of mercury in a single thermometer.\nThe mercury in a CFL is needed to help turn the electric current into white light you get from the bulb. Once turned on, a very small amount of the mercury in the CFL becomes a vapor. If a CFL bulb breaks, a small amount of the mercury vapor will be released in the air. Unlike the elemental mercury found in fever thermometers, which are the shiny beads of liquid mercury, you will probably not see any mercury with the naked eye if you break a CFL bulb. The white powder you see is from the phosphorus coating on the inside of the CFL.\nSo if you break a bulb, you\u2019re at little risk for significant mercury exposure. It is important, though, to carefully clean up and dispose of a broken CFL to avoid spreading around the phosphorus powder, glass and any remaining mercury.\nHere are U.S. EPA\u2019s guidelines for cleaning up a broken CFL:\nOpen a window and leave the room (restrict access) for at least 15 minutes. If you have fans, place the fans in the windows and blow the air out of the room. Note: If the room has no windows, open all doors to the room and windows outside the room and use fans to move the air out of the room and to the open windows.\nRemove all materials you can without using a vacuum cleaner.\nWear disposable rubber gloves, if available (do not use your bare hands).\nCarefully scoop up the fragments and powder with stiff paper or cardboard.\nWipe the area clean with a damp paper towel or disposable wet wipe.\nSticky tape (such as duct tape) can be used to pick up small pieces and powder.\nPlace all cleanup materials in a plastic bag and seal it, and then place in a second sealed plastic bag.\nIf no other disposal or recycling options are available, private residents may dispose of the CFL in residential garbage. Be sure to seal the CFL in two plastic bags and put into the outside trash.\nWash your hands after disposing of the bags.\nThe first time you vacuum the area where the bulb was broken, remove the vacuum bag once done cleaning the area (or empty and wipe the canister) and put the bag and/or vacuum debris, as well as the cleaning materials, in two sealed plastic bags in the outdoor trash or protected outdoor location for normal disposal.\nI broke a bulb awhile ago and have questions about whether\nmy family and home are safe. What do I do?\nIf you took the proper steps to clean up a broken CFL in the past, as described above, you are probably at little risk for any significant exposure. If you are still unsure, however, your health department is the best place to get information about indoor air quality and health-related risks from mercury.\nYou can contact the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), Bureau of Environmental Health, if you have questions about health risks related to mercury. E-mail Greg Stein , ODH, or call him at (614) 466-1390.\nHow should I dispose of unbroken or burned out bulbs?\nLike paint, batteries, thermostats and other hazardous household items, CFLs should be disposed of properly. Do not throw CFLs away in your household garbage if better disposal options exist.\nIf under warranty, return it to your retailer.\nENERGY STAR qualified CFLs have a warranty. If the bulb fails within the warranty period, return it to your retailer.\nRecycle it.\nU.S. EPA recommends that consumers take advantage of local recycling options for CFLs where available. U.S. EPA is working with CFL manufacturers and major U.S. retailers to expand disposal options. For more information, go to:\nOhio Consumers\u2019 Council CFL bulb disposal\nManage it with other household hazardous waste.\nMany communities and solid waste management districts (SWMD) hold household hazardous waste collection events .

By comparison, older home thermometers contain 500 milligrams of mercury, and many manual thermostats contain up to 3,000 milligrams. It would take between 100 and 600 CFLs to equal those amounts.\nMercury is an essential, irreplaceable element in CFLs and is what allows the bulb to be an efficient light source. Mercury is an element that, if breathed and absorbed by the body, can cause neurological damage.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy assure us that CFLs are safe to use in your home. No mercury is released when the bulbs are in use, and they pose no danger to you or your family when used properly. However, CFLs are made of glass tubing and can break if dropped or roughly handled. Be careful when removing the lamp from its packaging, installing it or replacing it.\nIronically, CFLs present an opportunity to prevent mercury from entering our air, where it most affects our health. The highest source of mercury in our air comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal, the most common fuel used in the U.S. to produce electricity. Energy-efficient CFLs present an opportunity to prevent mercury emissions from entering the environment because they help to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants.\nA CFL uses 75 percent less energy than an incandescent light bulb and lasts up to 10 times longer. A power plant will emit 10 milligrams (mg) of mercury to produce the electricity needed to run an incandescent bulb compared to only 2.4 mg of mercury to run a CFL for the same time. That means that use of the CFL will actually prevent six to eight milligrams of mercury from entering the environment.\nWhat should I do if I break a bulb?\nThe risks to you and your family from breaking a CFL are small. The amount of mercury in a CFL is very small, about five milligrams, or the size of the tip of a ball point pen. In comparison, older thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury. It would take at least 100 CFLs to equal the amount of mercury in a single thermometer.\nThe mercury in a CFL is needed to help turn the electric current into white light you get from the bulb. Once turned on, a very small amount of the mercury in the CFL becomes a vapor. If a CFL bulb breaks, a small amount of the mercury vapor will be released in the air. Unlike the elemental mercury found in fever thermometers, which are the shiny beads of liquid mercury, you will probably not see any mercury with the naked eye if you break a CFL bulb. The white powder you see is from the phosphorus coating on the inside of the CFL.\nSo if you break a bulb, you\u2019re at little risk for significant mercury exposure. It is important, though, to carefully clean up and dispose of a broken CFL to avoid spreading around the phosphorus powder, glass and any remaining mercury.\nHere are U.S. EPA\u2019s guidelines for cleaning up a broken CFL:\nOpen a window and leave the room (restrict access) for at least 15 minutes. If you have fans, place the fans in the windows and blow the air out of the room. Note: If the room has no windows, open all doors to the room and windows outside the room and use fans to move the air out of the room and to the open windows.\nRemove all materials you can without using a vacuum cleaner.\nWear disposable rubber gloves, if available (do not use your bare hands).\nCarefully scoop up the fragments and powder with stiff paper or cardboard.\nWipe the area clean with a damp paper towel or disposable wet wipe.\nSticky tape (such as duct tape) can be used to pick up small pieces and powder.\nPlace all cleanup materials in a plastic bag and seal it, and then place in a second sealed plastic bag.\nIf no other disposal or recycling options are available, private residents may dispose of the CFL in residential garbage. Be sure to seal the CFL in two plastic bags and put into the outside trash.\nWash your hands after disposing of the bags.\nThe first time you vacuum the area where the bulb was broken, remove the vacuum bag once done cleaning the area (or empty and wipe the canister) and put the bag and/or vacuum debris, as well as the cleaning materials, in two sealed plastic bags in the outdoor trash or protected outdoor location for normal disposal.\nI broke a bulb awhile ago and have questions about whether\nmy family and home are safe. What do I do?\nIf you took the proper steps to clean up a broken CFL in the past, as described above, you are probably at little risk for any significant exposure. If you are still unsure, however, your health department is the best place to get information about indoor air quality and health-related risks from mercury.\nYou can contact the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), Bureau of Environmental Health, if you have questions about health risks related to mercury. E-mail Greg Stein , ODH, or call him at (614) 466-1390.\nHow should I dispose of unbroken or burned out bulbs?\nLike paint, batteries, thermostats and other hazardous household items, CFLs should be disposed of properly. Do not throw CFLs away in your household garbage if better disposal options exist.\nIf under warranty, return it to your retailer.\nENERGY STAR qualified CFLs have a warranty. If the bulb fails within the warranty period, return it to your retailer.\nRecycle it.\nU.S. EPA recommends that consumers take advantage of local recycling options for CFLs where available. U.S. EPA is working with CFL manufacturers and major U.S. retailers to expand disposal options.

For example:\nCFLs perform best in open fixtures that allow airflow, such as table and floor lamps, wall sconces, pendants, and outdoor fixtures.\nFor recessed fixtures, it is better to use a reflector CFL than a spiral CFL since the design of the reflector evenly distributes the light down to your task area.\nIf a light fixture is connected to a dimmer or three-way socket fixture, you\u2019ll need to use a special ENERGY STAR qualified CFL designed to work in these applications. Make sure to look for CFLs that specify use with dimmers or three-way fixtures.\nChoose a qualified CFL that offers a shade of white light that works best for you . For example, while most CFLs provide warm or soft white light for your home, you could choose a cooler color for task lighting.\nTo choose the ENERGY STAR qualified CFL with the right amount of light, find a qualified CFL that is labeled as equivalent to the incandescent bulb you are replacing. Light bulb manufacturers include this information right on the product packaging to make it easy for consumers to choose the equivalent bulb. Common terms include \u201cSoft White 60\u201d or \u201c60 Watt Replacement.\u201d\nYou should also check the lumen rating to find the right CFL. The higher the lumen rating, the greater the light output. Consult the following chart to determine what CFL wattage is best to replace your incandescent light bulb:\nProper Disposal\nSwitching to CFLs is a simple way you can help lower your energy use at home and help to prevent greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, if every home in America replaced just one incandescent light bulb with an ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified CFL, it would save enough energy to light more than 3 million homes and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those of more than 800,000 cars annually.\nWhat makes these bulbs use 2/3 less energy than a traditional bulb is a small amount of mercury\u2014an average of 5 milligrams, which is roughly equivalent to an amount that would cover the tip of a ball-point pen. By comparison, older thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury. No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact or in use, and the energy efficiency of CFLs actually presents an opportunity to reduce mercury emissions. However, proper disposal or recycling of these bulbs can result in even more environmentally friendly energy savings.\nMore information on clean up and proper disposal of CFLs from ENERGY STAR and the Environmental Protection Agency\nRecycling\nUnited Power offers free recycling of household compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFL) in our offices.

It has infuriated conservatives who see the restriction as an infringement on their right to chose how they light their homes and businesses.\n\u201cCongress should not be picking winners and losers, allowing big corporate donors to dictate what consumer products we can and can\u2019t buy!\u201d the conservative Eagle Forum wrote in a recent action alert to supporters. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take a stand to save our light bulbs, what will they go after next?\u201d\nAdvocates for the phase-out explain that not only will new energy standards increase efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, they have already led to greater innovation.\n\u201cSince the standards were passed, we have seen more innovation in the lighting space in the past three years than we have in the last 125, when the first incandescent was invented,\u201d Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist in the National Resource Defense Council\u2019s energy program pointed out . \u201cDue to the standards, consumers will now have access to incandescent bulbs that use at least 28 percent less power than the older bulbs, as well as many other energy savings choices including compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) that save even more and last a lot longer too.\u201d\nThe new incandescents, however, are more expensive than the traditional Edison bulb and while there are alternatives, people already are stocking up on 100-watt incandescents.\nHoward Segermark, president of a government relations consulting company on Capitol Hill, explained to The Daily Caller that he has started to stock-pile incandescent 100-watt light bulbs due to the coming limits and incandescents\u2019 current cost.\n\u201cI was in Home Depot and they\u2019ve got a great sale on them,\u201d he told TheDC. \u201cI bought another dozen.\u201d\nSegermark added that he does not like the government telling him what kind of light bulb he should be using.\n\u201cThe arrogance of a government that tells you what size light bulbs to use is like Nixon imposing wage and price controls while devaluing the dollar; like FDR claiming to eliminate \u2018want;\u2019 like King Canute demanding the tide to stop,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThey all try to ignore the way the world works.\u201d\nIn July House Republicans attempted to repeal provisions of the 2007 law dealing with the efficiency mandates with the \u201cBetter Use of Light Bulb (BULB) Act,\u201d sponsored by Texas Republican Rep.

Using long-lasting, energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs seems like a good idea. Right?\nNot so fast.\nThis week the US House of Representatives considered a measure to repeal the new efficiency standards for light bulbs that were scheduled to become law in early 2012.\nIn 2007 an energy bill advocating new efficiency standards for light bulbs was passed with broad Republican support and signed into law by President George Bush. The logic behind this law was that the incandescent light bulb, a mid- to late-19th century invention, while revolutionary at the time, has one basic flaw, it is a very inefficient way to generate light, with as much as 90% of the energy created being emitted as heat. The 2007 law called for essentially phasing out traditional bulbs in favor of the more energy efficient fluorescent bulbs.\nIn James Broder\u2019s New York Times article on this subject, he cites James Haworth, chief executive of Lighting Science Group , \u201cLighting is the low-hanging fruit in reducing energy consumption: it accounts for 19% of the world\u2019s energy use. There are 4.4 billion traditional light sockets in the United States alone offering a rapid and practical path for billions of dollars in energy savings through the installation of more efficient lighting.\u201d\nSounds like a great way for companies and individuals and the country to save on energy costs. No?\nI won\u2019t go into details of how politics has trumped good science and common sense on this issue, but it seems that a mix of states\u2019 rights, individual freedom advocacy, mistrust of new technology, fear about mercury releases (from broken fluorescent bulbs), and the higher initial purchase costs of the new bulbs, have conspired in an attempt to trump the 2007 law.\nIn July, Texas passed a law that allows for the continued manufacture and sale of incandescent light bulbs in Texas. Any bulb with \u201cMade in Texas\u201d on it would not be subject to federal law. (According to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article ,\u00a0a GE spokesperson\u00a0is troubled by\u00a0the idea of state-by-state legislation on bulbs, \u201cThat could create a patchwork of inconsistent standards across the nation that would mean increased manufacturing and distribution costs, higher prices for consumers and lost sales for retailers.\u201d)\nHowever, there may be also rational solution. Osram Sylvania , a popular maker of incandescent light bulbs, has developed a more efficient incandescent bulb called the Sylvania SuperSaver that will meet the new federal requirements.\nLess heat, more light.\nLet there be light.\nUpdate: On Tuesday evening (7/12/11) the \u201cBetter Use of Light Bulbs Act\u201d failed to\u00a0get the two-thirds majority it needed for passage.

Despite the fact that it was invented over one hundred years ago, the principle behind the design is still the same today as it was then.\nThe incandescent light bulb is a glass bulb with a metal wire inside. When the power is on the light, of course, turns on. But what probably isn\u2019t as obvious is the fact that the electricity that turns the light on isn\u2019t directly producing the light. Instead, when power runs through the thin wire it encounters resistance. In overcoming this resistance heat is produced. In fact so much heat is produced that the filament glows white hot \u2013 the light that you can see.\nTo be practical the typical light bulb has to be able to last at least a few days. Therefore, a good filament must be chosen. The first practical light invented by Edison used a carbonized cotton thread filament which lasted about thirteen hours and thirty minutes. After more experimenting, Edison found that carbonized bamboo was a better choice. Even though bamboo still lasted a very short amount of time by today\u2019s standards, people back then were quite content with it. In about 1904 the robust tungsten filament incorporated in today\u2019s bulbs was introduced.\nThe material of the filament is not the only factor that affects the bulb\u2019s life. The surrounding space is important too. Edison discovered that to make a light bulb filament last longer it has to be in a vacuum, otherwise the filament will burn out quickly as the air oxidizes the filament at high temperature. Hence, the glass bulb\u2019s function is not solely for the protection of the materials inside and the user outside, but also to hold the required vacuum. Today certain gases, such as krypton or argon, are sometimes used to extend the life of the filament by preventing it from vaporizing quickly from its own heat.\nThe incandescent light bulb originally invented by Edison, hasn\u2019t changed much over the years and remains a very practical way to produce light. However, as the more efficient (using less power to produce the same amount of light) fluorescent bulbs begin to replace it, it is quite possible that the incandescent light bulb will become a thing of the past.\nFurther Reading\nHow Light Bulbs Work : Illustrated explanation and interesting experiment not to be tried at home \u2013 light bulbs in a microwave!\n"}, {"score": 2360.8328, "uuid": "7a145b48-fc84-50ab-b371-d4cd84683b45", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1117wb-87-20154", "target_hostname": "www.houselogic.com", "target_uri": "http://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/lighting/end-incandescence/", "page_rank": 1.2325538e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Incandescent</em> <em>Lights</em> Coming to an End | End Of <em>Incandescent</em> <em>Bulbs</em>", "snippet": "The means Edison\u2019s classic <em>incandescent</em> <em>is</em> giving way to more environmentally friendly <em>bulbs</em>, like compact <em>fluorescents</em> (CFLs), and LEDs, <em>which</em> lower energy costs up to 75%.", "explanation": null, "document": "Linkedin\nThe average incandescent bulb lasts 1,000 hours, while the average CFL has a life span of 10,000 hours.

All the elements of our modern light bulb. Still to come were the internal frosting, the coiled coil filament and major improvements in efficiency. However, we have now passed the age of the gentleman inventor, the First World War caused major social upheavals in throughout the world. Trade unions had gained greatly in their strength and the working classes were demanding better conditions. The industrialists, tooled for war, needed to re-direct their machinery to peace time uses. The light bulb and cheap electricity were ripe for development into this new technological age. The sophistication of manufacture was going to see rapid improvement. Immediately after the war most light bulbs were still hand-blown and the increase in demand was starting to put a great strain on the skilled glass-blowers. The speed of change needed required huge expenditure and the lone worker could no longer compete, although individuals continued to contribute greatly. Most of the developments in lighting were now being made by big businesses and while individual names are often linked to important developments they were mostly employed by the companies. For the study of light bulbs this period is fascinating as the old and new technologies often overlapped, carbon filament bulbs were still being produced for their heating properties. Frustratingly, frosting makes it impossible to see inside and examine the construction but most types were and still are made in clear versions. Of particular interest in this period was the sheer variety of special purpose lighting that was developed as the uses for electric lighting became more diverse. Perhaps the biggest leap is the development of electro-luminescent materials, although their use was largely restricted to industrial equipment and photocopiers. The micro-chip is also developing with light, microscopic light sources sending signals via fibre-optic paths instead of electricity.\nW. Fenton and J. Ridington of the USA patented a dipping car headlamp bulb in 1924. In 1937 the sealed beam headlamp was introduced in the USA.\nInternal frosting of bulbs was introduced in 1925. Before this bulbs had been either acid etched or sandblasted on the outside if a frosted effect was wanted.\nIn the United Kingdom the Electricity Supply Act of 1926 established a Central Electricity Board. This body was given the power to control the distribution of electricity and allowed a standard voltage and frequency of AC Electricity. By establishing the National Grid it was able to provide a unified distribution for the whole country. A standard frequency, the number of times that the polarity reverses, of fifty cycles per second was chosen for the UK. The USA chose a frequency of sixty cycles for its power supplies at 115 volts.\nConstruction of the British National Grid commenced in 1927 and was virtually completed by 1935 the first section opened in 1929.\nThe coiled-coil filament was developed in the USA in 1934. The extremely fine tungsten filament being coiled and then the coil coiled again, this trapped the gas in the coils creating a brighter and more energy efficient light.\nBy 1938 65% of British homes were connected to the mains electricity supply. This figure rose to 96% by 1961.\nVery high power incandescent bulbs were developed for lighthouse use from 1922. Xenon filled lamps were developed in 1947. Used in lighthouses they increased the effective range to 20 miles.\nIn the 1950\u2019s Siemens & Osram developed Metal-Halide lamps which gave a five times increase in light output for no power increase over tungsten. These lamps came into popular use after their use at the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. In 1973 they introduced the LUMILUX fluorescent lamp giving more light for 10% less power! When in 1978 Siemens took full control over Osram they were the world\u2019s fourth largest lamp manufacturer. The Osram CIRCOLUX bulb of 1980 is a fluorescent tube in a bulb giving the equivalent of 75 Watts for 25 Watts of power.\nLumalampen AB was set up in Sweden in 1929 and opened a factory in Stockholm to manufacture LUMA bulbs. Since 1936 they have produced their own tungsten from Swedish ore. They began to manufacture fluorescent lights in 1943. They moved to Karlskrona in 1970 and are now the only lamp manufacturer in Sweden.\nUseful electric power was first produced by a nuclear reactor in America in 1950 but the first nuclear power station for commercial use was opened at Calder Hall, England, in 1956.\nIn 1951 the British company G.E.C.\u2019s catalogue contained a wide variety of lamps many of which were for very specialised uses under the Osram marque. For mine use there were Krypton filled bulbs giving a 20% increase in light output for no power increase. For the film studio there was a \u20182 kW Compact Source Colour Corrected Lamp\u2019 which was a high pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp and was advertised as a replacement for carbon arc lamps. Colour correction was achieved by adding Cadmium vapour, they had an external pip and they cost \u00a340 each. They also still sold at \u00a32 each the \u2018Robertson\u2019 Carbon Filament Radiator bulb, used as the heating element in a type of electric heater, \u2018The Dowsing Radiator\u2019, developed in 1912. Standard Osram bulbs were available from 15 to 1,500 Watts for voltages from 25v to 260v gasfilled and vacuum bulbs for 15 and 25 Watts for the same range of voltages.\nA high pressure sodium lamp giving a golden white light was developed in 1957.\nThe laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) beam was invented in 1960 by American T. H. Maiman (b. 1927). As yet of little use in the home, except for CD players, they were first used by Siemens for stage lighting effects at the Munich Opera festival in 1970. It is used for communications by glass fibre cables, building alignment, machining in manufacture and very fast computer printers. The laser beam is an intensely concentrated beam of coherent light.\nIn 1961 the Quartz-iodine bulb was developed. Thorn Lighting developed compact source iodide (CSI) lamps in 1969. In 1981 Thorn introduced the 2D lamp producing 100 Watt equivalent light output for 20 Watts of power, it is a fluorescent tube folded up into a bulb which contains all the driving circuitry. It has a design life of 5,000 hrs and is priced to give a small economy over tungsten bulbs. Very recently versions have appeared that contain all the circuitry in an almost standard sized bulb with standard fittings.\nThe newer developments have little to do with the incandescent filament. Perhaps in the future it will vanish completely. Maybe someone will make a radical new development. Whichever way the lightbulb develops it will continue to be taken for granted in use. The early lightbulbs are now sought after by collectors and will be around for longer than most modern bulbs. Bulbs from 1890 onwards are fairly easy to obtain and many of them are very attractive objects in themselves.\n"}, {"score": 2282.9006, "uuid": "0e44651e-629a-5689-8bbf-38c595161058", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000wb-01-03165", "target_hostname": "www.mccoys.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mccoys.com/building-science-library/go-build-something/compact-fluorescents-or-led-bulbs-which-is-the-greener-choice", "page_rank": 1.1715424e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Compact <em>fluorescents</em> <em>or</em> LED <em>bulbs</em>: <em>Which</em> <em>is</em> the greener choice?", "snippet": ". * Exact Match Redirect OFF: Always show all search results (do not redirect) Home \u00bb Building Science Library \u00bb Go Build Something \u00bb Compact <em>fluorescents</em> <em>or</em> LED <em>bulbs</em>: <em>Which</em> <em>is</em> the greener choice?

These can use as little as 10% of the energy used by an incandescent, while lasting as much as ten times longer. You save on the cost of energy, and cut your maintenance costs as well.\nWhile there are many energy efficient lamps (bulbs) designed to fit the same fixtures as old-fashioned options, some new technologies require their own fixtures (or are built into the fixture). Consider the options for replacing the fixture instead of just the bulb to achieve your best savings and quality of light overall. Remember that the most common incandescent bulbs will be phased out during 2011 and 2012, making this a good time to rethink lighting systems.\nAffordability\nEfficient lamps usually cost more upfront than incandescents (i.e. from $3 to $10 for a compact fluorescent lamp), although prices continue to drop as more models and technologies enter the market. The shift away from incandescent technology has opened up many innovations; it\u2019s worth comparing prices, models, and lighting quality. Despite a higher price, efficient lamps boast remarkably longer service lives than incandescents, making their lifetime cost comparable or superior to old-fashioned lamps.\nCost savings\nA CFL operating during typical business hours, totaling 2,500 hours or more per year, will pay for itself in less than 12 months through reduced energy costs, then save you money for the next seven to nine years. In addition, many lighting technologies qualify for incentives under BC Hydro\u2019s Product Incentive Program , cutting the initial cost of switching.\nEnvironmental considerations\nThe energy savings from replacing incandescent bulbs with CFLs reduces greenhouse gas emissions from gas-fired or coal energy sources and lessens the need for new energy generation facilities. In addition, CFLs last eight to ten times longer than standard incandescents, so there is less material and manufacturing required and fewer spent bulbs in landfills.\nWhat you need to know\nCompact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)\nCFLs are the \u201ccurly bulbs\u201d that are currently the most common replacement for use directly in standard incandescent lamp sockets. CFLs are easy on the eyes; they cycle much faster than old tube fluorescents, so there is no perceptible flicker. They\u2019re available in a range of colour temperatures from soft white \"warm\" light tones similar to an incandescent to cooler blue tones for reading. Read more about colour temperature below.\nToday's compact fluorescent light manufacturers offer a wide variety of CFLs that deliver on light quality and convenience as well as energy savings \u2013 usually about 75% better than incandescents. Always look for the ENERGY STAR\u00ae label, which identifies products that have been tested to meet operating, reliability and energy efficiency criteria.\nCFLs are more expensive than incandescents, but replacing a 100-watt incandescent with a 25-watt CFL, for example, will save approximately $30 in electricity over the life of the CFL lamp.\nMany CFLs are designed to illuminate slowly to preserve the long life of the lamp. In settings where light is needed to switch on and off quickly (i.e. a supply cabinet) they may not be the best energy-efficient option and may prove frustrating to users.\nCFL products come with and without reflectors. Non-reflectorized lamps are usually used in table lamps, floor lamps and other fixtures designed to put out diffuse light. Reflectorized lamps provide a more directional light. CFLs may also be covered in various ways to mimic standard incandescent lamp shapes, such as A-lamps and PAR lamps.\nCFLs come in a range of power ratings, from 5 to 28 watts in screw-in versions and up to 55 watts in hardwired models. Manufacturers often claim that the lamps produce light output equal to a certain wattage incandescent; however, these ratings must be viewed with caution, since there are no formal standards for making such claims. One manufacturer's 18-watt product might be labeled as equivalent to a 60-watt incandescent, while a similar product from another vendor might be labeled as a 75-watt equivalent. As a rough guide, a 3:1 ratio, incandescent to CFL wattage, yields equivalent light output.\nCFLs last about eight times as long as incandescents \u2013 expect to replace them only every five to six years. Choose a bulb that best suits the situation; it will not burn out soon!\nNot all CFLs are dimmable. If you are buying for a fixture with dimming feature, ensure you buy a bulb that can dim.\nRead more about CFLs.\nLight-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)\nAn LED lamp clusters multiple light-emitting diodes together to produce an effective source of light. They are highly efficient, using at least 75% less energy than incandescent lighting. They are also very durable, lasting a minimum of 25,000 hours, or 22 years based on average household use (approximately 35-50 times longer than an incandescent and about two to five times longer than CFLs.) Because of their efficiency and long life, they are being rapidly adopted in a variety of commercial and institutional applications, such as traffic lights, marquee lighting , restaurant and retail lighting.\nLEDs produce directional light, making them ideal when focused light is required. This also means that although there are a number of LED replacements for standard incandescent lamps (which emit light in all directions), the technology is still evolving and there are not direct replacements for all incandescent forms.\nCompared to CFLs, LEDs provide more sparkle, making them preferable for some retail and decorative settings. They produce very efficient coloured light, and are the primary recommendation for holiday lighting . LEDs come on instantly when switched on. Dimmable products do not flicker.\nBecause of their technology, LEDs are often most effectively implemented in purpose-designed luminaires (fixtures) rather than as a replacement lamp within fixture designed for incandescents. LED luminaires are emerging for a wide variety of applications and offer significant energy reductions over incandescents. LED fixtures come with a minimum three-year warranty \u2014 far beyond the industry standard.\nLEDs are recommended for use in Exit signs , which must remain on at all times \u2013 producing great savings in efficiency and maintenance costs.\nFluorescent tube lighting\nLong favoured for general overhead room lighting, full-size fluorescent (not compact) tube lighting is one of the most common types in use \u2013 and the most efficient. However, new tubes and ballast systems are increasing efficiency levels and are subject to Power Smart incentives .\nBallasts \u2013 which convert current line current to the proper voltage \u2013 for fluorescent tube systems are also increasing in efficiency and come in various models. Ballasts can be the most expensive aspect of a lighting retrofit but are subject to incentives that help reduce the upfront cost.\nMix overhead fluorescent lighting with daylighting controls and appropriate task lighting for an energy efficient mix.\nCold cathode, metal halide, high pressure sodium, halogen and more\nLighting technology is evolving more rapidly now than it has in a generation. There are new options for both lamps and luminaires best suited to specific applications, with improvements emerging regularly. Consult a professional lighting designer who is knowledgeable about energy efficiency to ensure you get the best mix of efficiency and light quality for your company\u2019s needs.\nRead more about HID lamps and track lights; and HID vs. fluorescent for high-bay lighting.\nColour temperature\nColour temperature refers to the shade of white light, identified by correlated colour temperature (CCT) and measured by Kelvin (K). Warmer colours correspond to lower Kelvin numbers, while higher Kelvin numbers indicate a cooler, bluer light.\nThe majority of CFLs on the market are 2700-3000 K and project soft white or \"warm\" light. These bulbs enhance warm colours (red, yellow and orange) found in the home.\nBulbs with a slightly higher K rating (up to 3500 K) can be optimal for reading, but as that K rating increases (to 4100, 5000 and 6500K) the effect is increasingly white to bluish light that enhances cooler colours (blue, green, violet). The higher K-rated lights are often referred to as \"daylight\".\nYou may also see some bulbs labeled by a CRI (colour rendition index), which indicates how true colours appear under a light. Bulbs with a CRI rating of 60 to 80 are suitable for offices, classrooms and supermarkets, but all Energy Star rated CFLs have a CRI rating of at least 80 and are better for home, retail, restaurant and lobby use.\nFAQ\nSince there is mercury in CFLs, is it more environmentally responsible to use incandescent bulbs?\nMost CFLs contain less than 4mg of mercury, which is about one-fifth found in the average watch battery and less than 100th found in a typical amalgam dental filling. There are new bulbs on market with lower mercury levels, currently down as low as 1.4-2.5 mg per bulb.\nCFLs can actually reduce mercury levels in the environment by decreasing energy use, particularly coal-fired energy generation, which is one of the largest mercury producers in Canada.\nAlthough most of our energy in British Columbia comes from hydropower, we do import energy from other sources, including coal. When we reduce our energy use in B.C., the savings come out of the imported energy. Therefore, using CFLs reduces our contribution to greenhouse gases, energy consumption and mercury production.\nHowever, it is critical to dispose of CFLs properly to ensure that mercury does not build up in the environment and damage our ecosystems. Find out how to recycle CFLs in your area.\nIs the mercury contained in a CFL bad for my health?\nThe mercury that CFLs contain will not cause health or environmental issues while inside the tubes. It can only become a problem when you discard the tubes. Mercury in the environment is known to have adverse effects on fish, humans and other animals. To keep mercury from becoming a concern, always dispose of CFLs properly. Read the disposal information in this tip for more information and look for a CFL recycler near you .\nWhat if I break a CFL?\nIf you break a CFL:\nOpen a window if possible and vacate the area for 15 minutes.\nUse a wet rag to clean it up and put all of the pieces and the rag, into a sealed plastic bag or jar with a lid. Place all materials in a second sealed plastic bag.\nContact your local recycling center to see if they accept this material.\nWash your hands.\nHow do I dispose of a CFL?\nBecause they contain mercury, CFLs should never be sent to an incinerator, which would disperse the mercury into the atmosphere. Neither should they be disposed of in regular solid waste, where they would break. Save spent CFLs and take them to a qualified CFL recycler. (Due to their long life, you will have far fewer used CFLs than you are accustomed to with incandescent bulbs.)

They are four times more efficient and last up to 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. So you\u2019ll purchase fewer bulbs and use less energy. How much less? Over its lifetime, a single CFL could save you about $30 in energy-bill savings. Imagine how that will add up when you change more than one bulb.\nGood for the Environment\nIn addition to the cost-saving benefits, using CFLs where appropriate is better for the environment. Each CFL prevents more than 450 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions over its lifetime. That's the equivalent of saving more than 210 pounds of coal from being burned. And if every American home replaced their five most frequently used lights, or the bulbs in them, with ones that have earned the ENERGY STAR\u00ae, we would prevent the greenhouse gases equivalent to the emissions from more than 8 million cars.\nWhen to Choose a CFL\nCompact fluorescents work best in fixtures that will be used consistently for four or more hours per day. They work both indoors and outdoors and can be purchased where most other light bulbs are sold. CFLs do contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing, therefore used CFLs should be disposed of properly. Click here to learn more .\nChange a light, Change the world.

However, there <em>is</em> no agreed upon standard for equivalencies.", "explanation": null, "document": "Spiral Compact Fluorescent F.A.Q.\nQ: How do spiral compact fluorescent light bulbs save energy?\nA: A standard incandescent light bulb produces light by heating a filament inside the bulb. Only a small amount of the energy used to operate a standard light bulb is turned into light, most is wasted as heat. A standard incandescent only produces around 15 lumens of light per input watt. On the other hand, spiral compact fluorescent light bulbs produce 50-100 lumens per input watt. Thus, 13 watt spiral compact fluorescents produce as much light as a standard 60 watt incandescent light bulb (over 75% less electricity for the same amount of light).\nSpiral shape light bulbs will also save energy by producing less ambient heat than standard incandescents. Thus, your air conditioner won't have to work as hard.\nQ: I don't like the color of fluorescent light, are there any spiral compact fluorescents that produce similar light to incandescent light bulbs?\nA: Yes! Spiral CFL light bulbs are now available in a wide range of color temperatures (measured in degrees Kelvin [K]). The color of light a spring lamp produces is determined by the phosphors lining the glass portion of the spiral shape light bulb. The phosphors can be manipulated to mimic virtually any light source. The light produced by spiral compact fluorescents with a color temperature of 2700K-2850K is virtually indistinguishable from the light of incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescent spirals also come in colors that replicate halogen, traditional fluorescent, and full-spectrum light sources.\nQ: Which wattage of spiral cfl light bulb should I buy to replace my current light bulb?\nA: The manufacturers of most spiral CFLs rate their bulbs for incandescent equivalency. However, there is no agreed upon standard for equivalencies. Thus, not all 60 watt equivalent spiral compact fluorescents have equal light output. A better measure for comparing relative light output of spiral CFLs is 'Lumen Output'. A spiral CFL light bulb's lumen output is an actual, objective, measurement of light output.\nQ: Can spiral compact fluorescents be used with dimmers?\nA: Only spiral CFLs designed specifically for use with dimmers may be used with dimmer switches. A standard spring lamp will not operate correctly on a dimmer switch, and the spiral CFL light bulb will fail quickly. Use of non-dimming spiral CFLs on dimmer switches will void all warranties.\nWe are often asked if non-dimming spiral compact fluorescents may be used with dimmers if the dimmer is never dimmed. Theoretically, a dimmer always left at full power should not harm your spiral CFL light bulbs, however even slight or accidental dimming will do substantial damage to non-dimming spiral compact fluorescents.\nQ: My fixture is rated for a 75 watt maximum bulb. Can I use spiral CFL light bulbs that has an incandescent equivalency higher than 75 watts?\nA: Yes. When choosing a spiral compact fluorescent only the actual wattage needs to be considered. In the above example spiral compact fluorescents up to 75 watts may be used. Spring lamps are perfect for applications where more light is desired than a fixture's rating will permit.\nQ: Are spiral CFLs available with candelabra bases?\nA: Yes. Spiral compact fluorescents are available in candelabra base, medium (standard) base, and mogul base. Spiral shape fluorescents may also be found with 4-pin bases and GU24 bases.\nQ: Can spiral CFL light bulbs be used outside and in cold weather?\nA: Spiral compact fluorescents may be used outdoors as long as they are not directly exposed to the elements. We carry enclosed CFLs designed specifically for direct exposure to weather. Spiral compact fluorescents are ideal for coach lights or under eaves.\nWhen choosing a spiral CFL for use in cold weather, be sure to look at the minimum starting temperature of the spiral compact fluorescent. Most of the spiral CFLs we carry will start at ambient temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit. With all spiral compact fluorescents, the colder the temperature the longer it will take for your spiral CFL to reach full brightness.\nQ: Do compact fluorescent spirals make a buzzing sound?\nA: Older fluorescent technology utilized magnetic ballasts that would often times emit a buzzing sound that was irritating to some people. Modern fluorescents, including spiral compact fluorescents, use an electronic ballast that is not only more efficient but cycles at a rate that eliminates buzzing. A properly functioning spring lamp should operate silently. If your compact fluorescent spiral is buzzing then there is a problem with you spring lamp, the socket, and/or the wiring.\nQ: Do compact fluorescent spirals flicker?\nA: As with the problem of buzzing, the electronic ballasts used in compact fluorescent spirals have eliminated the flicker associated with fluorescent lighting. The most common cause of flickering with spiral compact fluorescents is using non-dimming spiral CFLs on a dimming circuit. In any case, if your compact fluorescent spiral is flickering then there is a problem with you spring lamp, the socket, and/or the wiring.\nQ: Are spiral compact fluorescents available for my 3-way floor lamps?\nA: Yes. We stock spiral CFL light bulbs that work with 3-way switches. These spiral CFLs offer 3 distinct light levels, but be careful of their size. 3-way compact fluorescent spirals are wider and taller than incandescent 3-way bulbs, so make sure you have room in your fixture. Our product line includes 3-way compact fluorescent spirals in 5100K, a color temperature many people prefer for reading, sewing, or any activity requiring high levels of visual acuity.\nQ: How long should spiral compact fluorescents last?\nA: Compact fluorescent spirals range is rated life from between 6,000 to 10,000 hours. Most of the spiral CFLs we carry are rated for 10,000 hours. The life of spiral compact fluorescents, for the most part, is determined by the quality of the ballast. Cheap spiral CFLs, both in price and quality, often have an inferior ballast. Also, keep in mind that the life rating is an average. Half of all bulbs will last longer than the rated life but half will not reach the rated life. All quality spiral CFLs are warrantied by the manufacturer.\nQ: Is there mercury in spiral compact fluorescents?\nA: Mercury is essential to the operation of spiral CFLs. It is the mercury that excites phosphors in spiral CFLs, causing them to glow and give light. The amount of mercury in most spiral compact fluorescents is less than 5 milligrams (most of our spiral CFLs contain around 3 mg), roughly the amount required to cover the tip of a ballpoint pen. By comparison, older home thermometers contain 500 milligrams of mercury and many manual thermostats contain up to 3000 milligrams. It would take between 100 and 600 spiral CFLs to equal those amounts.\nSpiral CFLs are responsible for less mercury entering the atmosphere than standard incandescent light bulbs, and spiral CFLs actually work to prevent mercury from entering our air, where it most affects our health. The leading source of mercury in our air comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal, the most commonly used fuel in the U.S. to produce electricity. Spiral compact fluorescents use 75% less energy than an incandescent light bulb and lasts up to 13 times longer. A power plant will emit 10 mg of mercury to produce the electricity to run an incandescent bulb compared to only 2.4 mg of mercury to run compact fluorescent spirals for the same amount of time.\nIt is also important to remember that spiral CFL light bulbs release NO mercury when the bulbs are in use.\n\u0095 Free Shipping on orders over $100 \u0095 Shipping & Handling Only $8.90 for most orders \u0095\n\u0095 4 Foot Lamps & Ballasts require additional charge of $4.00 \u0095 SLA Batteries may require additional charge \u0095\n"}, {"score": 2142.3872, "uuid": "815a1d52-49f0-578e-b308-a2ff05ba373b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1705wb-25-06896", "target_hostname": "www.politifact.com", "target_uri": "http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/492/phase-out-incandescent-light-bulbs/", "page_rank": 1.3558985e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "PolitiFact | The Obameter: Phase out <em>incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>", "snippet": "The standards themselves, <em>which</em> were developed later, include several exceptions for <em>incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>, including three-way <em>bulbs</em>, colored <em>lights</em>, bug <em>lights</em> <em>or</em> plant <em>lights</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nPhase out incandescent light bulbs\n\"I will immediately sign a law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs - a measure that will save American consumers $6 billion a year on their electric bills.\"\nObama makes light bulbs more energy efficient\nUpdated: Wednesday, July 1st, 2009 | By Catharine Richert\nLight bulbs beware: President Barack Obama has announced major changes in lighting standards that advocates say will effectively phase out the least efficient bulbs.\n\"One of the fastest, easiest and cheapest ways to make our economy stronger and cleaner is to make our economy more energy efficient,\u201d said Obama in a June 29, 2009, announcement that fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps (think track lighting in your kitchen) will become more efficient starting in 2012.\nThe administration says that these changes will reduce carbon emissions by 594 million tons between 2012 and 2042 and save consumers $1 billion to $4 billion in the same amount of time.\nThe announcement reflects this promise Obama made on the campaign trail:\n\"I will immediately sign a law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs \u2014 a measure that will save American consumers $6 billion a year on their electric bills,\" Obama said in an Oct. 7, 2007 speech on energy efficiency.\nWe already rated this promise as No Action because, as far was we could tell, there was no bill in Congress to phase out all incandescents, and therefore no law for Obama to sign. At the time, advocates of new efficiency standards told us that Obama would have been better off saying he would get rid of the least efficient bulbs, not all incandescent bulbs.\nAs part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, traditional pear-shaped incandescents are already on track to become more efficient. Obama's effort extends those rules to conventional incandescent reflector lamps, the cone-shaped bulbs most commonly used in recessed lights and track lighting. Other incandescents, like some used to illuminate driveways or sidewalks, will remain on the market.\nWe asked Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, whether the new rules represented some sort of political compromise.\n\"No, I don't think it does,\" he said. \"It takes a significant step towards getting the rest\" of the inefficient bulbs that weren't included in the 2007 law, he said. \"We're getting incandescents down to a small level.\"\nThe new efficiency rules represent the biggest energy-saving effort ever announced by the Department of Energy, Nadel added.\nBack in March when we first wrote about the light bulb promise, we struggled with how to rate it, and we still are struggling. Obama is not trying to take all incandescents off the market, but he is trying to make most of them more efficient \u2014 and energy efficiency advocates say that's a big step. In 2007, however, it seems Obama had more ambitious plans for light bulbs. Maybe Obama backpedaled or maybe he spoke carelessly; either way it's not a Promise Kept. As a result, we rate this one a Compromise, not because of any clear indication that Obama had to backtrack from his original position to broker a deal, but because it's the most accurate measurement we have to gauge the progress he's made on the issue, even if it's not what he originally promised.\nSources:\n"}], [{"score": 2137.5833, "uuid": "1d4a3df1-a7ac-55bf-838a-7fdb0177b39d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0604wb-21-20545", "target_hostname": "www.terrapass.com", "target_uri": "http://www.terrapass.com/blog/posts/incandescent-bulbs-may-mount-a-comeback", "page_rank": 1.1734718e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>,", "snippet": "As technology races forward, <em>is</em> it time for an I-told-you-so on the \u201c<em>bulb</em> ban\u201d?

Although the current generation of bulbs will effectively be banned under the lighting efficiency standard passed, we learn via the New York Times that a research team has roughly doubled the efficiency of regular light bulbs by blasting the filaments with a laser :\nThe key to creating the super-filament is an ultra-brief, ultra-intense beam of light called a femtosecond laser pulse. The laser burst lasts only a few quadrillionths of a second. To get a grasp of that kind of speed, consider that a femtosecond is to a second what a second is to about 32 million years. During its brief burst, Guo\u2019s laser unleashes as much power as the entire grid of North America onto a spot the size of a needle point. That intense blast forces the surface of the metal to form nanostructures and microstructures that dramatically alter how efficiently can radiate from the filament.\nThe laser sounds like it requires a lot of energy, but it doesn\u2019t \u2014 it can be powered by a standard wall outlet. The research team believes that, once refined, the technique should be fairly simple to integrate into current manufacturing processes.\nMeanwhile, a research team at Deposition Sciences has also been able to double the output of incandescents by coating them with a material that converts waste heat into visible light. It\u2019s possible that combining the two techniques, along with a variety of other advances coming out of labs, could extend the reign of Thomas Edison\u2019s most famous invention by at least a few more years. The lighting efficiency standard only requires a 30% efficiency improvement by 2014 and a 70% improvement by 2020, benchmarks that seem well within striking distance for improved incandescents.\nBut even these improvements may not be enough to protect old-school bulbs from their new-fangled rivals. LEDs are getting better so quickly, and offer so many advantages over other forms of lighting, that they\u2019re already proving popular in large-scale applications like street lighting and other specialized circumstances despite their hefty price tag. (Fun fact of the day: because LEDs don\u2019t emit ultraviolet radiation, they don\u2019t attract bugs.)\nWhich is all to the good. I don\u2019t know which of these technologies will prevail, but at this point I feel pretty confident that we can count on the lighting efficiency standard to knock a few percentage points off the national carbon footprint at a very low price per ton.\nTake a minute, now, to recall some of the hysterics we were treated to when the standard was approved at the end of 2007. I distinctly remember being lectured that environmentalists didn\u2019t grasp the nature of technological progress; that the lighting efficiency standard was an assault on fundamental freedoms that would put us on a slippery slope to one-world government; that the law of unintended consequences virtually guaranteed that we\u2019d all be dead from mercury poisoning within a year. This was often from people who professed to be concerned about climate change. But actually doing something about it? Well, that was a bridge too far.\nIt\u2019s probably a bit early for an I-told-you so, but at this point it appears the efficiency standard is working as advertised. By guaranteeing a market and helping to correct some incentive misalignments, the lighting efficiency standard is unlocking technological innovations that will benefit the environment at low or no cost to society. Ultimately, there\u2019s only so far efficiency standards can take us. But they are another tool in the kit, and we may as well pluck whatever low-hanging fruit are available in the fight against climate change.\n"}, {"score": 2105.9397, "uuid": "b61abb6d-a506-54e5-945d-82877ef9a544", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0603wb-82-12095", "target_hostname": "www.terrapass.com", "target_uri": "http://www.terrapass.com/blog/posts/efficient-incandescent-light-bulbs-available-now", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Efficient <em>incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>: available now - | TerraPass: Fight", "snippet": "The reason <em>is</em> simple, <em>fluorescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>is</em> colder to the eye, therefore less like sunlight. <em>Incandescents</em> are warmer and &quot;feel&quot; <em>better</em> to people.

With lighting consuming approximately 22 percent of all electricity in the U.S., the potential for energy savings and energy conservation that the country\u2014and the world\u2014can realize with this change to higher-technology light sources is immense. American businesses and consumers will annually save billions of dollars in electricity bills once the transition is complete,\u201d Pitsor said.\nEISA lighting provisions set phased-in, performance-based, technology-neutral standards, starting in 2011 in California, and nationally between 2012 and 2014. The new standards will continue to provide consumers with a choice of energy-efficient lighting products to meet their needs including high-efficiency halogen (advanced technology incandescent), compact fluorescent (CFLs), and new light-emitting diode (LED) solid state products.\nThe first product to be affected is today\u2019s 100-watt incandescent bulb. Beginning on January 1, 2012, manufacturers are required to produce bulbs that meet the EISA 2007 minimum efficiency requirements that result in nearly a 30 percent improvement in efficiency while providing about the same amount of light (lumens) as today\u2019s 100-watt bulb. The new bulbs will also last longer than today\u2019s 100-watt bulb.\nOver the course of two years, similar changes will take place for 75-, 60-, and 40-watt bulbs.\nEISA 2007 provisions do not mandate the use of only compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), nor do they \u201cban\u201d incandescent products.\n\u201cEnergy-saving halogen (advanced incandescent) bulbs join CFLs on store shelves today, and provide the choices and desired lighting ambiance consumers want, using much less energy than consumed by the 100-year old technology they replace. More products are becoming available every day, including energy-saving, long-lasting LEDs to fill the 4.4 billion medium screw-base sockets in the U.S.,\u201d Pitsor said.\nNEMA is the association of electrical and medical imaging equipment manufacturers.

So there can be a whole generation of people that don't understand light bulb jokes,\" said Consumer Reports Deputy Home Editor Celia Kuperszmid Lehrman.\nCFLs doing better in Consumer Reports testing\nStarting January 1, incandescent bulbs will be phased out so stores are telling you to stock up now. An incandescent may be cheap, but it's not energy efficient.\nThe compact fluorescent is more energy efficient, but a lot of consumers don't like CFLs.\n\"When I look at the CFL, they just don't seem bright. It's more of a dingy light,\" Dan Shaffer said.\nTesting at Consumer Reports labs also revealed flaws with early version CFLs.\n\"They weren't very bright. They hummed. They buzzed. They flickered. They gave you the unfortunate light and you look yourself in the mirror saying I must look better than that,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said.\nThe outlook for CFLs is getting better. Consumer Reports tested 26 of the newest bulbs and found they do a good job of mimicking incandescent light.\nLook for the Energy Star logo. That means the bulb has met strict energy efficiency and durability standards, as well as guidelines for color and brightness. Consumer Reports said the Eco-Smart 60-watt equivalent bulb is a good choice for a table lamp. They cost $6 for a four pack.\nThere's another bonus.\n\"Some of the ones we tested this year use about 60 to 75 percent less mercury than ones we tested just three years ago,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said.\nYou still need to recycle them, but the newer CFLs are less of a concern than the older ones.\nLEDs may take over the spotlight\nSoon, we may be forgetting about CFLs, too, as light emitting diodes -- or LEDs -- take over the spotlight. Consumer Reports said LEDs outshine CFLs. There's no mercury and they last 40 years.\n\"They are instant on at full brightness. CFLs have a little bit of a delay,\" Lehrman said.\nThey are not swirly like a CFL, but the design is a bit odd.\n\"LEDs don't like heat. These are all the ways it dissipates the heat,\" Lehrman said, pointing out the casing on the light bulbs.\nBut, don't worry. LEDs are not hot to the touch.\nLEDs are not the hot item yet, and the price may have a thing or two to do with that. But, Consumer Reports said the prices are dropping dramatically.\n\"This Phillips bulb is one of our top rated bulbs and when we tested them and published the results in Sept - Oct., it was $40. The price has dropped to $25,\"\nLehrman said.\nThat's a $15 price reduction in just a few months. You can save even more by looking for rebates from your state or manufacturer.\nWhile pricey upfront, Consumer Reports said the bulb will pay for itself in just a few years. Over the lifetime of the bulb, expect to save hundreds of dollars.\nNew light bulb labels\nThe next time you shop for a light bulb, expect to find new marketing and new terms. The changes on the label will help you pick a better bulb, one that matches the brightness you're looking for.\nLight bulb packaging will now have a color scale to show you the light's appearance measured from warm to cool or 2,700 Kelvin to 6,500 Kelvin.\nConsumer Reports said pay attention to the scale and not the marketing.\n\"Look at these. It's warm light, bright light, and daylight. They all sound great and you go why not get daylight it's a higher number, and it's because the light is going to be bluer and it's not particularly flattering indoors,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said.\nIn the case of light bulbs, Consumer Reports said the lower the number the better chance it will look like your old incandescent bulb.\nBuy a bulb that's yellow or 2,700 to 3,000 Kelvin.\nUpside to changes -- you can put a brighter bulb in a fixture\nThere is an upside to these energy efficient changes. If your light fixture says only use a 60-watt maximum bulb, and you don't think it's bright enough for your room you can add a brighter bulb because it's using less energy.\n\"This one is only using 13-watts and it's producing the same amount of light as a 60-watt bulb,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said.\nYou'll no longer buy bulbs based on watts, that's how much energy a bulb uses. Now, you'll buy a bulb based on how much light it puts out, which is a lumen.\nThis bulb is 1100 lumens bright. That's equivalent to a 75-watt bulb.\n\"I think there is a big learning curve,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said.\nThe two big takeaways -- Consumer Reports said the lower number is better for light color and the higher number is better for lumens.\nFor now, they'll be a cheat sheet on most packages.\n\"This\nis actually more informative,\" Kuperszmid Lehrman said of the new labels.\nClick here to see the new light bulb label called \"Lighting Facts\": http://on.wews.com/sSOYZG\nUnlike the old days where you'd stock up on lightbulbs, only buy one or two at a time since it's a little more complicated now. Once you find one you like, then you should stock up.\nPhaseout controversy\nIn some last minute political maneuvering, the Department of Energy was stripped of its funding to enforce these news rules.\nConsumer Reports said the phase out will still happen in January as planning has been underway for years.

This is because laws are being passed throughout the world to ban these types of light bulbs for more efficient light bulbs.\nFor instance, the new compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use significantly less electricity when used. This is mainly because CFLs produce a lot less heat compared to incandescent light bulbs, and the generation of heat is basically the loss of energy. Even though CFLs are more expensive than incandescent light bulbs, if it believed that CFLs are more cost effective when factoring in their longer life spans and lower energy consumption. If this is true, then there is no need to ban the traditional incandescent light bulbs; because the free market will automatically obsolete the least cost effective type of light bulb.\nThe only problem with CFLs is that they contain an extremely toxic substance called mercury. If a single CFL breaks, then it could be very costly to clean up. For instance, a carpet or rug would need to be thrown away and that could cost thousands of dollars, however using a disposable wet rag is all that is necessary to clean mercury off of tile or cement. Furthermore, because CFLs contain mercury, they are not allowed to be thrown away with the regular trash in most places in the world, and proper disposal for CFLs is not well known or available everywhere. As a result, CFLs should not be considered environmentally friendly, even though they use less electricity. In fact, a lot of scientists and environmentalists are against CFLs, at least until CFLs are created without extremely toxic materials such as mercury.\nThe third and least popular type of light bulbs are light emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs supposedly use less electricity than CFLs and incandescent light bulbs; however LEDs are currently much more expensive and harder to find. LEDs also have the added benefit of containing no toxic substances. Furthermore, LEDs supposedly last significantly longer than CFLs and incandescent light bulbs too. Hopefully with further scientific advances and larger scales of mass production, the price of LEDs will become competitive.\nTherefore, LEDs are the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly light bulbs. As a result, politicians should stop trying to ban the old traditional light bulbs but instead help decrease the costs of LEDs.\nThough not available for light bulbs, another friend to the environment is photoluminescent lighting . It absorbs and re-radiates photons, and is most commonly used for exit signs in office buildings. It is a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to the traditional forms of lighting used for emergency signage.\nby Phil B.\n"}, {"score": 2022.5847, "uuid": "4153237d-39e2-521f-a663-f082485fb3ba", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-44-17591", "target_hostname": "tammybruce.com", "target_uri": "http://tammybruce.com/2011/12/52707.html", "page_rank": 1.209195e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "A Word on <em>Incandescent</em> <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> \u00ab Tammy Bruce", "snippet": "And what about the people who make these <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>\u2026are they protected from the hazards of mercury?

The ban on incandescent light bulbs \u2014 perhaps about to be rescinded \u2014 is stupid, intrusive, destructive, and generally un-American.\nWhen questioned, Obama\u2019s Energy Secretary Steven Chu condemned the quaint notion of citizens choosing for themselves. Said Chu: \u201cWe are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.\u201d This man, who holds a Nobel Prize in physics, is a petty dictator and a moron.\nEnough with the ad hominem remarks. Time to get serious. First off, I\u2019ll proclaim myself a pragmatic green, and I\u2019ll back that up with a long history of lifestyle decisions. As a teenager, I was gathering the family cans and newspapers and hauling them to the local food co-op, which had at the time just about the only recycling center in the city. My car is a compact, and I often leave it garaged for days while I walk or bike or ride public transit. I\u2019m very interested in renewable energy resources; I applaud the spirit of the various government programs while condemning the fact that most of the existing operations are wasteful political boondoggles and payoffs to cronies, doing much harm and no good.\nBy the way, my ecological advocacy is entirely parallel to my economic advocacy. The nation must live within its energy means just as we must live within our fiscal means. Balance is sustainable; deficit is a road to ruin.\nAs far as the CFLs (\u201ccompact fluorescent lights\u201d) go \u2014 they\u2019re great. I love them. I long ago installed them in about half the lights in my house.\nBut the other half of my lights remain as traditional incandescents. There\u2019s a good reason for this. The incandescents are preferable for those lights that don\u2019t turn on often, or only stay on for a few minutes at a time. Putting the more expensive CFLs in those sockets is wasteful, because the energy savings will never make up for the extra costs. Also, the CFLs tend to turn on slowly; this only makes sense for the lamps that turn on and stay on for a long time. There are also some cases where, in dealing with electronic signals, I want to avoid the electrical line noise generated by a nearby fluorescent bulb. Some people prefer the color spectrum of incandescent bulbs for certain purposes, although I don\u2019t care about that point.\nIn other words, incandescent bulbs have a useful and valuable place in the scheme of things. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that incandescent bulbs are \u2014 or were \u2014 manufactured domestically. Thanks to Washington, our factories have been shuttered and the employment has gone to the overseas plants that make CFLs . Then our legislators wring their hands and wonder why Americans can\u2019t get jobs.\nHere\u2019s an enlightening \u201cSmackdown\u201d sequence in which Rand Paul challenges a smarmy Obama energy bureaucrat named Kathleen Hogan. It\u2019s a telling exchange. When Paul points out, with devastating logic, that Obama\u2019s policies are coercive and dehumanizing, Hogan\u2019s only defense is that these measures had bipartisan support. This is sadly typical of the Washington mindset: It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s stupid or hurtful or wrong, it just matters that we agreed on it.

The results of their work will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .\nAccording to the Chunlei Guo, an associate professor of optics at the university, the laser process creates a unique array of tiny structures on the surface of the filament, making it more effective at radiating light. Regular incandescent bulbs convert only about 10 percent of the energy used into light, while the rest is emitted as heat.\n\u201cWith the same electric power input, the lamp is about twice as bright,\u201d said Mr. Guo. And though the technology is still in the early stages of development, Mr. Guo believes it would not be difficult for bulb companies to add a tungsten blackening step to the manufacturing process. \u201cThe implementation should be fairly straightforward,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, researchers at Deposition Sciences in Santa Rosa, Calif., have found a way to increase the efficacy of an incandescent to nearly 40 lumens a watt by using reflective coatings that allow waste heat to be converted to visible light. The light output of traditional incandescents, depending on the wattage, is between about 10 and 20 lumens a watt.\n\u201cIf you can get up to the levels we\u2019re talking about, it really changes the game,\u201d said Norm Boling, vice president of research and development for the company. \u201cIt means you can have the attributes of an incandescent and still have the efficiency. You can have your cake and eat it too.\u201d\nLighting companies are already using earlier versions of Deposition Sciences\u2019 coatings to manufacture more efficient incandescents, like Philips Lighting\u2019s Halogena line, which promises to be up to 38 percent more efficient, with light outputs of up to 23 lumens a watt and 3,000-hour lifespans.\nIn Europe, Philips recently introduced the EcoClassic range of incandescents, which are touted as 50 percent more efficient than traditional bulbs.\nIndustry experts believe the price of advanced incandescents \u2013 Philips\u2019 A-shaped Halogenas are about $5 apiece at Amazon.com and Home Depot \u2013 are expected to come down as more consumers are forced to seek out bulbs that meet new efficiency standards.\nUtilities and government agencies are also considering offering financial incentives to make them more affordable.\n\u201cIf they save energy and are cost effective, we\u2019ll bundle them into an incentive program,\u201d said Gregg Ander, the chief architect for the utility Southern California Edison . (California will begin phasing out inefficient incandescents starting in 2011 \u2013 one year ahead of the rest of the nation.)\nFor all of this, light-emitting diode (LED) and compact-fluorescent products already on the market have stated efficiency ratings of 40 to more than 100 lumens per watt, making it difficult to predict how long incandescents will stay in the game.\nChris Calwell, a senior research fellow with Ecos Consulting , believes combining various research efforts \u2013 like those occurring at the University of Rochester and Deposition Sciences \u2013 may be the key to the incandescent\u2019s staying power.\n\u201cBased on the pace of the science we\u2019ve seen thus far, I think we will be surprised at how good the next generations\u201d of incandescents will be, Mr. Calwell said.\nMichael Siminovitch, the director of the California Lighting Technology Center , described super-efficient incandescents as the \u201choly grail\u201d of lighting research right now.\n\u201cThe stuff is happening, and will happen,\u201d Mr. Siminovitch said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be doing it because people hate fluorescents so much.\u201d\nThe federal Energy Star program does not certify advanced incandescents. But that may change if the technology catches up to C.F.L.\u2019s, which are purported to use 75 percent less energy than incandescents and last seven to 10 times as long.\nAlex Baker, the lighting program manager for Energy Star, told Green Inc. that if the performance of a halogen or other advanced incandescent source rivaled that of currently qualified C.F.L.\u2019s, the program might consider certifying them.\nReddit\nPermalink\nFrom Around the Web\nKnight Science Journalism Tracker\n1 2 Next \u00bb\n1.

The higher the operating temperature, the greater the fraction of energy is in the form of visible light. However, you\u2019re also getting closer to the melting point of tungsten, so the bulbs don\u2019t last as long. \u201cLong-life\u201d incandescent bulbs are designed to operate at lower temperatures, and therefore are less efficient in putting out visible light. The operating temperature is a function of the resistance of the filament and the applied voltage.\nThe 1500 W bulbs used in theatrical lighting are more brilliant\u2013and more efficient in terms of lumens per watt\u2013than are ordinary bulbs.

June 2, 2009 4:03 pm Link\nSeveral points are commonly overlooked in discussions of incandescents vs. CFLs:\n[1] When people quote \u201clifetimes\u201d of lamps, at least for public discussion, they don\u2019t specify test conditions. Do test conditions correspond to \u201creal life\u201d situations? In homes, lamps are switched on and off many times; in life tests, are the lamps switched on and simply left on? In practice, filament failure often limits the lifetime of fluorescent lamps.\n[2] The quality of filaments evidently varies from one manufacturer to another. That\u2019s been well-known in the incandescent industry, for example. Just because filament technology is based on \u201cold-fashioned\u201d metallurgy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unimportant.\n[3] It is possible for fluorescent lamps can to produce very high \u201cquality,\u201d pleasing light, as measured by the color rendition index (CRI). For example, people rarely object to the lighting in retail stores because the stores use high-CRI lamps. On the other hand, most lamps sold for home and utility use have lower CRI phosphors \u2014 they\u2019re less expensive.\n[4] Complaints that fluorescent lamps produce headaches might be due to AC flicker.

Developing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that generate full-spectrum color\u2014white light\u2014is particularly difficult. Another hurdle has been finding a way to efficiently manage LED temperature: If the bulb gets too hot, it fails. Now, the first LED bulbs to rival the 60-watt, screw-in incandescent are finally poised to hit the market. If they win over consumers, the efficiency gains could yield impressive reductions not only in individual electricity bills but also in global carbon emissions . The Department of Energy estimates that replacing regular light bulbs with LEDs could potentially save 190 terawatt-hours annually (pdf)\u2014the equivalent of lighting over 95 million homes.\nThe 12-watt EnduraLED, recently announced by Philips Lighting, has a rated life of 25,000 hours (nearly 3 years). The 9-watt Definity LED made by Lighting Science Group may last twice as long. But longevity in a super-efficient package doesn't come cheap. Each Definity LED will cost about 30 dollars and the EnduraLED may top 50 dollars\u2014as much as the lighting fixture it's destined for. The price tag will almost certainly cause consumers to stop short and weigh the real benefits. But even with the current high price, LEDs are one of the most promising light sources available for consumers, beating out everything on the current market for reliability, efficiency and longevity.\nWhere CFLs Fall Short ... Studies from the Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting (PEARL) show that compact fluorescent bulbs often don't live up to manufacturer's claims. Glenn Reed of Energy Futures Group in Burlington, Vt., and his colleague Chris Granda at Grasteu Associates recently analyzed five years' worth of PEARL testing data on 1500 Energy Star \u2013qualified CFLs. They found that some CFLs began to lose brightness quickly. For example, almost half of reflector CFLs\u2014the kind used in recessed lighting\u2014were more than a quarter dimmer before they had reached half of their rated lifetime. Although CFLs typically perform worse in recessed lighting, Reed found that these CFLs weren't even living up to their Energy Star ratings. One possible explanation is that the recessed cans that house reflectors trap heat that wears out the bulb.\nThe PEARL studies also revealed that the average lifespan of CFLs often fell short, echoing a common complaint among CFL users. Among eight frequently tested brands, including Philips Lighting and General Electric, early failure rates ranged from 2 to 13 percent. The National Lighting Product Information Program has found similar differences in quality among Energy Star\u2013labeled brands. Reed notes that PEARL only tested 10 bulbs per brand and that the same brand wasn't necessarily tested all five years. These data limitations make it difficult to rank best and worst brands, but, says Reed, \"it's definitely a yellow flag.\"\nLighting Science Group's DefinityLED\nbulb will be available this Fall.\n... LEDs Step In\nSolid-state lighting can potentially overcome many problems with CFLs, including those highlighted by the PEARL studies. LEDs perform well in all lighting applications, including recessed lighting, and unlike all but specialized compact fluorescent bulbs LEDs are dimmable. Because of recent advances in optics, LEDs have a quality of light superior to all other types of lighting\u2014and they deliver it more efficiently. For example, Lighting Science Group's Definity LED delivers 112 lumens per watt compared to a CFL's 50 to 70 lumens per watt.\nImprovements in managing the LED chip's temperature have contributed to their marathon life span: LEDs can last up to 50,000 hours, more than eight times as long as CFLs. The bulbs are also likely to deliver on their lifetime claims because they won't face the same quality-assurance issues that have plagued CFLs. Energy Star only recently began performing \"random, off-the-shelf testing\" of Energy Star\u2013qualified CFLs. In contrast, random testing has been a part of Energy Star's eligibility criteria for solid-state lighting since the beginning. Even if CFL quality becomes more consistent now, they still can't compete with LED efficiency or, because of their mercury content, be recycled as easily.\nZach Gibler, the CEO of Lighting Science Group, says LED prices will begin to drop over the next 12 to 36 months. A lower retail price for the 60-watt replacement combined with rebates, which companies already offer on many CFL and LED purchases, will provide strong incentives for consumers to replace CFLs with LEDs. \"Right now for day-to-day use, CFLs are still an inexpensive energy-efficient alternative to incandescents,\" Reed says, \"but they are really just a transitional technology.\"\nDo you like this story?\n"}, {"score": 1948.8522, "uuid": "742bd1ab-360f-511a-80d5-120e2355d8e2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-58-28526", "target_hostname": "environment.about.com", "target_uri": "http://environment.about.com/od/greenlivingdesign/a/LED_light_bulbs.htm", "page_rank": 1.3440928e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> - Are LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> <em>Better</em> Than CFLs for Eco-Friendly", "snippet": "But such LED \u201c<em>bulbs</em>\u201d still don\u2019t generate <em>light</em> much brighter than a 35-watt <em>incandescent</em>, <em>which</em> most people consider too little <em>light</em> for reading <em>or</em> other focused tasks.", "explanation": null, "document": "electricity\nDear EarthTalk: What\u2019s the story with LED light bulbs that are reputed to be even more energy-efficient than compact fluorescents? \u2013 Toby Eskridge, Little Rock, AR\nPerhaps the ultimate \u201calternative to the alternative,\u201d the LED (light-emitting diode) light bulb may well dethrone the compact fluorescent light (CFL) as king of the green lighting choices. But it has a way to go yet in terms of both affordability and brightness.\nLED Cost and Practicality are Improving\nLEDs have been used widely for decades in other applications\u2014forming the numbers on digital clocks, lighting up watches and cell phones and, when used in clusters, illuminating traffic lights and forming the images on large outdoor television screens. Until recently, LED lighting has been impractical for most other everyday applications because it is built around costly semiconductor technology. But the price of semiconductor materials has dropped in recent years, opening the door for some exciting changes in energy-efficient, green-friendly lighting options.\nLEDs Offer More Efficient Technology than Incandescent Lights and CFLs\nAccording to HowStuffWorks.com , LED bulbs are lit solely by the movement of electrons. Unlike incandescents, they have no filament that will burn out; and unlike CFLs, they contain no mercury or other toxic substances. Proponents say LEDs can last some 60 times longer than incandescents and 10 times longer than CFLs. And unlike incandescents, which generate a lot of waste heat, LEDs don\u2019t get especially hot and use a much higher percentage of electricity for directly generating light.\nLED Manufacturers are Working to Make Bulbs Brighter\nBut as with early CFLs, LED bulbs are not known for their brightness. According to a January 2008 article in Science Daily, \u201cBecause of their structure and material, much of the light in standard LEDs becomes trapped, reducing the brightness of the light and making them unsuitable as the main lighting source in the home.\u201d\nLED makers get around this problem in some applications by clustering many small LED bulbs together in a single casing to concentrate the light emitted. But such LED \u201cbulbs\u201d still don\u2019t generate light much brighter than a 35-watt incandescent, which most people consider too little light for reading or other focused tasks.\nInitial Price of LED Light Bulbs Offset by Low Operating Costs\nIf LEDs are going to replace incandescents and CFLs, manufacturers will have to make them brighter. EarthLED is lighting the way with its EvoLux and ZetaLux bulbs, which use multiple LEDs in a single casing to generate light. The EvoLux delivers light equal to that of a 100-watt incandescent, the company says. But the $80/bulb price tag may be tough to swallow. The ZetaLux, which retails for $49.99 and delivers light equivalent to a 50- or 60-watt incandescent, will last 50,000 hours and costs only $2/yearly to run.\nConsumers Can Purchase LED Light Bulbs Locally or Online\nOther bulb makers are working on similar designs for high-powered LED bulbs, hoping that an increase in availability will help spur demand, which will in turn lower prices across the board. Until then, consumers can find LED bulbs suitable for secondary and mood lighting purposes in many hardware and big box stores. C. Crane\u2019s 1.3-watt LED bulb, for example, generates as much light as a 15-watt incandescent bulb.

It is one of the best things you can do for the environment\u2014and your budget.\nAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists, if every U.S. household replaced just one regular incandescent light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb, it would prevent 90 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the equivalent of taking 7.5 million cars off the road. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says that by replacing regular light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs at the same minimal rate, Americans would save enough energy to light more than 2.5 million homes for a year.\nReasons to Switch to Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs\nOn top of that, replacing one regular light bulb with an approved compact fluorescent light bulb would save consumers $30 in energy costs over the life of the bulb.\nCompact fluorescent light bulbs use at least two-thirds less energy than standard incandescent bulbs to provide the same amount of light, and they last up to 10 times longer. Compact fluorescent light bulbs also generate 70 percent less heat, so they are safer to operate and can also reduce energy costs associated with cooling homes and offices.\nThe only real drawback to using compact fluorescent bulbs is that each one contains about 5 mg of mercury, a toxic heavy metal that can cause serious health problems if inhaled or ingested over a period of time or in large enough doses. As a result, many environmentalists and other experts recommend recycling compact fluorescent bulbs to make sure they don't end up in landfills.\nHow Much Can You Save by Using Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs?\nFor most people, switching from incandescent to compact fluorescent bulbs offers a lot of opportunity for energy and cost savings. Lighting accounts for 20 percent of the electric bill in the average U.S. home, and the average home has approximately 30 light fixtures. (Calculate your personal energy and cost savings with this handy online calculator , and find out how much you will be helping the environment.)\nTo save the most energy and money by using compact fluorescent light bulbs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends replacing standard bulbs in areas where lights are used frequently and left on for a long time, such as family rooms, living rooms, kitchens, dining rooms, and porches.\nChoosing the Right Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs\nTo make sure you get the same amount of light when replacing standard bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs, check the lumen rating on the light you are replacing and purchase a compact fluorescent light bulb with the same lumen rating. (A lumen rating is the measure of light the bulb puts out.)\nWattage varies greatly between standard light bulbs and compact fluorescent light bulbs. Compact fluorescent light bulbs typically use about one-quarter of the wattage used by standard bulbs to produce the same amount of light. So to replace a traditional 60-watt bulb, look for a compact fluorescent light bulb that is about 15 watts.\nCompact fluorescent light bulbs are available in many different sizes and shapes to fit in almost any fixture\u2014from three-way lamps to dimmer switches\u2014for both indoor and outdoor use. Compact fluorescent light bulbs also come in a variety of color temperatures, which helps determine the color and brightness of the light each bulb provides. (Learn more about the brightness, color and light quality of compact fluorescent light bulbs.)\nKeeping It Simple\nNone of this is as daunting as it may seem. But to make it really simple, the environmental group Environmental Defense has put together an easy-to-use web site that lets you search for the compact fluorescent light bulbs according to where you want to use them or by shape, brightness, color of light or other features.\nThe site also features user reviews of specific bulbs, and side-by-side photos of energy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs with incandescent bulbs to help you determine whether the fluorescent bulbs will fit your light fixture.\nWith all of the choices now offered by compact fluorescent technology, saving energy, saving money, and protecting the environment is as easy as changing a light bulb.\nGlobal Warming\n"}, {"score": 1943.4967, "uuid": "f8d4e829-4d73-5aca-b9a7-82893bd11a09", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401tw-09-04700", "target_hostname": "worldtruth.tv", "target_uri": "http://worldtruth.tv/understanding-the-dangers-of-fluorescent-light-bulbs/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Consciousness TV | Understanding The Dangers of <em>Fluorescent</em> <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em>", "snippet": "The danger comes if the <em>bulbs</em> are cracked, broken <em>or</em> not disposed of properly.

And pretty soon, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 kicks in, requiring bulbs to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient by 2012 to 2014, and 70 percent more efficient by 2020, effectively phasing out traditional incandescent bulbs as a way to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe energy efficiency of CFLs may be significant, but unlike traditional light bulbs, there is a hidden danger sealed inside each little bulb that requires special handling and disposal.\nMercury \u2013 a potent, developmental neurotoxin that can damage the brain, liver, kidneys and central nervous system. Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to mercury\u2019s toxic effects. Even at low levels, mercury is capable of causing a number of health problems including impair motor functioning, cognitive ability and emotional problems. Higher or prolonged exposure can result in much more serious health problems.\nCFLs are marketed as \u201csafe\u201d and don\u2019t pose any health risks as long as the glass remains intact. The danger comes if the bulbs are cracked, broken or not disposed of properly. Although it sounds like a miniscule amount \u2013 4 to 5 milligrams \u2013 there is enough mercury in just one fluorescent light bulb to contaminate 6,000 gallons of water.\nSo what does that mean if a CFL is cracked or breaks in our homes, releasing mercury vapors in an enclosed area?\nConsumers \u2013 especially those with young children \u2013need to know what to do when a CFL breaks and the proper way to dispose of used bulbs. It\u2019s no longer as easy as changing a light bulb.\nMERCURY WARNING:\nCompact fluorescent\u00a0light-bulbs\u00a0contain very small amounts of mercury and care must be taken in disposing of them or when they break.\nThe EPA suggests the following:\no People and pets should immediately leave the room.\no Open a window and/or door and Air out the room for 5 to 10 minutes.\no Turn off the central forced air heating/air-conditioning system.\no Thoroughly collect broken glass and visible powder using wet cloths. Never use vacuum cleaners or brooms.\no Put all debris and cleanup materials in a sealable container and put outdoors in a trash container or protected area until materials can be disposed of properly. Do not leaving bulb fragments or cleanup materials indoors.\no If practical, continue to air out the room where the bulb was broken and leave the heating/air conditioning system shut off for several hours.\nFrequently Asked Questions\u00a0Information on Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) and Mercury\u00a0November 2010\nAll of this needs to be done to protect people from the tiny amount of mercury in one fluorescent light bulb. Which begs the question, are these lights really safe and are the risks worth it?\nAnother equally important concern is what happens to the environment \u2013 the air, soil and water \u2013 when tons of discarded bulbs, along with the mercury, are dumped into local landfills?\nThe threat posed by billions of broken CFLs lying in landfills has resulted in some communities requiring their citizens to discard used and broken CFLs in designated recycling centers or in a hazardous-waste collection facility.\nGiven the known deleterious effects caused by mercury, it would seem logical to assume there will be some unintended consequences resulting from the switch to compact fluorescent lights.\nOnly time will tell how significant those consequences will be.\nIf you are concerned about the possible health risks associated with CFLs, LED or halogen lights are good alternatives. Both cost a little more but are as efficient as CFLs and can be recycled easily.\nFor more information about mercury and compact fluorescent light bulbs go to\nhttp://www.epa.gov/cfl/\nFor information about your communities recycling program go to http://epa.gov/cfl/cflrecycling.html\nCompact Fluorescent Lamps are designed to fit standard light sockets as an energy-saving alternative to traditional incandescent bulbs. CFLs have spiraling or elongated U-shaped tubes known as a single-envelope unit; the double-envelope or encapsulated bulbs have the tubes inside a glass bulb. Consumers should be aware of dangers associated with CFL bulbs before bringing the units into the home, school or workplace.\nMercury Content\nAlthough CFLs are considered extremely energy efficient, each bulb contains about 5mg \u201celemental mercury,\u201d says U.S. Army-Ft. Wood. General Electric, a manufacturer of CFL bulbs, notes the amount equivalent to the tip of a ballpoint pen. GE further claims the mercury is an \u201cessential, irreplaceable element\u201d that allows the bulb to perform as an efficient light source, posing no danger during regular use. Elemental mercury is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin that effects multiple neurological responses. High exposures may affect the kidneys, lead to respiratory failure and death. In addition, mercury accumulates in the environment, vaporizing into the air and leaching into water supplies.\nRadiation Emissions\nCFL bulbs are subject to scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as electronic products that emit ultraviolet radiation. However, as of May 2011, the FDA did not have \u201cspecific standards or annual reporting requirements\u201d for manufacturers because the bulbs are considered of little concern, having insignificant levels of radiation. CFLs emit a small amount of UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, according to the FDA. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency tested CFLs from various manufacturers. With the exception of people with photosensitive medical conditions, such as lupus, ARPANSA noted that CFLs are suitable for use at distances beyond 10 inches. However, when using desktop and other close lamps, it\u2019s advisable to utilize double-envelope or encapsulated bulbs.\nElectrical Sensitivity\nElectrical sensitivity, also known as electrical hypersensitivity and electromagnet hypersensitivity, is a recognized disability with chronic and systematic reactions to electromagnet fields given off by wiring, electrical equipment, transformers and florescent lighting \u2014 including CFLs. Approximately 8 million Americans experience electrical sensitivities, according to the Research & Training Center on Independent Living. It causes nervous system symptoms such as headache, fatigue, stress and sleep disturbances; skin symptoms including prickling, burning sensations and rashes, and pain and ache to muscles, as well as many other health problems. CFLs contribute to electrical sensitivity by emitting electromagnetic radiation.\nElectromagnetic Radiation\nElectromagnet radiation, also known as electromagnetic frequencies \u2014 EMF \u2014 is a naturally occurring energy. Technological advances such as CFL bulbs have increased the EMF in modern environments. The electromagnet radiation bundle includes dirty electricity \u2014 sometimes called dirty power \u2014 electrical pollution and radio waves. Most of the EMF fields experienced every day and emitted from CFL bulbs are non-ionizing radiation and considered safe. However, for people with electrical sensitivity, CFL bulbs have significant accumulative dangers, according to ElectroSensitivity UK News.\n"}, {"score": 1929.9286, "uuid": "47dd1dd2-13de-5a27-a95d-bfc79f2eff71", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-47-14254", "target_hostname": "www.earthtechproducts.com", "target_uri": "http://www.earthtechproducts.com/geobulb-3-led-light-bulb.html", "page_rank": 1.2197632e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "GeoBulb-3 - LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> - 50-60 Watt <em>Incandescent</em> Replacement", "snippet": "With just 7 Watts of power, you&#x27;ll be getting ultra bright white LED <em>light</em> that&#x27;s comparable to a 50 watt <em>incandescent</em> <em>bulb</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "GeoBulb-3 - LED Light Bulb - 50-60 Watt Incandescent Replacement\nGeoBulb-3 - LED Light Bulb - 50-60 Watt Incandescent Replacement\nShips\nWhat's Included:\nWith just 7 Watts of power, you'll be getting ultra bright white LED light that's comparable to a 50 watt incandescent bulb.

They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb.\"\nThe letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\n\"Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!\" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama.\nWe are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, \"Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs.\"\nFirst off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release \"dangerous\" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check.\nBut the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs.\nSec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years.\nThe curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs.\nSo we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law \"outlaws\" incandescent light bulbs.\nArnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them.\n\"We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require,\" Arnold said.\n\"If it's available, where can I buy it?\" he asked.\u00a0 \"Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?\"\nActually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S.\nPhilips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check).\nThe two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's.\nMoorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said.\n\"You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs,\" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\nJen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong.\n\"It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb,\" she said.\nThis one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs. We rule this claim Pants on Fire.\nAdvertisement\n"}, {"score": 1889.2838, "uuid": "bf6f388f-3584-58dc-b8fd-311b21153d76", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1600wb-00-15577", "target_hostname": "www.affordablequalitylighting.com", "target_uri": "http://www.affordablequalitylighting.com/docs/indoor/healthy/puralite/index.html", "page_rank": 1.2053994e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Fluorescent</em> and Air Purifying <em>Bulb</em>", "snippet": ": 25 Watts (equivalent <em>light</em> output to about 95 Watts <em>Incandescent</em>) Warranty: 1 Year <em>or</em> 10,000 Hours on <em>Bulb</em> and Filter \u2022 Permanent filter that never needs replacing and will last as long as the <em>bulb</em> does (<em>which</em> <em>is</em> rated at 10,000 hours) and all you need to do <em>is</em> simply dust off any accumulated dust", "explanation": null, "document": "\u2022 Schools, Preschools\u00a0& Day Cares\nHow Does It Work?\nWe have combined all the advantages in an Energy Saving Fluorescent Bulb with an Air Purifier that emits negatives ions which improves air quality for you and your family's health.\nThis element will help remove cigarette smoke, reduce all odors (especially cooking odor), improve immunity, hasten metabolism, slow down aging collecting dust, dispel pet odor and pet dander, kill bacteria, air born viruses and air containments!

The most effective measure of controlling indoor air pollution is by the use of a negative ion-generating air purifier.\nRecently, the importance of the indoor air quality is on the rise as a new social issue. According to the EPA, indoor air quality is our biggest pollution problem. The EPA\u00a0estimates that chemical levels are 70 times higher inside the home, than outside. The world Health Organization estiamtes that 40% of all buildings post a serious health hazard due to indoor pollution.\nEver notice why people tend to get ill more when its colder or hotter outside? Because you tend to spend more time indoors when its too cold or too hot to go outside. Yet, still more emphasis is placed on the quality of outdoor air, and people are still not fully aware of the character and concentration of indoor air pollution.\nWhat Do Negative Ions Do?\nThey detoxify the body through the emission of negative ions. This balances the ionization in your environment and combats ill feelings associated with our stressful lives.\nThe negative ions in the air vitalize our body as though we were in a forest, waterfall or hot springs. Negative ions are often called the \"air vitamin,\" because when we inhale negative ions, they accelerate the metabolism, promote vitality, make the blood clearer, stabilize the nervous system, aids in recovery of fatigue and increases the appetite.\nStems bacterial growth and forces precipitation of many airborne contaminants, including pollen, dust and dust mites, viruses, second-hand cigarette smoke, animal dander, odors, and toxic chemical fumes.\nHow Many\u00a0PuraLite System\u2122 Bulbs Do I\u00a0Need?\nNormal Recommended Amount: 1 PuraLite System\u2122 Bulb per every 80 Square Feet (8 x 10 foot area).\nHomes: Highly recommended in your children's rooms, nursery, family rooms, bedrooms, dens, bathrooms, hallways, closets, etc. Can be used in all rooms with normal ceiling heights of 8-10 feet.

LED light bulbs offer clean pure white light and great colors! LED light bulbs are shock and vibration resistant, and LED light bulbs are direct screw-in replacements for incandescent bulbs.\nPlease read the information we have provided here on high power LED light bulbs to help you with selection of proper LED light bulbs for the task. The information helps you to understand what kind of LED light bulbs we offer, how the LED light bulbs you want operate with respect to light generated and how it is generated. Without this information, you will not know which LED light bulbs to buy, or if the led light bulbs you want to buy are the right LED light bulbs for you. Contact us at any time if you have questions.\nHow to calculate energy savings when using LED Light Bulbs\n1. LED Light Bulbs and Heat\nHigh power LED Light Bulbs utilize the latest LED technology. These are the surface mount type or SMD LEDs. Small as they are, they generate high heat which must be dissipated or moved away from the LED in order for the LED to live the expected life time of 40,000 hours or more. To do that, most manufacturers have incorporated an aluminum or ceramic body with fins to increase the total area that the heat can escape to and be dissipated. The higher the operating current, the higher the heat load to be dissipated. That means more fins, or more thin and longer fins are required. In the case of one newly developed design, the LED bulb incorporates liquid to assist with the dissipation of heat.\nHeat is the enemy of a LED. It can tolerate only what the manufacturer builds into it. Without the means to dissipate the heat created by the actual operating current applied to the LED to generate light, the LEDs will die a premature death. The high powered LED bulbs will have currents of 350-700mA plus running through them. Its a small amount compared to a standard light bulb. But, it is applied to a tiny piece no larger than 5/16\" in diameter. This small section of material must take on 350-700mA which is huge for its size. This why so much heat is generated from so little electricity. There is no place for the current to go back to or to run to.\n2. LED Light Bulbs - Color Temperature\nThe color swatches are shown to give you an idea of what the white light color differences look like. They are NOT the actual light colors you will see.\nColor Temperature.\nDaylight White LED light bulbs are generally between 5000 and 5500k.\nCool White LED light bulbs are generally between 4200k and 4500k Color Temperature.\nWarm white LED light bulbs are generally between 2800k and 3300k Color Temperature.\nThe lower the number, the warmer or more yellow tint to the light will be visible.\nGenerally, warm white LED light bulbs look better in warm environments (earth tones for example) and daylight white LED Light bulbs look better in cooler environments (blues and stainless steel for example).\n3. LED Light Bulbs - View Angle\nThe high powered LED Light bulbs are offered within 10\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and wider beam width or view angle of the LEDs. The total volume of light between 20 degree view angle and 60 degree view angle LED light bulbs is the same. But, the concentration of light with narrower 20 degree view angle LED bulbs makes them seem brighter because you see all of it in a smaller space. The wider view angle LED bulbs will appear much less bright and that is because the same light volume has been spread wide. There is minimal light spread outside of the stated view angle.\n4. LED Light Bulbs - Base Size\nE27 is the designation for standard household medium base LED light bulbs. These are drop-in replacements for household sockets all over the world. E12 is the designation for candelabra base LED light bulbs. We also carry MR16 LED light bulbs and GU10 LED light bulbs. MR16 type LED light bulbs fit into two very small diameter holes in a flat socket spaced about 5cm apart. They will not fit into any other size MR socket. The same applies to the MR11 LED light bulbs, or other type LED MR light bulb. T8 is the designation for fluorescent tube replacements we carry. LED fluorescent tube replacements do not flicker.\nWhen in doubt about the base size you need for your fixture, or if you need a special base size for a larger project, please contact us .\n5. LED Light Bulbs - What does dual voltage mean?\nMany high powered LED light bulbs will operate on dual voltage - 85vac to 260 VAC making them universally applicable anywhere in the world. Dual voltage means the led light bulbs will switch internally from 110/120 vac to 220/240 vac as is appropriate for the country it is used in. Voltage above 130 VAC will still have the potential to burn out the LEDs.\n6. LED Light Bulbs - Specifications\nThe high powered LED light bulbs are listed with the watts that the LED is rated to consume. That changes a bit as the electronics also require power and effect the actual watts consumed. In general, electronics do not consume more than 1 watt total. We will also state the beam width or LED view angle, how many lumens and watts of light are generated by these high powered LED light bulbs, and a brightness comparison to incandescent light bulbs.\n7. LED Light Bulbs - Warranty\nALL high powered LED bulbs have a warranty against defect. Defect does not include or mean excessive voltage coverage. Dual voltage means the bulb will switch internally from 110/120 VAC to 220/240 VAC as is appropriate for the country it is used in. Voltage above 130 vac will still have the potential to burn out the LED. Warranty does not cover installing the bulb in such a way that the heat dissipating fins are rendered ineffective. LED light bulbs are never to be installed in covered fixtures with no air circulation.\n"}, {"score": 1795.4722, "uuid": "49e65edb-3fe6-5905-9058-e0b57cedf8be", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1003wb-11-14399", "target_hostname": "www.liquidleds.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.liquidleds.com.au/blog/leds-alternative-light-bulbs/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "LEDS: The <em>Better</em> Alternative in <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> &#x2F; LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> | LED Lighting", "snippet": "With the advantages that many people enjoy from using LEDs, it <em>is</em> predicted that 2012 will see the end of the usage of <em>fluorescent</em> <em>lights</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "LEDS: The Better Alternative in Light Bulbs\nLEDS: The Better Alternative in Light Bulbs\nPosted on 01/02/2012 by Arthur There have been 0 comments\nImagine a night without light.

The biggest one by far has got to be so save money on electricity and they certainly do make a dramatic impact on the quarterly electricity bill. With a CFL technology energy saving light bulb saving around 75% and an LED bulb saving in the order of 88% there is a massive gain to be made by this move.\nThe next 2 reasons on\u00a0 most peoples agenda is to reap the benefits of longer life span and then to play your part in the eco drive. With an LED bulb lasting between 20000 and 50000 hours then this is a massive improvement even on the\u00a0 relatively long lifespan of the CFL energy saving light bulb at 10000 hours and a mammoth improvement over the old incandescent light bulb which lasts about 1000 hours before burn out.\nSo these are the big hitters but the benefits do not stop here and depending on the applicaction then there are normally a range of other cherries to be picked.\nLooking deeper into the benefits of LED Bulbs and Energy Saving Light Bulbs\nNow lets say you are lighting a kitchen. Here by the very nature of a kitchen it is going to be hot and in a number of cases there might actually be some fairly sophisticated air conditioning or cooling system to make the ambient temperature acceptable from a working perspective. So the last thing you want it a set of filament or halogen bulbs heating the place up just so you can get the required levels of illumination.\u00a0 In this case it is like\u00a0 a downward spiral because the more light you put in to the space,\u00a0the more heat that\u00a0is generated and the more the air conditioning then has to work to keep the place cool and the only result is spiralling energy costs which might be good for the energy companies but nobody else.\nAnother interesting angle is looking deeper into the lifespan. On the face of it if a CFL energy saving light bulb lasts 10000 hours and an LED lamp lasts 50000 hours then you would say well the LED bulb is 5 times better. However, if you look deeper then you need to get the replacement bulbs when the lamps fail and also change them so there is normally significant acquisition costs to be accommodated plus some maintenance costs. Then if the premises are commercial there will undoubtedly be some health and safety considerations to bear in mind.\nThen another angle is then to look at the electricity supply and wiring capability for the establishment, particularly in commercial buildings. A number of properties which are more traditional in character will be several decades old and in these times the electrical supply capacity and the sophistication of the consumer units was not as it is today. Even so people are now plugging in more and more appliances and extending ring mains which is putting a much higher load on the electrical systems. In this case then either the number of appliances and light fittings needs to be reduced or the whole electrical system upgraded. In the case one easy solution is to go LED bulbs which will reduce the lighting consumption by anything up to 90%. Although this is a relatively high investment cost with the LED bulbs then it is often a far more economical solution that upgrading the electrical system.\nI will not write chapter and verse on the other benefits but just finish with a list, namely, reduced fire risk, instant start up of LED\u2019s, no premature failure with LED\u2019s when used with sensors, more variety on lighting colour, less load on transformers, smaller batteries needed for emergency lighting, reduced land fill, lower carbon footprint\u00a0and the list goes on!!\n"}, {"score": 1778.8713, "uuid": "ff9b9c04-2f9a-55fc-8431-1cd03799a675", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0603wb-57-32585", "target_hostname": "www.lightingdirectory.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lightingdirectory.com/news/t/brighter-led-light-bulbs-better-for-kitchens-2009", "page_rank": 1.229858e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Lighting Directory News - Brighter LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> <em>Better</em> For Kitchens", "snippet": "Send a link to the article &#x27;Brighter LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> <em>Better</em> For Kitchens&#x27; to a friend <em>or</em> colleague by entering their email address in the box below.

Many home owners will agree that finding just the right kind of light for a busy kitchen \u2013 and hub of the household- can be quite a task. LED bulbs have had a reputation for casting out an almost clinical blue light, which is fine when you need clear visibility for cooking and cleaning but can make actually eating and entertaining guests in the kitchen less practical.\nThe good news for those who have lots of summer parties planned and a full social calendar of BBQs and dinner parties to look forward to is that LED light bulbs have undergone something of a makeover. Brands like Philips have used new technology and \u0091tuneable lights' that are whiter than their bluish predecessors, making them a perfect match for kitchen lighting requirements. These same bulbs also work well in a bathroom or cloakroom, where white lighting can give a clean and fresh feel.\nLED bulbs have increased in popularity in recent years as they have established a reputation as an energy saving light bulb. With this burgeoning demand, a range of LED lighting solutions can be mixed and matched to create the perfect kitchen lighting set up. BLT Direct, the energy saving lightbulb specialist stock hundreds of different styles of LED bulb. They have reported an increase in clients wishing to install LED bulbs and tubes in their kitchens, replacing traditional incandescent, energy-eating lights.\nGary Baker from the firm said, \"We have certainly witnessed an increase in demand for products like LED fluorescent tubes and LED downlighters . Downlighters in particular are very popular with homeowners as they are available in a range of light colours giving real freedom to be creative and create a mood that befits the environment \u2013 choices of daylight and warm light for example were not possible a few years ago but now make ideal kitchen and bathroom lighting installations.\"\nLED light bulbs have a very long life which makes them an attractive and practical prospect for difficult to reach places.

No question, it's amazing what we've accomplished. But these things are happening in labs far removed from our everyday lives.\nThere is also change going on right at our fingertips in an industry that touches billions of people every day, yet to which few of them ever really give much thought. Despite that, hundreds of scientists in many countries are continually at work, trying to reinvent this now centuries-old \"technology\" using semiconductors, nano-scale engineering, even biology. All to improve the seemingly simplest of devices - the light bulb.\nDespite the dim (ahem) interest, lighting accounts for more than 15% of global electricity usage, and is a $50-billion-per-year industry. Today we look at a fundamental shift in lighting technology; away from long-established market leaders, this is now being accelerated by policy around the world.\nIn the Beginning\nOf all human accomplishments, the control of fire ranks near the top of the list in terms of importance. It was, along with creation of crude stone tools, among the first technological breakthroughs - the first times we manipulated nature to create tools for ourselves that would improve quality (and length) of life in a dramatic way.\nNo one knows when fire was first harnessed by human beings. A conservative guess would be about a half-million years ago, although other estimates place it as far back as two million. In any event, it probably came about after some prehistoric savant had an \"Aha!\" moment and deduced that it was possible to preserve a few embers after a lightning strike... and then, that they could be carried from place to place, enabling a perpetual renewal of the flame. To be appointed keeper of the fire was likely a great honor.\nFire bestows upon its users many gifts. It warms living spaces, it can be used to cook food, and it is a weapon against predators. But it is also a source of light, serving as a surrogate sun and prolonging the possibility of human activity into the nighttime hours. Early humans were freed to gather around the hearth after dark, to work, to socialize, and - as language evolved - to tell each other stories.\nOver time, humans have created light by burning just about anything flammable, from wood to whale oil to gas. But using actual fire as a light source has a lot of drawbacks. It's impractical: you need to constantly maintain your fuel supply. It's inefficient: the great majority of the energy is lost as heat. And it's dangerous, always a threat to spread if you're careless.\nIn order to take the next step on the long road to Las Vegas Boulevard, people needed something better. That thing happened to come in the form of a vacuum-sealed glass chamber filled with electroluminescent materials - the now-ubiquitous incandescent light bulb.\nThe Breakthrough\nThe invention of this bulb is most often - and mistakenly - attributed to the Wizard of Menlo Park, Thomas Edison. In truth, its antecedents date back to 1802, when the great British scientist Sir Humphry Davy demonstrated incandescence for the first time by passing an electric current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because of its high melting point. It didn't work very well, but the principle was established.\nAfter Davy set the stage, it was off to the races. Over the ensuing decades, experimenters fiddled with many different combinations of metal wires, carbon rods, and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures.\nIt wasn't until much later - in 1879 - that the 32-year-old Edison started coming close to a commercially feasible version of the incandescent light, with a carbon-filament lamp. In 1880, he created a carbonized bamboo filament with a working life previously unimagined, of over 1,200 hours.\nOriginal Edison carbon-filament bulb\nCarbon, however, was not destined to become the standard for filaments. Tungsten - which lasted longer and gave a brighter light - was. In 1906, the General Electric Company patented a method of making filaments from sintered tungsten and, in 1911, used ductile tungsten wire for incandescent light bulbs. Then, in 1913, GE's Irving Langmuir found that filling a lamp with inert gas instead of a vacuum resulted in twice the luminous efficacy and a reduction in bulb blackening.\nThus was born the incandescent lamp as we know it; it has survived relatively unchanged for the past century.\nOutline of glass bulb Low-pressure inert gas (argon, neon, nitrogen) Tungsten filament Contact wire (goes out of stem) Contact wire (goes into stem) Support wires Stem (glass mount) Contact wire (goes out of stem) Cap (sleeve) Insulation Electrical contact\nWhile technology progresses more rapidly in the Information Age than it did in the preceding centuries, the incubation time from invention to commercialization continues to be a defining trend for technology. In a commodity industry such as lighting it is especially important, as the economies of scale push down the commercially tolerable price for mass adoption to incredibly low levels. There are, however, ways to enter the market and expand over time. There is no better example than the incandescent bulb's most effective competitor to date.\nThe Challenger\nThe modern incandescent gives off a light that's fairly close to sunlight. People are used to it. They like it. However, the problem with these bulbs has always been their inefficiency. Ninety percent or more of the energy used to get the filament to glow is dissipated as heat... not as bad as a fire, but still hardly a best in show.\nThis inefficiency and the associated large electrical cost per lumen (the standard measurement of light, a photonic equivalent to a gram or meter) left a big opening for competitive technologies. And, as technologists tend to do with such an obvious problem, over the course of the past century, numerous alternatives have been introduced, including: sodium vapor, neon, xenon, carbon arc, and many others. Some of these specialized lights are still in use today in niche applications. But, for one reason or another - short lifespan, too many toxic chemicals, or simply too expensive - none was suitable for everyday lighting.\nNearly from the beginning, the only real challenger has been the fluorescent lamp.\nFluorescents are tubes containing pressurized mercury vapor. When an electrical current is passed through them, the excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes phosphors coating the tube's interior to fluoresce, producing visible light.\nAgain, understanding of the principle goes back to the mid-19th century; all the proper elements were available by the 1920s. But producing a workable model took even longer than with incandescents. The tubes may look simple, but they're not.\nThe main difficulty is that fluorescent lamps are \"negative differential resistance\" devices, which means that as more current flows through them, electrical resistance drops, allowing even more current to flow, and so on. So you can't connect one directly to a constant-voltage power supply and walk away; pretty soon, it would self-destruct under the buildup of current. To prevent this, you have to have something in between - a ballast - to continually regulate the current flow through the tube.\nThere were plenty of other problems, too. It wasn't until 1934 that GE finally rolled out its prototype. As one industry historian wrote of the event: \"A great deal of experimentation had to be done on lamp sizes and shapes, cathode construction, gas pressures of both argon and mercury vapor, colors of fluorescent powders, methods of attaching them to the inside of the tube, and other details of the lamp and its auxiliaries before the new device was ready for the public.\"\nWith the cost savings they afforded, fluorescents were quickly adopted by schools, businesses, municipal buildings, and such. By 1951, more light in the US was produced by them than by incandescents.\nBut because, for a long time, they could only be made in long tubes (either straight or with several U-shaped bends), they failed to catch on in home lighting. And even if they'd been initially adaptable, few would have chosen them. People hated the cold, harsh light they gave off, that they required some warm-up time, and that they had a tendency to flicker.\nStill, there were enough researchers on the job to ensure that eventually most problems would be resolved, and we would get a fluorescent bulb that could screw into a standard socket. That happened in 1980, when Philips introduced a screw-in lamp with integral ballast, the first compact fluorescent lamp (CFL). Osram followed that in 1985 with the first CFL to include an electronic ballast. These tube types remain the most popular in Europe, but in North America, helical lamps , first released in 1995, have become the favorites.\nCFLs cost much more than standard incandescents - and their price has shot up even more lately, due to their need for rare-earth metals, whose cost has risen rapidly in recent years as they are used in virtually every single type of electronic component. However, despite cost struggles, they have a number of advantages. The primary one is energy consumption. They convert far more electricity into light (measured in lumens per watt), as you can see here:\nIn addition, CFLs have a life rated at some 10-20 times longer than their rivals, at least when operated continuously, for several hours at a time. Their light is more diffuse, reducing glare. And you can touch them without getting burned.\nNevertheless, consumer response has been tepid, as there are some major disadvantages. Many still don't like the light quality. If there is frequent on/off switching, fluorescents age rapidly and their life is severely shortened. The shape is not suitable for many lampshades. They emit much more UV light than incandescent bulbs, which can affect sensitive individuals and harm paintings. Some people may also be sensitive to their flicker rate, and there's suspicion they can trigger migraines. They can't be used with a dimmer switch. And the mercury they contain can be a health hazard if they're broken.\nIt's this potential toxicity issue that has critics of the conversion to fluorescents most up in arms.\nThe US government has mostly downplayed the mercury risk. However, in Australia, they're considerably more cautious. Lengthy guidelines for cleanup of a broken fluorescent include the following admonitions:\nOpen nearby windows and doors to allow the room to ventilate for 15 minutes; do not use a vacuum cleaner or broom, instead scoop up broken material (e.g. using stiff paper or cardboard), if possible into a glass container which can be sealed with a metal lid; use disposable rubber gloves rather than bare hands; use a disposable brush to carefully sweep up the pieces; and it is important to emphasize that the transfer of the broken CFL and clean-up materials to an outside rubbish bin (preferably sealed) as soon as possible is the most effective way of reducing potential contamination of the indoor environment.\nThat's not even exhaustive and it's already quite a procedure.\nDespite these differing viewpoints on the safety of fluorescent bulbs, CFLs have to some extent become the battle flag of an escalating political and economic war being waged against the incandescent bulb.\nThe Lighting Wars\nIt's doubtful that any of the pioneers of electric lighting could have imagined their products becoming political footballs. But never underestimate the capacity of the government to involve itself in every possible aspect of life, including consumer choice.\nWelcome to the lighting wars.\nGovernments around the world are moving to mandate the demise of the incandescent bulb. Brazil and Venezuela started phasing them out in 2005. The European Union, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Australia began their phase-outs in 2009, and others are on track to do the same, including Argentina, Russia, India, and Canada this year.\nThe US government got into the act in December 2007, with the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). Tucked inside it was a requirement that all general-purpose light bulbs that produce 310-2,600 lumens be 30% more energy efficient than then-current incandescent bulbs between 2012 and 2014, starting with standard 100-watt bulbs and working down to 40-watt bulbs.\nBy 2020, a second tier of restrictions would become effective, requiring all general-purpose bulbs to produce at least 45 lumens per watt (similar to current CFLs). Exemptions from the Act include reflector flood, three-way, candelabra, colored, appliance lamps, plant lights, stage lighting, and other specialty bulbs.\nMostly, they want to force you to change the light bulbs in your living room.\nThe near-term winner from all of this meddling thus far has been the CFL. However, there are quite a few dark horses in the race to fill the gap, and they're about to be thrust upon the market.\nThe Future of Light\nThe future is... well, bright.\nWhat technology will ultimately come to dominate the lighting market is still up for grabs, but in the near term, one possibility is incandescents redux. Once EISA was put in place, manufacturers of the traditional bulb tried any number of ways to make it more efficient. The first bulb to emerge from this push - Philips Lighting's Halogena Energy Saver - uses a special chamber to reflect formerly wasted heat back to the filament to provide additional lighting power. They're expensive, selling for about $5 apiece. But they're cheaper than many fluorescents and are also 30% more efficient than standard bulbs, bringing them into EISA compliance.\nLonger term, however, it's likely that both fluorescents and incandescents will go the way of the torch.\nOne potential replacement is electron-stimulated luminescence (ESL). It works through accelerated electrons hitting a phosphor surface, making the bulb glow in a process known as \"cathodoluminescence.\" The process is similar to that employed by your old computer monitor's cathode-ray tube (CRT). ESLs are mercury-free and have the same light quality as incandescent lamps, but are about 70% more energy efficient, produce 50% less heat, and are rated to last up to five times longer than incandescents.\nThe bulbs were developed by a small company, Vu1, and are new to the market, so they're rather hard to find at the moment. If you can locate one, a 65-watt equivalent will set you back about $20 - far from a valid economic substitute for the few dollars a standard light bulb will typically cost.\nBut the real challenger on the horizon is the LED (light emitting diode). These little dots of light have become familiar to many consumers because of their widespread use in automotive taillights and more recently their appearance in flat screen TVs.\nLEDs came out of electronics technology and are semiconductor based. They stimulate electrons to release energy in the form of photons, a process called \"electroluminescence.\"\nThey have been around since the 1960s, so adapting them to home lighting has taken some time. But the first commercial products are on the way. They're also mercury-free, more energy efficient than incandescents, and dimmable. They don't degrade with frequent on/off switching, and they're rated to last six times longer than CFLs. Right now, they are just beginning to appear in the marketplace; their main drawback is cost, about $20 apiece for a replacement bulb. Individual LEDs are cheap, down to a few pennies apiece from hundreds of dollars in the 1970s. However, stringing together a set of them - with the wiring required to make them work together and with a standard lighting socket - still costs quite a few dollars. That seems likely to come down as mass production sets in and the tech improves; thus many people have tabbed them as the bulb of the future. And we have to say, the new Switch LED bulb is nothing if not futuristic.\nIn truth, though, there's no telling what is going to catch on in the end - after all, an LED bulb may be rated for 20 years of life, but a lot of new innovation can happen over two decades. Something better could easily come along even before the first LEDs start to burn out.\nHoly Light Saber\nYes, it's just possible that one of those innovations is going to be laser lighting.\nThe first step along that road, so to speak, has been taken by BMW, which recently revealed that the company plans to outfit its cars with laser headlights \"within a few years.\"\nIf you're concerned about tooling down the highway and suddenly getting blasted by a laser that burns your retinas, BMW says, \"Don't be.\" The bluish laser beam isn't emitted directly, but is first converted by means of a fluorescent phosphor material inside the headlight into a pure white light that is suitable for use in road traffic and poses no risk to humans or animals. The emitted light would also be very bright and white, making it more comfortable to the eye.\nBecause it is a \"coherent\" light source, BMW says that laser lighting can produce a near-parallel beam with an intensity that is a thousand times greater than LEDs. At the same time, it requires only half the energy of LED headlights. Where LED lighting generates about 100 lumens per watt, the laser would generate around 170 lumens.\nThe diodes used in a laser light are also small, about 10 microns in length - far shorter than the one-millimeter-long, square-shaped cells used in LED lighting. This means that BMW could radically reduce the size of its headlights. The company says it has no plans to do so, but this raises some intriguing possibilities.\nOne can envision the day when a home or office is illuminated by a few tiny lights that consume almost no energy at all.\nNow there's a prospect that should please both consumers and meddlesome bureaucrats.\n[]To profit from exciting 21st-century breakthroughs like revolutionary new forms of lighting, you must avoid these three technology-investing myths .]\nBits & Bytes\nSolar Startup Sets New Efficiency Record (Technology Review)\nOne of the main drawbacks of using solar panels to generate more than just a small fraction of the world's electricity needs is their inefficiency, which makes their cost per kilowatt hour significantly above that of coal, gas, or nuclear power plants. Conventional silicon solar panels typically convert less than 15% of light into electricity. But a small startup out of Durham, North Carolina has just achieved an independently verified efficiency rating of 33.9% with its new concentrated gallium arsenide solar panel, marking the first time any solar module has been able to convert more than one-third of the sunlight that falls on it into electricity. These new solar cells still can't come close to competing with conventional methods of electricity generation, but it's an impressive advancement nonetheless.\nThe Mother of All Patent Troll Trials (Wired)\nEolas Technologies, an ostensibly Tyler, Texas-based company with 12 employees, is suing some of the largest Internet firms in the world (like Google and Amazon) for $600 million claiming - get this! - ownership of the \"interactive web.\" Michael Doyle, a biologist and chairman of Eolas, claims that he and a couple of colleagues actually patented the \"interactive web\" back in 1993. He argues that a program he created to allow doctors to view embryos over the nascent World Wide Web was the first program that allowed users to interact with images inside of a web-browser window. Doyle and his lawyers now claim he's owed royalties for the use of technologies such as watching online video and having a \"search suggestion\" pop up in a search bar. It may sound ridiculous, but apparently the situation was serious enough to motivate Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, to fly to Texas and testify in the case in an attempt to defeat the patent claims.\nMicron's CEO Dies in Tragic Plane Crash (Daily Tech)\nFinally, we would like to express our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Steven Appleton, longtime chairman and CEO of Micron Technology, who died in a plane crash late last week. Appleton was instrumental in Micron's diversification beyond DRAM and into non-volatile flash memory in an effort to drive future growth for the company and its global workforce of 20,000 employees.

If a CFL bulb lasts for longer than 50hrs, then the total life cycle energy consumption of the CFL will be lower than that of an incandescent bulb even though they are more complicated to make.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, lighting in the U.S. accounts for 22% of electricity consumption and costs American\u2019s $58 billion a year. If every American home replaced just one light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb (your everyday energy \u201cefficient\u201d bulb), we would save $600 million per year in energy costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 800,000 cars.\nThese numbers account for the life of the bulb though, not the entire life cycle of the bulb. The question of whether we can be more lighting efficient by using compact fluorescent bulbs needs an in depth analysis of how much energy is required to make and recycle the bulb. It\u2019s actually quite complex. Here\u2019s why.\nWhen evaluating energy consumption or CO2 emissions of a technology, the full lifecycle of the product should be considered, not just its lifetime productivity. A proper analysis should include the CO2 emissions or embodied energy associated with all of the raw materials, all of the transportation and distribution, the operation and finally the recycling or decommissioning of the product. You\u2019ll find a couple different names for this type of assessment popping up: energy return on energy invested (EROI), well-to-wheel (these two are typically used for fuels), dust-to-dust, cradle-to-grave or more correctly, life cycle analysis (LCA).\nThe LCA is what really matters when talking about energy consmption/CO2 emissions. You\u2019re probably familiar with the mother of all LCA debates: ethanol \u2013 does it produce more CO2 than gasoline over its lifetime, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a hugely important question since the wrong policy decisions are being made right now by politicians who just don\u2019t know. In the same sense as the ethanol lifecycle, you wouldn\u2019t think about oil from Alberta\u2019s oil sands without thinking about natural gas, water or strip mining, or about coal power without thinking mountain top removal.\nSo why is it that we only think about the lifetime of an energy efficient light bulb (in this article, a compact fluorescent light bulb, CFL) and not its dust-to-dust lifecycle?\nIt\u2019s likely because we\u2019re really only interested in our bottom line \u2013 the fact that energy efficient light bulbs use 13W instead of 60W, which could save us money. That, and because accounting for the total life cycle is notoriously difficult.\nKeeping in mind the time requirements and expertise required to do a lifecycle analysis, I\u2019m in no position to do one myself (and very few are), but luckily, I\u2019ve found people who are.\nThe dust-to-dust story - production\nIf you have a compact fluorescent light bulb, take a look at it. It\u2019s clearly more complex than your typical incandescent light bulb (your typical \u201cin-efficient\u201d bulb). The lamp tube of the CFL twirls in every-which direction, but there\u2019s also complexity underneath: Coating the inside of the tube is phosphor, floating around inside the tube is ~5mg of mercury vapour (not much compared to a typical mercury thermometer which has around 250mg). There\u2019s even a 24 component microchip (officially called the ballast) in every single CFL bulb! I tore one apart (carefully), this is what it looks like:\nA picture of my prematurely broken CFL bulb. Every CFL has one of these microchips (balasts). This one contains 24 components.\nCompare this to an incandescent bulb with a tungsten filament, is simple more beautiful?\nThe dust-to-dust story \u2013 lifetime\nThe lifetime of the compact fluorescent light bulb is where it really shines compared to the incandescent. An incandescent light bulb heats the tungsten filament by passing a current through it. This process sees 90-95% of the energy input going to heat and 5-10% going to light. In contrast, the CFL operates in a completely different way. Electricity is passed between two filament cathodes which stimulates mercury atoms to radiate ultraviolet radiation and heat. The UV radiation is transformed into light via the phosphor coating on the tube. With this process, about 25% of the energy input goes towards making light and 75% goes to heat.\nThe dust-to-dust story \u2013 end of life\nWhen your CFL dies, it\u2019s not recommended that you throw it out, this\u2019ll just increase the chances of the mercury getting out into the open. The mercury can be recycled or disposed of properly and there are specific CFL recycling programs in place. For incandescent, no guide lines, just throw it in the trash.\nThe tally\nAlthough difficult to come across, I found a life-cycle study comparing CFL bulbs to incandescent bulbs , written by Dutch researchers from the Technical University of Denmark. The total energy input for the production of a CFL light bulb comes to 1.7kWh compared to 0.3kWh for a single incandescent light bulb. The inputs are summarized in the figure below.\nEnergy input required to manufacture a CFL bulb, and incandescent bulb and 8 incandescent bulbs (a CFL bulb should last 8 times longer than an incandescent bulb)\nHere's a summary of the embodied energy in a light bulb (all numbers represent energy in kWh):\nCFL\n"}, {"score": 1772.4677, "uuid": "81c5f382-0ac0-5768-8a6c-2617f5b444f2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0612wb-77-09631", "target_hostname": "www.thewatt.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thewatt.com/?q=node/175", "page_rank": 1.5121172e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Compact <em>Fluorescent</em> <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> \u2013 A Tale From Dust to Dust | the Watt", "snippet": "So for every 1 compact <em>fluorescent</em> <em>bulb</em> that <em>is</em> made, 8 <em>incandescent</em> <em>bulbs</em> are made.

The lamp tube of the CFL twirls in every-which direction, but there\u2019s also complexity underneath: Coating the inside of the tube is phosphor, floating around inside the tube is ~5mg of mercury vapour (not much compared to a typical mercury thermometer which has around 250mg). There\u2019s even a 24 component microchip (officially called the ballast) in every single CFL bulb!

An incandescent light bulb heats the tungsten filament by passing a current through it. This process sees 90-95% of the energy input going to heat and 5-10% going to light. In contrast, the CFL operates in a completely different way. Electricity is passed between two filament cathodes which stimulates mercury atoms to radiate ultraviolet radiation and heat. The UV radiation is transformed into light via the phosphor coating on the tube. With this process, about 25% of the energy input goes towards making light and 75% goes to heat.\nThe dust-to-dust story \u2013 end of life\nWhen your CFL dies, it\u2019s not recommended that you throw it out, this\u2019ll just increase the chances of the mercury getting out into the open.

The relative importance of what happens in between depends not just on how it lived, but also how long it lived.\u201d - a Ben Kenney original\nNote: If you don't want to read all of this, here is the key point. If a CFL bulb lasts for longer than 50hrs, then the total life cycle energy consumption of the CFL will be lower than that of an incandescent bulb even though they are more complicated to make.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, lighting in the U.S. accounts for 22% of electricity consumption and costs American\u2019s $58 billion a year. If every American home replaced just one light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb (your everyday energy \u201cefficient\u201d bulb), we would save $600 million per year in energy costs and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 800,000 cars.\nThese numbers account for the life of the bulb though, not the entire life cycle of the bulb. The question of whether we can be more lighting efficient by using compact fluorescent bulbs needs an in depth analysis of how much energy is required to make and recycle the bulb. It\u2019s actually quite complex. Here\u2019s why.\nWhen evaluating energy consumption or CO2 emissions of a technology, the full lifecycle of the product should be considered, not just its lifetime productivity. A proper analysis should include the CO2 emissions or embodied energy associated with all of the raw materials, all of the transportation and distribution, the operation and finally the recycling or decommissioning of the product. You\u2019ll find a couple different names for this type of assessment popping up: energy return on energy invested (EROI), well-to-wheel (these two are typically used for fuels), dust-to-dust, cradle-to-grave or more correctly, life cycle analysis (LCA).\nThe LCA is what really matters when talking about energy consmption/CO2 emissions. You\u2019re probably familiar with the mother of all LCA debates: ethanol \u2013 does it produce more CO2 than gasoline over its lifetime, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a hugely important question since the wrong policy decisions are being made right now by politicians who just don\u2019t know.

When many of these small lights are grouped together, they make a light bulb with many advantages over both incandescent as well as fluorescent lighting. The one most commonly be used in the home setting is the GU10 LED light bulb. There are many reasons that make the GU10 LED light bulb a good choice when replacing bulbs in one\u2019s home. Compared with other light sources, the GU10 LED light bulb uses much less electricity, thus helping to reduce one\u2019s electrical bill. This kind of GU10 LED light bulb is also much more durable than an ordinary bulb. The materials used in the manufacturing process, making it much less likely to be broken out, this allows the homeowner to use it in areas where it may not be ideal for more fragile types of lighting. In addition, these kinds of GU10 LED light bulbs last approximately 20 times longer than traditional bulbs. The standard lights generally need to be replaced every six months to a year, but the GU10 LED light bulb will last up to seven years, or fifty thousand hours. An added benefit of using these lamps is their low level of heat. Unlike the incandescent bulbs, the GU10s do not produce much heat, making them much safer to use in the home setting.\nCopyright \u00a9 2011-2012 by AGICO GROUP All Rights Reserved.\nTel: (86) 372 5081976 Fax: (86) 372 5951936 E-mail: sale@chineselight.com\n"}, {"score": 1759.7943, "uuid": "5c193c35-2a68-5ef6-8955-03830f263b09", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1408wb-93-14115", "target_hostname": "www.chineselight.com", "target_uri": "http://www.chineselight.com/E27-LED-Light-Bulb/LED-Bulb-Light-GL-E27-005.html", "page_rank": 1.2100022e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "LED <em>Bulb</em> <em>Light</em>, Multicolor LED <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> China", "snippet": "* A Few Limitations of Buying T8 <em>Fluorescent</em> Tubes * LigLighting Designer Creates a Wonderful World with LED Lighting Fixtures LED <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em> are much <em>better</em> than the traditional lamps in the energy-saving aspect.", "explanation": null, "document": "Waterproof Grade: No\nPrice:\nLED light bulbs are much better than the traditional lamps in the energy-saving aspect.

There is no doubt at all that they save you money over the life of the lamp. A halogen bulb uses about half the energy of a conventional light bulb to generate the same amount of light.\nLightbulb types\nFluorescent light sources (contain gases in a tube but have no filament). These have been around for many years and are better known as the long white tubes commonly seen in utility ceilings. Recent technology has reduced the size and improved the efficiency. Many different shapes and power options are available.\nThe benefits are low power consumption (around 20% of a conventional light bulb) and long life (up to 8000 hours). They are ideal for lights which need to be kept on for a long time. Many people assume fluorescent light is 'cold' but 'warm white' lamps are available which improve the colour.\nIncandescent light sources (conventional filament bulbs)\nThese are the conventional bulbs which we all recognise and their chief advantage is the colour of light they emit. Colours of objects are generally more accurate with this type of light bulb and they impart a warm feeling to a room.\nThe disadvantage is that they are inefficient by modern standards and have a relatively short life (around 1000 hours).\nIncandescent lamps come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a number of different fittings:\nBayonet cap (BC), Small Bayonet cap (SBC), Edison screw (ES or E27) and Small Edison Screw (SES or E14). The Edison screw types are becoming more popular in the UK.\nSeveral different coatings are also available with the following properties: Pearl is an all over frosting which diffuses the light and is best used in a light fitting with shades.\nClear bulbs are more attractive when used in fittings where the bulb is visible or a sparkle is required such as crystal chandeliers\nReflector bulbs have a silvered surface to direct the light in a certain direction and are usually intended for direction fittings such as spot lights.\nHalogen light sources (filament bulbs containing halogen gas)\nHalogen bulbs produce a very attractive light which closely resembles sunlight. They are more efficient than incandescent bulbs using only half the energy to produce the same light output and last twice as long.\nGenerally they are small lamps which generate a lot of heat so they can only be used in light fittings designed to cope with the higher temperatures.\nThere are two main types of halogen lamp available in the domestic market:\nLow voltage. These lamps operate on 12V which means a transformer has to be fitted either in the light fitting itself or remotely. The advantages of the lower power are that the safer voltage enables manufacturers to produce interesting and slim designs without the need to protect against danger from higher voltages. Transformers can be either electronic or 'wire wound'. The newer electronic transformers are more energy efficient and smaller but more expensive than the conventional wire wound type. Electronic transformers can be damaged by voltage 'spikes' in the mains supply (sometimes referred to as 'dirty mains'). These spikes can be caused by fluorescent lights, older motors, fridges, lift shaft motors etc. If persistent problems occur the use of mains voltage lighting is recommended.\nMains voltage. This relatively new breed of lamps offers the light colour advantage of halogen without the need to house a transformer. The reflector type bulbs are known as GU10 or GZ10 and the latest small envelope non-reflector halogens are known as G9.\nDimmers. Most tungsten and halogen light fixtures are dimmable but only certain types of fluorescent can be dimmed. When installing a dimmer you should check on the compatibility of the fitting with the dimming device and that the dimmer has sufficient capacity to control the load on the circuit.\nKey to Bulb Types\nBC/B22 GLS bayonet cap general light service\nBC/B22 GB bayonet cap golf ball\nBC/B22 CNDL bayonet cap candle\nSBC/B15 GB small bayonet cap golf ball\nSBC/B15 CNDL small bayonet cap candle\nES/E27 GLS Edison screw general light service\nES/E27 GB Edison screw golf ball\nSES/E14 GB small Edison screw golf ball\nSES/E14 CNDL small Edison screw candle\n12V Halogen\n"}], [{"score": 1738.5508, "uuid": "00f3bc16-b929-502f-9836-236887a661ab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0106wb-67-03259", "target_hostname": "www.expresslightbulbs.com", "target_uri": "http://www.expresslightbulbs.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=682_2", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Metal Halide <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em>", "snippet": "Compared to other <em>light</em> sources like <em>fluorescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em> and <em>incandescent</em> <em>bulbs</em>, the metal halide <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> <em>is</em> very efficient, generating 65 -115 lumens per watt, <em>which</em> make them a cost saving and less wasteful option.

The lights come in many sizes, shape and types. We also carry Probe Start Metal Halide Lamps which are also commonly known as Pulse Start Metal Halide Lamps. You will not find better service, support and quality from any other Metal Halide supplier anywhere.\nAdvantages of Metal Halide Light Bulbs\nMetal halide lamps provide several unique characteristics. Metal halide lamps have an average life span of 15000 to 20000 hours, which is more than ten times that of the traditional incandescent light bulbs, saving you maintenance costs. Metal Halide bulbs also provide an output that is much closer to natural light than other lamps. This white light produced by MH light bulbs is preferable by a lot of people since it provides better visual acuity, even at low light levels.\nThe color temperature given off by metal halide lamps has a very wide range \u0096 from about 2700 Kelvin to 20000 Kelvin, meaning that almost any color temperature desired can be achieved including blue, green, aqua and pink. MH lamps offer an excellent color rendering index of 65 \u0096 90 CRI which is more than the average value for most other light sources.\nThe compact size of metal halide light bulbs means that a high light level is generated from a compact light source, providing smaller, more controllable luminaries. The metal halide lamp is also extremely versatile. It is relatively unaffected by ambient temperature and so can be used for both indoor and outdoor applications. They also come in extensive style and wattage options which allows for many different uses. Compared to other light sources like fluorescent light bulbs and incandescent bulbs, the metal halide light bulb is very efficient, generating 65 -115 lumens per watt, which make them a cost saving and less wasteful option. However, this is not just about saving money. Widespread use of MH light bulbs will have a positive effect on air quality and the environment in general. This is because lower electrical power generating requirements means less air pollution from power stations and the long life and efficiency of the halide bulb translates to less landfill waste generated.\nIt is also useful to compare metal halide light bulbs with other types of light sources available. As compared to incandescent lights, a 100-watt halide lamp provides five times the lumen output of a 100-watt incandescent bulb, lasting twenty times longer. The incandescent bulb may have a lower initial cost, but the metal halide bulb has a much lower overall cost over its total life because it is five times more efficient.\nVapor mercury lamps also have a long life but are not nearly as efficient as the metal halide bulbs, producing 35 \u0096 58 lumens per watt compared to the 65 \u0096 115 lumens per watt of the MH bulbs. Mercury Vapor lights are also limited to the blue/green spectrum, having a lower (CRI) color rendering index. The metal halide light bulb provides light that is closer to sunlight than any other high intensity discharge (HID) light source.\nHigh pressure sodium (HPS) lamps are another type of HID light which have a long life. However, they do not provide the same light quality as metal halide light bulbs because they only give off the strong yellow light of the spectrum, which is about 2200 Kelvin due to their sodium content. The color rendering index of HPS lights is also very poor at about 20 -25 CRI. Metal halide lamps on the other hand provide the full spectrum of light with a much higher CRI.\nFluorescent light bulbs are usually much longer and thus can be less directed than metal halide bulbs which are compact and easily controllable as earlier mentioned. A single 100-watt halide bulb will provide the same light as three 48 inch high output fluorescent lamps. Fluorescent lamps are often limited in the temperature range in which they can perform, performing optimally in indoor applications at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit, and this degrades as the temperature varies. Metal halide bulbs are able to tolerate a wider range of operating temperature conditions.\nHalide light bulbs can be applied in a wide range of areas, used both for general industrial purposes and for specific applications requiring a specific UV or blue-frequency light. A common use is for indoor gardening since they produce the spectrum and temperature of light which encourages plant growth. They are also used in athletic facilities like gyms and squash courts, and also popular with reef aquarists who need high intensity light for their corals. MH lamps also have widespread use in high end professional lighting fixtures, especially in intelligent lighting where they are commonly known as MSD lights. In these applications they are used in 150-, 250-, 575-, and 1200-watt ratings.\nAll MH bulbs require ballasts with which regulate the current flowing through the arc of the lamp and deliver the right voltage to the arc. The most common are the electrical ballasts. The probe start metal halide bulbs contain a starting electrode in the light bulb which initiates the arc when turned on, generating a slight flicker in the process. Pulse start metal halide light bulbs use a special starting circuit known as the igniter to generate a high voltage pulse to the operating electrodes. The American national Standards Institute (ANSI) has established parameters for all halide bulbs except for some newer products.\nThere are a few electronic ballasts available now for MH light bulbs. These offer more precise management of the lamp\u0092s wattage, providing more consistent color and a longer life. Electronic ballasts are also known to increase the efficiency, or in other words, reduce the electrical usage of the halide bulb. Although, high frequency operations may not necessarily increase the light\u0092s efficiency (as with high output or very high output fluorescent bulbs), it may allow for specially designed dimming metal halide ballast systems.\nMH bulbs were hitherto preferred to mercury vapor lights in uses where a more natural light was required because of the whiter light produced by mercury vapor lights. The differences are not as great today with some Metal Halide bulbs providing very white light with a color rendering of up to 80 CRI. Specialized metal halide mixtures are now available which can have a color temperature of as low as 3000 Kelvin, which is very yellow; to as high as 20000 Kelvin, which is very blue. Some of these specializations are targeted for use by indoor gardeners for their growing plants; and for use in indoor aquariums to benefit animals. Because of tolerances in the manufacturing process, color temperature can vary slightly between lights such that the color properties of metal halide lamps cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy. The standards set by ANSI specify that the color specification of metal halide bulbs can only be measured after the bulb might have been seasoned (or burned) for 100 hours. With probe start MH bulbs, a color temperature variance of, give-or-take 300 Kelvin may be recorded, while with the newer pulse start technology, the variance observed is less.\nThe color temperature of a metal halide bulb may also be affected by the electrical system which is powering it. An underpowered halide bulb will have a color temperature closer to that given off by mercury vapor lights. This is because the temperature of the light will be cooler and as such the halide salts, which are responsible for the warmer reds and yellows, will not reach complete vaporization and ionization. The more easily ionized mercury will then dominate, resulting in a cooler, bluer output. With an overpowered halide bulb, the reverse will be the case, but this condition is not desirable and is potentially dangerous as it could lead to arc-tuber rupture. The color properties of metal halide light bulbs may change over their lifetime and it can be noticed that where there is a large installation of MH bulbs, no two will be exactly the same color.\nWhen a metal halide light bulb is started at below its operating temperature, it cannot begin providing light at its full capacity. This is because the temperature and pressure within the inner arc require time to reach full operating levels. This may take a few seconds, and even up to five minutes, depending on the type of lamp. As the various metal halides vaporize in the arc chamber, the MH lamp will exhibit different colors. The MH bulb\u0092s arc will go out if power is interrupted however briefly, and the high pressure within the hot arc tube will prevent re-striking of the arc. Because a cool-down period of five to ten minutes is required to restart the halide bulb, it is a major concern where prolonged lighting interruption could create process shut-downs or safety issues. However, some few metal halide bulbs have an instant re-strike capability in which the lamp, ballast and socket are built to withstand the 30000 volts required to re-ignite the lamp via a separate anode wire.\nWhen metal halide light bulbs reach the end of their life, they display a phenomenon known as cycling in which the light glows for a while and the goes out, repeatedly. The cause of this is that when the lamps are old, the voltage required to maintain the arc exceeds the voltage provided by the ballast. When the halide bulb heats up to the point where the maintaining voltage is higher than that provided by the ballast, the arc fails and the light goes out. Some more sophisticated ballast designs recognize cycling and do not attempt to restart the best metal halide bulb after a few attempts. This phenomenon is what is commonly seen in your neighborhood when a street light turns off, and back on again, after it has cooled.\nThere are some dangers and other effects in the use of metal halide lamps in relation to humans. Some people have noticed a temporary blurring of vision after very brief close range exposure to metal halide lighting which could be linked to Photokeratitis, or snow blindness \u0096 a result of unprotected exposure to ultraviolet radiation. MH lamps using a quartz arc tube are also susceptible to explosion at the end of life as the corrosive effects of the halide salts degrade the quartz over its life. A universal position halide bulb which is mounted horizontally also has an increased risk of explosion because of higher arc wall temperatures. Mechanical shock and leaving the MH bulb on all day are other situations which may cause explosion. To remedy these, an MH bulb should be turned of for at least 15 minutes each week and a quartz shroud may be used for added protection, and also to reduce ions escaping through the arc tube wall in the case of quartz metal halide light bulbs.\n"}, {"score": 1736.2128, "uuid": "4cd68a63-9150-5da4-ba62-3a3e82b708e4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1612wb-07-10153", "target_hostname": "www.edinformatics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.edinformatics.com/inventions_inventors/incandescent_light_bulb.htm", "page_rank": 1.1780914e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Incandscent <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em>", "snippet": "A <em>fluorescent</em> lamp, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> approximately four times more efficient (about 40%) than an <em>incandescent</em> lamp (about 10%), will produce one-sixth of the heat, assuming the same levels of <em>light</em> from both sources.", "explanation": null, "document": "Great Inventions --Great Inventors\nIncandescent light bulb\nThe incandescent light bulb ( archaically known as the electric lamp) uses a glowing wire filament heated to white-hot by electrical resistance , to generate light (a process known as thermal radiation or incandescence ). The bulb is the glass enclosure which keeps the filament in a vacuum or low- pressure noble gas , or a halogen gas in the case of quartz -halogen lamps (see below) in order to prevent oxidisation of the filament at high temperatures. In Australia a light bulb is also called a light globe, but this term is not used elsewhere.\nBecause of its poor efficiency and yellowish color, it is being gradually replaced in many applications by fluorescent lights , high-intensity discharge lamps , LEDs , and other devices.\nHistory of the light bulb\nThe invention of the light bulb is sometimes attributed to Thomas Alva Edison , who made contributions to its development producing a practical and viable electric lamp and succeeded in marketing the device, but today it is well-known that Heinrich G\u00f6bel built functional bulbs three decades earlier. Many others also contributed to the development of a truly practical device for the production of electrically generated lighting.\nIn 1801 Sir Humphry Davy , an English chemist, made platinum strips glow by passing an electric current through them, but the strips evaporated too quickly to make a useful lamp. In 1809 he created the first arc lamp , which he demonstrated to the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1810 , by creating a small but blinding arc between two charcoal rods connected to a battery .\nIn 1820 a British scientist Warren De la Rue enclosed a platinum coil in an evacuated tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain less gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although it was an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use.\nIn 1835 James Bowman Lindsay demonstrated a constant electric light at a public meeting in Dundee. He stated that he could \"read a book at a distance of one and a half feet\". However having perfected the device, to his own satisfaction, he turned to the problem of wireless telegraphy and did not develop the electric light any further.\nIn 1841 Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first patent for an incandescent lamp, with a design using powdered charcoal heated between two platinum wires.\nIn 1854 , the German inventor Heinrich G\u00f6bel developed the first 'modern' light bulb: a carbonised bamboo filament, in a vacuum bottle to prevent oxidation. In the following five years he developed what many call the first practical light bulb. His lamps lasted for up to 400 hours. He did not immediately apply for a patent, but his priority was established in 1893.\nJoseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914) was a physicist and chemist born in Sunderland, England. In 1850 he began working with carbonised paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860 he was able to demonstrate a working device but lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and inefficient light. By the mid-1870s better pumps became available, and Swan returned to his experiments. Swan received a British patent for his device in 1878. Swan reported success to the Newcastle Chemical Society and at a lecture in Newcastle in February 1879 he demonstrated a working lamp that utilised a carbon fibre filament. The most significant feature of Swan's lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England and by the early 1880s had started his own company.\nAcross the Atlantic , parallel developments were also taking place. On July 24 , 1874 a Canadian patent was filed for the Woodward and Evan's Light by a Toronto medical electrician named Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans , who was described in the patent as a \"Gentleman\" but in reality a hotel keeper. They built their lamp with a shaped rod of carbon held between electrodes in a glass globe filled with nitrogen . Woodward and Evans found it impossible to raise financial support for the development of their invention and in 1875 Woodward sold a share of their Canadian patent to Thomas Edison .\nUS223898 Electric Lamp\nEdison purchased the Woodward and Evans patent and had a team of developers search for an alternative filament material. Eventually he used a carbon filament that burned for forty hours (first successful test was on October 21 , 1879 ; it lasted 13.5 hours). Edison continued to improve their design. The original spiral carbon-filament is shown and repeatedly referred to in his initial light patent. By 1880 he had a device that could last for over 1200 hours using a bamboo-derived filament, longer than the 400 hours of Heinrich G\u00f6bel 's earlier light bulb.\nIn January 1882 , Lewis Latimer received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons,\" an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments which yielded longer lasting bulbs than Edison's technique.\nIn Britain, Swan took Edison to court for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company. Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.\nThe United States Patent Office had ruled on October 8 , 1883 that Edison's patents were based on the prior art of William Sawyer and were invalid. Litigation continued for a number of years. Eventually on October 6 , 1889 , a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid. Research exposed in \" A Streak of Luck \" by Robert Conot ( 1979 ), shows that Edison and his attorneys hid significant information from the judge . They cut out the October 7-21, 1879 section of a notebook that the judge might have determined showed that they were simply extending Sawyer's (or Swan's) work with carbon \"burners\" or \"rods\" in an evacuated glass bulb.\nEdison and his team did not find a commercially workable filament (bamboo) until more than 6 months after Edison filed the patent application. The weak and short lived (40 to 150 hours) carbon filament was eventually superseded by the tungsten filament. In 1903 Willis Whitnew invented a filament that would not blacken the inside of a light bulb. It was a metal-coated carbon filament. In 1906 , the General Electric Company was the first to patent a method of making tungsten filaments for use in incandescent lightbulbs. The filaments were costly, but by 1910 William David Coolidge ( 1873 - 1975 ) had invented an improved method of making tungsten filaments. The tungsten filament outlasted all other types of filaments and Coolidge made the costs practical.\nOne of the major problems of the standard electric light bulb is evaporation of the filament. The inevitable variations in resistivity along the filament cause nonuniform heating, with \u0091hot spots\u0092 forming at higher resistivity. Thinning by evaporation increases resistivity. But hot spots evaporate faster, increasing their resistivity faster\u0097a positive feedback which ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament. Irving Langmuir suggested that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation and still avoid combustion, and so ordinary incandescent light bulbs are now filled with nitrogen , argon , or krypton .\nA typical filament light bulb lasts about 1000 hours. See the section below, Voltage, light output, and life, for a discussion of the tradeoffs involved in setting a lamp life specification.\n[ edit ]\nThe halogen lamp\nHalogen light bulb capsule (center) with an integrated dichroic reflector . This integrated design is referred to as an \"MR16\" package (Miniature Reflector, 16 eighths of an inch in diameter). A permanently-integrated UV filter is frequently included.\nThe problem of short bulb life is addressed in the halogen lamp which is filled with a halogen gas such as iodine or bromine . This creates an equilibrium reaction where evaporated filament is chemically re-deposited at the hot-spots, preventing the early failure of the lamp. This allows halogen lamps to be run at higher temperatures which would cause unacceptable low lamp lifetimes in ordinary light bulbs, allowing for greater brightness and efficiency.\nBecause the lamp envelope must be very hot for this to work, the envelopes are made of quartz glass instead of ordinary glass, which would soften and flow too much at these temperatures. Thus halogen lamps are sometimes called tungsten halogen lamps and are sometimes called quartz halogen lamps. They were once called quartz iodine lamps.\nPerhaps the most significant side effect of using quartz instead of ordinary glass is that the lamp becomes a source of UV-B light, because the quartz is transparent to this spectral range and ordinary glass is not. One consequence is that it is possible to get a sunburn from excess exposure to the light of a quartz halogen lamp. Quartz halogen lamps are used in some scientific instruments as UV-B light sources.\nBecause the quartz is hot, and poses a danger of fire or burns , and because of the risk from UV exposure, these lamps are usually protected by a filter of ordinary glass, which, as noted above, absorbs most of the UV-B light.\nThe quartz glass can be damaged by residue from fingerprints . These bulbs should be handled without touching the quartz capsule (the actual light bulb). If the quartz capsule is touched, it must be cleaned with rubbing alcohol .\nThe incandescent light bulb is still widely used in domestic applications, and is the basis of most portable lighting (for instance, some car headlamps and electric torches ). Halogen lights have become more common in auto headlights and domestic situations, particularly where light is to be concentrated on a particular point. The fluorescent light , has, however, replaced many applications of the light bulb with its superior life and energy efficiency. LED lights are beginning to see increased home and auto use, replacing incandescent bulbs. Newer headlights are going to high-intensity discharge lighting , such as halogen metal oxide , which look purplish instead of yellowish.\nStandard fittings\nMost domestic and industrial light bulbs have standard fittings compatible with standard lampholders. The most common types of fitting are:\nMES or medium Edison screw (aka E26), used in the USA and Japan for most 120 and 100 volt lamps\nBC or double-contact bayonet cap, used in the UK , Ireland and Australia for most 240 volt mains lamps (although MES is also common in the UK)\nE14 / E27 screw fittings, used in continental Europe . (E27 is very similar to MES, but not identical.)\nIn each designation , the E stands for Edison, who created the screw-base lamp, and the number is in millimetres . (This is true even in the United States, where other designations involving the diameter of the bulb itself are still given in eighths of an inch .) In North America , there are four standard sizes of screw-in sockets used for line-voltage lamps: candelabra (E12), intermediate (E17), medium or standard (E26), and mogul (E39). In continental Europe , these are instead slightly different: candelabra (E10 or E11), intermediate (E14), medium or standard (E27), and mogul (E40). There is also a rare \"admedium\" size (E29), and a very miniature size (E5), generally used only for low voltage applications such as with a battery . Bayonet bulbs have similar sizes, and are given a B designation.\nHalogen bulbs often come inside one of these standard bulbs, but also come with pin bases. These are given a G designation, with the number being the centre-to-centre distance in millimetres.\nEfficiency\nLuminous efficiency is defined as the ratio of luminous flux to total radiated flux, and is measured in lumen per watt (lm/W) or as a percentage of 683 lm/W, the efficiency of a monochromatic source of wavelength 555 nm (a yellow-green colour to which the human eye is most sensitive).\nA different measure, the overall luminous efficiency, is defined as the ratio of luminous flux to total energy input. This is less than or equal to the luminous efficiency.\nCategory\n"}, {"score": 1731.109, "uuid": "e7d49aa2-a277-5cfb-a00b-ff17524b512d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0817wb-26-09676", "target_hostname": "www.esplighting.com", "target_uri": "http://www.esplighting.com/92102.html", "page_rank": 1.2043544e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Lights</em> of America 100W <em>fluorescent</em> super flood <em>light</em>", "snippet": "Often <em>fluorescent</em> <em>or</em> compact <em>fluorescent</em> <em>bulbs</em> are also called <em>incandescent</em> replacement <em>or</em> halogen replacement <em>or</em> energy efficient <em>fluorescent</em> <em>bulbs</em>. <em>Lights</em> of America products save money for you by reducing energy bills with <em>fluorescent</em> technology.", "explanation": null, "document": "Home > Fluorex Outdoor Fixtures > Lights of America 100W fluorescent super flood light (92102)\nFLUORESCENT FLOOD LIGHT\n100 Watt Fluorescent Area Light\n1000 watts of light output - 80%* lower operating costs - bulb lasts 13 times longer**\nLights of America 100W fluorescent super flood light (92102)\nItem# 92102\nQty:\nProduct Description\nThis is our most powerful floodlight!

This light was produced through different means\u00e2torches, candles, oil and gas lamps. Besides the danger presented by an open flame (especially when used indoors), these sources of light also provided insufficient illumination.\nThe first attempts at using electric light were made by English chemist Sir Humphry Davy. In 1802, Davy showed that electric currents could heat thin strips of metal to white heat, thus producing light. This was the beginning of incandescent (defined as glowing with intense heat) electric light. The next major development was the arc light. This was basically two electrodes, usually made of carbon, separated from each other by a short air space. Electric current applied to one of the electrodes flowed to and through the other electrode resulting in an arc of light across the air space. Arc lamps (or light bulbs) were used mainly in outdoor lighting; the race was still on among a large group of scientists to discover a useful source of indoor illumination.\nThe primary difficulty holding back the development of a commercially viable incandescent light was finding suitable glowing elements. Davy found that platinum was the only metal that could produce white heat for any length of time. Carbon was also used, but it oxidized quickly in air. The answer was to develop a vacuum that would keep air away from the elements, thus preserving the light-producing materials.\nThomas A. Edison, a young inventor working in Menlo Park, New Jersey, began working on his own form of electric light in the 1870s. In 1877 Edison became involved with the rush for a satisfactory electric light source, devoting his initial involvement to confirming the reasons for his competitors' failures. He did, however, determine that platinum made a much better burner than carbon. Working with platinum, Edison obtained his first patent in April of 1879 on a relatively impractical lamp, but he continued searching for an element that could be heated efficiently and economically.\nEdison also tinkered with the other components of the lighting system, including building his own power source and devising a breakthrough wiring system that could handle a number of lamps burning at the same time. His most important discovery, however, was the invention of a suitable filament. This was a very thin, threadlike wire that offered high resistance to the passage of electric currents. Most of the early filaments burned out very quickly, thus rendering these lamps commercially useless. To solve this problem, Edison began again to try carbon as a means of illumination.\nHe finally selected carbonized cotton thread as his filament material. The filament was clamped to platinum wires that would carry current to and from the filament. This assembly was then placed in a glass bulb that was fused at the neck (called sealing-in). A vacuum pump removed the air from the bulb, a slow but crucial step. Lead-in wires that would be connected to the electrical current protruded from the glass bulb.\nOn October 19, 1879, Edison ran his first test of this new lamp. It ran for two days and 40 hours (October 21\u00e2the day the filament finally burned out\u00e2is the usual date given for the invention of the first commercially practical lamp). Of course, this original lamp underwent a number of revisions. Manufacturing plants were set up to mass produce light bulbs and great advances were made in wiring and electrical current systems. However, today's incandescent light bulbs greatly resemble Edison's original lamps. The major differences are the use of tungsten filaments, various gases for higher efficiency and increased lumination resulting from filaments heated to higher temperatures.\nAlthough the incandescent lamp was the first and certainly the least expensive type of light bulb, there are a host of other light bulbs that serve myriad uses:\nTungsten halogen lamps\nFluorescent lamps are glass tubes that contain mercury vapor and argon gas. When electricity flows through the tube, it causes the vaporized mercury to give off ultraviolet energy. This energy then strikes phosphors that coat the inside of the lamp, giving off visible light.\nMercury vapor lamps have two bulbs\u00e2the arc tube (made of quartz) is inside a protecting glass bulb. The arc tube contains mercury vapor at a higher pressure than that of the fluorescent lamp, thus allowing the vapor lamp to produce light without using the phosphor coating.\nNeon lamps are glass tubes, filled with neon gas, that glow when an electric discharge takes place in them. The color of the light is determined by the gas mixture; pure neon gas gives off red light.\nMetal halide lamps, used primarily outdoors for stadiums and roadways, contain chemical compounds of metal and halogen. This type of lamp works in much the same fashion as the mercury vapor lamps except that metal halide can produce a more natural color balance when used without phosphors.\nHigh-pressure sodium lamps are also similar to mercury vapor lamps; however, the arc tube is made of aluminum oxide instead of quartz, and it contains a solid mixture of sodium and mercury.\nThomas A. Edison (center, with cap) with workers in his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. The photo was taken in 1880.\nMore than twenty inventors, dating back to the 1830s, had produced incandescent electric lights by the time Thomas Edison entered the search. The 1870s was the crucial decade, as the technologies of production and the forces of demand combined to make the search for a commercially feasible electric light the high-tech, high-stakes race of the era. Edison had established his research laboratory in rural Menlo Park, New Jersey, midway between New York City and Philadelphia. The laboratory building and several outbuildings were constructed in 1876 with profits Edison had made with his telegraph inventions. He initially intended to take projects from any investor who wanted his help and to continue working on his own ideas in telegraph and telephone systems. He said he thought the laboratory could produce a new invention every ten days and a major breakthrough every six months.\nIn 1877, Edison decided to enter the highly publicized race for a successful light bulb and enlarged his laboratory facilities with a machine shop and an office and research library. The staff grew from 12 to over 60 as Edison tackled the entire lighting system, from generator to insulator to incandescent bulb. Along the way, Edison created a new process of invention, orchestrating a team approach that brought financing, materials, tools, and skilled workers together into an \"invention factory.\" Thus, the search for the light bulb illustrated new forms of research and development that were later developed by General Electric, Westinghouse, and other companies.\nWilliam S. Pretzer\n.\nRaw Materials\nThis section as well as the following one (The Manufacturing Process) will focus on incandescent light bulbs. As mentioned earlier, many different materials were used for the filament until tungsten became the metal of choice during the early part of the twentieth century. Although extremely fragile,\nImage Pop-Up\nOne of the main components in a light bulb, the filament, is prepared by mixing tungsten and binder and then drawing the mixture into a fine wire around a steel mandrel. Aher heating the wire and then dissolving the mandrel with acid, the filament assumes its proper coiled shape.\ntungsten filaments can withstand temperatures as high as 4500 degrees Fahrenheit (2480 degrees Celsius) and above. The development of the tungsten filaments is considered the greatest advancement in light bulb technology because these filaments could be produced cheaply and last longer than any of the previous materials.\nThe connecting or lead-in wires are typically made of nickel-iron wire (called dumet because it uses two metals). This wire is dipped into a borax solution to make the wire more adherent to glass. The bulb itself is made of glass and contains a mixture of gases, usually argon and nitrogen, which increase the life of the filament. Air is pumped out of the bulb and replaced with the gases. A standardized base holds the entire assembly in place. The base, known as the \"Edison screw base,\" was originally made of brass and insulated with plaster of paris and, later, porcelain. Today, aluminum is used on the outside and glass is used to insulate the inside of the base, producing a stronger base.\nThe Manufacturing Process\nThe uses of light bulbs range from street lights to automobile headlights to flashlights. For each use, the individual bulb differs in size and wattage, which determine the amount of light the bulb gives off (lumens). However, all incandescent light bulbs have the three basic parts\u00e2the filament, the bulb and the base. Originally produced by hand, the light bulb manufacture is now almost entirely automated.\nFilament\n1 The filament is manufactured through a process known as drawing, in which tungsten is mixed with a binder material and pulled through a die\u00e2a shaped orifice\u00e2into a fine wire. Next, the wire is wound around a metal bar called a mandrel in order to mold it into its proper coiled shape, and then it is heated in an process known as annealing. This process softens the wire and makes its structure more uniform. The mandrel is then dissolved in acid.\n2 The coiled filament is attached to the lead-in wires. The lead-in wires have hooks at their ends which are either pressed over the end of the filament or, in larger bulbs, spot-welded.\nGlass bulb\n3 The glass bulbs or casings are produced using a ribbon machine. After heating in\nVirtually the entire light bulb manufacturing process is automated. The glass bulbs are blown by a ribbon machine that can produce more than 50,000 bulbs per hour. After the filament and stem assembly are inserted into the bulb, the air inside the bulb is evacuated and an argon/nitrogen mixture is pumped in. Finally, the base is sealed on.\na furnace, a continuous ribbon of glass moves along a conveyor belt. Precisely aligned air nozzles blow the glass through holes in the conveyor belt into molds, creating the casings. A ribbon machine moving at top speed can produce more than 50,000 bulbs per hour. After the casings are blown, they are cooled and then cut off of the ribbon machine. Next, the inside of the bulb is coated with silica to remove the glare caused by a glowing, uncovered filament. The company emblem and bulb wattage are then stamped onto the outside top of each casing.\nBase\n4 The base of the bulb is also constructed using molds. It is made with indentations in the shape of a screw so that it can easily fit into the socket of a light fixture.\nAssembly\n5 Once the filament, base, and bulb are made, they are fitted together by machines. First, the filament is mounted to the stem assembly, with its ends clamped to the two lead-in wires. Next, the air inside the bulb is evacuated, and the casing is filled with an argon and nitrogen mixture. These gases ensure a longer-life for the filament. The tungsten will eventually evaporate and break. As it evaporates, it leaves a dark deposit on the bulb known as bulb-wall blackening.\n6 Finally, the base and the bulb are sealed. The base slides onto the end of the glass bulb such that no other material is needed to keep them together. Instead, their conforming shapes allow the two pieces to be held together snugly, with the lead-in wires touching the aluminum base to ensure proper electrical contact. After testing, bulbs are placed in their packages and shipped to consumers.\nQuality Control\nLight bulbs are tested for both lamp life and strength. In order to provide quick results, selected bulbs are screwed into life test racks and lit at levels far exceeding their normal burning strength. This provides an accurate reading on how long the bulb will last under normal conditions. Testing is performed at all manufacturing plants as well as at some independent testing facilities. The average life of the majority of household light bulbs is 750 to 1000 hours, depending on wattage.\nThe Future\nThe future of the incandescent light bulb is uncertain. While heating a filament until it glows is certainly a satisfactory way to produce light, it is extremely inefficient: about 95 percent of the electricity supplied to a typical light bulb is converted to heat, not light. In a world with dwindling resources, where energy conservation is increasingly vital, this inefficiency may eventually make the incandescent light bulb impractical.\nThere are other light sources already in use that could supplant the incandescent bulb. Fluorescent tubes, for instance, already dominate the industrial market, and undoubtedly they will find increasing use as a domestic light source as well. Fluorescent bulbs use at least 75 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs and can last twenty times longer. The recent development of \"compact\" fluorescent bulbs, which unlike the standard fluorescent tube can screw into a typical domestic lamp, may expand the domestic market for fluorescent lighting.\nAnother recent development is the \"radio-wave bulb,\" a bulb that creates light by transmitting energy from a radio-wave generator to a mercury cloud, which in turn produces ultraviolet light. A phosphor coating on the bulb then converts the ultraviolet light into visible light. Such bulbs use only 25 percent as much energy as incandescent bulbs, and they can last a decade or more. They are also completely interchangeable with incandescent bulbs.\nWhere To Learn More\nFriedel, Robert. Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention.

Cutting energy use means that our electrical utilities have to generate less energy and produce less pollution, which means less impact on the Creation. Incandescent bulbs have not changed much since Thomas Edison invented them more than a century ago. They put out light by heating a metal filament until it is white-hot. But they also put out heat, wasting energy that isn\u2019t putting out light and even raising air conditioning costs in the summer.\nIn the 1980\u2019s, the fluorescent light tubes that were used primarily in industrial settings received a makeover for more widespread application. Engineers figured out how to reduce the size of the tube by curling it so that it is the approximate size of the old incandescent bulb and can fit into the same socket. Most importantly, it uses much less power. A 13-watt CFL produces about the same light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb, and a 25-watt CFL is as bright as a 100-watt incandescent.\nIt\u2019s true that the CFL bulb costs more up front. But an Energy Star CFL lasts up to 10 times longer. In the end the reduced energy costs will mean that purchasing and using a CFL costs less than a third as much as purchasing and using the old dinosaur bulb. Here\u2019s a comparison of costs based on 10,000 hours of light (nearly 7 years if the light is on 4 hours a day):\nCFL Incandescent\nEnergy Input (watts) 13 60\nLight Output (lumens) 810 830\nUseful life (hours) 10,000 1,500\n# Bulbs for 10,000 hours 1 6.7\nBulb Costs 1 @ $4.00 = $4.00 6.7 @ $0.32 = $2.14\nElectricity Used (kilowatt hours) 130 600\nElectricity Cost (@ $.08 per kwh) $10.40 $48.00\nTotal Cost (Electricity + Bulb) $14.40 $50.14\nCost savings in using a CFL - $35.74 or 71%!\nThe energy saved also makes it much better for the Creation. The 470 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity saved translates to a global warming-fighting reduction of over 730 pounds of carbon dioxide. It also means a reduction of 1.6 pounds of nitrogen oxides (which contribute to ozone and acid rain), and makes significant reductions in other impacts of coal-produced power such as mercury pollution and destruction of forest and stream habitats in mining areas.\nNo major environmental group or organization with their solid science knowledge base has spoken any concern about the disposal of CFL\u2019s. There is a small amount of mercury vapor in all fluorescent lights. Mercury is a toxic substance, but the amount in CFL\u2019s compared to all the other sources of mercury exposure (thermometers, regular long tube fluorescent lamps, emissions from coal-fired power plants, etc.) is so little that it does not substantially contribute to the problem of mercury exposure. Theoretically, we should be disposing of all our used mercury-containing products by appropriate hazardous waste methods. So, when, after the long, long useful life span of a cfl is over, we recommend disposal through hazardous waste handling systems but it is not obligatory to do so. A few progressive recycle facilities have found reclamation markets for fluorescent lights.\nLogin to post comments\nJoin our next conference call\nTXIPL's next Interfaith Call for Caring for Creation will be:\nWednesday, May 30, 12:00 p.m.-1:00 p.m.\n"}, {"score": 1724.3151, "uuid": "ac8bc965-bafb-53a0-8cb7-1b16e5dc12e8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500tw-34-10562", "target_hostname": "www.lyco.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.lyco.co.uk/", "page_rank": 3.3068526e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em>: Energy Saving Halogen <em>Bulbs</em> and <em>Fluorescent</em> Tubes | Lyco Direct", "snippet": "Whether you want to know <em>which</em> energy saving <em>bulbs</em> will suit you best <em>or</em> the latest EU regulations on the phasing out of standard <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>, just ask.

Learn how these light bulbs can save you more energy and money than standard incandescent lights in this educational video.\nTranscript:What Are Environmentally Friendly Light Bulbs?\nHi I\u2019m Christopher Padgett, an environmental scientist, for about.com and today we\u2019ll be talking about the environment. A very simple task that you can do in your home and office to help the environment is to change a light bulb. Easy right?\nEco-Friendly Fluorescent Lights\nMost households have regular incandescent light bulbs in their lighting fixtures. If you switched that bulb out with a compact fluorescent light bulb, it would help prevent greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The best places to switch the old bulbs out for the new eco friendly ones would be in the rooms with the most use. The first thing you will notice about the compact fluorescent light bulb is the design. It strays from the classic design of the traditional light bulb.\nThe cfl bulb has a utilitarian, tubular design, which has drawn some criticism from homeowners. However, you can\u2019t discount what the bulb can do. CFLs have two main components, a gas-filled tube and magnetic or electronic ballast. They are produced for both alternating current and direct current, making them a popular choice for recreational vehicles and off the grid housing.\nLight Bulbs Save Energy and Money\nOn average you will save between 30 and 50 dollars on energy bills over the life of the bulb. These bulbs use two thirds less energy, and generate less heat than the standard incandescent bulb. They also have a much longer lifespan, about 8-15 times longer, which helps save you money in the long run. The lifespan can vary on the voltage, and frequency of use.\nFinding the right wattage may be tricky, as cfl bulbs need fewer watts to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb. For example, if you were to replace a 60-watt incandescent bulb, you\u2019d want a cfl bulb that is about 15 watts. They typically use about one quarter of the wattage of an incandescent. One of the first major companies to bring these bulbs mainstream was Philips. Many more have quickly jumped on board considering the popularity and eco-friendliness of the bulb.\nProperly Discard Fluorescent Lights\nOne thing to be aware of with these bulbs is that they do contain mercury, which is poisonous. Be very careful when discarding the bulbs. Don\u2019t just discard them, do some research and see if there is a location nearby that will recycle the bulb for you. Hopefully now you have a better idea about environmentally friendly light bulbs. It\u2019s an easy way to do your part to make a better environment. Thanks for watching.

model \u00a0EDXR -30-14) and an\u00a0new 65W incandescent\u00a0recessed light (GE Reveal 65) by measuring their spectra with a NIST traceable calibrated spectroradiometer .\u00a0 In each case the bulb pointed down, like a typical recessed light, with the spectroradiometer measurement point 108 cm below the bulb.\u00a0 The measurement was repeated seven times for each bulb: first with the spectroradiometer directly below the bulb, then with the spectroradiometer moved about 15 cm horizontally, then 30 cm horizontally\u2026out to about 90 cm horizontal shift.\nNote that the GE Reveal 65 had an \u201cenhanced color spectrum that used a neodymium glass filter to reduce the amount of light in the middle part of the visible spectrum to yield more vivid reds and blues.\u00a0 I would have been better off with a simpler incandescent lamp for this comparison.\nThe first graph below shows the spectral irradiance for the CFL.\u00a0 Note that most of the irradiance is in the visible part of the spectrum.\u00a0 The seven curves correspond to the seven horizontal positions, with the highest irradiance being directly below the bulb.\u00a0 The second graph is the same, but zoomed in to the visible part of the spectrum.\nThe following two graphs show the same thing for the incandescent lamp.\u00a0 Notice the dip in the middle of the visible spectrum.\u00a0 This is due to the neodymium glass filter.\u00a0 If that filter were not present the total irradiance of the incandescent lamp would have been higher.\u00a0 I will repeat this experiment at a later date with the simpler incadescent lamp.\nIrradiance only tells the beginning of the story.\u00a0 The human eye is more sensitive to some colors than to others.\u00a0 It is more sensitive to the middle of the visible part of the spectrum than to the red or the blue.\u00a0 Of course, it is totally blind to the UV and the IR.\u00a0 So, the irradiance is multiplied by\u00a0 a Luminosity Function and a constant to give a measure of how bright a light is.\u00a0 The following plot shows the typically used Photonic Luminosity function.\nThe following two graphs show the products of the Photonic Luminostiy function, a constant (683 lux/W/m2), and the spectral irradiance of the CFL and the incandescent bulbs.\u00a0 The total area under any curve gives the \u201cbrightness\u201d for the lamp at a particular horizontal shift.\u00a0 I have deliberately left the Y axis the same on both graphs to make them easier to compare.\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0is clear that the CFL is very bright over two narrow wavelength bands centered on about 545 nm and 620 nm, while the incandescent light is spread more evenly over the visible spectrum.\u00a0 This is probably why people feel that colors look less natural under a CFL.\nAfter all the graphs and the math, which light is brighter?\u00a0 It depends on the horizontal position, as shown in the following figure.\u00a0 The incandescent is brighter directly below the lamp, but the CFL is brighter off to the sides.\u00a0 This should not be too surprising, because the light from the incandescent comes from a small filament, which is more easily reflected in the same direction than the light from the extended source of the CFL.\u00a0 But when integrated over all directions, the incandescent and the CFL are probably a very close match, as claimed by the CFL manufacturer.\nIt would be interesting\u00a0 to repeat this experiment with bulbs that have accumulated about 1000 hours.\u00a0 But that is an experiment for another day.\nWarm-up time.\nI also measured the irradiance of the CFL as a function of time.\u00a0 This was done for the lamp after it had been off and cool for hours, and again after it had been fully warmed and then allowed to cool for three minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 It takes about 4.5 minutes to get to full irradiance for a cold lamp, and about 3 minutes for a warm lamp.\u00a0 Of course, the warm-up time for the incandescent is essentially zero minutes.\nConclusions\nThere are hundreds of different configurations of CFLs and incadescent bulbs being used in the world.\u00a0 My sample is miniscule.\u00a0 However, some of my numerical results are probably fairly representative, and there are common observations reported by many users.\nAs shown above, at least in my case, the 14 Watt CFL was about a bright as the \u00a065 Watt incandescent it was designed to replace.\u00a0 However, the color quality of the CFL was much poorer.\u00a0 This poor color quality is a function or the flourescent nature of the lamp, and is likely common to most CFLs.\nThe CFL takes a long time to warm up, compared to the instant-on of an incandescent.\u00a0 The warmup time probably varies from one type of CFL to another.\u00a0 I have data to indicate that the irradiance vs. time for the warmup minutes can look quite different for a new CFL vs. and an identical CFL with several thousand hours, but that data is not presented here.\nAs indicated in a previous post , my experience is that a CFL will save money compared to an incandescent that it is designed to replace.\u00a0 But as shown here, the color quality of the light is worse and there may be an annoying wait for it to warm up.\nI will continue to use CFLs where they make sense, but I am also stockpiling some incandescents for the day when they are no longer available by government mandate .\u00a0 Short duration use of many CFLs reduces their lifetime, and as seen above, it may take several minutes for the CFL to get to full brightness.\u00a0 So I will use incandescents in closets and storage rooms, etc., and CFLs in the main living areas.\nLast comment\nI have presented this information as a small part of a large issue.\u00a0 My endorsement of CFLs, despite some of their drawbacks, is most definitely not support for\u00a0the government mandate to force us to use CFLs.\u00a0 I am stockpiling incandescents for certain situations and would suggest that others do the same.\u00a0 Perhaps the price of LEDs will drop enough to make this issue irrelevant.\nUltimately, I would like to see abundant amounts of energy available to all Americans\u00a0and to all the people of the world.\u00a0 Then the issue of light bulb choice would simply be moot.\u00a0 My fear is that we are moving in the opposite direction.\n"}, {"score":

Fields marked as \"unknown\" were not visible in the photos provided on the Powerhouse Museum website .\nIt quickly becomes obvious that all of these lamps have the same order number of \"2889\" - perhaps a unique number that L.C.M. & Co. used to invoice all Lane-Fox lamps under.\nA curious aspect to the lamps in my collection (that I cannot find an answer to) involves the two different construction methods. Oddly, not all of the lamps employ the usual mercurial lead-in wire connections so well known to Lane-Fox lamps. Instead, three of the lamps omit the mercury connection by simply using a piece of copper wire. These lamps also differ in that the glass is pinched off where the electrical leads exit the bulb. Hence, platinum wire is used where the lamps are pinched off, then a copper wire of a larger diameter is used and lastly the familiar drilled carbon cylinders and Indian ink are used to attach the actual filament. The photos below show a comparison made between the two constructions methods, where the left photo illustrates the usual design with the mercury sealed leads, while the right photo shows the simple and crude lead-in wires with the pinched off glass. It seems odd that two completely different designs were utilized within just months of each other.\nMercury sealed leads\nCrimped copper wire leads\nSeveral Lane-Fox lamps originally existed as part of the William J.

Improved Lane-Fox lamp, tipless, bottom seal, vegetable filament, carbon paste clamps.\"\nPharmaceutical Journal and Transactions\nAug. 5th,1882\n\"The International Electric Exhibition (1881 Paris Exhibition)\nThe next Englishman to tread in Mr. Swan's steps in this field was Mr. St. George Lane-Fox. The following description of this inventor's lamp by the Paris committee is very full and clear, but further detail as to the manner in which the contacts are made will be found of interest and will therefore be given after the description. \"The Lane-Fox lamp is ovoid in shape, the neck being in length intermediate between the two lamps last described (Swan and Maxim). The carbon is in the form of a horseshoe, and is circular in cross-section. It is made from the root of an Italian grass, largely used a France for making brooms. After carbonization the filaments are classified according to their resistance. They are then heated in an atmosphere of gas, by which carbon is deposited upon them, as is the filaments of the lamps last described. The filament in the lamp is supported by platinum wires, to which it is attached by sleeves of carbon encircling both. These wires pass through tubes in the top of a hollow glass stem. Just below the extremities of these tubes are two small bulbs containing mercury, forming the contact between the platinum wire sealed into the glass above and the copper conductor which enters from below. These conductors are held in place by plaster, which fills the base of the lamp.\"\nThe filaments are joined to short cylinders of carbon or graphite by means of holes drilled a little way into them; these holes are filled up with a cement composed of genuine Indian or Chinese ink and finely divided plumbago. At the other end of the cylinders holes are drilled to meet the ends of the filament, but the inventor states that this is not absolutely necessary. In these latter holes short lengths of platinum wire are inserted, cemented as before; each length of platinum wire need not extend 3/4 of an inch in length. The other ends of the platinum wires are fused into tubes of lead glass and the wire ends come into the small glass globes filled with mercury. The mercurial contacts are arranged as stated by the committee.\nThe Italian grass from which the filaments are manufactured is stated by the inventor to be the Chrysopogon Gryllus. The grass is prepared by boiling in a 5 percent solution of caustic soda or potash; the outer skin is thus loosened and scraped off. The fibre is straightened by stretching it while still damp, and the straightened fibre is bound on a block of carbon, buried in plumbago in a sealed crucible and the crucible and its contents raised to a white heat. The fibres are thus ready for mounting as before described. If the resistance of the carbonized fibres proves to be too high Mr. Lane-Fox ingeniously incandesces them in a \"Woulfe's\" bottle contrivance; through which a stream of coal gas or hydrocarbon vapour is passing continuously. The filaments are in connection with a measuring apparatus when the resistance is found to be nearly right, the filaments are mounted in their holders and the process repeated until the resistance reaches the exact figure necessary.\nThe Lane-Fox lamp was found by the Paris Committee to have a mean resistance cold of 55 ohms: at 16 candles this resistance became reduced to 27.4 ohms, and at 32 candles to 26.59 ohms. The current required when yielding 16 candles was 1.593 amperes with an electromotive force of 43.63 volts; at 32 candles the current was 1.815 amp\u00e8res and the electromotive force 48.22 volts; 10.61 16 candle lamps were yielded per horse-power and 8.65 32 candle lamps, being 173.58 and 276.89 candles per horse-power.\nThe Lane-Fox lamp is worked by the Anglo- American Brush Electric Light Company. The luxurious richness of the installations of Lane-Fox lamps in the Alhambra Court at the Crystal Palace made the Brush Company's exhibit one of the most popularly attractive sights of the exhibition. The display was certainly an impressive demonstration of the ornamental capabilities of the incandescent electric lamp, such as cannot be imagined by those who had not the fortune to see it.\"\nUseful Information on Electric Lighting by Killingworth Hedges\n1882\n\"The Lane Fox Lamp.\nThis system resembles both those previously described. The horse-shoe form of Edison is adhered to, but the filament instead of being larger at its extremities remains the same size, and is fixed into two little cylinders of plumbago, which are also connected to the platinum wires, each fixed in a glass tube containing mercury, in which dip the connections leading from the exterior of the lamp.\nThe filament is composed of stalks of grass or of vegetable fibre vulcanised and impregnated with chloride of zinc. To form the vacuum in the lamp the Sprengel pump is not employed, but an improvement of a barometrical air exhauster, which has been used for the production of the vacuum in the well known Geissler's tubes.\nSeven lamps have been worked per horsepower, each having a lighting power equal to 12 candles. The resistance of each lamp measured when cold varies between 75 to 105 ohms, when hot it is about 45 percent less. This system is employed for the illumination of the reading-room at the South Kensington Museum , a Brush machine furnishing the current to a number of 20-candle lamps.\"\nThe Modern Applications of Electricity by \u00c9douard Hospitalier, Julius Maier\n1883\n\"Lane Fox's Lamp.-Fig. 187 gives a sectional view, and Fig. 188 a perspective view, of the lamp. The light results from the incandescence of a continuous conductor made of a filament of carbon. This conductor is of high electrical resistance, so that a comparatively small amount of electricity driven through it develops sufficient heat to produce incandescence. The filament is enclosed in a glass globe, from which all deleterious atmosphere has been as completely removed as possible.\nIn the diagram of the lamp, the curved line A represents the luminous conductor, which consists of a carbon filament, prepared by baking a strong cotton thread or string in a hermetically sealed vessel at white heat. Conductors may be made in this manner with a resistance of several thousand ohms for only a few inches length.\nIn order to reduce this resistance and to produce a harder and more durable carbon, Lane Fox adopted a plan, first suggesting by Sawyer, of New York, of heating the conductor to incandescence whilst immersed in a hydrocarbon liquid or gas; but this process is not by any means essential. Referring again to the diagram, 1 1 are carbon cylinders, into which the ends of the carbon filaments are secured. A small hole is drilled through these cylinders, and into these holes the ends of the carbon thread fit tightly. A very good cement for fixing these carbons may be made out of plumbago and Indian ink. The ends of the platinum wires are beat into eyes e e, into which the hooks of the holder are inserted.\nFigs. 189 and 190 show the latest form of the Lane Fox lamp.\nThe filament employed in these lamps is made from grass fibres, preferably that known as French whisk, or bass broom, and used in making certain kinds of carpet brushes. The fibre is first cleaned by boiling in a strong solution of caustic soda or potash, and the outer skin scraped off. The soda or potash is then boiled out of it, and a number of fibres are stretched round a mould or shape of plumbago, and are then baked in a plumbago crucible at a white heat. After being baked in this manner, the fibres are further carbonized by depositing carbon upon them from a rich hydro-carbon gas, such as benzole. For this purpose they are suspended in large globes filled with benzole or coal-gas, and then heated to incandescence by the current. The white-hot filament decomposes the gas, and carbon is deposited on its surface, especially at the thinner parts, where the temperature is highest. In this way the fibre is covered with a hard skin of carbon, which brings it to the required resistance and renders it more uniform throughout-a point of some importance as affecting the durability of the filaments. Instead of employing the electric current in this way, Mr. Lane Fox carbonizes his filaments by raising the benzole receptacle to a white heat in a furnace.\nAfter being carbonized in this manner, the fibres are classed according to their thickness, and are ready for mounting in the lamps. Slight differences of thickness occasion great differences in resistance, and the thicker specimens are reserved for lamps of thirty to sixty candle-power, whilst the smaller ones are kept for lamps often to twenty candle-power.\"\nA Practical Treatise on Electric Lighting by James Edward Henry Gordon\n1884\n\"The Lane-Fox Lamp\nMr. Lane-Fox's process is probably not very different from that adopted by other manufacturers. As it happens, however, that I have had an opportunity of inspecting it somewhat closely, I will describe it in detail, not saying that it is better or worse than other processes, but as an illustration of what the general nature of all the processes is. The filaments are usually prepared from the fibres of the bass broom.\nAbout 100 pieces of fibre, cut to the right length, are bent round a block of carbon, and secured to it by winding string round, as shown in fig. 44. Some fifty of these blocks are prepared, and placed in layers one above another in a crucible, all the interstices between them being filled with powdered charcoal, with which also the crucible is filled up to the top.\nThe crucible is then placed in a small furnace (Plate VII.), and the temperature gradually raised up to full whiteness. The crucible, with its contents, is kept at a full white heat for some twenty minutes, after which it is allowed to cool. On being taken out, the fibres are found to be converted into hard carbon of a rough, porous texture and of high and unequal resistances.\nPlate VII. shows the details of the arrangements of the furnace used by Mr. Lane-Fox as constructed by Messrs. Fletcher.\nWe note that there is a perforated diaphragm which causes the draught to circulate evenly round the crucible.\nA furnace and crucible of the size shown will carbonize about 5000 filaments at one heating. Fig. 45.\nThe next process is to gauge the fibres with a wire gauge reading to 1/1000 inch (fig. 45); they are then sorted, so that all of the same diameter are placed together for the making of lamps of the same radiating surface.\nIf S be the surface, L the length, and D the diameter, we have,-\nS=3.1416 D L . . . . . (44)\nExample.\nA filament is 2 inches long and .018 inch diameter, what is its surface?\nWe have from (44),-\nS=3.1416 x .018 x 2 = .1031 of a square inch.\nThe next operation is the equalizing of the resistances, and the hardening and smoothing of the carbon. This is accomplished by means of what is called a flashing- bottle.\nThe carbons are placed, one by one, with their two ends in two spring clips, so that a current can be sent through them. These clips are fixed into a cork, so that they can be placed inside a bottle,- through which a stream of coal-gas is constantly flowing.\nOn a current being sent through the filament so as to render it incandescent, carbon from the gas commences to deposit on it, and the filament becomes denser and smoother, and its resistance rapidly diminishes. The process is stopped when the resistance has reached exactly the desired amount. As the resistance diminishes, the brightness of the light given by the filament in the flashing-bottle increases.\nWhen the workman, judging by the light, considers that the resistance has reached its proper value, he removes the filament from the bottle and tests its resistance (cold) by a Wheatstone's bridge. After a little practice the workmen are able to obtain the resistance correct to about one ohm, by judging the brightness of the light, in one or two tries, or \"flashes,\" for each filament.\nBy means of the ohmmeter, it might be possible to obtain the hot resistance accurately without taking the filament out of the bottle.\nThe thickened ends of the filaments consist of two little cylinders of carbon, which are drilled from end to end. The ends of the filament are inserted into the holes at one end of each cylinder, and the platinum wires which pass through the glass of the lamp are inserted into the other ends. The filament and platinum wires are secured by a cement of which Indian ink is the chief ingredient.\nThe construction of the glass part of the lamp is seen in Plate VIII. and in figs. 46 and 47.\nThe globe is prepared with a sufficiently wide neck to admit the carbon loop (which is sufficiently elastic to be considerably bent without breaking).\nA glass piece (fig. 46) is prepared, having two narrow tubes, into the points of which are melted little pieces of platinum wire, about 3/16 inch long. The carbon is attached to these wires in the manner already described, and the forked piece being inserted in the globe, the neck of the globe is melted on to the wide part of it in a blow-pipe flame. The upper piece is taken off, so that the neck is hollow and funnel-shaped, as shown in fig. 47.\nA fine tube is then melted into the side of the neck for exhaustion. A little mercury* is put from outside into each of the tubes of the forked piece, and copper wires put in so as to dip into the mercury at C. The mercury forms an electrical connection between the copper and platinum, and at the same time prevents any leakage of air where the platinum passes through the glass. The hollow neck is filled up with cotton-wool (B), and with plaster of Paris (A), which holds the copper wires and the mercury in their places. The lamp is now ready for exhaustion.\nThis is accomplished by means of a pump invented by Mr. Lane-Fox, and shown in Plate IX.\n*The whole of this part of the process is antiquated, but it is of some historical value as showing the difficulties which had to be overcome in the early days of lamp manufacture.\nThe Lane-Fox Pump\nThe pump consists essentially of two large globes connected by a tube, partly of glass partly of india-rubber. The glass part (A) of the tube is vertical, and is some 35 inches long, and one globe is fixed at the top of it. The other globe is moveable, and is connected to the lower end of the fixed glass tube, by a length of india-rubber tube sufficient to allow the moveable globe to be hung by its wire handle to either of two hooks, one of which brings it above the fixed globe, while the other is below the level of the bottom of the fixed glass tube. The top of the moveable globe is open to the air.\nEnough mercury is put in the apparatus to fill the tube and one globe.\nA side tube branches out from the fixed tube near the top, and turns up and passes vertically a little higher than the top of the fixed globe.\nA lamp, or generally two lamps at a time, are attached to the top of this tube.\nIn the vertical part of the side tube is a valve consisting of a cylindrical enlargement, inside which lies a hollow glass stopper. On mercury rising in the side tube, the stopper floats up and closes the tube sufficiently tight to stop mercury from passing up to the lamps. The mercury surrounding the stopper prevents air passing it.\nAt the top of the fixed globe is a valve worked by hand, consisting of a glass stopper surrounded by a second smaller globe. To close the valve the stopper is inserted, and a little mercury or sulphuric acid put in the smaller globe surrounding it. The stopper prevents the liquid from passing from the small to the large globe, and the liquid prevents the entrance of air.\nWhen the pump is worked, the moveable globe is hung on the upper hook, so that the mercury rises in the fixed tubes. In the side tube it rises as far as the valve, which it closes; while in the main tube it rises and fills the fixed globe, the stopper being withdrawn to allow the air to escape.\nSome strong, pure sulphuric acid is then put into the smaller globe, and the moveable globe lowered sufficiently to allow a little of the acid to enter the large fixed globe, where it lies on the top of the mercury. The stopper is then inserted, and the moveable globe completely lowered and hung on the lower hook.\nThe mercury sinks, leaving a complete vacuum in the upper globe until the column is lower than the opening of the side tube, when the valve in the latter opens and the air in the lamps rushes into the large globe.\nThe moveable globe is then again raised, and the rising mercury closes the valve leading to the lamp; and the air, being directed into the fixed globe, escapes through the stopper valve, which is opened for the purpose. Meanwhile the sulphuric acid removes every trace of moisture. We see that the ratio of the quantity of air in the lamp after each stroke is, to that before the stroke, as the volume of the lamp is to the sum of the volumes of the lamp, tube, and fixed globe.\nAfter a few minutes' work the lamp is completely exhausted, as is shown by the sharp click with which the mercury strikes the top of the fixed globe on the moveable globe being raised.\nThe filaments are then brought to a state of vivid incandescence, and the pumping recommenced, and continued for a few minutes more, until the greater portion of the gas contained in them has been expelled and removed. They are, however, kept on the pump and incandescent for some twelve hours, a stroke being taken only occasionally to remove the last trace of gas. The lamps are then sealed off in the ordinary way, and are ready for use.\"\nDynamo-Electricity by George B. Prescott\n1884\n\"The form of the Lane-Fox lamp (figure 151) is very similar to the Edison; both make a single loop of the carbon, which is bent into a horse-shoe form. The filament of the Lane-Fox lamp is made from grass fibres of the kind known as French whisk or bass broom, used in making carpet brushes. The fibres are boiled in a strong solution of potash or soda, and the skin scraped off and then the soda or potash is boiled out of them, and they are stretched around a mould of plumbago, and baked at a white heat. The fibres are then further carbonized by depositing carbon upon them from a rich hydrocarbon gas. This is done by suspending them in large globes filled with bengole, and then heated to incandescence by an electric current. The gas is decomposed by the white hot filament, and carbon is deposited on its surface, by which means the fibre is covered with a hard carbon skin, which produces the requisite resistance and renders the filament more uniform, thus insuring greater durability. The carbons are of various thickness, some being used in lamps of 10 and 20 and others of 30 and 60 candle power.\nMr. Lane-Fox's method of distributing the current is similar to Edison's, except that he uses the earth instead of a return wire. The lamps are placed in multiple arc and a constant electro-motive force of about 100 volts is maintained in the circuit. An automatic regulator is employed to insure this result, which is placed in the circuit between the main conductor and the earth. The regulator (figure 152) consists of an electromagnet, E, through which a shunted portion of the current passes, and attracts the armature of lever L, pivoted at H. This lever plays between the two adjustable contact pins I and v, resting midway when the current is of the proper intensity, but striking the upper pin I, if the current becomes too strong, and the lower pin v, if it becomes too weak. By this means a local circuit is closed, and more or less resistance is inserted in the circuit of the field-magnets of the generator, so as to bring the lighting current to its normal value, and the lever of the regulator to its mid position. This resistance is inserted automatically. E is a vibrating electro-magnet, analogous in its action to the buzzer of an electric bell, which is caused by the local current to rotate a vertical axis N, carrying at its upper end a small toothed pinion, which can gear with either of the two like wheels R and R', enclosing it between their toothed edges. If it gear with the wheel R, the horizontal spindle D, carrying these two wheels, will be rotated in one direction, and if it gear with R' the same spindle will be rotated in the other direction, and as the spindle D carries at its lower end a vertical shaft connected with the sliding contact arm F, F, which moves over the contact pieces c, c, of a series of resistances contained in the box, it throws in or takes out resistance from the field magnet The direction in which the horizontal spindle shall turn is determined by the two electro-magnets E and E'. According as the lever L touches I or v, one or other of these electro-magnets E or E' attracts the armature A, placed between their opposed poles, which moves the spindle D longitudinally, and brings the pinion- headed axis into gearing with one or other of the two wheels R and R' on the horizontal spindle.\nSecondary batteries are used to store any surplus current and return it to the circuits when there is any falling off in those below the normal current They are so arranged that the battery in discharging will automatically adapt the potential of its discharge to the needs of the mains as determined by the regulator.\nMr. Lane-Fox has invented three kinds of meters for measuring the current used in his lamps. The Lane-Fox system is now worked by the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, and was exhibited with fine effect at the Crystal Palace Exhibition, where the Alhambra Courts were lighted by Lane-Fox lamps fed from a Sellon-Volckmar secondary battery charged by a Brush machine, and the light was conveniently graduated by switching on a greater or less number of cells of the battery.\"\nElectricity in the Service of Man by Alfred Urbanitzky\n1886\n\"Glow Lamps by Lane-Fox (Fig. 444).-Two wires e e, which are connected with the mercury tubes f, are attached to the metal springs c, which are the carbon holders. These springs are regulated by the slide d, consisting of insulating material. The tubes f and h pass through an india-rubber cork g; i is a layer of mercury, and over it is a layer of cement j. The glass vessel is exhausted by means of the tube h.\nLane-Fox prepares the carbon filaments for his lamps in the following manner: Hemp threads are wound round a piece of coke having a knife-edge at one side; and the whole is placed in an oven. During carbonisation the threads contract and are cut by the knife-edge. In this manner carbons of the same length are obtained. Benzole, or similar vapour, is used for carbonising the filaments, whilst the carbons are made white-hot by means of the electric current The ends of the filaments are connected with a short piece of wire (short-circuited), and again a current passes through them. The lamp is constructed in different sizes, and for an intensity of 87 candles, 66 volts by 0-673 ampere are required.\"\nThe Incandescent Lamp and Its Manufacture by Gilbert Scott Ram\n1894\n\"All these [filament attachment] methods, which were used in the early days of lamp-making, have, however, been abandoned as unsatisfactory or too costly. The filaments were apt to work loose, owing to expansion and contraction with temperature. In the earlier forms of the Lane-Fox lamp a hollow carbon tube was used, into which the platinum wire was inserted at one end and the filament at the other, with some kind of carbon paste to make the joint firm.\"\nRelated links:\n"}, {"score": 1717.8906, "uuid": "c9817f6b-180f-5709-8779-c4e8bf2d703e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-56-28256", "target_hostname": "www.ecogeek.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ecogeek.org/component/content/article/205", "page_rank": 1.1906612e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "One Watt <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em>!", "snippet": "I don&#x27;t know why, but I have always preferred the <em>light</em> coming from <em>incandescent</em> filament <em>bulbs</em> than to <em>fluorescent</em> <em>or</em> even energy efficient ones.

Brandston\nWall Street Journal - September 2009\nSave the Light Bulb!\nThe Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will effectively phase out incandescent light bulbs by 2012-2014 in favor of compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs. Other countries around the world have passed similar legislation to ban most incandescents.\nWill some energy be saved? Probably. The problem is this benefit will be more than offset by rampant dissatisfaction with lighting. We are not talking about giving up a small luxury for the greater good. We are talking about compromising light. Light is fundamental. And light is obviously for people, not buildings. The primary objective in the design of any space is to make it comfortable and habitable. This is most critical in homes, where this law will impact our lives the most. And yet while energy conservation, a worthy cause, has strong advocacy in public policy, good lighting has very little.\nEven without taking into account people's preferences, CFLs, which can be an excellent choice for some applications, are simply not an equivalent technology to incandescents in all applications. For example, if you have dimmers used for home theater or general ambience, you must buy a compatible dimmable CFL, which costs more, and even then it may not work as desired on your dimmers. How environmental will it be for frustrated homeowners to remove and dispose of thousands of dimmers? What's more, CFLs work best in light fixtures designed for CFLs, and may not fit, provide desired service life, or distribute light in the same pleasing pattern as incandescents. How environmental will it be for homeowners to tear out and install new light fixtures?\nNone of these and other considerations appear to have been included in the technical justification for this law. Instead, the decision appears to have been made entirely based on a perception of efficiency gains. Light-source efficacy, expressed as lumens of light output per watt of electrical input, has been used as a comparative metric justifying encouragement of CFLs. But this metric is flawed for one simple reason: It is a laboratory measurement and a guide, not a truth, in the field; actual energy performance will depend on numerous application characteristics and product quality.\nIf energy conservation were to be the sole goal of energy policy, and efficacy were to be the sole technical consideration, then why CFLs? If we really want to save energy, we would advocate high-pressure sodium lamps\u2014those large bulbs that produce bright orangish light in many streetlights. Their efficacy is more than double what CFLs can offer. Of course this would not be tolerated by the public. This choice shows that we are willing to advocate bad lighting\u2014but not horrible lighting.\nNot yet, at least. Energy regulations pending in Washington set aggressive caps on power allowances for energy-using systems in commercial and residential buildings. These requirements have never been tested.\nHere's my modest proposal to determine whether the legislation actually serves people. Satisfy the proposed power limits in all public buildings, from museums, houses of worship and hospitals to the White House and the homes of all elected officials. Of course, this will include replacing all incandescents with CFLs. At the end of 18 months, we would check to be certain that the former lighting had not been reinstalled, and survey all users to determine satisfaction with the resulting lighting.\nBased on the data collected, the Energy Independence and Security Act and energy legislation still in Congress would be amended to conform to the results of the test. Or better yet, scrapped in favor of a thoughtful process that could yield a set of recommendations that better serve our nation's needs by maximizing both human satisfaction and energy efficiency.\nAs a lighting designer with more than 50 years of experience, having designed more than 2,500 projects including the relighting of the Statue of Liberty, I encourage people who care about their lighting to contact their elected officials and urge them to re-evaluate our nation's energy legislation so that it serves people, not an energy-saving agenda.\nInfinite Health Resources does not at any point, for any circumstances suggest that you do not follow or stop medical advice of your physician.

Neurologists agree this happens. I don\u2019t feel well in stores with such lighting, but at least I hope I would have the ability to CHOOSE to have safer lighting at home. But nooooo \u2013the government wants to make that difficult. So, we have to build wheel chair ramps everywhere for those with disabilities, but documented health effects from fluorescents are completely overlooked? I\u2019m not asking that every public building be required to cater to my \u201clighting sensitivity\u201d but surely, in my own home at least I should be allowed to buy incandescent. I\u2019m not a Republican, but think I\u2019ll become one because of this issue. Go Ron Paul!

However, an ill conceived and not fully researched Federal Government edict law is not what we need. Especially for those of us that live in the parts of this country that have long periods of the year when the outside temperatures are below the operating capabilities of the prime alternative method of lighting, the CFL. Last fall I purchased new outdoor fixtures for my garage that came with the touted 10,000 hour LED light bulbs. While they worked great at first, two of the three bulbs in each fixture burned out within three to four monts of service. Keeping in mind that these lights only came on after decting movement between the hours of dusk to dawn, I am not convinced that the LED alternative is a cost effective solution either. I am now at the decision point of what lighting options are viable for my new detached, non-heated, two car garage. If the incandescent light bulbs, 40 watt and above, are being banned, currently available heavy use designed fluorescent lights are not usefull below zero to 10 degrees, LEDs obviously not cost efficient, what type of lighting fixtures do I pay the electrician to install when they wire this new non-heated structure in Grand Island, NE? Why enact a ban on one of the two types of light bulbs that will work properly below 10 degrees before a suitable cost effective / reducing substitute was made available?\nPatric\nposted on March 13th, 2011 at 3:31 am\nI am all for saving energy and for encouraging others to do so. Because CFLs are supposed to consume less energy, I use them in various places in my home and my small business where a somewhat poorer quality of light (\u201cbluish light\u201d) is acceptable. I have found that CFLs work best when I keep them constantly turned on, however. They take time to get up to full brightness, and they burn out quickly when turned on and off.)\nHowever, I have a few very strong reasons for insisting that I and others maintain full and ready access to incandescent bulbs. For me, the main reason is quality of life. Incandescent bulbs emit a warmer, more \u201chuman\u201d light, and create a cheerier and more emotionally settling atmosphere in a room or home. This has positive health and human benefits compared to the colder and more emotionally sterile atmosphere created by fluorescent-based bulbs. This is why lighting designers around the world overwhelmingly oppose the de facto ban on incandescents. Are there good scientific studies to support this very obvious, common-sense observation? Well, yes, in a way. Several studies show that fluorescents create demonstrable, objectively-measurable adverse health effects in certain subsets of patients with emotional problems. One can readily conjecture that less-demonstrable, less-objective, but no less real effects are present in more robust patients as well\u2014CFLs may be putting us on edge, making us feel subtly less welcome in a room lit by their cold light. Just what we need in an era of increasing stress, right?\nAnother reason I want full access to bright incandescent bulbs is for reading. One of the oldest, simplest, and most significant activities known to civilized man is reading by the warm light of a fire or (more recently) warm incandescent bulb. Both I and the people with whom I work professionally\u2014older patients with vision problems due to any number of eye conditions\u2014prefer to read by the light of bright incandescents. And in this case the science is very clearly on our side, as clinical studies of patients with macular degeneration found that such patients overwhelmingly preferred incandescents to fluorescent lights. The preference is presumably based on how our photoreceptors respond to light emitted in the red (incandescent) vs. blue (CFL) spectra. Moreover, we do not just read with our eyes, but with our brains. There is something more than just energy output and watts that goes into the equation of humans reading books.\nFinally, I think that the de facto light bulb ban is not a political issue but an issue of common sense. The original 2007 legislation was signed into law by George Bush, yet the opposition to the legislation is being spearheaded by Republicans. New Zealand has already repealed their de facto ban on incandescents. The majority of people in Europe oppose the de facto ban on incandescents (despite the fact that their governments passed de facto bans), so much that mass panic buying and hoarding of incandescents occurred in Europe.\nThere are many ways we can reduce energy. It is not only far less energy-consuming, but presumably more stimulating to the cerebral cortex and better for society, for an individual to choose to read by a 100-watt incandescent bulb, rather than to choose to play video games on a 42-inch plasma TV. Yet we are in effect banning the former activity, and allowing the latter. Surely we can find a better way to encourage others toward a more sensible approach to energy conservation!\nNorthStarr\nposted on March 14th, 2011 at 7:09 pm\nAs someone in decorating industry, I have to say that I H-A-T-E fluorescent bulbs. Always have, always will. They are creepy and depressing. They ruin the ambience of a room and greatly distort wall colors, giving them a greenish, muddy cast.\nWe are pretty \u2018green\u2019 at home and are glad to take steps to use less energy. But this bulb ban is just nonsense. Making more fuel-efficient cars and increasing insulation in buildings will save a hundred times more energy than any bulb change could. And furthermore, the real issue is we need to get off oil, no matter what it\u2019s powering.\nI\u2019m stocking up on real lightbulbs, in hopes they will last until a better alternative is found to CFL and the (so-far) substandard light produced by most LEDs. I encourage others to do the same. I called GE and Phillips, and they said the bulbs are thought to last indefinitely, if stored in a cool, dry place.\nLaquasha\nposted on March 19th, 2011 at 11:42 pm\nAgree with NorthStarr and CFLs are just not healthy for people and pets.\nBill\nposted on March 22nd, 2011 at 12:45 pm\nI certainly agree that government should not mandate what kind of light bulbs we are able to buy, there is no question, however since starting to sell the CFL\u2019s at work, I have found that most people do not know there are more than just one type of CFL for each wattage equivalent. At least from my experience it\u2019s not that CFL\u2019s give off horrible/blueish/gray light, it is that people selling them do not take the time to educate their customers as to the differences in the bulbs. We have a light box setup at my store with three 60 watt equivalent CFLs but three different \u201ccolor temperatures\u201d and it is amazing what a difference there is in the quality of light!! I think if any of you were to experiment with the different colors of the bulbs, you may find that they aren\u2019t so bad after all.\nAnd for Kate, when was the last time you tried a CFL?? I also suffer from migraines and seizures and have not had a problem with the newer type bulbs.\nCarole\nposted on March 22nd, 2011 at 3:54 pm\nPlease don\u2019t take away my incandescent light bulbs. The so called \u201cenergy efficient\u201d ones depress me\u2026the light they give off is weird and gives me headaches. Besides that\u2026they aren\u2019t more economical because they break when they are bumped or dropped just as readily as incandescent bulbs but are a health hazard because of the mercury inside. This is crazy. Back off Big Brother and your neurotic eco-nut Sister.\nKristen\nposted on March 28th, 2011 at 8:47 am\nCFLs are only beneficial if they are left on for longer periods of time. If you are like me, conscientious about turning off lights when leaving a room and badgering your children to do the same, you will actually lose the energy and financial benefits attributed to CFLs. They aren\u2019t made to be turned on and off. In daily, residential life they are impractical and without true benefits.\nChildren are particularly vulnerable to Mercury poison. When they play, accidents happen, lamps topple over and bulbs break. This has happened twice in the past 6 months in the bedroom of my two young boys (and no, I do not allow them to run wild or wreak havoc in our home, and still accidents happen). I don\u2019t want mercury in their carpet where they sit for hours playing with their legos. There are no safe levels of Mercury.\nIn a few areas of our home, as in our barn we use CFLs. However, I live in an area with a long, cold winter. The CFLs take too long to heat up to be able to cast any beneficial light when we actually need it. Indoors we have all of our lights on dimmers, even table lamps (plug adapter). With the use of dimmers we are able to minimize kilowatts. Only specialty CFLs work with dimmers. It is not recommended to use any CFLs in enclosed fixtures, i.e. an enclosed ceiling light, as the heat becomes an issue. Nor are they recommended for fixtures in ceiling fans and garage door openers due to vibrations.\nThis is short sighted, reactionary legislation. I make no claim to be the \u201cbrightest bulb on the tree\u201d and even I can see this.\ngwen\nposted on March 28th, 2011 at 8:28 pm\nI really like the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d light bulbs the best. The other ones\u2013even though they promise a longer life\u2013tend to burn out when bumped or something. I also like the heat of the \u201cregular\u201d light bulbs, which is nice in colder weather.\nI don\u2019t like our government dictating our life about what we can and cannot do in these minor issues. Big brother is too controlling.\nAlso, I also believe big brother shouldn\u2019t be dictating to restaurants that they cannot allow smokers in restaurants. Even though I don\u2019t smoke, if smoke bothered me, I would just choose another restaurant. Restaurant owners, in their own private businesses, should be able to make their own calls to what brings in the most business.\nWhat ever happened to the government \u201cby the people, FOR the people.\u201d We are tending to be soooo socialistic.\nLouise Linville\nposted on March 29th, 2011 at 4:41 am\nIn regard to the \u201cnew\u201d flourescent light bulbs. I don\u2019t like them because they are not as bright and they distort reading and colors. But my BIGGEST concern, they give FALSE readings on my pacemaker. I cannot have these bulbs where I am because the pacemaker does not function properly. If it fails, I am really in a mess.\nCheck and see how many people cannot use these bulbs before making everyone go to them.\nTom\nposted on March 31st, 2011 at 2:54 pm\nI think Patric and Northstar have stated the case well. I have used CFLs for the past two years, purchsed somewhere between 35 and 40 bulbs with about half already returned to recycling. That isn\u2019t even close to the projected cost and reliability numbers. Trying to read under a soft or bright white CFL leads to dizziness and/or headaches. CFLs, Halogens and LEDs, although using less energy are not even close to the light quality and performance of the incandescent.\nposted on April 8th, 2011 at 1:50 am\nHello,\nI understand the frustration most people are having over this. Basically I think it can be summed up as a leadership problem. A good leader knows that you get in front of the troops and \u2018pull\u2019 them, you don\u2019t sit behind and \u2018push\u2019 them \u2014 even Napoleon knew this. In other words, the government should be the one leading the way by converting all of their lights to high efficiency LED\u2019s before requiring the rest of the country. If everyone tried to convert at once, the supply of high quality bulbs just does not exist. That is why it would be best for the government to lead by first converting all of their buildings and THEN asking us to follow suit. I will admit that finding good quality LED bulbs is a challenge \u2014 one that I face in work, which is why I became an LED importer myself. Initially I started with specializing in converting high powered halogen bulbs to LED, but did not figure anyone would be interested in converting the lower powered bulbs. But then I did a big job where I converted every fixture (around 200) and did the math. Here\u2019s the math. Converting 150 fifty watt bulbs to 5 watt LED bulbs for landscape lighting that runs 6 hours/day every day saves (50 -5)*150 bulbs *6hrs/day*365days/year = 14,782,500 watts or 14.7 MEGAWATTS per year on ONE house. Converting the smaller 20W bulbs to 3W led\u2019s saved (20-3)*50lights*6hours/day*365days/year = 1.86 MEGAWATTS/year. So, just by changing some landscape lighting bulbs at one house, I was able to save over 16 MEGA watts/year. This was not an average house, but still even on an average house a lot of savings can be made. But consider what I said about leading \u2014 now ONE large highschool converting would save as follows. Assume 1,000 40W flourescent bulbs are replaced with 1,000 20W LED bulbs. Savings: 20W*1000 bulbs*10 hours/day*5days/week*20days/month = 20000000Watts or 20 MEGA watts/month. Actual savings is higher if the building is open for sports on weekends and evenings and if more bulbs \u2013 like stadium bulbs are converted. Still, 20M watts/month per large high school or public building like a library \u2013 we could shut down a number of power plants across the US if our GOVERNMENT would LEAD instead of TALK. As a final note I will say that I prefer to lead from out front which is why all my landscape lighting is LED as well as some of my regular inside lighting \u2014 by the end of this year it will most likely all be LED as I continue to test new products \u2013 which I admit not everyone has time for. The biggest problem we really face is we need to elect people who lead from the front \u2013 not the back. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for Trump if he runs!!\nBetsy Rogers\nposted on April 11th, 2011 at 8:01 pm\nI am very energy-conscious but I agree with others who have complaints/concerns about CFLs. I use CFLs for some things and incandescent bulbs for other things \u2013 and this should remain up to my discretion. This is yet another unfortunate example of a law that was passed before all the ramifications were truly considered. It\u2019s great that it was a bipartisan bill, but I get the feeling it was also an \u201celection season\u201d bill that would help everyone\u2019s PR campaigns. I\u2019m all for saving energy, but to force incandescent bulbs off the market is pretty hypocritical compared to some of the things that Are allowed in this country.\nPeople have the right to fill their houses with guns and ammunition, but I won\u2019t have the right to buy a couple of incandescent bulbs? People have the right to drive a less-than-20-mpg monster SUV all around town, but if a CFL bothers my eyes then too bad for me? I recycle everything that I can find a place that will take it, but I don\u2019t have the right to Not buy something that requires hazardous-waste disposal? And how many people do you think won\u2019t even bother to dispose of CFL\u2019s properly? What then? A ban on CFLs? I predict a ridiculous cycle of bills being passed, modified, repealed, clarified, etc, \u2013 all around in circles in congress and other government offices. And how much paper, electricity, and \u2018hot air\u2019 will be wasted in the end?\nBetsy Rogers\nposted on April 11th, 2011 at 8:30 pm\nJust a side note: I\u2019m not sure everyone remembers that this bill was passed during the Bush administration, not during the current administration. It was bipartisan legislation co-authored by members from both parties, and was part of the Energy Independence Security act of 2007. It was supported by large majorities in both the House and the Senate, and signed by Bush in December, 2007. (Just FYI, since a lot of people are mistakenly assuming this was an initiative of the current administration.)\nAnother side note: The first phase of the legislation is to ban the 100-watt bulb by 2012. I for one see no absolute necessity for the 100-watt incandescent bulb. It\u2019s incredibly inefficient, too bright for most household needs, and many lamps are not rated for that high a wattage anyway (and it\u2019s dangerous when people use them for a lower-rated lamp). I\u2019d be fine with a ban on just the 100W bulb. But other than that, keep your hands off my incandescent bulbs! :)\nmaverick\nposted on April 12th, 2011 at 12:50 pm\nCFL\u2019s are made in many different colors and they do not flicker anymore. The issues brought up here against CFL\u2019s are either made by oil/gas company lobbyists, or people that heard things from others or just plain wackos. The amount of mercury in the ccfl\u2019s is inconsequential if they are recycled properly. The amount of energy they save over their lifetime (and I\u2019m still running original ones from 10 years ago) is more than the cost of the recycling and manufacturing costs, unlike other people claim here. If you are overly sensitive, you should use LED lights.\nIf you are concerned about hazardous waste disposal, you need to not only stop buying CFL\u2019s, but also all other electronics in California. Might as well pack up a tent and walk the earth like Cain. Hazardous waste disposal is everyone\u2019s responsibility. I think we should drive up the price of electricity from 10 cents a kwh to 50 cents. Take the 40 cents and use it towards building solar panels and wind generators. If the right wing wackos here want to still use their 500 watt hallogen with their air conditioning going full blasts, great, their buying more solar panels and wind. That should stop them in their tracks.\nMy dad has a pacemaker and the house is filled with CFL\u2019s and has no problems. From what I\u201dve seen, there\u2019s CFL\u2019s in every store so that must preclude the one person in the world that cfl\u2019s interferers with a pacemaker.\nFor the guy with gov\u2019t for the people by the people. We did make a choice not to have smoking in restaurants, as a majority. Your minority oppinion by a large margin was extinguished with the cigarette smokers. What kind of company that can sell a product that kills more people than all of the world wars put together can stay in business? I think they should ban cigarettes completely. Insurance company should also drop you from coverage if you are a smoker.\nFor the guy that says his cfl\u2019s don\u2019t work in cold weather. That\u2019s correct, the cheap 69 cent ones don\u2019t. Lights of America has one that will work well below 0 degrees and available for a few bucks. Don\u2019t you people know how to use google? Or has the incandescent light bulb held you back to a wood stove and candles?\nBetsy Rogers\nposted on April 12th, 2011 at 7:08 pm\n@Maverick, re- \u201cThe amount of mercury in the ccfl\u2019s is inconsequential if they are recycled properly. \u2026If you are concerned about hazardous waste disposal, you need to not only stop buying CFL\u2019s, but also all other electronics\u2026\u201d\nActually, I am Very concerned about people improperly disposing of electronics, batteries, household hazardous waste, etc. The fact is that a lot of people either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re dumping in to the landfills, down their drains, etc. And then they complain that they \u2018need\u2019 to buy bottled water because they\u2019re worried about what\u2019s in their tap water.\nThe fact is that the lightbulb doesn\u2019t come close to being our biggest source of wasted energy. A recent analysis by Lawrence Livermore National Labs showed that, for 2009 in the U.S., the major source of energy inefficiency (i.e. wasted energy, or what they call \u201crejected energy\u201d in the flow chart) can be attributed to inefficiencies in the \u201cTransportation\u201d category (cars, trucks, etc) which are largely petroleum based. The Transportation category accounted for about Half of our total rejected energy. The second highest source of \u2018rejected energy\u2019 was from inefficiencies in the \u201cIndustrial\u201d category, which are powered mainly by electricity, petroleum, and natural gas. Residential energy inefficiencies were a Very small component of the nations rejected energy totals (less than 3%). I\u2019m quite sure residential use of lightbulbs didn\u2019t account for all of that ~3% either.\nIt would be more efficient (sorry for the pun) if more effort and time went into regulating the efficiency standards of cars, trucks, etc., instead of regulating efficiency standards of household lighting. And when it comes to hazardous waste, a combustion engine certainly creates more hazardous waste (e.g. oil changes) and gives off more pollution and particulates than my 60W incandescent lightbulb ever will.\nWe can\u2019t fix everything overnight, and there\u2019s a lot that needs to be fixed, but there are bigger things that need to be addressed than regulations on household lighting.\nBetsy Rogers\nposted on April 12th, 2011 at 7:10 pm\nSorry, I forgot to provide the link to the LLNL study:\n"}, {"score": 1693.3704, "uuid": "3328dc0c-e17b-5f69-9a36-1b27a002a6cd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-47-01896", "target_hostname": "www.popularmechanics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/reviews/news/4217864", "page_rank": 1.2322803e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Compact <em>Fluorescent</em> <em>Bulbs</em> and Mercury: Reality Check - Popular Mechanics", "snippet": "But only 5 to 10 percent of that electricity <em>is</em> transformed into visible <em>light</em>. \u0093In an <em>incandescent</em> <em>bulb</em>, much of the electricity <em>is</em> used for heat, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> not efficient,\u0094 Leslie says. \u0093<em>Fluorescent</em> <em>lights</em> use electricity to do much more than heat a solid object.", "explanation": null, "document": "Share\nJune 11, 2007 3:06 AM Text Size: A . A . A\nIn the May 2007 issue of Popular Mechanics, we tested seven popular compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and found that the light quality in all of them topped that emitted by traditional incandescent bulbs. Following that lab test, we received a lot of questions from readers regarding the environmental impact of the mercury contained in CFLs. For more of the lowdown on these energy-saving bulbs , we crunched the numbers and checked in with the Department of Energy and Russ Leslie at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. \u0097Julianne Pepitone and Emily Masamitsu\nWhy do CFLs require mercury to produce light?\nCompact fluorescent bulbs are made of glass tubes filled with gas and a small amount of mercury. CFLs produce light when the mercury molecules are excited by electricity running between two electrodes in the base of the bulb. The mercury emits ultraviolet light, which in turn excites the tube\u0092s phosphor coating, leading it to emit visible light.\nHow much mercury is contained in a CFL?\nEach bulb contains an average of 5 milligrams of mercury, \u0093which is just enough to cover a ballpoint pen tip,\u0094 says Leslie, associate director of the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer. \u0093Though it\u0092s nothing to laugh at, unless you wipe up mercury [without gloves] and then lick your hand, you\u0092re probably going to be okay.\u0094\nHow do CFLs and incandescents compare in terms of electricity consumption?\nOn average, CFLs require about 25 percent of the electricity as their incandescent counterparts to produce equivalent light. Replacing an incandescent with a CFL ultimately decreases the amount of electricity the nation\u0092s power plants must generate and, in turn, the amount of carbon dioxide\u0097a powerful greenhouse gas\u0097that they emit into the atmosphere.\nHow much mercury do power plants emit to light a CFL?\nAbout 50 percent of the electricity produced in the U.S. is generated by coal-fired power plants. When coal burns to produce electricity, mercury naturally contained in the coal releases into the air. In 2006, coal-fired power plants produced 1,971 billion kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity, emitting 50.7 tons of mercury into the air\u0097the equivalent amount of mercury contained in more than 9 billion CFLs (the bulbs emit zero mercury when in use or being handled).\nApproximately 0.0234 mg of mercury\u0097plus carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide\u0097releases into the air per 1 kwh of electricity that a coal-fired power plant generates. Over the 7500-hour average range of one CFL, then, a plant will emit 13.16 mg of mercury to sustain a 75-watt incandescent bulb but only 3.51 mg of mercury to sustain a 20-watt CFL (the lightning equivalent of a 75-watt traditional bulb). Even if the mercury contained in a CFL was directly released into the atmosphere, an incandescent would still contribute 4.65 more milligrams of mercury into the environment over its lifetime.\nWhy are incandescents less efficient than CFLs?\nUnlike compact fluorescents, incandescent bulbs produce light by heating the metal filament inside the bulb. When electricity passes through the filament, its temperature rises to 2,300 degrees Celsius, with the heat causing the filament to glow white-hot and emit light. But only 5 to 10 percent of that electricity is transformed into visible light. \u0093In an incandescent bulb, much of the electricity is used for heat, which is not efficient,\u0094 Leslie says. \u0093Fluorescent lights use electricity to do much more than heat a solid object.\u0094\nHow much of a difference can CFLs really make?\nAccording to EnergyStar\u0097a program run by the Environmental Protection Agency\u0097if each U.S. home replaced just one of its incandescent bulbs with a CFL, the electricity saved each year could light 3 million homes and prevent greenhouse gas emissions equal to that of 800,000 cars. And with a recent study for the U.S. government saying that a single 24-watt CFL\u0092s lifetime energy savings add up to the gas equivalent of a coast-to-coast Prius road trip, it\u0092s probably time to get moving on your energy footprint .\nWhat is the proper way to handle a broken CFL?\nOpen the windows and let the room air out for 15 to 30 minutes, then remove as much material as possible without a vacuum cleaner. Using disposable gloves, scoop the glass onto a piece of cardboard and wipe the area with a wet paper towel. For smaller pieces of glass and powder, use duct tape to pull up the fragments and wash your hands after cleaning up the debris.\nWhat is the proper method to dispose a CFL?\nCheck if your local recycling center has services available for CFL disposal by calling directly or by visiting Earth 911 . Plus, as retail giants such as Home Depot and Wal-Mart amp up their CFL offerings, IKEA recycled 156,301 pounds of CFLs in its 2005 fiscal year with its \u0093Free Take Back\u0094 recycling program that puts a collection bin in each store. If that wasn\u0092t enough incentive, officials are looking into providing more consumer bonuses for CFL recycling, Leslie says, and they may even add a deposit value much like cans and bottles.

These fluorescent bulbs, however, were considered unsuitable for places where they were turned on and off frequently, such as bathrooms, as they could not light up as instantly as incandescent bulbs.\nTo solve the problem, Panasonic has successfully developed the \u201chybrid lighting method\u201d by installing a newly-developed compact \u201cquick lamp\u201d in the \u201cquick lamp\u201d allows the bulb to obtain 60 percent of full brightness within the first second after it is turned on, which is 50 percent faster than current Pa-Look Ball Premium bulbs and stands as the industry\u2019s quickest ramp-up time[1].\nA built-in timer automatically turns off the \u201cquick lamp\u201d when the spiral arc tube lamp develops enough brightness. As a result, the new Premium Q bulbs achieve brightness equivalent to that of 54-watt[2] incandescent bulbs with an energy consumption of only 10-watts[3], cutting down CO2 emissions and electricity bills by 80 percent[4].\nThe new Premium Q bulbs deliver the industry\u2019s top performance in lifespan and durability[2]. They last approximately 13,000 hours and can be switched on and off approximately 40,000 times, achieving a 30 percent improvement from the current Pa-Look Ball Premiums. Consequently, the new bulbs can reduce frequency of exchanging bulbs to one-thirteenth compared to 54-watt incandescent bulbs.\nPanasonic continues to implement its commitment to the environmental protection by introducing innovative products such as the Pa-Look Ball Premium Q fluorescent light bulbs.\n[1] As of June 9, 2008 in Japan, compared in luminous flux.\n[2] Refers, here and after, to 60-watt incandescent bulbs with energy consumption of 54-watts.\n[3] Excludes the time in which quick lamp is being lit.\n[4] Excludes lighting of quick lamp. While quick lamp is lit, it consumes 30-watts up to a maximum of 1 minute.\n* Guarana-based: Guarana is an ingredient found in plants that grow in South America. It mostly helps in increasing the level of consciousness as well as the energy levels of the body. It can be compared, to quite an extent, with caffeine.\n* Vitamin B-based: Considered to be amongst the best energy drinks in the market, the ones based on Vitamin Bs are believed to help in kick-starting the body into action.\n* Ginseng-based: Ginseng is the name of an herb that is now-a-days being used as a major ingredient in energy drinks. The potential benefits of Ginseng are increase in energy levels and alleviation of stress.\n* Ginkgo Biloba-based: Ginkgo Biloba is another popular herb that is receiving interest from health drink makers. There are a number of benefits according from it, namely improvement of memory, concentration levels and blood circulation, along with regulation of stress levels.\n* L-Carnitine-based: L-Carnitine is a nutrient produced naturally by the human body. It mainly helps in speeding up the metabolism, improving the energy levels and enhancing the endurance of the body. When used in energy drinks, it accords the same benefits.\n* Sugar-based: A number of energy drinks in the market today have been made using sugar as the main ingredient. Such health drinks provide a lot of energy to the body.\n* Antioxidants-based: Antioxidants are being used for making many energy drinks these days. They not only help the body in killing the free radicals, but also speed up the recovery process of the body after any damage through illness or otherwise.\nEffects of Energy Drinks\nThere are always two sides of the same coins. This proverb holds very true for energy drinks. They concurrence a number of benefits to users, like increased energy levels, faster metabolism, alleviation of stress, improved blood circulation, better endurance levels, etc. Remember that energy drinks as such are not bad for the health; it is their wrong use that leads to the bad effects.\nJadilah orang pertama yang menyukai tulisan ini\nApakah anda menyukai tulisan ini ?\nSuka tulisan ini\nTags: energy , premium\nThis entry was posted on Thursday, October 22nd, 2009 at 12:26 and is filed under General .

Sad, isn't it? They might use less electricity than magnetic ballasts, but what's the cost of the additional labor to keep replacing them? Some are failing under warranty, but we still have the hassle of filing a warranty claim and paying postage to return the old ballasts. And if they aren't under warranty, we are spending more on new ballasts. I don't see how we are saving anything!\nMagnetic ballasts for T8 tubes are available, but I don't know how reliable they are. I would hope that they are as reliable as the old standard T12 mag ballasts, but I shouldn't make that assumption. They are also much more expensive than comparable electronic ballasts.\nEdit: Forgot to mention: The other enemy of T12 magnetic ballasts is 34 watt energy-saving tubes. This is especially true with older ballasts that weren't designed to handle 34 watt tubes. The electrical characteristics are different enough from 40 watt tubes that 34 watt tubes can't be used on all ballasts. Problem is, because of EPACT92, 40 watt tubes are much harder to find and are more expensive. Cheap \"cool white\" halophosphate tubes are only available in 34 watt. The best price my supplier can give me on 40 watt tubes is around $3 per tube for basic Sylvania D41 T12s. However, I can buy them at Menards for around $13 per 10-pack.

Sorry to skilled tech people that work hard but don't do their jobs in not knowing what the heck they are doing and or are better suited for gas station attendants.\nEventually it this good lamp installed into a perfectly bad socket will of course stop working in trashing another lamp. Average like four lamps before really bad in noticing and like 125 hours per lamp less in lamp life. This each lamp at day labor cost per lamp - and each time the fixture was visited in costing time to change the lamp until totally melted down and delaying further in no longer able to light the lamp.\nBy that time, such a fixture will normally be sent back to the shop in not working properly and be replaced by another one.\nOnly a scoop ?

As a result, it is gradually being phased out over the next few years. Yet its replacement, the energy saving light bulb, is not so \u201cgreen\u201d as plugged. Its light does not only damage our eyes, but can even cause hormone-related illnesses \u2013 including cancer!\nBy Benjamin Seiler\nAll glowed out: After 130 years our flash of inspiration is to be retired.\n\u201cYesterday panic buyers were snapping up the remaining bulbs in a last-ditch attempt to stockpile the final supplies,\u201d reported British newspaper The Daily Mail on 7 January 2009. \u201cHundreds of leading supermarkets have already sold their last remaining bulbs after a surge in panic buying.\u201d Millions of English citizens stormed the shops after the British government announced the European Union\u2019s decision to remove the conventional 100-watt incandescent bulb from the market: a reaction that was hardly to be expected from these cool and collected islanders. But, as they say, an Englishman\u2019s home is his castle \u2013 and he clearly does not like his household decisions made for him. Much in contrast to his obedient European German-speaking counterparts, many of whom have not yet even noticed that after a hundred and twenty years the light bulb is soon to be snuffed out.\nIt seems as though the consumer harbours an almost instinctive antipathy to energy saving bulbs: despite massive promotion, only a seventh of all illuminants used in the EU were energy saving light bulbs. In Switzerland this quota was barely a fifth, if you include all neon bulbs. Little wonder, since energy saving light is cold \u2013 not nearly as cosy and warm as normal bulbs.\nThere is a demonstrable measurable reason for this: like candle-light, the incandescent light bulb emits a \u2018natural light\u2019 spectrum, which is similar to the sun in several aspects. All parts of visible light are present in balanced amounts, which is why one talks of a full spectrum light. This is completely different to fluorescent light, to which category all energy saving bulbs belong. This light spectrum consists predominantly of isolated peaks, explaining the disharmonic and penetrative nature of such light in our perception. Instead of a harmonic whole, only single, super-elevated energy peak light frequencies are measured. The same applies to so-called full spectrum lamps, warm tone lamps, daylight lamps or bio-light fluorescent lamps. Although these match the same colour temperature as daylight, the composition of their light radiation has absolutely nothing in common with sunlight.\nBut what\u2019s the point of such nitpicking? Surely light is just light. The main thing is that it brightens up our surroundings sufficiently, right? Wrong - and a dangerous notion at that! Light is not simply present to chase away darkness, not by a long shot. Light is a foodstuff, and indeed the most important one we have. This realization has lead to the emergence of chronobiology and light medicine, a relatively new science based on the laws of quantum physics (see text box), no less. Light governs our hormonal balance, as well as cellular activity in the body. The wrong light at the wrong time interferes with the natural balances of life.\nA difficult risk to assess\nIt is very difficult to estimate how much damage is actually wrought by artificial light, as living organisms are able to recover on a rolling basis. In order to be able to estimate the extent of such damage, it is essential to know how quickly and how robustly a body can regenerate. Yet this is hardly possible in practice, not least because, \u201cfor many years physicians have no longer been trained in the art of healing, but are urged to work and think highly scientifically i.e. physically,\u201d according to light biologist Alexander Wunsch. Thus the biological equation \u201cInjury = damage - repair\u201d is increasingly fading into the background. The founder of psychosomatic medicine Thure von Uexk\u00fcll once tellingly remarked: \u201cPhysicists have begun to believe in the Good Lord again \u2013 only physicians still believe in physicists.\u201d\nConsequently, one can observe the toxic effects of light primarily in experiments at a cellular level, or from epidemiological developments. \u201cSince modern civilisations are subject to predominantly artificial light \u2013 in city dwellers, it is more than 95 percent of our waking hours \u2013 the first question must be whether we can really count the sun as the only decisive factor in light-related damage,\u201d warns the physician Wunsch. \u201cYet precisely this occurs with regard to skin cancer, to the development of cataracts and to the emergence of age-related macular degeneration, by which almost a third of people aged over 65 in industrial nations have been affected.\u201d\nThe role of artificial light, on the other hand, was barely investigated until very recently, although it is in fact the dominant light influence on us. That our psyche responds accordingly to it is a fairly obvious fact. In order to research this idea better, classrooms at a Hamburg primary school were fitted with a lighting system, whose intensity of illumination and colour temperature could be changed by the teachers. Bright, cold white light was supposed to energise the students in the morning, while a dim reddish light was meant to calm them down. It worked. For a year, the Hamburg University researchers compared the achievements of a class working under such dynamic light with a class working under standard illumination. Result: under the former, reading speed rose by approximately 35 percent. Attention and concentration improved, while disruptive hyperactivity was also positively influenced by the right light.\nCancer: when night turns to day\nRather less positive is the fact that artificial light can scramble our hormones. This means that illnesses that can be traced back to disturbances in the hormonal balance \u2013 such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes or even cancer \u2013 are ever increasing. New study results indicate a link between artificial light and the emergence of breast cancer. A link is also thought to exist between this type of light and both colon and prostate cancers.\nSince 1987 American cancer researcher Richard Stevens has been warning that nocturnal artificial light can cause cancer in humans, mainly because light causes our internal clocks to get out of time, and the body produces too little melatonin \u2013 which also directly affects hormones. According to Professor Stevens, \u201cMelatonin and breast cancer go together: for one thing, melatonin slows the growth of tumours. For another, it inhibits the production of estrogens. If less melatonin is produced, the level of estrogen rises. And estrogens play a significant role in the emergence of breast cancer.\u201d\nThe Harvard Medical School stores data from 120,000 nurses, who fill out a questionnaire on their health every year. In effect, the more often nurses work nights, the more frequently they fall ill with breast cancer. Blood tests revealed that night nurses have considerably less melatonin and more breast cancer-encouraging estrogens in the blood. Similarly, another investigation on blind women concluded that these women fell ill less frequently of breast cancer than sighted women.\nAt the Institute for Occupational Medicine, Social Medicine and Social Hygiene, the Cologne University Clinic has evaluated around thirty studies from around the world on the topic of shift work and cancer, in which particular attention was paid to external clocks, in particular light. A crucial result of these meta-analyses demonstrates that there is a statistically significant increase in the risk of cancer in two occupational groups investigated, namely flight personnel and shift workers \u2013 particularly affected are flight personnel. The increase in the risk of cancer is 70 percent for breast cancer and 40 percent for prostate cancer. Professor Stevens also worked on a study which was published in February 2009: employees at the University of Haifa collected data on prostate cancer illnesses from a total of 164 nations, focusing on a possible link between the disease, artificial light at night and the electricity consumption in these countries. Their suspicion was confirmed: countries with an above average amount of nocturnal artificial light showed an approximately 30 percent increase in prostate cancer rates. The countries with the most intense nocturnal artificial light conditions showed 80 percent more prostate cancer illnesses!\n(...)\nThe full report further reveals how blue light knocks our internal clock completely out of balance and disrupts our day-night rhythm to a dangerous extent.

This isn\u2019t a useful unit of measurement for new energy-saving light bulbs, which consume much less power than old-style incandescent light bulbs. So because comparisons based on wattage are no longer meaningful, the strength of new energy-saving light bulbs is expressed in lumens, which measures instead the amount of light they produce. The higher the number of lumens, the brighter the light.\nIf you haven\u2019t already, you\u2019ll soon start seeing light bulbs categorised by lumens rather than wattage. There isn\u2019t necessarily a correlation between lumens and watts because they measure different things.

Even if you have them installed professionally, understanding recessed light bulbs will enable you to enter into a conversation with your contractor about the type of bulbs you want in your home.\nRecessed Light Bulb Specifications\nThe specifications you should use are typically found inside your recessed lighting can.\nThe first thing that you will want to check when installing your recessed light bulbs are the specifications of the bulb. Every recessed light bulb comes with four specifications: wattage, size, voltage and reflection angle. Depending on your recessed can, you can should use different specifications, or else the bulb will not work properly, and it could be hazardous.\nIn order to check for the specifications that you need, take the trim off of your recessed can. If you look inside, you will see that there are listed maximum wattages and angles inside of your can. These tell you the specifications to look for, assuming you want the maximum illumination from your recessed lighting. You are always free to go under these numbers.\nWattage\nWattage is the amount of electricity that may flow through your bulb. You'll notice that for most recessed cans, the wattage is far lower than you'd expect from a lamp or pendant. This is mostly because recessed lighting is designed to use multiple cans, so each emits less light. How much illumination you will get from this wattage depends on the type of bulb you use, which I will discuss below.\nBulb Codes\nBecause recessed light bulbs shine in a single direction, downwards, the light bulbs used are referred to as \"reflector bulbs\". Reflector bulbs come in two types. First, there are those simply called \"reflector\" bulbs, denoted with the prefix \"R\". These bulbs have a frosted coating and reflect much of their light in a single direction. There are also \"parabolic reflector\" bulbs, denoted with the prefix \"PAR\". These bulbs use a parabolic base to capture of the light. As a rule, \"R\" bulbs are less efficient than \"PAR\" bulbs because of the light that is not properly directed.\nThe number after the \"R\" or \"PAR\" represents the width of the bulb in eights of inches. So, for instance, a PAR16 bulb is 2 inches wide. Typically, the more wattage you use in a bulb, the smaller the bulb must be.\nThis is a typical reflector (\"R\") light bulb. Notice the way that not all light will be reflected forward.\nThe number before the \"R\" or \"PAR\" represents the beam angle of the bulb. Bulbs can come in angles from 3 degrees all the way to 60 degrees across. So, for instance, a 40 degree, two-inch parabolic bulb will be called a 40PAR16. Which angle you choose will affect the way that the lighting appears in your room. If you are using the lighting to highlight a particular object, such as a statue, you should consider a smaller angle. Usually, though, you will be using your recessed lighting for general illumination, in which case you will want to use a wider beam spread, typically 40 or 50 degrees.\nOne quick word needs to be said about recessed wall-washing bulbs. Wall washing is when a light is placed near a wall, and it picks up the texture of the wall by shining onto the wall at an angle. This requires the light to be shone downward and to the side. Some wall washers use reflector bulbs with smaller angles. However, others do not use reflector bulbs at all, relying on the housing to reflect the light in the correct direction. If you are using such a wall washer, it will give very specific specifications as to the type of bulb to use on the housing.\nVoltage\nThere are different voltages available for recessed light bulbs. The most common voltages historically have been 120v and 130v light bulbs. Each of these can run on a standard household current (in North America). There are, however, some differences. A 130v light bulb is less efficient than a 120v light bulb, getting less illumination per watt. However, the 130v light bulb will last longer. Which to choose depends on which goal you wish to reach.\nOn the other hand, there are low-voltage recessed light bulbs. Low-voltage light bulbs produce more illumination per eighth of an inch, allowing you to use more light sources. They are also the standard voltage for LED light bulbs. As a result, low-voltage light bulbs are becoming more common. However, in order to use low-voltage light bulbs, you will need to use a transformer to alter the current. Be sure that you have one installed or are willing to install one should you choose to use low-voltage light bulbs.\nLight Bulb Types\nThere are actually four different types of light bulbs used in recessed lighting. There are traditional incandescent light bulbs, halogen light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs and LED light bulbs. Incandescent and halogen light bulbs are being used less and less frequently.\nIncandescent and Halogen Light Bulbs\nIncandescent light bulbs and halogen light bulbs were the standard recessed light sources used up until about twenty years ago. The primary problem with these light bulbs is that they are terribly inefficient. Aside from the environmental and economic impact of this, they also have the effect that they will be substantially dimmer than fluorescent and LED recessed light bulbs. Because you are limited to a certain wattage per fixture and fluorescent and halogen light bulbs get more illumination per watt, you will get far less light with these bulbs.\nHalogen light bulbs have a reputation for being more efficient and whiter than incandescent light bulbs. However, this reputation is now largely erroneous. Halogen light bulbs are slightly more efficient and whiter than incandescent bulbs, but they are still far less efficient and white than either fluorescent and LED light bulbs. They were the most efficient and white bulbs available, but this is no longer true by a wide margin.\nFluorescent Light Bulbs\nFluorescent light bulbs have undergone something of a revolution in recent decades. They were well-known as being greenish, having color spikes, flickering and causing noise. All of these problems have now been largely resolved. On top of this, they are about five times more efficient than incandescent light bulbs and four times more efficient than halogen light bulbs. This means that your carbon footprint is reduced, your energy bills are lower and you can have more light per recessed can.\nIn addition, Fluorescent light bulbs now come in a wide array of colors. Their color spikes have been significantly reduced to the point of being almost unnoticeable. Their colors range from warmer, reddish colors usually called \"warm white\" or \"soft white\" that imitate the color of traditional fluorescents up to \"cool white\" which mimics the slightly bluish light of daylight. This provides a number of options for integrating their color into your home.\nLED Light Bulbs\nLED light bulbs come in the same parabolic reflectors as halogen light bulbs.\nLED light bulbs have only recently become usable in home lighting, and they are now being used increasingly as recessed light bulbs. They are very energy efficient and have the advantage that they do not contain any toxic mercury like fluorescent bulbs do (though recessed lights are generally be shielded from breakage problems). For now, they are more expensive than fluorescent light bulbs, though their price will likely lower in the future.\nThe difficulty with LED light bulbs is color. White LED light bulbs are actually blue light bulbs with a phosphorescent coating to turn that blue light to white. This process is often not entirely successful, and the success can be more or less from diode to diode. As a result, LED lights are somewhere between white and bluish, and you will need to pay more for the whiter colors. However, if you are looking for non-toxic energy efficient lighting on the whiter end of the color spectrum, they are a very good choice. Remember that LED lighting is typically low voltage, so you will need to have a transformer.\nPutting It All Together\nThere are a number of different things to consider when choosing recessed light bulbs:\nYour wattage is limited by the type of recessed can you use.\nDifferent beam angles will allow your recessed lighting to cover greater or lesser areas.\nThe more efficient your bulbs are, the more illumination you will receive.\nIncandescent and halogen light bulbs are neither efficient nor very bright.\nFluorescent light bulbs are bright and efficient and come in a wide range of colors.\nLED light bulbs are non-toxic, as bright and efficient as fluorescent light bulbs, but are limited to the white-blue part of the color spectrum.\nWith this information in mind, you will be in a better position to select the recessed light bulbs that are right for you.\n"}, {"score": 1657.2242, "uuid": "c79a74a0-9413-5d14-b61c-f85f3e620b6a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0701wb-91-06391", "target_hostname": "www.diyadvice.com", "target_uri": "http://www.diyadvice.com/diy/electrical/lights/installing-fluorescents/", "page_rank": 1.183588e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Installing <em>Fluorescent</em> <em>Lights</em> - How to Install a <em>Light</em> Fixture <em>or</em> Fan -", "snippet": "<em>Fluorescent</em> lighting <em>is</em> inexpensive to run, but the <em>light</em> from standard tubes <em>is</em> cold and industrial.

This means that it controls the part of the nervous system regulating automatic and metabolic processes in the body. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger and thirst, water balance and blood pressure. It links the nervous system to the endocrine system.\nAdditionally, it controls the body's master gland, the pituitary, which secretes many essential hormones. The hypothalamus initiates the body's stress response, affects our emotions and controls immune functions.\nSignificantly, our \"body clock\" is also housed in tiny centers located in the hypothalamus. Our body clock-controlled circadian rhythms are the 24 hour cycles of light and darkness.\nThese light-sensitive rhythms are not an invention of modern society. They are biological constructs imposed upon us by Mother Nature.\nConsequently, anything that disrupts these rhythms (like inadequate sunlight) has a far-reaching impact on our body's ability to function.\nThis explains why, since sunlight has been shown to be the most effective regulator of the body clock, it is also the quickest method of recovering from jet lag. (Or you can supplement sunlight with full spectrum lighting indoors.)\nBut it gets even more interesting. In 1998, scientists found that they could reset the body clocks of study subjects by shining bright lights onto the back of their knees. This demonstrates that areas of the skin are significantly affected by light, just like the retinas of our eyes. This led researchers to conclude that the body may have more than one body clock, although the eyes still seem to be the main route by which the circadian system senses light.\nSo why the anatomy lesson?\nWell, the body clock control centers in the hypothalamus are also connected to the pineal gland, which is considered the body's light meter. The pineal gland secretes the important hormone melatonin.\nMelatonin, the \"hibernation hormone\", increases with decreased light, which explains that tired feeling that comes on when it begins to get dark outside -- even if it is only 4 o'clock in the afternoon. And it also explains why decreased melatonin is found in those with insomnia (and why full spectrum light is beneficial for healthy sleep).\nConversely, serotonin, the brain hormone associated with mood elevation, rises with exposure to bright light, and falls with decreased sun exposure. This has been proven by many scientific studies, including one reported in the well-respected medical journal Lancet in 2002. This study measured blood levels of serotonin, finding that production of serotonin by the brain was directly related to the duration of bright sunlight.\nThis has been proven by many scientific studies, including one reported in the well-respected medical journal Lancet in 2002. This study measured blood levels of serotonin, finding that production of serotonin by the brain was directly related to the duration of bright sunlight.\nWhat's more, full spectrum lighting has even more benefits...\nImprove Your Performance at Work and Home With Full Spectrum Lights\nSadly, antiquated fluorescent lights are still the norm in the average work setting, the place where most Americans spend half their lives. Studies have shown that poor lighting in the workplace triggers headaches, stress, fatigue and strained watery eyes, not to mention inferior work production.\nConversely, companies that have switched to full spectrum lights report improved employee morale, greater productivity, reduced errors and decreased absenteeism.\nNaturally, if you own your own business, I would certainly recommend a complete switch to full spectrum lighting throughout the workplace for those reasons noted above. In fact, that's exactly what I have done in my own office. Now all my employees have the benefit of full spectrum lights for their good health, mood and productivity.\nIf you don't have the luxury of doing that, your best (and healthiest) option is to replace the bulb or bulbs in your desk lamp or nearest light with Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum light bulbs, which are compact enough to fit most standard light fixtures and lamps.\nAs a consequence, you will certainly have decreased eye strain and fatigue with less glare while working in front of your computer monitor -- this has been just one of the great benefits that I can personally attest to.\nThose who work at home -- as well as those who just want the healthiest home environment possible -- can enjoy all the benefits of natural balanced sunlight indoors by switching to Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum lights. Better health, better mood, better productivity, and better energy ...\nBy the same token, those who enjoy hobbies such as sewing, drawing, or crafts like scrapbooking will notice a decrease in eye strain (and the tight muscles that go with it) ... and find the improvement in color clarity and vibrancy quite obvious while working under natural full spectrum lighting.\nEqually important, older individuals generally require more light than those who are younger, just to perform the same tasks comfortably. In fact, one study concluded that workers over age 50 required twice the light level of young adults for comfortable work.\nSo, it certainly stands to reason that our aging population -- especially baby boomers and retirees -- have eyes which are seriously challenged by poor lighting. Replacing those old-fashioned bulbs with Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum lights can make a remarkably significant difference for those of us in middle age and beyond.\nYour Children's Teachers Will Thank You\nIn a similar fashion, with full spectrum lighting, your children and grandchildren will be able to read, learn, study and do their homework much more effectively at home. In fact, studies of the use of full spectrum lighting in classrooms and schools overwhelmingly demonstrate positive effects on learning performance and achievement.\nPioneer light researcher (and full spectrum light inventor) Dr. John Ott first coined the term \"malillumination\" to describe sunlight deficiency and the harmful effects of typical cool-white and pink-colored fluorescent light on learning, behavior, health and longevity.\nEven back in 1980, scientists reported that cool-white fluorescent lighting produced increased levels of the stress-producing hormones ACTH and cortisol. They noted that their findings explained the agitated mental and physical behavior of children sitting all day under artificial lights, and recommended a change to illumination similar to that of natural light.\nDr. Laurence Martel, President of the National Academy of Integrative Learning, Inc., believes that light, particularly full spectrum light, is a critical element in what he calls the ergonomics of learning. As he puts it, malillumination is to light what malnutrition is to food.\nDr. Martel references a large body of research evidence indicating that the cool-white fluorescent bulbs found in virtually all classrooms cause increased stress, hyperactivity, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, attention problems and poor learning performance.\nBecause of this, he coined the term \"posillumination\" to refer to the simulated sunlight found in full spectrum lighting. He states that there is an overwhelming body of research showing its positive impact on human behavior, learning, health, hardiness and longer life.\nAccording to the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, poor lighting is one of the major environmental dangers at school that our children are subjected to. This journal cited studies showing the positive benefits of \"daylighting\" or creating classrooms with full spectrum lighting.\nIn one study done in a North Carolina school, children attending classes with full spectrum lighting vs. traditional lighting were healthier overall, attended school several more days per year, and exhibited more positive moods. And a California school study showed that students in classrooms with more natural lighting demonstrated faster progression in both math and reading tests.\nAnd students aren't the only ones noticing benefits in the classrooms. Teachers have reported more energy, elimination of headaches and decreased frustration when classrooms have been fitted with full spectrum lights.\nUnfortunately, unless you are a wealthy philanthropist, you may not be able to upgrade your child's school to full spectrum lighting. However, you can upgrade your child's home learning environment to promote the highest level of functioning possible by replacing lights in your home and, especially, your child's study area with full spectrum light bulbs.\nPets and Plants Need Full Spectrum Light Too\nJust like you, your pets need adequate sunlight -- and will derive much the same benefit from Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum lighting in your home. With veterinarian bills rivaling the cost for our own medical bills, boosting their health is an extra bonus of using full spectrum light ... and just makes good sense.\nSimilarly, plants also grow better under full spectrum lights. Obviously, plants depend on quality light for their growth -- just like we do. Relying on sunlight coming through windows during part of the day is not adequate. Add to this other factors such as air pollution, cloudy weather, and dirty windows (or no windows) and you can easily see how the addition of full spectrum lighting will make your green thumb even greener.\nWhat Makes A Light Full Spectrum?\nI apologize in advance if this gets a bit technical. However, as a consumer, you are owed all the facts so that you can make informed choices, especially with such important issues about your health and well-being -- wouldn't you agree?\nFirst of all, you should consider these key points:\nIn order to achieve natural balanced sunlight INDOORS, your light bulbs must contain a full spectrum of color (imagine all the colors of the rainbow).\nAdditionally, true full spectrum lighting must contain infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. (The hazards of UV have been vastly exaggerated -- moderate levels of UV are not only safe, but essential for good health.)\nMercola Healthy Home full spectrum light bulbs contain all these essential ingredients (full color spectrum, IR and UV) to help you receive the complete balanced complement of natural light.\nThird, there is no such thing as an incandescent full spectrum light bulb (despite what some unscrupulous sales people might tell you). Inexpensive neodymium bulbs touted as \"full spectrum\" lights will not give you the health benefits of true full spectrum, and are consequently no bargain.\nAnd fourth, fluorescent bulbs are the ONLY type of bulbs that currently produce complete and healthy full spectrum lighting. But, as you will see, not all fluorescent bulbs are the same ...\nThere is some terminology you need to be aware of to really understand why Mercola Healthy Home bulbs are TRUE full spectrum lights ... and why many bulbs on the market are not.\nTwo terms you should understand are Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and Color Retention Index (CRI).\nCorrelated Color Temperature is a scale used to describe temperature in degrees Kelvin (abbreviated as 'K'). The CCT rating for a lamp is a general indication of the warmth or coolness of its appearance. As CCT increases, that means the appearance of the source light has shifted from reddish-white toward bluish-white; in other words, the higher the color temperature, the cooler the color appearance.\nNow, this may seem counter-intuitive -- we want to believe that bluer light sources have a lower or \"cooler\" color temperature, and that yellow light sources have a higher or \"warmer\" color temperature. However, the exact opposite is true.\nLamps with a lower color temperature (3500K or less) have a warm or reddish-yellow to orange-white appearance. Saturated in red and orange wavelengths, the light brings out warmer colors such as red and orange more richly.\nLamps with a mid-range color temperature (3500K to 4100K) have a neutral or white appearance. The light is more balanced in its color wavelengths.\nLamps with a higher color temperature (4100K or higher) have a cool or bluish-white appearance.\nSo don't be confused: summer sunlight at noon on a clear day has a very cool appearance at about 5500K. The light is saturated in green and blue wavelengths, bringing out cooler object colors such as green and blue more richly.\nThis color temperature of 5500K is exactly the temperature found in Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum light bulbs, making them comparable to mid-day sun, the time of day when the sun has its highest \"photobiotic\" activity.\nThe other term you should understand, the Color Rendering Index or CRI, describes how a light source makes the color of an object appear to human eyes; how well subtle variations in color shades are revealed. CRI is expressed as a rating from 0 to 100; the higher the CRI rating, the better its color rendering ability.\nImagine two objects, one red and one blue, which are lighted by a cool light source with a low CRI. The red object appears muted while the blue object appears a rich blue. Now take out the low CRI light source and put in a cool light source with a high CRI. The blue object still appears a rich blue, but the red object appears more like its true color.\nOne common misconception is that color temperature and color rendering both describe the same properties of the lamp. You can see from the above descriptions that this is not the case. Color temperature describes the color appearance of the light source and the light emitted from it. Color rendering describes how well the light demonstrates colors in objects.\n'Mercola Healthy Home' Full Spectrum Light Bulbs Simulate Natural Sunshine with an Optimal CCT and CRI\nYet another misconception is that all fluorescent lamps are neutral or cool in color appearance and do not have very good color rendering ability. This is largely due to the fact that the typical \"cool white\" fluorescent lamp has historically been the industry standard. It has a cool color (4200K) with a poor CRI rating (62).\nThere are also some \"cool white\" bulbs on the market with a CRI of 82 and CCT of 3000-4100K that are being falsely promoted as full spectrum lights. Unfortunately, this relatively poor color rendering and harsh yellow color promotes eye strain and fatigue -- and the technology is over 75 years old! While the manufacturer can offer these bulbs more cheaply, the light is far from healthy and will lose its intensity quickly, causing these bulbs to need replacing every year.\nThis is simply not the case with more technologically sophisticated full spectrum lighting found in the Mercola Healthy Home bulbs.\nSo, in order to see how close Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum lights are to the natural goodness of sunshine, compare the difference between natural outdoor light, Mercola Healthy Home fluorescent full spectrum light, and ordinary fluorescent light in the spectral distribution charts below:\nI'm sure you can see how closely the Mercola Healthy Home full spectrum light bulb simulates the qualities of natural outdoor light.\nFor even more detailed specifications regarding the Mercola Healthy Home compact fluorescent 20 and 30 watt bulbs, see the chart below:\nMercola Healthy Home\u00a0Compact Fluorescent Description\nLight Output\n"}, {"score": 1649.221, "uuid": "aa6953b1-4bec-5bc0-a92b-d0f36a4b0e9e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1009wb-91-29884", "target_hostname": "www.creeledrevolution.com", "target_uri": "http://www.creeledrevolution.com/blog/2011/02/22/the-incandescent-light-bulb-phase-out-does-not-mandate-cfls-as-a-replacement/", "page_rank": 1.2203588e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "The <em>incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> phase out does not mandate CFLs as a replacement", "snippet": "I do question if you have actually seen what a modern LED <em>bulb</em>&#x2F;fixture such as the offerings from CREE are capable of.

It even means we could turn to slightly more efficient incandescents that use halogen technology (although this borderline defeats the purpose of the standards, since halogens just barely make the energy-efficiency cut).\n"}, {"score": 1626.7332, "uuid": "fe660545-2b99-58e0-a723-5a10a52bc074", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0917wb-70-15031", "target_hostname": "www.liquidleds.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.liquidleds.com.au/blog/learning-center/changing-broken-light-bulb/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Learning Center &#x2F; Changing a Broken <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> - <em>Is</em> It Really Hard?", "snippet": "Broken <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em> can be very hazardous to your health, especially if it <em>is</em> a <em>fluorescent</em> type, since these <em>lights</em> contain trace amounts of mercury.

The total number of CFLs in use globally nearly doubled between 2001 and 2003 alone, growing from an esti\u00admated 1.8 billion to 3.5 billion units.2\nReliable global data on CFL use since 2003 do not exist, but sales growth in individual countries strongly indicates that total usage continues to increase at a fast pace. Between 2000 and 2004, for example, estimated sales in the United States grew 343 percent-from 21 million to 93 million-and by 2007 they reached 397 million.3 CFL sales in Western Europe grew 34 percent between 2000 and 2004, from 173 million to 232 million units, and in Eastern Europe they rose 143 percent, from 23 million to 56 million units.4 (See Figure 2 and Table 1.)\nThe lightbulb market share for CFLs varies widely among leading industrial nations. In the United States, CFLs accounted for more than 20 percent of sales in 2007, a strong growth from less than 1 percent before 2001.5 But other wealthy nations have shown much higher CFL use rates for quite some time, including 80 percent of households in Japan and 50 percent in Germany (in 1996 in both cases).6 Many developing countries have shown strong CFL market share in recent years as well: 14 percent of sales in China in 2003, for instance, and 17 percent in Brazil in 2002.7\nCFLs are far more efficient than traditional incandescent lightbulbs because they produce less heat to create light, using about 75 percent less energy to produce the same amount of light and lasting up to 10 times longer.8 These energy savings translate into monetary savings. For example, a single CFL bulb can save up to $30 in energy costs in the United States over its lifetime; savings can be even greater where electricity costs are higher.9 Incandescent bulbs burn out after around 1,000 hours of use while CFLs can last for up to 10,000 hours, lowering their cost even without taking energy savings into account.10\nEnergy savings also mean a reduction in greenhouse gases. Electric lighting consumes 19 percent of total electricity grid production and is responsible for more than 1,500 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, the equivalent of the emissions from more than half of the world's light passenger vehicles.11 Replacing\nall the inefficient incandescent lightbulbs with CFLs in the United States alone could prevent 158 million tons of CO2 emissions according to one lighting company, the equivalent of taking more than 30 million cars off the road.12 Sub\u00adstituting CFLs under a global scenario that \u00adminimizes costs would reduce lighting energy demand by nearly 40 percent and save 900 million tons of CO2 a year by 2030, with a cumu\u00adlative savings by then totaling 16.6 billion tons-more than twice the carbon dioxide released in the United States in 2006.13\nA large part of the increase in CFL sales has been due to government action. In 2007, Aus\u00adtralia became the first country to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs, and sales there will be phased out entirely by 2009.14 The European Union, Ireland, and Canada have since announced plans to ban incandescent bulbs.15 The United States has also passed legislation increasing the efficiency standard required for lightbulbs, which will effectively phase out incandes\u00adcents.16 In total, more than 40 countries have announced plans to follow suit.17\nRetail giant Wal-Mart has also promoted the use of CFLs by raising awareness, and the company's action is driving down prices. In November 2006 Wal-Mart announced a goal of selling 100 million CFL units by the end of 2007-which it accomplished by October that year.18\nDespite their many benefits, CFLs have some problems, including quality control at factories in developing countries. To address this issue, the Efficient Lighting Initiative (ELI), launched in 1999 by the International Finance Corporation and the Global Environment Facility, created a certification mechanism for high-\u00adquality products.19 ELI allows manufacturers \u00adto voluntarily have their products tested to see if they meet a technical standard for quality. Those that pass receive ELI's \"seal of approval,\" a well-known international standard, and can qualify for promotions and procurement programs.20\nModern CFLs also contain about 4 milli\u00adgrams of mercury, a dangerous neurotoxin.21 This is less than 1 percent as much mercury as found in old thermometers, but it still means broken bulbs should be treated with care and discarded bulbs should be recycled instead of thrown out.22 And for consumers who rely on coal-fired electricity, one of the largest sources of mercury emissions, the increased energy efficiency of these bulbs means that over its lifetime a CFL-even if it is broken or thrown away-will release significantly less mercury into the environment than an incandescent bulb would.23\nBecause of these issues with CFLs, many scientists and consumers have looked toward light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a better source of energy-efficient lighting. LEDs are semiconductor pinpoint lights that when clustered together can function as a lightbulb. They are more than twice as efficient as CFLs and can last five times as long. 24 However, LEDs also have several drawbacks, such as high cost (up to $60 per bulb), a harsh white light that con\u00adsumers find unappealing, and a more focused light stream that is not well suited for ambient lighting. 25 These problems have prevented LEDs from catching on with consumers. But as they are improved through new research and development, LEDs could become the next genera\u00adtion of energy-efficient lighting. 26 Recent market projections indicate that LEDs could become cost-competitive with CFLs in as little as five years. 27\nIncluded Trends:\nCFL Production in China, 2001-06;CFL Sales in Selected Regions and Countries, 2000-07;Estimated World Sales of Compact Fluorescent Lamps, 1988-2006\n\u00a9 2011 | Worldwatch Institute | All Rights Reserved\n1776 Massachusetts Ave., NW | Washington, DC 20036 | Phone: (202) 452-1999\nFooter Menu\n"}, {"score": 1616.6781, "uuid": "513ae073-e847-5ff2-9d1f-5a3c81aa8888", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0813wb-28-20927", "target_hostname": "earth911.com", "target_uri": "http://earth911.com/news/2010/10/28/the-phase-out-of-incandescent-light-bulbs-what-you-need-to-know/", "page_rank": 1.5044767e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "The Phase-Out of <em>Incandescent</em> <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em>: What You Need To Know - Earth911", "snippet": "She <em>is</em> a freelance writer based in New York City.

This has never been true in my house. I have replaced each of the 7 CFLs installed within a year or less. The 30 or so incandescent bulbs that existed in my house before I moved in 6 years ago are still working, minus 4. I am now putting the incandesents back when the CFLs burn out. Junk for more money? No thanks. Maybe the laws of physics cease to exist in my house?

It is impossible to have \u201cCFL use four times less energy to run\u201d than incandescent bulbs. For example, let\u2019s suppose that an incadescent bulb uses 60 watts during an hour. For a CFL bulb to use \u201cfour times less energy\u201d that would require it to use 60 watts \u2013 4*60 watts = -180 watts. How can a CFL bulb use a negative amount of electricity?

Now when I say cold I mean roughly 20 \u2013 30 degrees. Your meaning of cold may be different, but for the majority of the country that 20 \u2013 30 degrees is what cold is.\nI have CFLs in my house that have been in place for 4 or 5 years now and have not burnt out. I was replacing the incandescent on those same lights yearly. I really don\u2019t see the problem with CFLs they come in all shapes and sizes now, and different lighting types. As far as up front cost goes, keep your eyes out for sales at your local hardware stores. I couple months ago I bought just some standard CFL bulbs for $1 piece on a 3 day sale at ACE hardware. I stocked up and bought 15 of them, and now I don\u2019t have to buy any more for a long time. Also look for rebates from your local electric company I have seen in many stores where you can instant rebate on certain brands of CFLs and LEDs. Yes I know you have to recycle them but I have box in my garage I put the bad ones and when I get couple of them I take them to Home Depot for recycling.

It acknowledges that \u201cenergy efficiency standards will inevitably make most incandescent bulbs obsolete, and give a boost to their more energy-efficient competitors\u201d. How will this happen except if incandescents can\u2019t meet the new standards and are excluded from the marketplace? But it then repeats \u2013 unchallenged \u2013 the line that \u201cno one is requiring you to buy a CFL \u2013 not now, not ever\u201d. I suppose that\u2019s technically true since you can buy an LED instead of a CFL. But it\u2019s presented in the context of challenging the idea that ordinary bulbs will banned. If ordinary bulbs are regulated out of the marketplace, then yes, that\u2019s a ban, and the critics are right.\nThe most egregious example is the statement that \u201cthe legislation will force manufacturers [of LED and CFL bulbs] to make them even better\u201d. If LED and CFL bulbs had to continue competing against incandescent ones, as they have up to now, THAT would force the manufacturers to improve them. But by removing incandescent bulbs as a competitor, the legislation will actually reduce the pressure on manufacturers of other bulbs to improve their products.\nSome elementary understanding of how the marketplace works would have greatly improved this article and made it less of an advocacy piece.\nCarol\nposted on November 14th, 2010 at 11:32 am\nTo all you whiners out there that can\u2019t\nstand to wait one or two seconds for a\nlight to come on, I say GOOD GRIEF!!!\nit\u2019s only a second.

I\u2019m the one who pays the electricity bill, and if nothing else, they\u2019ve already paid for themselves in terms of peace of mind. They come on at about 80% brightness and take a few minutes to warm up (big waah), and I\u2019ve replaced one or two, but overall, they\u2019ve held up well. At first, my wife complained about the light color, so I went back to Home Depot a couple times until I found the right style. Now no one notices a difference. For me, the switchover was a no brainer, but it\u2019s sad that some people want to hold on to incandescents like an old blankie\u2026.to the point that the government has to regulate common sense.

I had the same negative experience with old CFLs but, the new ones work a lot better. Also, if you have regular flouresent tube lighting with magnetic ballasts, try converting over to the T8 lights and ballasts (for 4 ft length). They use less energy and flick on faster than the old ballasts. And, don\u2019t forget, LEDs. They work with dimmers!\nThere is a reason government has to get involved. Older technologies have huge advantages over newer ones such as the plant & equipment investment having been paid for and a public resistant to change to name just a couple. So, to push us ALL into a better, greener environment, the gov\u2019t has to give us all a push.\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be MY choice to pay more for electricity if I prefer the light from an incandescent bulb?\u201d The answer is because when you and a lot of other people do it, the practice uses more energy driving up the cost for everyone, dumping more carbon into the atmosphere making everyone else\u2019s life more miserable. Let me ask you something. Why should I have to shell out more money for my electric bill and live on a more toxic planet just because you\u2019re not willing to get off your duff and make a change for the better?\nBrian\nposted on November 26th, 2010 at 7:43 pm\nHey Noman (Norman?),\nI had a similar problem with family members not turning lights off.

However, the article as well as people dance around the fact that the mercury in the CFLs are much higher than what is in incandescent bulbs. In fact, there is a specific disposal for these bulbs and if one is broken in your home, CALL the EPA!!!! The article tries to say that the amount of mercury is so insignificant that you would literaly have to lick the mercury to become affected by it. Well that\u2019s completely wrong, remember in science lab when the teacher would say do not drop the thermometer because the mercury can get into the air and inhaled into your body? Same goes with a broken bulb, and the glass has to be sealed in an air tight container and must be disposed of properly\u2026not just in the trash. I\u2019m not convinced on CFLs, but I am on the bandwagon for LEDs.\nMarty\nposted on January 8th, 2011 at 7:02 pm\nPhew. lots of negatives.\nSome CFLs WILL work with dimmers. More expensive than Regulars. READ THE PACKAGE before you buy.\nThe color rendition of various CFLs are different just like conventional Flourescents. Try several, find one you like and then look at the Color Temperature Rating for the CFL (Soft whites are 2700K).\nI live where -20F is pretty normal in the winter. There are CFLs which are rated for a minimum stating temperature of -20F (-28.9C). Again READ THE PACKAGE before you buy. (There are others that do not have to light below +60F)\n(Yes I live on a Solar PV powered system and MUST pay attention to things like this)\nTony Kane\nposted on January 11th, 2011 at 9:36 am\nI am the purchasing agent for an electrical wholesaler. There are CFLs that are rated for dimmers and, yes, they do cost more than the regular CFLs. Motion sensors are tricky. Older ones do not work with fluorescents of any kind. Most of the newer ones on the market today do. Older CFLs(3 years or older) did flicker when powering. The newer ones are instant on and do take a couple of minutes to achieve full brightness. As mentioned in earlier comments cold temps can be a problem. Again you should read the package. The industry push now is LEDs. In the next couple of years the technology and pricing of LEDs will evolve and CFLs will become less and less expensive. Being on the wholesale purchasing end of the industry, my suggestion before laying out some serious cash for LEDs would be to wait. The market right now is being flooded with LEDs of varying quality. As with all new technologies, the longer it is on the market the cheaper they will become. It seems every lighting company has new LEDs that they are trying to peddle. If you are interested in buying LEDs, look for a name you recognize. They might be a little more expensive than others but, you get what you pay for. There is nothing worse than buying a light bulb with a five year warranty and then two years later taking it back to the store where you bought it to get a replacement and find out the company is no longer in business. It has happened.\nMargaret\nposted on January 13th, 2011 at 1:00 pm\nThe quality of CFL is just not consistent. We have many we bought at Home Depot that only last a few months. I can put 2 brands in different ceiling fixtures and one will burn out quickly, while the other lasts much longer. I never found that with incandescents.\nWe have many fixtures in our house that use bulbs that are not yet manufactured as CFL or LED (vanity bulbs, small base bulbs, and flame tips to name a few). We have pendant lights in the kitchen that need a clear bulb. When are these going to be available? I was glad to finally see dimmable CFLs, but the cost is ridiculous! Considering the short life span of many of the CFLs I have purchased, I am not anxious to pay this price.\nAlso, disposing of bulbs is a problem. Our recycling program doesn\u2019t accept them, which means I need to find another place and also make a storage space for them. Ugh!\nnoman\nposted on January 14th, 2011 at 10:21 am\nThanks Tony, good info.

Check out (below) the EPA\u2019s guidelines for cleaning up a broken bulb (from http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/lighting/cfls/downloads/CFL_Cleanup_and_Disposal.pdf ). You\u2019re suppose to \u201cair out the room\u201d and turn off central air/heat during cleanup AND for the next several times you vacuum the area where the bulb broke. They say to THROW AWAY any clothing or bedding that comes in contact with the broken glass because washing these things \u201cmay contaminate the machine and/or pollute sewage.\u201d Seriously?\nFrom energystar.gov website:\n\u201cBecause CFLs contain a small amount of mercury, EPA recommends the following clean-up and disposal guidelines:\n1. Before Clean-up: Air Out the Room\n\u2022 Have people and pets leave the room, and don\u2019t let anyone walk through the breakage area on their way out. Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more. Shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system, if you have one.\n2. Clean-Up Steps for Hard Surfaces\n\u2022 Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.\n\u2022 Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass pieces and powder.\n\u2022 Wipe the area clean with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes. Place towels in the glass jar or plastic bag.\n\u2022 Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean up the broken bulb on hard surfaces.\n3. Clean-up Steps for Carpeting or Rug:\n\u2022 Carefully pick up glass fragments and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.\n\u2022 Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.\n\u2022 If vacuuming is needed after all visible materials are removed, vacuum the area where the bulb was broken.\n\u2022 Remove the vacuum bag (or empty and wipe the canister), and put the bag or vacuum debris in a sealed plastic bag.\n4. Clean-up Steps for Clothing, Bedding, etc.:\n\u2022 If clothing or bedding materials come in direct contact with broken glass or mercury- containing powder from inside the bulb that may stick to the fabric, the clothing or bedding should be thrown away. Do not wash such clothing or bedding because mercury fragments in the clothing may contaminate the machine and/or pollute sewage.\n\u2022 You can, however, wash clothing or other materials that have been exposed to the mercury vapor from a broken CFL, such as the clothing you are wearing when you cleaned up the broken CFL, as long as that clothing has not come into direct contact with the materials from the broken bulb.\n\u2022 If shoes come into direct contact with broken glass or mercury-containing powder from the bulb, wipe them off with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes. Place the towels or wipes in a glass jar or plastic bag for disposal.\n5. Disposal of Clean-up Materials\n\u2022 Immediately place all clean-up materials outdoors in a trash container or protected area for the next normal trash pickup.\n\u2022 Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials.\n\u2022 Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific\narea. Some states do not allow such trash disposal. Instead, they require that broken and unbroken mercury-containing bulbs be taken to a local recycling center.\n6. Future Cleaning of Carpeting or Rug: Air Out the Room During and After Vacuuming\n\u2022 The next several times you vacuum, shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system and open a window before vacuuming.\n\u2022 Keep the central heating/air conditioning system shut off and the window open for at least 15 minutes after vacuuming is completed.\u201d\nEcoHomeStore\nposted on February 2nd, 2011 at 12:36 pm\nI\u2019m waiting on the ESLs that will be shipped sometime this month.

There is no energy cost savings (look it up), bulbs don\u2019t use that much energy on their own. If you save $10 a year it would be amazing (per bulb).\nCFLs either burn out or simply \u201cget dimmer\u201d over time\u2026so your 4-5 year CFLs are probably a whole lot dimmer than brand new-sure they have not burned out, but they light the provide is lumen for lumen, less than a new bulb.\nCFLs play havoc with the mind as they are turning off/on 200 times a second and can cause seizures and aggravate skin conditions such as psorasis.\nnoman\nposted on February 8th, 2011 at 10:21 am\nHave all of you who are so paranoid about CFLs ever watched a movie or anything on TV?

All bulbs were placed in the fixtures the same day. After two years I removed ALL CFL\u2019s from my home. The CFL\u2019s in the three fixtures were taking over three minutes to come to full light and this is inside the house not outside (don\u2019t even go there with me on CFL\u2019s being used outside). The light coming from the CFL\u2019s was significantly less than that coming from the fixture with the Incandescent bulbs. The reduction in light from the CFL\u2019s was causing me to turn or more lights and I was even bringing lamps from other rooms just so I could see what I was doing in this one room at night.\nAfter removing all the CFL\u2019s throughout my home I have been able to see to read or do embroidery without severe eyestrain. The color is warmer rather than being the cold blue color that comes from the CFL\u2019s. Yes, I did purchase the \u201cwarm color\u201d CFL\u2019s and the term warm should have never been used to describe a CFL bulb.\nI am glad to have these bulbs out of my house and I will never buy another one, ever! I am stocking up on the wattage bulbs I use. Even in England incandescent bulbs are being sold. Of course, they are sold as heat lamps but, they can be purchased.\nI have quite a few halogen light fixtures in my home and they at least produce light when I flip the switch.\nUsing CFL\u2019s outside is laughable. I live in Utah and even at night in summer months the CFL\u2019s take several minutes to come to full light. I would never use one of these bulbs where I need light for safety. In winter months the CFL\u2019s never come to full light output.\nBOYCOTT CFL\u2019S. Can\u2019t afford LED\u2019s as they are costing $10.00 plus per bulb.\nJom\nposted on February 16th, 2011 at 1:40 am\nCFL\u2019s are not good for every application. They are okay in most indoor locations that are on standard switched fixtures. However.\n1) They are no good in decorative lighting like chandeliers with candelabra fixtures.\n2) They cannot be dimmer and you should never put them in a socket controlled by a dimmer.\n3) The should never be used in certain electronically controlled circuits, like some photocell actuated circuits (i.e. on a dusk off a dawn) and in some infrared controlled circuits.\n4) They are notoriously bad in cold climates. In wintertime in outdoor fixtures they will come on but they are extremely dim and take 10 minutes or more to reach full brightness. Likewise I wouldn\u2019t use them as utility lamps in freezers or refrigerators.\n5) Never use a CFL as an oven light.\n6) never use them in appliances.\nCFL\u2019s have their place but they are not complete replacements for incandescents. And, there are some people who simply don;t like the type of light they get from CFL\u2019s\nIncandescents have stood the test of time and will be around for along long time to come. So far the versatility of the incandescent is unmatched.\nConservMore\nposted on February 22nd, 2011 at 8:49 pm\nMany of you are complaining that CFLs do not turn on right away, flicker or going dim (vs. dimmable). I suspect those of you who have tries SOME of the LEDs will mention that they also dim over time. Try buying QUALITY!\nCFLs \u2013 First of all \u2013 check your CFLs to see if they are a magnetic or electronic ballast. Many hardware store employees do not know the difference, so the easiest way is to look at the package. If there is an \u201cM\u201d ANYwhere in the model/part number, it is Magnetic \u2013 DON\u2019T buy that one if you do not want delay, flicker or dimming over time! Make sure you get the Electronic Ballast; it may cost a bit more \u2013 I usually pay $1-$2 per bulb for the 100w equivalent and a bit more for 3-way or even more for the dimmable ones. With my erratic work hours, my lights are often on 24/7 and the savings does add up. I have only once broken a CFL and I just put on disposable gloves to clean it up. My town has a \u2018clean-up\u2019 day to dispose of various can\u2019t-go-in-trash items.\nLEDs \u2013 Again check QUALITY. The reason that most LEDs go dim relatively quickly is that they are not made with a heat sink. Check out the products from FineLite.com. I have used their products extensively and even specially ordered them for a custom mobile office (Mini-RV). Each bulb has an individual heat sink. Over several YEARS of constant use, they have had any decrease in output (lumens) and they have withstood the vibrations of being installed in a moving vehicle. True they were a bit more than some others, but I would rather keep a quality product for a long time than have to constantly discard and replace.\nI have not tried the ESLs, but then I do not expect to need replacing my current setup for quite some time.\nMiffed\nposted on March 2nd, 2011 at 9:25 am\nThese CFLs give me ocular migraines because of the indiscernable flashing.

What, pray tell is your doctorate in? Please don\u2019t say math. If I put a 14 watt CFL in my 60 watt fixture, I am using 76.7% less energy. The MATH works this way\u2026 14/60=23.3 or, 14 is 23.3% of 60. 100-23.3=76.7 Hmmm\u2026not hard to figure out \u201cDoc\u201d.\nI replaced all of my 60w lamps with 14w cfl (electronic balast). I get 80% illumination instantly and in less than 5 minutes have full illumination. I bought the color that was comfortable to me AND, the fact that it doesn\u2019t come on at full intensity help ME with my own light sensetivity issues in that I get serious headaches from high intensity flash or lighting. The slower increase to full illumination allows my eyes to adjust better which makes it less likely that I will get a headache.\nNone of my lights make any noise except when I turn them of\u2026 they click. With my \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d CFL\u2019s I have saved over $200.00 over the past 3 years partly from the energy saved and partly from not having to buy more bulbs. With my savings, I bought a 750w microwave that is Energy Star rated and makes popcorn that tastes like money. I have never broken any of my lights cuz, I haven\u2019t TOUCHED them in 3 years. If, in the next 5 years, one or two of these evil lil s%^ts decides to die on me, my local HOME DEPOT will take them off my hands for me at no cost. I may even decide NOT to make a special trip to turn them in (since they take up less that .25 cuft in my closet); instead, I may just wait until I need some more daffodils for my flower garden and replace those nasty dead CFL bulbs with some flower bulbs\u2026 in the same trip.\nSeriously\u2026 No one ever demanded that IBM or APPLE make our home PC\u2019s betterstrongerfaster. They did that on their own and much to our (the consumer) benefit. They even imposed \u201cgreen tech\u201d arbitrarily when they set my PC up to go to sleep if I leave it running and walk away. How dare they? What if I want my PC to stay awake, dammit? Well, I guess I can turn that off cuz they left me the option.\nWould anyone here mind a gas burning car that gets 100mpg? I have a 15 gallon gas tank on my 1997 Jeep. If my engine was rated at 100mpg, I could go see my sister in NY on one tank of gas (from VA). Even at 3.50/gal that is a 52.50 trip just for the gas. Round trip air is a little less than $200.00 (not counting all those lil fees for convenience items like baggage\u2026plus a rental care that gets 35mpg) It really is a no brainer.\nIt is amazing to me that people are so resistant to change in spite of the obvious benefits. We can come up with any number of \u201creasons\u201d why we shouldn\u2019t do something. But the truth is that if we don\u2019t step out and try to make things better, then nothing will ever get done. Instead of complaining about the quality of the products available, we should tell our manufacturers what we need so they will make good on our demands.\nOur society assumes that what we get off the shelf should be exactly what we want or need. That is unrealistic in the sense that unless the producers get feedback from us, they will just keep guessing as to what to put on those shelves. If I pop some popcorn in my microwave oven, and I decide that there is not enough salt, do I take that popped popcorn back to Orville Redenbacher and demand that he put more salt in it? NO, i get out my salt shaker and fix the problem so I can go watch my movie on my Energy Star rated LED flat screen TV.\nBut, if I want GE to build me a better CFL/ESL/LED to replace my incandecent bulbs, I should probably take a few minutes to send GE some feedback and let them know that I won\u2019t buy poor quality appliances or accessories so they better get on the ball. If they don\u2019t pay attention to me, then I sic my congressman on them and make policy to increase efficiency. Why won\u2019t they do that on their own? Maybe its cuz our throw-it-away-when-I-am-tired-of-it society has let the greedy bastards get away with being greedy for too long\u2026.. jus guessin here.\nWhy do I have a cell phone that has more computing power than my PC at work, but I can\u2019t get a light bulb that uses 90% less energy than my old bulbs, or a car that uses 75% less fuel to take me twice as far as I can go right now? What is wrong with that? Who cares about the environment? I want my efficiencies dammit!!! I want to save more money so I can do some daytrading and stimulate the economy!!!\nWhat!??? If I do all of this, the environment will benefit too? What the hell???!!! REALLY??? HOLY S&%T!!! That means my kids won\u2019t die of asthma or lung cancer!! My grandkids will have better opportunities for education and happiness!!!!\nWHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT THAT???!!!!\nJohn W.\nposted on March 12th, 2011 at 10:35 am\nOk\u2026 I don\u2019t have a doctorate in math either\u2026 The MATH is correct to a point, I just jumped to the conversion and put the emPHAsis on the wrong syLAHbul\u2026 Thus;\n14 divided by 60 equals .2233333, or, stated as a percentage, 14 IS 23.3% OF 60. (100 percent minus 23.3 percent equals 76.7 percent) SO, If I replace a 60w bulb with a 14w bulb, I am still using 76.7 percent less energy.\nMath is hard\u2026.\nCaterina\nposted on March 13th, 2011 at 9:16 pm\nThis is starting to sound like a communist government, telling us what lightbulbs that we can buy. I have replaced some but not all of my lights and I should be able to choose not the government.\nI have replaced some of my lightbulbs with cfl\u2019s in areas where I can and where lights are used more to save energy but not on all because of the kind of fixtures I have. I have an antique looking candelabra fixture where the bent tip flame bulb is actually part of the look. They haven\u2019t made nice cfl bulbs for them yet, they are out there but they are ugly.\nI have recessed light heat lamps in one of my bathrooms in the winter that work very well. I also have some fixtures with dimmer switches, that I haven\u2019t replaced because the cfl\u2019s for dimmers cost a ridiculous amount of money and I heard they don\u2019t work well on the lowest light, they flicker. I need a dimmed light so my children are not scared to go to the bathrrom at night.\nI have touch lamps with three -way bulbs for my childrens\u2019s rooms and the cfl\u2019s don\u2019t work on them. I am not even comfortable in having the cfl\u2019s in my children\u2019s rooms because of the health hazards if they get broken.\nI also agree with Margeret, sometimes the cfl\u2019s only last a couple months while others have lasted longer, the quality is not consistent enough and for the price I\u2019m getting tired of replacing my expensive cfl\u2019s where I do have them.\nCaterina\nGinger\nposted on March 15th, 2011 at 3:49 pm\nWow. Was this a sponsored post? Sure sounds like an advocacy piece as opposed to a fact-based article.\nIt\u2019s repeatedly stated here how everyone\u2019s individual electric bills will be reduced as a result of CFL bulbs replacing incandescent. That\u2019s great, but it is only telling a fraction of the story. For example, the last incandescent bulb manufacturing plant has closed its doors as a result of this legislation, and we import nearly all of our CFL\u2019s from China. That adds a bit of a carbon footprint to each bulb saving you money on your US electric bill.\nFurthermore, China\u2019s not particularly concerned with environmental concerns, so how much damage is being done to the environment by each of these CFL plants that are handling a major toxin? And what about the working environment for these people in China? What\u2019s their exposure to mercury and other toxins?\nIs saving money on your US electric bill worth the trade-off to the environment and the health of other human beings? The big picture isn\u2019t clear, and it\u2019s a very US-centric perspective to think, \u201cWell, MY bill is lower, so it must be good for the environment!\u201d\nAs another commenter stated above, the EPA website differs greatly from the notion that you\u2019d need to \u201click the mercury off of your hand\u201d for their to be a health risk. Per the EPA, the room needs to be ventilated for hours (this includes turning off any heating/air conditioning and leaving windows open). Have fun with that in an interior room, or during the winter in frigid climates. This is because the MOST toxic part about mercury is the vapors, far more than touching or ingesting it. Nice way to spread incorrect information about an incredibly toxic element.\nI\u2019m sure that the author, a recent college grad with an English degree (my own undergrad degree, so no snarkiness intended) was excited to write this article and that her intent to be environmentally conscious was pure\u2026however, anyone who reads this without a HUGE grain of salt is, well\u2026mad as a hatter.\nevilone\nposted on March 15th, 2011 at 11:03 pm\nI have tried several times to use the energy saving bulbs, no matter what wattage I get it doesn\u2019t seem bright enough to read.

Well, after spending $75 on new bulbs my electric bill was the same as it was before I installed them. I spent $75 for nothing. Also, I read on the package that the CFL\u2019s contain Mercury and Phosphorus and that they need to be disposed of correctly and not put in the trash. How many average people will actually take their used CFL\u2019s to a recycling center or store them until hazardous material collection days (which usually only occur once a year)? Not many will. They will end up in the trash and then off to the landfill they go. In the process they will be crushed in the garbage truck, contaminating everything around it, then it will be in the landfill where the mercury and phosphorus will eventually leach into the ground water. All that the Bush law did was create another environmental disaster in a failed attempt to conserve energy and lower pollution.

Typically the issues with CFL\u2019s and now LED\u2019s is there is so much misinformation released and many non traditional lighting companies rushing to market with inferior products. The majority of retail customers are more concerned with the low price rather than the quality of the item and I see this as LED\u2019s are released in box stores at prices lower than we can purchase ourselves. However I had the opportunity to listen to a CFL manufacturer and most of what is stated here is incorrect. Some products have been made for awhile and some are just coming out.\n1) Dimmable spirals and floods are now available down to 2% but it still looks as if some dimmers are issues(New dimmable product is now rated for even longer life)\n2) The starting temps have gone down for some CFL\u2019s\n3) The instant start issue is being overcome by offering a program instant start product that reaches 60% of initial lumens immediately and they are trying to increase that to more like 80% and some of it is being done by overdriving the wattage of the lamp initially but it doesn\u2019t affect the lamp life\n4) All colors and sizes are available\n5) The halogen replacements have been around for years from Sylvania and others but the manufacturers are trying to redefine the product and put some new twists on it\n6) LED is there for most applications like recessed cans for your house or track lighting(the general A-line lamps are close) but the price points typically are not\nFrom what I can tell TCP is only manufacturer out there taking this seriously.

Problem is gov\u2019t pushed CFL so hard here that your favourite restaurant, hotel, motel, pub, shopping centers, cafes, you name it are using VERY POWERFUL CLF\u2019s now. They are very bright, they only use the worst \u2018mortuary\u2019 white light (\u2018cold\u2019 light) here. So that means even if you still have old incandescents at home. You can\u2019t go out in any form of comfort. Essentially I am in a state of \u2018house arrest\u2019. I now take my old incandescents when travelling Australia locally because they have all changes to mostly: mortuary white CFL or fluorescent tubes mounted vertically on walls (in place of old light fixture) or unshielded tubes along the drapes or combinations of all these. And it causes social issues. Eg. I refuse to go to someones house that has CFLs because I don\u2019t like them. In shopping centers, the light is way to bright halogens or CFLs with no covers on them. You walk around with direct light towards your eyes.

As far as change, I dont mind change and living in a clean planet, as long as its reasonable. The light bulb ban is not only unreasonble but stupid. 1st off, there are many false promises about these so called \u201cenergy efficient bulbs\u201d Many cfls dont work in all fixtures of your home, they\u2019re potentially toxic, and in my opinion, the light quality looks like shit. And im sure that many ppl would agree with me on that one. Someone made an interesting comment about cfls not being warm which is the truth. i dont care how \u201cwarm\u201d of a color they THINK cfls are. cfls will never have the warm light visual that an incandescent has. anybody who thinks that there are cfls that have the same color as incandescents need to get their eyes checked out. if cfls were that superior, more people will purchase them, with out government having to tell us to buy them and u wouldnt see so many ppl stocking up on edison bulbs. The other issue with CFLs, besides their horrible light quality is that they dont work in all fixtures in your home. it cost quite a bundle to replace fixtures. many cfls dont even last 4 to 5 years and if they do, they get dimmer and dimmer with in time. So after the 4 to 5 year period, you\u2019re room ends up looking like the inside of a cave. i have incandescents that hasnt burnt out in years.

A new kid on the block \u2013 still in the same form factor \u2013 are LED lights, which are even more energy-efficient than CFLs. Until recently, however, there were no decent replacement options for standard fluorescent lighting. But now new products such as posilight and ReLED fill that gap in the market.\nWhy It\u2019s Clever\nIncandescent lamps have become almost obsolete and will be taken off the market in a few years in most parts of the world because new lighting regulations stipulate a higher efficiency than they can possibly offer.\nReplacement with LED lights is a good option, since these have become powerful enough to replace current light bulbs, have become dimmable too and use only a fraction of the energy of traditional lights. And it makes sense to replace (compact) fluorescent lamps with LEDs, because they offer a considerable increase in efficiency, hence saving energy. There are also situations where fluorescent lighting doesn\u2019t perform very well, for instance in cold environments. LED lighting wouldn\u2019t have a problem there.\nWhile LED light manufacturers have mainly focused on traditional bulbs so far, they are now bringing out solutions in a traditional fluorescent form factor as well. This means that you can easily replace your fluorescent lamp with an LED light in seconds without changing the fixture. I suppose that this will spell the end of those dreaded flickering fluorescent tubes as well.\nOne of the manufacturers is posilight, who seem to focus on applications in refrigerators, for instance in food stores. Besides operating better at low temperatures than fluorescent lights, another advantage of LED lights is that they generate less heat themselves, thereby reducing your cooling requirements: A win-win.\nThe posilight Legacy e exists in T12, T10 and T8 fluorescent form factors. The light is not directional, similar to a normal fluorescent tube, making it a perfect replacement.\nAnother brand is ReLED. The idea is similar, the main difference being that ReLED uses high-power directional LEDs in a fluorescent tube form factor. This means that the ReLED light, which is evenly spread in the case of a fluorescent tube, becomes more directional. The tube can rotate 180 degrees, enabling you to aim it at the spot where you want most light, but the effect might not be the same as with the fluorescent lamp that you want to replace.\nReLED offers two different color temperatures (neutral white and warm white) and has a driver circuit with the same form factor as a traditional ballast from a fluorescent lamp, allowing it to be fit to the existing fixture. It\u2019s available in standard T5, T8 and T12 sizes. Here\u2019s a drawing that explains how it can be retrofit . I suppose this is similar for the different products.\nSummary\nLED replacements for traditional fluorescent lamps\nT5, T8, T10, T12 sizes\nUp to 85% energy saving\nGives off less heat\n"}, {"score": 1600.8344, "uuid": "f5e3a1de-038f-5717-94a0-c7ee6beae03a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0408wb-99-28020", "target_hostname": "www.ewg.org", "target_uri": "http://www.ewg.org/reports/compact-fluorescent-light-bulbs", "page_rank": 1.2139285e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Lighten Up in &#x27;09: Shopper&#x27;s Guide to Compact <em>Fluorescent</em> <em>Light</em> <em>Bulbs</em> |", "snippet": "Compact <em>fluorescent</em> <em>light</em> (CFL) <em>bulbs</em> promise a win-win: according to the industry and U.S. government&#x27;s Energy Star program, <em>which</em> promotes CFL <em>bulbs</em> and other substitutes for energy-hogging <em>incandescents</em>, a CFL uses 75 percent less energy than its <em>incandescent</em> counterpart, lasts up to 10 times longer", "explanation": null, "document": "Mercury\nBy Sean Gray, Senior Analyst; Sonya Lunder, MPH EWG Senior Scientist; Elaine Shannon, Editor-in-Chief, December 2008\nResolving to save money? And the planet? Compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs promise a win-win: according to the industry and U.S. government's Energy Star program, which promotes CFL bulbs and other substitutes for energy-hogging incandescents, a CFL uses 75 percent less energy than its incandescent counterpart, lasts up to 10 times longer and prevents more than 450 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere.\nOver its lifetime, a single CFL can save the consumer $80 or more, depending on local electric rates.\nBut all CFL bulbs aren't equal. Some have lower mercury content than others, and some last much longer. Unfortunately, you can't tell the best of the best by their labels - or the U.S. government Energy Star logo. Some Energy Star labelled bulbs could not be legally sold in Europe due to excessive mercury content.\nAn Environmental Working Group investigation has identified 7 bulb lines made by Earthmate, Litetronics, Sylvania, Feit, MaxLite and Philips that trump the rest. These bulbs, listed in our Green Lighting Guide contain a fraction of the toxic mercury allowed by Energy Star, reducing the mercury contamination from a broken bulb. All last 8-15,000 hours, dramatically longer than the Energy Star standard of 6,000 hours, and also offer high efficiency.\nPresident Obama says his energy strategy and economic stimulus plan will focus on moving toward use of CFLs and other energy-efficient lighting sources. \"We can save huge amounts of energy costs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil by simple things like weatherization and changing the lighting in major buildings,\" Obama said on Meet the Press Dec. 6. \"That's going to be part of our economic recovery plan. It actually allows us to spend some money, put some people to work right away, but it also creates a long- term, sustainable energy future.\"\nCFL use in U.S. households has reached a new high: 1 bulb in 4 sold in the 3rd quarter of 2008 was a CFL.\nThe trend toward CFL use is welcome. But Energy Star and its parent agencies -- the Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-- have not adequately addressed the risks of mercury in CFL bulbs.\nLaunched in 1982 as an energy-efficiency rating system, Energy Star has driven development of energy-saving appliances and consumer products. But under the Bush administration, Energy Star drifted to the rear, becoming a passive partner of the electrical industry. EWG's best bulbs carry the Energy Star logo - but so do a lot of average and even sub-par bulbs. The program deploys a trailing-edge incentive structure that rewards stragglers as handsomely as innovators.\nThe Obama administration must reinvigorate Energy Star, using its marketing cachet and other incentives to push low-toxin energy efficiency in lighting. Stricter mercury standards for CFL bulbs could encourage wary consumers to buy more of them and speed the transition away from wasteful incandescent bulbs. EWG recommends:\nLowering the maximum mercury content in each CFL bulb to 3 miligrams (mg). This measure would save 225 pounds of mercury for every 100 million bulbs.\nCreating a tiered (\"Platinum,\" \"Gold,\" \"Silver\") rating system to reward creative companies that produce the highest efficiency, longest-lived bulbs with the lowest mercury content.\nUpdating minimum requirements every 2 years instead of every 5 years, to take advantage of rapidly changing technology and fierce competition among bulb makers vying for bigger shares of the green-products market.\nAdopt an independently verifiable mercury content limit for CFL bulbs. Energy Star requires only that the manufacturers file a statement about bulb mercury content with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.\nEnergy Star updates: Too little, too late\nEnergy Star's 2008 standards, unveiled last March as a replacement for 2003 specifications, proposed to ratchet up energy efficiency requirements, tighten other performance measures and, for the first time, set a cap on bulb mercury content.\nThe 2008 specs were scheduled to take effect December 2nd. But in mid-October, DOE officials made a concession to industry officials because of the souring economy: they postponed the 2008 standards for a 6-month \"grace period\" to July 1, 2009, so that the U.S. inventory of about 100 million bulbs fabricated under 2003 specs could be sold off. EWG research shows that 1 in 3 can't meet 2008 standards for efficiency and life span.\nEven when Energy Star's 2008 standards become effective next July, they will leave consumers in the dark about several key facts about CFL mercury content:\nProduct labels must disclose that the bulbs contain mercury -- but not how much. Consumers have a right to know exactly how much mercury is in various brands.\nEnergy Star's 5 mg mercury cap is twice as high as necessary. In March 2007, in an effort to blunt consumer concerns about mercury, a potent neurotoxin, members of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) issued a voluntary \"commitment\" to their customers to limit mercury content in most CFL bulbs to 5 mg. A year later, Energy Star adopted the 5 mg cap as its own. Meanwhile, however, manufacturers aware of consumer concerns were competing to lower bulb mercury content. EPA and NEMA estimate the industry-wide average is between 3 and 4 mg. EWG's best bulbs contain just 1 to 2.7 mg of mercury. The 5 mg cap is virtually obsolete now; putting it into effect next July is pointless.\nSome U.S. bulbs that proudly bear the Energy Star seal of approval can't be legally sold in Europe, where the European Union has capped mercury content at 4 mg per bulb for CFLs. Under the new Energy Star criteria, bulbs larger than 25 watts can contain up to 6 mg of mercury.\nEWG believes that CFL bulbs are a promising technology to reduce energy consumption and pollution associated with it. Mercury pollution from broken bulbs is offset, and more, by larger gains from energy conservation. Coal-fired electrical plants are a major source of mercury emissions, totaling 104 tons of mercury across the U.S. annually. Energy Star calculates that each CFL bulb generates 70 percent less mercury pollution than a comparable incandescent bulb.\nBut at present, only a handful of bulb makers offer truly superior products with high efficiency, longevity and mercury content of 1 to 2.7 mg -- about a quarter to a half of the Energy Star mercury cap.\nThe Obama Administration should award the Energy Star logo far more selectively, as a carrot to speed research and development on the next generation of CFLs and other alternatives to incandescent bulbs that, according to DOE, convert 90 percent of the energy they consume to heat.\nTake action\nWrite to Energy Star today and tell them that you want meaningful mercury requirements.\nRelated News:\n"}, {"score": 1597.0239, "uuid": "2c816ddf-d0fc-56a6-99e5-bf8f17d569e0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1711wb-54-07257", "target_hostname": "www.tmworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tmworld.com/blog/Taking_the_Measure/19711-Incandescents_fluorescents_LEDs_oh_my_.php", "page_rank": 1.1773135e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Incandescents</em>, <em>fluorescents</em>, LEDs, oh my!", "snippet": "That\u2019s how \u2018How the World Works\u2019 feels after striving to parse the implications of an article that adds new complexity to the ever popular debate over <em>which</em> <em>is</em> <em>better</em>: compact <em>fluorescent</em> <em>or</em> <em>incandescent</em> <em>light</em> <em>bulbs</em>.\u201d", "explanation": null, "document": "Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nMarch 24, 2008\nHave we entered the lighting-efficiency Twilight Zone? Andrew Leonard, in his \u201cHow the world works\u201d column for Salon, seems to think so: \u201cYou are traveling through another dimension\u2014a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. That\u2019s how \u2018 How the World Works\u2019 feels after striving to parse the implications of an article that adds new complexity to the ever popular debate over which is better: compact fluorescent or incandescent light bulbs.\u201d\nThe Twilight Zone , perhaps, or maybe the Land of Oz , with Dorothy chanting,\u201d Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my! \u201d and the wizard exhorting us, \" Bring me the filament of the Wicked Incandescent Bulb of the West \"\u2014such bulb having been invented, of course, in the western hemisphere. (In this formulation, the compact fluorescent, or perhaps the LED, is Glinda the Good Bulb of the North, I guess, but let\u2019s not push the allusions too far.)\nBefore getting to the article that seems to perplex Leonard of Salon, let\u2019s recap what\u2019s been happening in the RBI electronics blogosphere . Paul Rako at EDN in a green-baiting post called \u201c LED lighting\u2014yet more green BS \u201d takes issue with environmental claims for LEDs; Rako nominates the CFL for the Glinda role. Paul Scheidt, a product marketing manager from Cree Solid State Lighting, send a response, which Rako\u2019s posted in \u201c Cree on my LED lighting post .\u201d\nIn the article that Leonard in Salon comments on, Toronto Star columnist Tyler Hamilton questions the whole idea of the switch away from incandescent lighting. He asks, \u201c\u2026is it wise to outright ban the old Edison light bulb in Ontario? Across Canada? A year ago this writer would have had one answer: Definitely. But the answer, it turns out, shouldn\u2019t be so clear cut.\u201d Hamilton cites a paper titled \"To Switch or Not to Switch: A Critical Analysis of Canada\u2019s Ban on Incandescent Light Bulbs,\" by Michael Ivanco, a senior scientist at Atomic Energy of Canada, and professor Bryan Karney and graduate student Kevin Waher from the department of civil engineering at the University of Toronto.\nHamilton derives these suggestions from the paper: \u201cIf you live in Alberta, which relies heavily on fossil fuels for both its power generation and home heating, then switching to CFLs always makes sense\u2026. [But] In provinces such as Manitoba and Quebec, which rely primarily on emission-free electricity, you can come to the opposite conclusion. Using clean hydropower to light up an incandescent bulb and fill your home with residual heat during the winter will release fewer greenhouse gases than using a natural gas furnace to provide that same amount of heat.\u201d\nLeonard at Salon comes to this conclusion: \u201c\u2019To Switch or Not to Switch\u2019 does not appear to be available online, so it\u2019s hard to get a sense of how rigorous the argument is\u2026. And the calculus varies considerably if you move from the frozen tundra down to, say, California\u2019s Great Central Valley during the summertime. In that scenario, the heat from light bulbs only adds to the load of your air conditioner \u2014 no matter what is fueling the grid. In every scenario, a different solution. The 21st century could turn out to be hard for absolutists.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think so. If you live in a place with clean, cheap hydroelectricity, install electric heating. And even if you\u2019re stuck with a legacy fossil fuel heating system and can\u2019t afford to convert, you should know, as various commenters have pointed out, a light bulb is poor at distributing heat where you want it, so you\u2019re better off supplementing your fossil fuel system with an electric space heater.\nThis 21st century absolutist says, if energy savings (and not aesthetic considerations) is your main concern, install CFLs, whether you live in El Azizia or Quebec City. When the CFLs you install today burn out, take another look at LEDs.\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nSerilucia commented:\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nDarren Holdstock, UK commented:\nRed plus green plus blue does not equal white - try reading a resistor colour code under fluorescent or LED lighting.

Many, many rooms are lit entirely by table or floor lamps. Hotel and motel rooms being one example, my parents' living room being another. Many other people are strong on track lighting. Nice, diffuse radiation heating (heats the people, not just the air, you know!) When it comes to my own house, well, a watt that heats up the living space is a watt that heats up the living space. Now, if part of the heat goes somewhere else, or convects warm air into the attic, that's a different story. But, in my house, 1st floor incandescents' heat all ends up either on the 1st floor, or the 2nd floor. (100% efficiency.) The fixtures in the 2nd floor ceiling all get CFL's year-round (even if they don't hold up as well as advertised, they are still cost efficient, there.) I've even once taken a dead 4 ft. fluorescent fixture and turned it into a reflector for a string of long-life incandescents: Wonderful overhead light / heat lamp in the shop, in the winter. (Granted, to replace a bulb, I have to grab the soldering gun, but, what day do I not grab the soldering gun?) I guess I should make another: I have a whole stack of dead FL fixtures to work with. (This post was supposed to be 1st, but apparently did not go through the 1st time.)\nMarch 25, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nPaulR commented:\nIncidentally, correct about heat tape, but I use heat tape on \"remote\" pipes, a light bulb to help make sure the well pump and pressure tank don't freeze up if unused on a cold night.\nMarch 24, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\ndavid strong commented:\nIncandescent bulbs are not designed to deliver heat efficiently into living spaces. Although they are often used for that purpose, for example, to keep pipes from freezing, that's because of ease and availability, NOT efficiency. Heat tape would be a much more energy-efficient solution. Likewise, incandescent light in the ceiling (where much light is located) is a POOR substitute for electric baseboard heat with diffusing fins. Couple that with the transferrability of electric power, and the high efficiency of point-of-use gas residential gas furnaces, and the argument seems pretty far-fetched.\nMarch 24, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nPaulR commented:\nI'm a big fan of \"zonal\" heating, but, in the winter my house still needs some general heating, which is one reason why I switch to incandescents in many areas, in the winter. So far as I can tell, virtually none of the incandescent watts are \"wasted\". They are also much safer than electric space heaters (although I use those as well.) Additionally (I should really go back and check in on the Rako discussion) I still find modern FL fixtures and bulbs (including CFL's), which I use more than anything else, in general much less reliable and durable than claimed. That greatly raises costs, exacerbates disposal issues, and so on.\nMarch 24, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nDennis commented:\nHas anyone ever done a comparison of total cost of the various lighting options?

Since CFLs and LEDs use less energy for the same amount of light, it costs less than incandescent because less energy is used. No need to look further.\nMarch 24, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nMeredith Poor commented:\nHydropower is not emissions-free. Water impoundments are populated by bacteria that produce methane. This methane is released when the water undergoes a significant reduction in pressure, which occurs as the water is released from the impoundment. There are researchers trying to figure out how to capture the methane for productive use. This shouldn't take more than a few years, but as of right now hydropower contributes to greenhouse gases.\nMarch 24, 2008\nIn response to: Incandescents, fluorescents, LEDs, oh my!\nSemiman commented:\nLast time I checked, provinces such as Manitoba and Quebec, with their low production costs, and excess capacity sell as much of their electricity as they can. That would imply that every little bit that does not go to light up an incandescent light will be exported to somewhere that likely has a high reliance on fossil fuels and the like for electricity production. Hence that argument about where your electricity comes from pretty much goes out the windows.\n"}, {"score": 1596.3871, "uuid": "97e06b2a-2bbd-5a2f-86d2-503816f80f76", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0612wb-63-00959", "target_hostname": "www.wilk4.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wilk4.com/humor/humorc8.htm", "page_rank": 1.2743296e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Humor - Denominational <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> Jokes", "snippet": "You are invited to write a poem <em>or</em> compose a modern dance about your personal relationship to your <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> and present it next month at our annual <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> Sunday service, in <em>which</em> we will explore a number of <em>light</em> <em>bulb</em> traditions, including <em>incandescent</em>, <em>fluorescent</em>, three-way, long-lived, and", "explanation": null, "document": "Denominational Light Bulb Jokes\n(Take this with a smile, it's not meant to insult anyone.

One woman to replace the bulb while five men review church lighting policy.\nHow many United Church of Christ members does it take to change a light bulb?\nEleven. One to change the light bulb. And ten more to organize a covered dish supper that will follow the changing of the bulb service.\nHow many Lutherans does it take to change a light bulb?\nThere is some question here. But we have it on good authority that they have appointed a committee to study the issue and report back at their next meeting.\n-Or-\nWe read that we are to so fear and love God that we cannot by our own effort or understanding comprehend the replacement of an electromagnetic photon source. It is, rather by faith, NOT by our efforts (effected toward the failed worldly incandescence), that we truly see, and that our own works cannot fully justify us in the presence of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Of course, it is still dark.\n-Or-\nNone. Lutherans don't believe in change.\nHow many Amish does it take to change a light bulb?\nWhat's a light bulb?\nHow many Mormons does it take to change a light bulb?\nFive. One man to change bulb & four wives to tell him how to do it.\nHow many Presbyterians does it take to change a light bulb?\nNone.

After completion it takes 100 individuals to complain about the method of installation and another 177 to debate the ecological impact of using the light bulb at all.\nHow many United Methodists does it take to change a light bulb?\nWe choose not to make a statement either in favor of or against the need for a light bulb. However, if in your own journey, you have found that a light bulb works for you, that is fine. You are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance about your personal relationship to your light bulb and present it next month at our annual light bulb Sunday service, in which we will explore a number of light bulb traditions, including incandescent, fluorescent, three-way, long-lived, and tinted; all of which are equally valid paths to luminescence through Jesus Christ.\n-Or-\nUndetermined. Whether your light is bright, dull, or completely out, you are loved --you can be a light bulb, turnip bulb, or tulip bulb. Church wide lighting service is planned for Sunday. Bring bulb of your choice and a covered dish.\n"}, {"score": 1594.8724, "uuid": "9a250164-a6c1-559a-a226-c6c3c2c6fb1b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-52-27886", "target_hostname": "www.ideafinder.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/lightbulb.htm", "page_rank": 1.3345185e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> History - Invention of the <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em>", "snippet": "The <em>bulb</em> <em>is</em> the glass enclosure <em>which</em> keeps the filament in a vacuum <em>or</em> low-pressure noble gas, <em>or</em> a halogen gas in the case of quartz-halogen lamps in order to prevent oxidation of the filament at high temperatures.", "explanation": null, "document": "Joseph W.

The gas infrastructure was in place, franchises had been granted, and manufacturing facilities for both gas and equipment were in profitable operation. Perhaps as important, people had grown accustomed to the idea of lighting with gas.\nIncandescent lamps make light by using electricity to heat a thin strip of material (called a filament) until it gets hot enough to glow. Many inventors had tried to perfect incandescent lamps to \"sub-divide\" electric light or make it smaller and weaker than it was in the existing electric arc lamps, which were too bright to be used for small spaces such as the rooms of a house.\nEdison was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent electric lamp. Many inventors had tried and failed some were discouraged and went on to invent other devices. Among those inventors who made a step forward in understanding the eclectic light were\nSir Humphrey Davy,\nWarren De la Rue, James Bowman Lindsay,\nJames Prescott Joule,\nFrederick de Moleyns and Heinrich G\u00f6bel.\nBetween the years 1878 and 1892 the electric light industry was growing in terms of installed lights but shrinking in terms of company competition as both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse determined to control the industry and its advancement. They even formed the Board of Patent Control, a joint arrangement between General Electric and the Westinghouse Company to defend the patents of the two companies in litigation. This proved to be a wise decision as over 600 lawsuits for patent infringement were filed.\nThe easiest way to understand those turbulent times in the early lighting industry is to follow the company's involved. Of the hundreds of companies in the business, we only cover the major players. We show the flow of inventor's patents and inventor's companies and how the industry ended up monopolized by GE and Westinghouse. Company names listed in GREEN ultimately became part of General Electric. Company names listed in RED ultimately became part of Westinghouse.\nAmerican Electric Company.\nIn the late 1870's high school teachers Elihu Thomson and Edwin Houston began experimenting with and patenting improvements on existing arc lamp and dynamo designs. In 1880 after being approached by a group of businessmen from New Britain CT, They all agreed to the formation of a company that would engage in the commercial manufacture of lighting systems (both arc and incandescent) based on their own patents. This was the American Electric Company which existed until 1883 when it was reorganized and was renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\nBrush Electric Company\nIn 1880, Charles F. Brush forms the Brush Electric Company. That same year he installs the first complete eclectic arc-lighting system in Wabash, Indiana. Wabash was the first American city to be lit solely by electricity and to own its own municipal power plant (that small dynamo driven by a threshing machine engine). The installation in Cleveland the year before had been a demonstration, but Cleveland would soon begin lighting its streets with arc lamps as well. In 1876 Charles F. Brush invented a new type of simple, reliable, self-regulating arc lamp, as well as a new dynamo designed to power it. Earlier attempts at self regulation had often depended on complex clockwork mechanisms that, among other things, could not automatically re-strike an arc if there were an interruption in power. The simpler Brush design for a lamp/dynamo system made central station lighting a possibility for the first time.\u00a0 Joseph Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882. In 1889, Brush Electric Company merged into the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\nEdison Electric Light Company\nIn the period from 1878 to 1880 Edison and his associates worked on at least three thousand different theories to develop an efficient incandescent lamp.\nEdison\u0092s lamp would consist of a filament housed in a glass vacuum bulb. He had his own glass blowing shed where the fragile bulbs were carefully crafted for his experiments. Edison was trying to come up with a high resistance system that would require far less electrical power than was used for the arc lamps. This could eventually mean small electric lights suitable for home use.\nBy January 1879, at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had built his first high resistance, incandescent electric light. It worked by passing electricity through a thin platinum filament in the glass vacuum bulb, which delayed the filament from melting. Still, the lamp only burned for a few short hours. In order to improve the bulb, Edison needed all the persistence he had learned years before in his basement laboratory. He tested thousands and thousands of other materials to use for the filament. He even thought about using tungsten, which is the metal used for light bulb filaments now, but he couldn\u0092t work with it given the tools available at that time.\nHe tested the carbonized filaments of every plant imaginable, including bay wood, boxwood, hickory, cedar, flax, and bamboo. He even contacted biologists who sent him plant fibers from places in the tropics. Edison acknowledged that the work was tedious and very demanding, especially on his workers helping with the experiments. He always recognized the importance of hard work and determination. \"Before I got through,\" he recalled, \"I tested no fewer than 6,000 vegetable growths, and ransacked the world for the most suitable filament material.\"\nEdison decided to try a carbonized cotton thread filament. When voltage was applied to the completed bulb, it began to radiate a soft orange glow. Just about fifteen hours later, the filament finally burned out. Further experimentation produced filaments that could burn longer and longer with each test. By the end of 1880, he had produced a 16-watt bulb that could last for 1500 hours and he began to market his new invention.\nIn Britain, Swan took Edison to court for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan which was then incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd). Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.\nIn 1889 the Edison Electric Light Company merged with several other Edison companies to become the Edison General Electric Company. When the Edison General Electric Company merged with Thomson-Houston in 1892, a bitter struggle developed, Edison's name was dropped, and Edison himself had no more involvement with the newly formed General Eclectic Company beyond defending his patents.\nIn 1903 Willis Whitnew invented a filament that would not blacken the inside of a light bulb. It was a metal-coated carbon filament. In 1906, the General Electric Company was the first to patent a method of making tungsten filaments for use in incandescent light bulbs. The filaments were costly, but by 1910 William David Coolidge had invented an improved method of making tungsten filaments. The tungsten filament outlasted all other types of filaments and Coolidge made the costs practical.\nEdison & Swan United Electric Company\nIn Britain, Joseph Swan took Edison to court for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan). Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company.\nGeneral Electric Company\nIn 1892, a merger of Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric Company created General Electric Company. General Electric, GE is the only company listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Index today that was also included in the original index in 1896.\nSawyer & Man Electric Company\nWilliam Sawyer and Albon Man are issued Patent No, 205,144 on June 18, 1878 for Improvements in Electric Lamps. In 1884, Albon Man formed the Sawyer & Man Electric Co for the purpose of protecting the\u00a0 Sawyer-Man electric lamp patent. William Sawyer had died the previous year. In 1886, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company purchased the Sawyer & Man Electric Company and began making incandescent lamps under the Sawyer-Man patents.\nSwan Electric Light Company\nJoseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914) was a physicist and chemist born in Sunderland, England.\nSwan was the first to construct an electric light bulb, but he had trouble maintaining a vacuum in his bulb. In 1850 he began working on a light bulb using carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860 he was able to demonstrate a working device, and obtained a UK patent covering a partial vacuum, carbon filament incandescent lamp. However, the lack of good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient light.\nFifteen years later, in 1875, Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb and, with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonized thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. Swan received a British patent for his device in 1878\n.\nSwan had reported success to the Newcastle Chemical Society and at a lecture in Newcastle in February 1879 he demonstrated a working lamp. Starting that year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. In 1880, Swan gave the world's first large-scale public exhibition of electric lamps at Newcastle upon Tyne England. In 1881 he had started his own company, The Swan Electric Light Company, and started commercial production.\nSwan took Edison to court in Britain for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan). Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Also in 1882 Joseph Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company, a successful \"arc\" street light manufacture.\nThomson-Houston Electric Company\nIn the late 1870's high school teachers Elihu Thomson, a teacher of physics and chemistry, and Edwin Houston, a science teacher, began experimenting with and patenting improvements on existing arc lamp and dynamo designs. In 1880 after being approached by a group of businessmen from New Britain CT, Thomson & Houston agreed to the formation of a company that would engage in the commercial manufacture of lighting systems (both arc and incandescent) based on their own patents. This was the American Electric Company which existed until 1883 when it was reorganized and was renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. .\nThe company became quite successful and diversified into other electrical markets. In 1886 they purchased the Sawyer & Man Electric Co. and began making incandescent lamps under the Sawyer-Man patents. In 1889 in an attempt to avoid patent disputes over a double-carbon arc lamp design, Thomson-Houston negotiated the purchase of a controlling interest in the Brush company. The Swan Incandescent Light Company was part of the Brush plant so it was included in the takeover. In 1892 Thomson-Houston merged with the Edison companies to form the giant General Electric Company.\nUnited States Electric Lighting Company\nFounded in 1878 by the prolific inventor Hiram Maxim, the United States Electric Lighting soon established itself as Thomas Edison's chief rival in the field of incandescent lighting. The company made some of the earliest installations of this new technology using Maxim's patent on a carbon-filament lamp, which was similar to that invented by Edison in 1879. When Maxim left USEL in 1881 to pursue other lines of invention, the company purchased the Weston Electric Lighting Company in Newark, NJ, and the services of its founder Edward Weston. The inventor of a successful \"arc\" lighting system, Weston, as works manager and chief designer of USEL, developed a comprehensive arc and incandescent system which the USEL began to market in 1882. In January 1882, Lewis Latimer, an employee of USEL, received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons,\" an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments which yielded longer lasting bulbs than Edison's technique. In 1888, United States Electric Lighting Co. was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company.\nWestinghouse Electric Company\nIn 1886, George Westinghouse formed the Westinghouse Electric Company. The main function of the Electric & Manufacturing Company was to develop and produce \"apparatus for the generation, transmission and application of alternating current electricity.\" The company also produced electric railway motors, producing approximately 75,000 by 1905.\nWeston Electric Lighting Company\nFounded in New Jersey by Edward Weston in 1880, the company's innovations included the Weston standard cell, the first accurate portable voltmeters and ammeters, the first portable light meter, and many other electrical developments. In 1881, the United States Electric Lighting Company purchased the Weston Electric Lighting Company, and the services of its founder Edward Weston. The inventor of a successful \"arc\" lighting system, Weston, as works manager and chief designer of USEL, developed a comprehensive arc and incandescent system which the USEL began to market in 1882.\nWoodward and Evans Light\nOn July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed for the Woodward and Evans Light by a Toronto medical electrician named Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans, who was described in the patent as a \"Gentleman\" but in reality a hotel keeper. They built their lamp with a shaped rod of carbon held between electrodes in a glass globe filled with nitrogen. Woodward and Evans found it impossible to raise financial support for the development of their invention and in 1875 Woodward sold a share of their Canadian patent to Thomas Edison.\nThe Edison Vision\nThe economic effect of electric lighting went far beyond increasing the workday. Profits generated by the electric lamp, in effect, paid for a network of generators and wires. This infrastructure then became available for a whole new class of inventions: appliances and equipment that by the 1930s had transformed the home and the workplace.\nEdison didn't just invent a light bulb, either. He put together what he knew about electricity with what he knew about gas lights and invented a whole system of electric lighting. This meant light bulbs, electricity generators, wires to get the electricity from the power station to the homes, fixtures (lamps, sockets, switches) for the light bulbs, and more. It was like a big jigsaw puzzle--and Edison made up the pieces as well as fitted them together. He did it his way.\nTO LEARN MORE\n"}, {"score": 1594.3467, "uuid": "4570a804-1ebe-573d-9b69-33ede5611d06", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-23-09174", "target_hostname": "www.ideafinder.com", "target_uri": "https://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/lightbulb.htm", "page_rank": 1.2623358e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em> History - Invention of the <em>Light</em> <em>Bulb</em>", "snippet": "The <em>bulb</em> <em>is</em> the glass enclosure <em>which</em> keeps the filament in a vacuum <em>or</em> low-pressure noble gas, <em>or</em> a halogen gas in the case of quartz-halogen lamps in order to prevent oxidation of the filament at high temperatures.", "explanation": null, "document": "Joseph W.

In 1886, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company purchased the Sawyer & Man Electric Company and began making incandescent lamps under the Sawyer-Man patents.\nSwan Electric Light Company\nJoseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914) was a physicist and chemist born in Sunderland, England.\nSwan was the first to construct an electric light bulb, but he had trouble maintaining a vacuum in his bulb. In 1850 he began working on a light bulb using carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860 he was able to demonstrate a working device, and obtained a UK patent covering a partial vacuum, carbon filament incandescent lamp. However, the lack of good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient light.\nFifteen years later, in 1875, Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb and, with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonized thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. Swan received a British patent for his device in 1878\n.\nSwan had reported success to the Newcastle Chemical Society and at a lecture in Newcastle in February 1879 he demonstrated a working lamp. Starting that year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. In 1880, Swan gave the world's first large-scale public exhibition of electric lamps at Newcastle upon Tyne England. In 1881 he had started his own company, The Swan Electric Light Company, and started commercial production.\nSwan took Edison to court in Britain for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan). Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Also in 1882 Joseph Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company, a successful \"arc\" street light manufacture.\nThomson-Houston Electric Company\nIn the late 1870's high school teachers Elihu Thomson, a teacher of physics and chemistry, and Edwin Houston, a science teacher, began experimenting with and patenting improvements on existing arc lamp and dynamo designs. In 1880 after being approached by a group of businessmen from New Britain CT, Thomson & Houston agreed to the formation of a company that would engage in the commercial manufacture of lighting systems (both arc and incandescent) based on their own patents. This was the American Electric Company which existed until 1883 when it was reorganized and was renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. .\nThe company became quite successful and diversified into other electrical markets. In 1886 they purchased the Sawyer & Man Electric Co. and began making incandescent lamps under the Sawyer-Man patents. In 1889 in an attempt to avoid patent disputes over a double-carbon arc lamp design, Thomson-Houston negotiated the purchase of a controlling interest in the Brush company. The Swan Incandescent Light Company was part of the Brush plant so it was included in the takeover. In 1892 Thomson-Houston merged with the Edison companies to form the giant General Electric Company.\nUnited States Electric Lighting Company\nFounded in 1878 by the prolific inventor Hiram Maxim, the United States Electric Lighting soon established itself as Thomas Edison's chief rival in the field of incandescent lighting. The company made some of the earliest installations of this new technology using Maxim's patent on a carbon-filament lamp, which was similar to that invented by Edison in 1879. When Maxim left USEL in 1881 to pursue other lines of invention, the company purchased the Weston Electric Lighting Company in Newark, NJ, and the services of its founder Edward Weston. The inventor of a successful \"arc\" lighting system, Weston, as works manager and chief designer of USEL, developed a comprehensive arc and incandescent system which the USEL began to market in 1882. In January 1882, Lewis Latimer, an employee of USEL, received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons,\" an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments which yielded longer lasting bulbs than Edison's technique. In 1888, United States Electric Lighting Co. was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company.\nWestinghouse Electric Company\nIn 1886, George Westinghouse formed the Westinghouse Electric Company. The main function of the Electric & Manufacturing Company was to develop and produce \"apparatus for the generation, transmission and application of alternating current electricity.\" The company also produced electric railway motors, producing approximately 75,000 by 1905.\nWeston Electric Lighting Company\nFounded in New Jersey by Edward Weston in 1880, the company's innovations included the Weston standard cell, the first accurate portable voltmeters and ammeters, the first portable light meter, and many other electrical developments.

The inventor of a successful \"arc\" lighting system, Weston, as works manager and chief designer of USEL, developed a comprehensive arc and incandescent system which the USEL began to market in 1882.\nWoodward and Evans Light\nOn July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed for the Woodward and Evans Light by a Toronto medical electrician named Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans, who was described in the patent as a \"Gentleman\" but in reality a hotel keeper. They built their lamp with a shaped rod of carbon held between electrodes in a glass globe filled with nitrogen. Woodward and Evans found it impossible to raise financial support for the development of their invention and in 1875 Woodward sold a share of their Canadian patent to Thomas Edison.\nThe Edison Vision\nThe economic effect of electric lighting went far beyond increasing the workday.

This infrastructure then became available for a whole new class of inventions: appliances and equipment that by the 1930s had transformed the home and the workplace.\nEdison didn't just invent a light bulb, either. He put together what he knew about electricity with what he knew about gas lights and invented a whole system of electric lighting. This meant light bulbs, electricity generators, wires to get the electricity from the power station to the homes, fixtures (lamps, sockets, switches) for the light bulbs, and more. It was like a big jigsaw puzzle--and Edison made up the pieces as well as fitted them together.

The gas infrastructure was in place, franchises had been granted, and manufacturing facilities for both gas and equipment were in profitable operation. Perhaps as important, people had grown accustomed to the idea of lighting with gas.\nIncandescent lamps make light by using electricity to heat a thin strip of material (called a filament) until it gets hot enough to glow. Many inventors had tried to perfect incandescent lamps to \"sub-divide\" electric light or make it smaller and weaker than it was in the existing electric arc lamps, which were too bright to be used for small spaces such as the rooms of a house.\nEdison was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent electric lamp. Many inventors had tried and failed some were discouraged and went on to invent other devices. Among those inventors who made a step forward in understanding the eclectic light were\nSir Humphrey Davy,\nWarren De la Rue, James Bowman Lindsay,\nJames Prescott Joule,\nFrederick de Moleyns and Heinrich G\u00f6bel.\nBetween the years 1878 and 1892 the electric light industry was growing in terms of installed lights but shrinking in terms of company competition as both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse determined to control the industry and its advancement. They even formed the Board of Patent Control, a joint arrangement between General Electric and the Westinghouse Company to defend the patents of the two companies in litigation. This proved to be a wise decision as over 600 lawsuits for patent infringement were filed.\nThe easiest way to understand those turbulent times in the early lighting industry is to follow the company's involved. Of the hundreds of companies in the business, we only cover the major players. We show the flow of inventor's patents and inventor's companies and how the industry ended up monopolized by GE and Westinghouse. Company names listed in GREEN ultimately became part of General Electric. Company names listed in RED ultimately became part of Westinghouse.\nAmerican Electric Company.\nIn the late 1870's high school teachers Elihu Thomson and Edwin Houston began experimenting with and patenting improvements on existing arc lamp and dynamo designs. In 1880 after being approached by a group of businessmen from New Britain CT, They all agreed to the formation of a company that would engage in the commercial manufacture of lighting systems (both arc and incandescent) based on their own patents. This was the American Electric Company which existed until 1883 when it was reorganized and was renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\nBrush Electric Company\nIn 1880, Charles F. Brush forms the Brush Electric Company. That same year he installs the first complete eclectic arc-lighting system in Wabash, Indiana. Wabash was the first American city to be lit solely by electricity and to own its own municipal power plant (that small dynamo driven by a threshing machine engine). The installation in Cleveland the year before had been a demonstration, but Cleveland would soon begin lighting its streets with arc lamps as well. In 1876 Charles F. Brush invented a new type of simple, reliable, self-regulating arc lamp, as well as a new dynamo designed to power it. Earlier attempts at self regulation had often depended on complex clockwork mechanisms that, among other things, could not automatically re-strike an arc if there were an interruption in power. The simpler Brush design for a lamp/dynamo system made central station lighting a possibility for the first time.\u00a0 Joseph Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882. In 1889, Brush Electric Company merged into the Thomson-Houston Electric Company.\nEdison Electric Light Company\nIn the period from 1878 to 1880 Edison and his associates worked on at least three thousand different theories to develop an efficient incandescent lamp.\nEdison\u0092s lamp would consist of a filament housed in a glass vacuum bulb. He had his own glass blowing shed where the fragile bulbs were carefully crafted for his experiments. Edison was trying to come up with a high resistance system that would require far less electrical power than was used for the arc lamps. This could eventually mean small electric lights suitable for home use.\nBy January 1879, at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had built his first high resistance, incandescent electric light. It worked by passing electricity through a thin platinum filament in the glass vacuum bulb, which delayed the filament from melting. Still, the lamp only burned for a few short hours. In order to improve the bulb, Edison needed all the persistence he had learned years before in his basement laboratory. He tested thousands and thousands of other materials to use for the filament. He even thought about using tungsten, which is the metal used for light bulb filaments now, but he couldn\u0092t work with it given the tools available at that time.\nHe tested the carbonized filaments of every plant imaginable, including bay wood, boxwood, hickory, cedar, flax, and bamboo. He even contacted biologists who sent him plant fibers from places in the tropics. Edison acknowledged that the work was tedious and very demanding, especially on his workers helping with the experiments. He always recognized the importance of hard work and determination. \"Before I got through,\" he recalled, \"I tested no fewer than 6,000 vegetable growths, and ransacked the world for the most suitable filament material.\"\nEdison decided to try a carbonized cotton thread filament. When voltage was applied to the completed bulb, it began to radiate a soft orange glow. Just about fifteen hours later, the filament finally burned out. Further experimentation produced filaments that could burn longer and longer with each test. By the end of 1880, he had produced a 16-watt bulb that could last for 1500 hours and he began to market his new invention.\nIn Britain, Swan took Edison to court for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan which was then incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd). Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his United States patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.\nIn 1889 the Edison Electric Light Company merged with several other Edison companies to become the Edison General Electric Company. When the Edison General Electric Company merged with Thomson-Houston in 1892, a bitter struggle developed, Edison's name was dropped, and Edison himself had no more involvement with the newly formed General Eclectic Company beyond defending his patents.\nIn 1903 Willis Whitnew invented a filament that would not blacken the inside of a light bulb. It was a metal-coated carbon filament. In 1906, the General Electric Company was the first to patent a method of making tungsten filaments for use in incandescent light bulbs. The filaments were costly, but by 1910 William David Coolidge had invented an improved method of making tungsten filaments. The tungsten filament outlasted all other types of filaments and Coolidge made the costs practical.\nEdison & Swan United Electric Company\nIn Britain, Joseph Swan took Edison to court for patent infringement. Edison lost and as part of the settlement, Edison was forced to take Swan in as a partner in his British electric works. The company was called the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan).
