In that debate I supported Digimon, which in my opinion is better than Nintendo's counterpart in terms of story and character development. Here, I will go with the Simpsons.\nSome said Digimon was a rip off of the other in the old thread. For this thread I say Family Guy is a horrible rip off of The Simpsons. I cannot watch the show for long, the characters never engaged me and the jokes were of bad taste. There is too much vulgarity in comparison to the Simpsons (which is undeniably vulgar).\nThe Simpsons in some episodes and even the motion picture have a moral about life. In contrast, Family Guy feeds off constant randomness and incoherence.\nAlso, The Simpsons came first and revolutionized television. That show I can watch for hours in a row. My favorite episodes are the Treehouse of Horror specials. I do admit it has been going on for so long the quality of the episodes has gone down, but at least not to the level of Family Guy.\nOn the other hand, Family Guy brought nothing new to TV, and was even cancelled three times (always returning to broadcast).\nLast edited by MrV; 08-21-11 at 03:07 AM.\nWhite Version FC:3439-6701-5608\n"}, {"score": 2085.3025, "uuid": "d0cff493-748f-5908-a91e-75c1a973f132", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1406wb-00-03295", "target_hostname": "www.writers-network.com", "target_uri": "http://www.writers-network.com/forum/music-movies-and-t-v/the-simpsons-vs-family-guy/", "page_rank": 1.2208259e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> vs <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>", "snippet": "<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> <em>is</em> pretty good too, but <em>Simpsons</em> wins by a mile. :grin: :grin: Hm, against <em>the</em> whim of <em>the</em> wind, I would have to say I prefer <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> over <em>the</em> <em>Simpsons</em>. <em>Family</em> <em>guy</em> <em>is</em> just more hilariously random, in my opinion.

This was used to cover the fact that O.J. Simpson was actually in prison following the O. J. Simpson Las Vegas robbery case, when this episode first aired. By the time OJ had been indicted for the robbery, the Family Guy writers had already poured a lot of time and money into the episode, and it was cheaper to put up this disclaimer rather than modify the entire episode.\nAfter a fiasco involving Stewie's attempting to fix their satellite TV and getting stuck on the roof while Peter was supposed to be watching him, Peter attempts to go fix it himself. While looking in a draw for his tools he comes across a winning 1989 raffle ticket he had forgotten to cash in, winning him a chance to play golf with O.J. Simpson; however, he had been unaware until now that Simpson was accused and acquitted of murder, and grows fearful. His friends suggest he spy on Simpson during the game and try to get him to confess the murder, hooking him to a wire. When his cover is blown, Simpson laments having lost a chance of escaping accusation. Feeling guilty, Peter decides that Simpson is innocent and befriends him.\nPeter brings Simpson home with him to meet the family, which is initially less tolerant of Simpson than is Peter, though they manage to live under one roof without any major conflicts (one close call involved Simpson accidentally dropping a tray of lasagna on the kitchen floor and Lois slipping on it, making it appear as if she had been stabbed to death). Word soon gets out of Simpson's presence in Quahog, so Peter decides to throw a house party to help everyone else get to know him better; instead they are met with an angry mob intent on driving Simpson out. Simpson makes a heartfelt speech saying that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, and the residents of Quahog apologize. Then, for no apparent reason, Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off, the mob giving chase; as the Griffins look on, Peter indifferently declares, \"I guess he did do it.\"\n"}, {"score": 1379.2458, "uuid": "72d3638d-5634-5417-95f3-1c1e1132f4ea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1515wb-59-20076", "target_hostname": "thatguywiththeglasses.com", "target_uri": "http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/bum-reviews/17494-family-guy-response", "page_rank": 1.1706492e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> Response", "snippet": "Not saying <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> (<em>or</em> American Dad....<em>which</em> <em>is</em> a....less defesnible story) <em>is</em> _completely_ innocent of this, but there are really only like 2 <em>or</em> 3 infractions that hold any water in <em>the</em> face of common sense.", "explanation": null, "document": "Saturday, 20 February 2010 21:11\n17494\n"}, {"score": 1378.896, "uuid": "e5f6a7da-b06d-5711-8472-e4cffbc94224", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1515wb-21-28217", "target_hostname": "watching-tv.ew.com", "target_uri": "http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/10/30/allen-gregory-the-simpsons-family-guy-halloween/comment-page-4/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "&#x27;Allen Gregory&#x27; &#x27;<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em>&#x27; &#x27;<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>&#x27;: Sunday cartoons | Ken Tucker&#x27;s", "snippet": "&#x27;Allen Gregory,&#x27; &#x27;<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em>&#x27; Treehouse of Horror, &#x27;<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>,&#x27; and &#x27;<em>The</em> Cleveland Show&#x27;: <em>Which</em> animation dominated your attention?", "explanation": null, "document": "tresorparis\nThu 11/24/11 7:32 PM\nYouareamazing!

And this week\u2019s episode was not as funny as fans had expected and it had trio crossover with American Dad and The Cleveland Show also. So read on to know each and every details of the episode.\nThere is not much action happening in this week\u2019s Family Guy Season 10 Episode 2 as mainly two storylines were focused. The episode was started off with a hurricane coming to Quahog and after preparing for it, Griffin family is trying to pass their time. But instead of passing time the situation turned into two not so entertaining situations.\nFirst we got to see in Family Guy Season 10 Episode 2 that Stewie and Brian have mushrooms for their entertainment. But Brian eats some of them taking him to a different world in his hallucination state. In this state he sees several monsters and bites his own ear but Stewie is there for his care. This part was not that interesting but I think it could be made much better.\nSecondly we got to see in Family Guy Season 10 Episode 2 that Meg finally stands for herself and makes his parents and brother realize that how they have been behaving with her since long. And her talks did have an effect on them making her parents cry. But that\u2019s not what we expect from Family Guy episodes so Meg goes to all of them and makes them feel okay and once again all of them are back to their normal selves.\n"}, {"score": 1282.3365, "uuid": "b36d6d1d-fa27-510f-b58e-f37c67becc60", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-57-08171", "target_hostname": "tellybrain.com", "target_uri": "http://tellybrain.com/2012/04/06/which-is-better-british-tv-or-american-tv-part-one-america/", "page_rank": 1.2633722e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Which</em> <em>is</em> <em>better</em>, British TV <em>or</em> American TV?", "snippet": "<em>Which</em> <em>is</em> <em>better</em>, British TV <em>or</em> American TV?

Morgan Spurlock (of Supersize Me fame) also launched his new show, New Britania,\u00a0on the channel, which as you may have guessed is an exploration of the cultural differences between Britain and The United States of\u00a0America. And this got us thinking\u2026\u00a0Often the question is asked \u201cWhich is better, British TV or American TV\u201d and it is an argument that\u00a0has never really been settled. Well, armed with passion,\u00a0arrogance, and\u00a0 brains full of\u00a0loosely formed argument, Jack, the\u00a0Tellybrain editor, and his mate David\u00a0(of Den of Geek )\u00a0hope to settle this once and for all. Flying the flag for Britain\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0will be Jack , but first here is David with his\u00a0pro-USA argument. Enjoy!\nWhy American TV is better than British TV by David Pallant\nFrom watching The West Wing I know that any important debate can be won in one of two ways. The first is the positive campaign strategy where you focus on the issues at hand, and demonstrate the excellence of your point of view. Then there is the negative campaign. This debate strategy is based on the mantra \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how bad you think we are; the other side is worse.\u201d\nThe opinions I am going to express will be from the latter category, not because I don\u2019t have confidence that American TV is better than British TV, but because I reckon it will infuriate Jack! I\u2019m going to try and guess what he thinks the best things about British TV, and then explain why America still do it better.\nI should add, as a disclaimer, I do not dislike British TV. There are some very fine examples out there of great British TV. However, I believe that for every one example of great British TV there are three examples of equally great American TV.\nJack would say that British TV is filled with talent\u2026\nHe would be right. When you see Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry and Ricky Gervais light up the little box in the corner of the room you know that the tiny island in the Atlantic is doing something right. Heck, when Monty Python went transatlantic decades ago, American TV was rife with cheaply-put-together imitations.\nBut right across the American TV networks at the moment you have over a dozen Oscar-winners working in-front and behind the camera. At this point the argument that British TV has talent becomes a little bit conceited. Martin Scorsese, Dustin Hoffman and Anna Paquin are just three I could name. The BAFTAs versus Oscars debate will rage eternal but it cannot be denied that when you line up the talent of the UK against the talent of the US it looks like Rotherham United\u00a0versus Manchester United.\nJack would try and point out that British TV makes stories that are relevant to us\u2026\nAgain, to some extent Jack would be right. Currently Titanic is beached on our TV screens receiving some praise ( though not on this site! ) and spinning a story that is relevant because of the ship\u2019s centenary. Then you can look at shows like Hollyoaks and Casualty \u2013 the latter Jack worked on \u2013 that weave plotlines which are accurate commentaries on the UK\u2019s social and economic climate.\nAcross the Atlantic, American TV also has socially-relevant programming. But they don\u2019t work as well even in the USA; this is mainly because America is nearly twenty-times the size of Britain (give or take). What may make sense to a New Yorker could completely baffle a Californian.\nInstead, America specialises in churning out (and in this scenario, the word is not meant negatively) dozens of viewer-friendly TV shows each month. Each one may sit nicely into a niche or genre, but they are designed and written to be accessible by every American. As a result they are accessible for us Brits too.\nAnd when Jack says Doctor Who, I would answer Buffy, Lost and Fringe (Like I said it is a 1:3 ratio).\nFinally Jack might try and land the knockout punch by talking about the unique brilliance of British comedy\u2026\nHe would be absolutely correct. British comedy, when done well, is a feast for the ears, eyes and funny bone. However, the eagle-eyed readers may have noticed the clause in that previous sentence: when done well. We can all remember a side-splitting gag from BlackAdder, The Office or Only Fools and Horses. In fact, there are many creative minds out there that when you see them attached to a production you know it will be a guaranteed laughter-fest (I\u2019m looking at you Steven Moffat). But how many comedies have fallen down at the first-series hurdle? Do The Royal Bodyguard, According to Bex and Sir Yellow sound familiar?\nThen we look at the massive writer\u2019s rooms of American Sitcoms. Britain has writing teams ranging from one all the way up to three or four. Any more than that and individual talent is stifled. That might be a fair point. But isn\u2019t the bigger picture more important (or as Spock would say, \u201cthe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u201d \u2013 Star Trek, another American show) because as individuality dies, doesn\u2019t the fruit of collaboration grows? Just think of Frasier, the most decorated sitcom ever. The more people involved, the more a comedy moment can potentially grow. That only benefits one person, you the viewer.\nAmerican TV is better. You can\u2019t disagree with Jack\u2019s logic.\nOn a side note, it should be acknowledged that this article has not made reference to Friends, Family Guy, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Angels of New York, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Will and Grace, Saved By The Bell, How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, The X Files, Gilmore Girls, 24, 30 Rock, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Dallas, Dukes of Hazard or Futurama, The OC, The Vampire Diaries, Battlestar Galactica, Cheers, Happy Days House M.D and Doogie Howser M.D. even once.\nDavid Pallant loves film and TV\u00a0almost as much as his pet tortoise, Monty.

These are listed below whenever an exceptional mention <em>is</em> made, such as an individual article, <em>or</em> particularly when <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> are on <em>the</em> cover and&#x2F;<em>or</em> are a cover story.", "explanation": null, "document": "Introduction and Background\nFirst and foremost, let me explain what this isn't. It isn't just a bibliography that just lists articles that reference The Simpsons; wherever we can and wherever it's worth doing we quote from each article. Moreover, over 200 full articles have been transcribed; small ones are included right in the bibliography, and larger ones we link to. We're also adding new ones every day, including older ones that were never transcribed and newer ones as they are printed.\nThis list was originally \"Chapter 5 - Hot Off the Press\" of \"The Simpsons Tome\", a work previously distributed in hard copy and on floppies. Since some of the other chapters largely duplicated the superior efforts of others I am working to incorporate additional information I have into lists maintained by others and releasing other chapters as separate lists. This work was started in December of 1989, two weeks before the first episode, when I first heard The Simpsons were going to get their own show.\nAs a Simpsons fanatic I could never get enough of The Simpsons. To satiate my Simpsons hunger therefore I turned to magazines and newspapers. With so few episodes broadcast the first season I then turned to merchandise once that appeared, and I started to index that too.\nSince The Simpsons name sells all newspaper and magazine publishers have wanted at various times to cash in on them. Therefore I frequently found (and continue to find) The Simpsons on the cover of magazines, even when little or nothing inside was relative to The Simpsons. In this list I document all the covers and articles on The Simpsons or on Matt Groening, all the comics and political cartoons about The Simpsons, and all other major external references to The Simpsons not detailed on lists maintained by others. Note that covers are included both in the main body of this document with all the articles and in a separate covers list at the end.\nIn this bibliography I'm attempting to document every cover and every article about The Simpsons and Matt Groening. I've also included articles by Matt Groening himself, regardless of subject. A far more difficult and impossible task would be to attempt to document every REFERENCE to The Simpsons (not that it stops us from trying). When The Simpsons were the \"latest craze\" practically every single newspaper and magazine writer made at least a passing reference. For example, in a Crain's New York (a business publication) article about Bank Of New York it mentions that today's customers are more likely to be like Bart Simpson. In William Safire's On Language column in the November 25, 1990 issue of The New York Times Magazine he references another article in the Detroit Free Press about 'attitude', indicating that \"Bart Simpson has too much\". A passing reference to Bart is made by Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame) in an article written for the New York Times (also Nov 25 1990). Some references to The Simpsons are not indexed if they're truly irrelevant.\nNote that the magazine 'Simpsons Illustrated' is here! and all Simpsons comics are documented elsewhere on the archive right here! Books on The Simpsons are also documented elsewhere on the archive, right here! Books that reference The Simpsons are listed herein.\nI also limit this listing to printed material and television shows that reference The Simpsons; it does not include Simpson music videos (listed with the regular episodes), Simpsons albums and videos, which are listed here! and games, which are listed here!\nIt is not our objective to document Futurama articles here, but we've never yet seen a Futurama article that didn't reference The Simpsons. Likewise, we've never seen a Futurama article that didn't reference Matt Groening, so yes, every Futurama article we've found is also invariably documented here. While we were at it we went ahead and documented Futurama covers in a separate list. First Futurama references appear in 1998, and you naturally see a great number of Futurama covers and articles in 1999, the year Futurama debuted.\nTwo publications stand out as having had extremely frequent references to The Simpsons. The first and obvious one is TV Guide. TV Guide, of course, references The Simpsons every week in the listings. In the index below I include mentions beyond the standard listings, i.e., articles, mentions in articles, recommended viewing, and yes, even advertisements. In TV Guide we even index the crossword puzzle questions, and answers, although the questions are so simple they insult the intelligence of any fan.\nEntertainment Weekly, particularly for the first two seasons, also referenced The Simpsons in every issue. Entertainment Weekly also gives ratings, and frequently recommended The Simpsons every week as a show to watch. Simpsons was listed as the #1 show for the weeks of June 29, 1990, July 6, 1990 and Oct. 26, 1990, for example. Entertainment Weekly also listed the Billboard charts, with Simpsons Sing the Blues on the charts over a dozen weeks across January - March of 1991. The Simpsons Do The Bartman was also the number one video in the country on the MTV video charts; at the end of March, Deep, Deep Trouble won second place in a weekend video marathon call-in vote, also on MTV.\nIn light of the frequent mentions, I first list all \"TV Guide\" references (that's the U.S. publication; TV Guide Canada shares it's name and not much else, and is a separate publication), then all Entertainment Weekly references followed by all other publications in date order.\nThere are also many references to specific Simpsons merchandise that are not entirely listed below. Specifically, both Advance Comics magazine and Previews magazine give advance notice of every comic and include references to videos, trading cards and other merchandise. The various video game / computer games magazines often reference the Simpsons' games. These are listed below whenever an exceptional mention is made, such as an individual article, or particularly when The Simpsons are on the cover and/or are a cover story. This is somewhat subjective, so I always err on the side of inclusion; if you know of something not indexed below, don't assume I decided not to include it; please advise!\nNote that most of what appears below CANNOT be found in the 'Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature'. I spend a lot of time scanning newsstands and have always kept an eye out for Simpsons references. I checked various types of online magazine cross-references but nonetheless I found so many by pure chance that I wonder what I may have missed.\nSince fellow workers, friends and family also know of my Simpsons searches I was often contacted with leads in the direction of certain publications and pointers to new merchandise (fellow workers had a hint by way of the six-foot Bart Simpson in my office..). I am forever indebted to them.\nThere were also a number of amateur X-Rated drawings distributed by photocopy which are not listed anywhere at this point. Not because of their lewdness, but due to the general stupidity and lack of humour. Not that I still don't collect them, of course.\nSome of the strict bibliographical formats don't work particularly well, and almost assume everything is part of a formal article. With TV Guide in particular we almost ignore the traditional format in favour of one that allows for a better arrangement of the information. Note that all the information from a strict bibliographical format is nonetheless included. When quoting material I correct obvious typos from the original but otherwise leave unaltered any non-standard spelling, grammar, etc.\nOver the course of the past twenty years I've slowly expanded what I supply for each entry so some are missing details that you'll find in later entries. Better articles are now always fully transcribed if relevant or quoted at length so we're going back and transcribing them. Feel free to email me for any special requests!\nWe continue to add in foreign publications with each update, and we're sure missing a lot of good entries. We're assuming we'll reach the point of getting to a detailed index of publications in each country which we'll use to expand the number of foreign publicatons that are included.

These are listed below whenever an exceptional mention <em>is</em> made, such as an individual article, <em>or</em> particularly when <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> are on <em>the</em> cover and&#x2F;<em>or</em> are a cover story.", "explanation": null, "document": "Introduction and Background\nFirst and foremost, let me explain what this isn't. It isn't just a bibliography that just lists articles that reference The Simpsons; wherever we can and wherever it's worth doing we quote from each article. Moreover, over 200 full articles have been transcribed; small ones are included right in the bibliography, and larger ones we link to. We're also adding new ones every day, including older ones that were never transcribed and newer ones as they are printed.\nThis list was originally \"Chapter 5 - Hot Off the Press\" of \"The Simpsons Tome\", a work previously distributed in hard copy and on floppies. Since some of the other chapters largely duplicated the superior efforts of others I am working to incorporate additional information I have into lists maintained by others and releasing other chapters as separate lists. This work was started in December of 1989, two weeks before the first episode, when I first heard The Simpsons were going to get their own show.\nAs a Simpsons fanatic I could never get enough of The Simpsons. To satiate my Simpsons hunger therefore I turned to magazines and newspapers. With so few episodes broadcast the first season I then turned to merchandise once that appeared, and I started to index that too.\nSince The Simpsons name sells all newspaper and magazine publishers have wanted at various times to cash in on them. Therefore I frequently found (and continue to find) The Simpsons on the cover of magazines, even when little or nothing inside was relative to The Simpsons. In this list I document all the covers and articles on The Simpsons or on Matt Groening, all the comics and political cartoons about The Simpsons, and all other major external references to The Simpsons not detailed on lists maintained by others. Note that covers are included both in the main body of this document with all the articles and in a separate covers list at the end.\nIn this bibliography I'm attempting to document every cover and every article about The Simpsons and Matt Groening. I've also included articles by Matt Groening himself, regardless of subject. A far more difficult and impossible task would be to attempt to document every REFERENCE to The Simpsons (not that it stops us from trying). When The Simpsons were the \"latest craze\" practically every single newspaper and magazine writer made at least a passing reference. For example, in a Crain's New York (a business publication) article about Bank Of New York it mentions that today's customers are more likely to be like Bart Simpson. In William Safire's On Language column in the November 25, 1990 issue of The New York Times Magazine he references another article in the Detroit Free Press about 'attitude', indicating that \"Bart Simpson has too much\". A passing reference to Bart is made by Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame) in an article written for the New York Times (also Nov 25 1990). Some references to The Simpsons are not indexed if they're truly irrelevant.\nNote that the magazine 'Simpsons Illustrated' is here! and all Simpsons comics are documented elsewhere on the archive right here! Books on The Simpsons are also documented elsewhere on the archive, right here! Books that reference The Simpsons are listed herein.\nI also limit this listing to printed material and television shows that reference The Simpsons; it does not include Simpson music videos (listed with the regular episodes), Simpsons albums and videos, which are listed here! and games, which are listed here!\nIt is not our objective to document Futurama articles here, but we've never yet seen a Futurama article that didn't reference The Simpsons. Likewise, we've never seen a Futurama article that didn't reference Matt Groening, so yes, every Futurama article we've found is also invariably documented here. While we were at it we went ahead and documented Futurama covers in a separate list. First Futurama references appear in 1998, and you naturally see a great number of Futurama covers and articles in 1999, the year Futurama debuted.\nTwo publications stand out as having had extremely frequent references to The Simpsons. The first and obvious one is TV Guide. TV Guide, of course, references The Simpsons every week in the listings. In the index below I include mentions beyond the standard listings, i.e., articles, mentions in articles, recommended viewing, and yes, even advertisements. In TV Guide we even index the crossword puzzle questions, and answers, although the questions are so simple they insult the intelligence of any fan.\nEntertainment Weekly, particularly for the first two seasons, also referenced The Simpsons in every issue. Entertainment Weekly also gives ratings, and frequently recommended The Simpsons every week as a show to watch. Simpsons was listed as the #1 show for the weeks of June 29, 1990, July 6, 1990 and Oct. 26, 1990, for example. Entertainment Weekly also listed the Billboard charts, with Simpsons Sing the Blues on the charts over a dozen weeks across January - March of 1991. The Simpsons Do The Bartman was also the number one video in the country on the MTV video charts; at the end of March, Deep, Deep Trouble won second place in a weekend video marathon call-in vote, also on MTV.\nIn light of the frequent mentions, I first list all \"TV Guide\" references (that's the U.S. publication; TV Guide Canada shares it's name and not much else, and is a separate publication), then all Entertainment Weekly references followed by all other publications in date order.\nThere are also many references to specific Simpsons merchandise that are not entirely listed below. Specifically, both Advance Comics magazine and Previews magazine give advance notice of every comic and include references to videos, trading cards and other merchandise. The various video game / computer games magazines often reference the Simpsons' games. These are listed below whenever an exceptional mention is made, such as an individual article, or particularly when The Simpsons are on the cover and/or are a cover story. This is somewhat subjective, so I always err on the side of inclusion; if you know of something not indexed below, don't assume I decided not to include it; please advise!\nNote that most of what appears below CANNOT be found in the 'Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature'. I spend a lot of time scanning newsstands and have always kept an eye out for Simpsons references. I checked various types of online magazine cross-references but nonetheless I found so many by pure chance that I wonder what I may have missed.\nSince fellow workers, friends and family also know of my Simpsons searches I was often contacted with leads in the direction of certain publications and pointers to new merchandise (fellow workers had a hint by way of the six-foot Bart Simpson in my office..). I am forever indebted to them.\nThere were also a number of amateur X-Rated drawings distributed by photocopy which are not listed anywhere at this point. Not because of their lewdness, but due to the general stupidity and lack of humour. Not that I still don't collect them, of course.\nSome of the strict bibliographical formats don't work particularly well, and almost assume everything is part of a formal article. With TV Guide in particular we almost ignore the traditional format in favour of one that allows for a better arrangement of the information. Note that all the information from a strict bibliographical format is nonetheless included. When quoting material I correct obvious typos from the original but otherwise leave unaltered any non-standard spelling, grammar, etc.\nOver the course of the past twenty years I've slowly expanded what I supply for each entry so some are missing details that you'll find in later entries. Better articles are now always fully transcribed if relevant or quoted at length so we're going back and transcribing them. Feel free to email me for any special requests!\nWe continue to add in foreign publications with each update, and we're sure missing a lot of good entries. We're assuming we'll reach the point of getting to a detailed index of publications in each country which we'll use to expand the number of foreign publicatons that are included. We currently include some British, Canadian, Australian, French, Italian, Dutch and Brazilian publications. Early foreign covers we've seen referenced which we need information on include;\nAvez-Vous La Simpsonite?

You need JavaScript enabled to view it\nOne of my college classes, Writing about Film and Television, requested, on Monday, that each student write a meditation on television and the experience which occurs while doing so. I never really watch much television anymore. I limit myself to watching the news at lunchtime and my weekly ritual of the next episode of \" 24 \". However, this previous weekend I had to venture from my dorm in Milwaukee back to home in good old Port Washington, Wisconsin, the home of \"Step by Step\". Unlike \"Step by Step\"\u2019s portrayal of Port Washington, there isn\u2019t much to do. I spent my Easter weekend by sitting through all twenty-eight episodes of Fox\u2019s recently cancelled animated sitcom \"Family Guy\" and it was one of the best television experiences I\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\"Family Guy\" revolves around the Griffin family. Peter Griffin (creator Seth MacFarlane) is the overweight moron, and Homer variation, who serves as the head of the house. His wife, Lois (Alex Borstein), seems to be the back bone and mediator of the group. The rest of the family consists of the couple\u2019s children and their intellectual dog. Chris (Seth Green), seems to be a fourteen year old version of Peter, overweight and stupid while insecure Meg (Mila Kunis) seems to be the product of her mother. However, their toddler, Stewie, and dog, Bryan (MacFarlane, who won an Emmy for his portrayal of Stewie, in both roles), seem to escape the stock characterization of Meg and Chris. Stewie and Bryan are, ironically enough, the most intellectual out of all the family members. While Stewie uses his intelligence manically to either take over the world or kill his mother, Bryan drowns his in books and martinis.\nThe plot of the show races through a variety of incidents. From the first episode, in which the family becomes the recipient of a erroneous welfare check, through the Griffin\u2019s family experiences following Y2K, to Peter coaching a young golf prodigy with attention deficit disorder. However, plots aside, MacFarlane and his staff of writers seem to find other points within each episode to provide a hysterical joke. For example, during his house arrest, Peter gets television shows all confused and conjures up one entitled \"Homicide: Life on Sesame Street\" which depicts Burt and Ernie as gay lovers.\nI laughed out loud during every episode. I only found one to be below par, \"Holy Crap\", the second episode of the second season. Granted, some episodes are better than others. Overall, however, \"Family Guy\" proves to be one of the funniest animated shows to ever hit airwaves. It does lose its satiric approach by taking a heavy handed approach to its crude humor like \"South Park\" does but nor does it retreat into the ranks of dryer satire like \"The Daily Show\".\n\"Family Guy\" has been inappropriately branded a cross between \"The Simpsons\" and the animated dick and fart joke of \"South Park\". While it features aspects of both shows, its satire is much closer to that of \"The Simpsons\". However, unlike \"The Simpsons\", the first season of \"Family Guy\" proved to be one of the best first seasons ever produced. Some have complained that \"Family Guy\" never evolved into anything like \"The Simpsons\" did. This is because \"The Simpsons\" was not the working formula it is today when it began. \"Family Guy\" does not commit the same error that \"The Simpsons\" does. I would agree that the show never evolves into anything, but it was only on for three seasons and contained roughly fifty episodes. It was never given the incubation time to evolve.\nThe video quality on this set proves to be slightly disappointing. The animation seems to shift and has an overall rigid look. The audio proved adequate and I have no complaints towards it. This volume of the show does not feature much in the way of extra material. Each disc, featuring seven episodes a piece, holds commentary tracks for two different episodes. The only other extra is a three minute fluff featurette on the making of the show. However, the show makes this set worth purchasing alone. I look forward to the third season, which hits the DVD format in fall, to cap off one of funniest television shows I\u2019ve ever seen.\nTweets\n"}, {"score": 1156.9739, "uuid": "1a150574-954c-59f0-b97a-efebce9c583b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-86-33901", "target_hostname": "www.hollywoodauditions.com", "target_uri": "http://www.hollywoodauditions.com/tv/the_simpsons.htm", "page_rank": 1.2331034e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "About <em>the</em> <em>simpsons</em> cartoon, tv shows, <em>the</em> <em>simpsons</em>!", "snippet": "In addition to <em>the</em> recent best-seller <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em>: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite <em>Family</em>, Groening&#x27;s books, based on &quot;Life in Hell&quot; and <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> include Love <em>Is</em> Hell, Work <em>is</em> Hell, School <em>is</em> Hell, <em>The</em> Big Book of Hell, Akbar &amp; Jeff&#x27;s Guide to Life, Love <em>is</em> Hell 10th Anniversary Edition, Binky&#x27;s", "explanation": null, "document": "tv shows > The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons\nCan life get any better for Homer J. Simpson? He juggles the roles of husband, father, safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, bowler, beer drinker, astronaut, small business owner and dreamer, and makes it all look easy. But it wasn't always so easy for Homer J. Raised by his father, Abe, who tried to compensate for the absence of Homer's radical hippie mother, Homer graduated at the bottom of his high school class and managed to earn the distinction of being the longest-term entry-level employee at the plant. Together with his high school sweetheart, Marge Bouvier, Homer settled down in Evergreen Terrace, the nicest upper-lower-middle class section of Springfield, to raise his three precious children. Homer is fond of Duff Beer, donuts, Marge's pork chops and watching the Bee Guy on the Spanish channel. His dislikes include his boss, Mr. Burns, yard work and his neighbor, Ned Flanders.\nBart Simpson is misunderstood. Wrongly pegged as an underachiever and troublemaker, Bart would like to remind the world of some of his decent qualities: He looks out for his sister, Lisa; he's befriended outcasts and misfits like Milhouse Van Houten and Ralph Wiggum; he's injected romance into the life of his teacher, Edna Krabappel; and he brought down an illegal French winery during his brief semester abroad. So what if he's also befouled the Springfield Community Church with phony hymns or prank-called Moe's Tavern several times a day for the last few years? It all balances out, right? At age 10, Bart has managed to live out a number of dreams: He has starred in his own short-lived TV series (with his idol, Krusty the Clown), spotted and named a deadly comet that nearly destroyed his town, and almost snagged the role of Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie. He couldn't have done any of those things without the help and support of his best friend, Santa's Little Helper.\nLisa Simpson can't wait for college. She's only 8 and already reads at a 14th grade level, and has written a number of application-quality essays, one of which won her family a free trip to Washington, D.C. Her favorite activities include playing her saxophone, attending school and reading Non-Threatening Boys Magazine. A fan of Malibu Stacy, Lisa tried unsuccessfully to create her own talking doll, Lisa Lionheart. Unfortunately, no one wanted to buy a talking doll that was as judgmental as Lisa. Lisa wants everyone to know that she is a vegetarian and that if she could have one thing (besides world peace), it would be a pony.\nMatt Groening changed television forever when he brought animation back to primetime with this immortal nuclear family. He is also creator and executive producer of the FOX animated series Futurama. Originally brought to life in 1987 for FOX's Emmy Award-winning series The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons was Groening's introduction into the animation world. Previously, he was best known for his \"Life in Hell\" cartoon strip, an irreverent portrayal of broken life that debuted in 1977 and currently appears in more than 250 newspapers worldwide. In 1993 he formed Bongo Comic Group, whereby he serves as publisher over the following: \"Simpsons Comics,\" Itchy & Scratchy Comics, Bartman, Radioactive Man, Lisa Comics and Krusty Comics. In 1995 he founded and published \"Zongo Comics,\" which included Jimbo and Fleener. In addition to producing his weekly strip, keeping on top of the ongoing production demands of the weekly television series, and meeting regularly with the Bongo team, Groening oversees all aspects of the licensing and merchandising of The Simpsons. In addition to the recent best-seller The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family, Groening's books, based on \"Life in Hell\" and The Simpsons include Love Is Hell, Work is Hell, School is Hell, The Big Book of Hell, Akbar & Jeff's Guide to Life, Love is Hell 10th Anniversary Edition, Binky's Guide to Love, The Simpsons Xmas Book, The Simpsons Rainy Day Fun Book, Making Faces With the Simpsons, Bart Simpson's Guide To Life, The Simpsons' Uncensored Family Album, Cartooning With The Simpsons, Simpsons Illustrated magazine, Simpson Comics & Stories comic book, Simpsons Comics Extravaganza, Simpsons Comics Spectacular, Bartman: The Best of The Best, and Simpsons Comics Simps-O-Rama.

However, a broader interpretation also includes Jews who originated from Turkey, Greece, Italy, England, the Ottoman Empire and other lands. The tradition today has come to include not only those with geographic ties, but also those with links to the fascinating culture. Many Jews know that Sephardim eat rice and beans on Pesach, and know of the unique torah trope of the tradition, but little else. However, many Jews, and even non-Jews are exposed to aspects of the Sephardic tradition and culture without even knowing it.\nEver since the late 1950's, America has been fascinated by pop culture. From Andy Warhol's eccentric artwork to Britney Spears, pop culture has reflected the times and ideas of generations past in a convenient, easy to understand fashion. Today, pop culture can be found in the form of the Internet, radio, movies, or television. While their methods are extremely efficient, only television is able to offer a visual as well as audio component that is free and easy to access. Often pop culture is criticized because it lacks intelligence and stereotypically portrays much of society, but this does not hold true for all facets of pop culture. For example, \"The Simpsons,\" the longest running primetime animated show, has often been praised for being one of the most intelligent and provocative television programs on the air. Although many discount \"The Simpsons,\" simply because it is a cartoon, this portion of the population is blinded to the high \"plane\" the show operates on. Aside to references to famous authors and philosophers like Marx, Kant, Twain, and Hemingway, \"The Simpsons\" also displays a knowledge of the Sephardic tradition that would make Rabbi Moses ben Maimon blush.\nThe creators of \"The Simpsons\" know that they have a powerful effect on their audience and have the opportunity to impart some wisdom onto their faithful cadre of fans. Much of this knowledge comes from the teachings of the Jewish faith. Long time writer Mike Reiss says, \"There have always been a lot of Jewish writers on 'The Simpsons\" (Pinsky 109). For example, self-proclaimed Sephardic Jew Hank Azaria not only writes for the show but also lends his voice to numerous characters such as Apu, Professor Frink, and Moe. Writers like Azaria have deftly incorporated Jewish wisdom into various episodes, much of which includes aspects of the Sephardic tradition.\nThe Simpson family, which the show places into various situations each episode has a broad range of personality traits in each of the characters. First off, there is the father Homer, who has a deep passion for life, as well as food. His judgment is often poor, but he usually means well, especially in regards to his family. His wife Marge has large blue hair, and holds the family together through her unending dedication to her job as a homemaker. They have three children: Bart is the young troublemaker who always causes a ruckus, while Lisa represents high intellectualism and morals, even though she is only eight years old. The baby Maggie never speaks, but observes all the ordeals the family goes through. The Simpsons live in Springfield, a diverse town that is the setting for the series. The use of the town and recurring characters in each episode creates a virtual community, with people of all races, classes, religions and traditions. However, this diverse setting often leads to culture wars and clashes between the townspeople.\nAll too often in world history, when nations experience internal strife, leaders are quick to blame a distinguishable group for the problems. The Spanish Inquisition was instituted to rid the country of individuals whom they believed to be causing Spain's rapid decline. In fact, Spain was losing many of its colonies throughout the world, achieving a smaller sphere of influence, and its source of wealth was drying up. The gold and silver they counted on from foreign lands ran out, and the country entered difficult economic times. \"The Jew became the scapegoat of all misfortune, economic or otherwise\" (Mowbray). The events of the inquisition forever changed the traditions and roles of Sephardic Jews. No longer was there a Golden Age, where Jewish thought and life flourished. Instead, Jews felt unwelcome and were persecuted because of their identity. The effects of Jews being used as scapegoats for societal problems can be seen today in the Sephardic tradition. Lessons from this can be learned, with the hope that something of this nature will not happen again.\nThe horror and shear unfairness of the expulsion of Jews from Spain was demonstrated in a 1996 episode of \"The Simpsons.\" The details of the show have a striking resemblance to the situation Jews encountered during the Spanish Inquisition. In the episode \"Much Apu About Nothing,\" citizens of Springfield are unhappy with the high rate of taxes, and the government leader, Mayor Quimby, blames the economic problem on illegal immigrants. This is a sharp parallel to the Inquisition, during which the government leaders, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, blamed the troubles of Spain, including economic problems, on the Jews. In the case of this \"Simpsons\" episode, while in fact immigrants had nothing to do with the tax increase, they were used as defenseless, powerless scapegoats, much like the Jews during the Inquisition.\nMany Jews in Spain found their lives became easier once they converted to Christianity. The term \"Crypto Jew\" refers to a person secretly remaining faithful to Judaism while outwardly practicing another religion. In addition to the \"marranos\" of Spain and Portugal, crypto Jews also existed in North Africa in the 12th century. While they were officially deemed \"New Christians\" and were supposed to be treated as equals, considerable legislation was taken against them in Spain, Portugal, and the colonies. In addition, the brunt of the Spanish Inquisition was aimed at them (Sephardim 1146). There were considerable amounts of social, political, and economic pressures placed on Jews in Spain to convert once the 14th century rolled around (Gitlitz 4). For example, in 1348, Castillian Jews were forbidden to lend money at interest (Gilitiz 6). And as early as the mid 13th century, Christians were allowed to enter temples and attempt to persuade Jews to convert as they were forced to sit and listen. In 1263, Saint Raymond of Penyafort and Nacmanides were forced to debate the reliability of the Talmud before a congregation in Barcelona (Gitlitz 4). Although no outcome was reached, a bad precedent had been set. In the 1370's, a revival of anti-Semitic literature took place in Spain and several prominent Jews converted, including Solomon Halevi, chief Rabbi of Burges, who took the name of Pablo de Santa Maria. Fueled by the inflammatory oratory of Archdeacon Martinez of Seville, who preached a holy war against the Jews, and called for the destruction of local synagogues, pogroms spread across Spain in June of 1391, followed by mass conversions. Haim Beinart said \"what started in Seville in 1391 was like a spark in a forest fire\" (425). Once lit, nobody could quell the anti-Semitism in Spain.\nIt was estimated that one third of the Jewish population of Spain was killed in the pogroms of 1391, and another third converted to Christianity (Beinart 425). Jews faced more and more hardships in Spain after this incident, culminating in the Edict of Expulsion of 1492, which forced Jews to either convert of leave the country. These extremely difficult circumstances forced a significant percentage of Jews to take on the Christian faith.\nConversos came in two categories: those who wished to mend into Christian society and erase their Jewish past and those who sought to preserve as much of their heritage with as few alterations as possible. This latter form is what is now almost romantically referred to as the crypto Jew. Some noteworthy changes include the shift from yeshiva education to being taught by one's family members, an obligation taken very seriously (Gitlitz 217).\nIf anyone truly understands the difficulties of living one way, and believing something completely different, it is \"Simpsons\" character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (voiced by Azaria). Apu was born in Ramatur, Pakistan and attended Calcutta Technical Institute (CalTech) where he graduated valedictorian of his class of seven million. After several years, he completed his Ph.D. thesis and then found work at Springfield's Kwik-E-Mart (a spoof of 7-11 convenience stores). Apu is a devout Hindu, but has been forced to hide his religious identity in order to be accepted by his peers. He adorns a cowboy hat to cover up his traditional Indian locks and at times even tried to feign interest in baseball, America's national pastime. When Apu replaces his statue of the Hindu god Genisha with a stack on Entertainment Weekly magazines, Homer asks why Apu made the change, to which he responds \"Oh, who needs the infinite compassion of Genisha when I have Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me with their dead eyes!\" The obvious frustration felt by Apu here is typical of what many crypto Jews felt in Spain. Apu curses himself for letting down his family, \"I've betrayed my Indian heritage, sir. What would my parents say?\" This must have been a feeling that many crypto Jews were forced to get used to in order to remain in Spain.\nThe same can be said of the life of the character Waylon Smithers. Smithers is a closet homosexual, and is forced to forever hide this aspect of his life from his peers to gain their acceptance. He carries a picture of his boss Mr. Burns, with whom he is infatuated, in his wallet alongside his dog. He even has dreams of Mr. Burns flying into bed with him. Yet every opportunity he has to declare his true self, Smithers reluctantly holds back. In the episode entitled \"Bart's Inner Child,\" Smithers actually musters up the courage to tell Mr. Burns that he loves him at the first \"Do What You Feel Festival,\" but quickly covers his tracks by adding \"\u0085 in those colors!\" This idea of hiding one's true identity is very much related to the Sephardic crypto tradition, and brought up repeatedly in \"The Simpsons.\"\nAccording to David Gitlitz, in spite of the attempts of crypto Jews, most of these conversos had been completely assimilated by the end of the 17th century (Gitlitz x). Gitlitz say that the meager remnants that resurfaced in the 20th century are the exception to the rule. There is evidence to suggest that the writers portray the Simpson family as crypto Jews of the assimilated nature, so much so that they no longer know their true identity. Mark Pinsky, author of The Gospel According To The Simpsons , argues that \"The Simpsons from time to time suggest an underlying element of what might be called crypto-Judaism\" (121). For example, a menorah is found in the Simpsons' storage closet, with no explanation. Also, Homer's father Abe, is portrayed as the quintessential Jewish grandfather, always complaining and boring his family with stories of \"the old country.\"\nIn addition to crypto-Jewry, the Sephardic tradition is based heavily on enjoying life and taking care of oneself while doing so. For example, poems by Sephardic writers such as Moses ibn Ezra convey the importance of living life to its fullest. \"Immerse your heart in pleasure and in joy,\" he writes. Another poem by Rufina Bernardetti, a Sephardic-American, expresses the importance of living with a vivacious spirit in Sephardic culture. \"With the wholeness of spirit that is victorious we once more can share the essence and purity of life as Jews from Sepharad\". These writings begin to encompass what the Sephardic tradition means in today's world.\n\"The Simpsons\" demonstrate the concept of living life to its fullest routinely, especially through Homer's actions. While simply a working class family man, over the years Homer has managed to accomplish many things including winning a Grammy award, traveling to outer space, climbing the highest mountain in town, doing undercover work for the police, and meeting Presidents Ford, Carter, Bush, and Clinton. He has a sensational passion for life. \"I want it all! The terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles\" (Irwin 7). Homer's ambition and thirst for excitement allows him to live a fulfilling life, which other characters take pride in. His next-door neighbor, Ned Flanders, labels Homer as having an \"intoxicating lust for life\" (Irwin 20).\nWhile Homer does many life-rewarding things, he also does many things that go against the Sephardic tradition. All too often he contradicts the teachings of Maimonides and other Sephardic thinkers, which leads to visible negative effects. He has a hedonistic lifestyle, which is the flaw that prevents him from greatness. In the episode \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken,\" Homer's favorite baseball team wins the pennant, and he celebrates with heavy drinking, which leads him to destroy the local school. Homer enjoyed drink, as ibn Ezra's poem dictates, but he did so to the point of excess where Maimonides would not be pleased with his actions. \"Food should not be taken to repletion,\" he says (Minkin 382). Homer also eats to excess on many other occasions, which causes him physical harm, and creates problems for himself and his family. In order to qualify for disability and be able to work from home, Homer intentionally eats to gain weight His plan backfires, and he loses the respect of his family and friends when he does damage to his body. Other examples of Homer's hedonism are demonstrated by his eating to the point of sickness. After eating expired canned meat, Homer returns to the store to complain, where he is quick to accept ten pounds of moldy seafood as an apology, which only makes him sicker. In yet again another situation, Homer eats a steak so large that another person who he coerces into eating it with him has a heart attack. Obviously, Homer in this case did not follow Maimonides' instructions to eat one-third less than the quantity that would make one feel full (Minkin 382).\nMaimonides also incorporates his advice about other topics of health and hygiene into the Sephardic tradition. When giving the rules for proper rest and sleeping, he insists, \"one should not sleep during the day\" (Minkin 383). Meanwhile, Homer is routinely shown asleep on the job throughout the day. While this goes against what Maimonides taught, at the same time, these actions are fulfilling and gratifying to his lifestyle, which is encouraged by the tradition. Homer's characteristics and actions have been assimilated into American culture, while containing Sephardic themes and traditions, unbeknownst to many.\nGood health is a prerequisite for another important part of the Sephardic tradition: education. According to Maimonides, the highest goal that one can hope to attain is the perfection of the mind. As he noted in The Guide to the Perplexed, \"the true perfection of man [is] the possession of the highest intellectual faculties\" (Minkin 417). For Maimonides, the ultimate aim of education was to achieve knowledge of G-d through the Torah, but he and his Sephardic peers never underestimated the importance of learning in other areas. This stress on education of secular subjects as well as religious topics allowed the Sephardic Jews privileged enough to live in the Golden Age of Spain to contribute to a wide array of matters. According to Solomon David Sassoon, \"all fields of intellectual endeavor such as medicine, mathematics, philosophy, grammar, poetry, ethics Talmud and mysticism\u0085were widely deepened by the Jews of Spain\" (Sassoon 7).\nAspects of the Sephardic style of education can be seen clearly in \"The Simpsons\" upon careful inspection. According to Maimonides, every province is responsible for the education of its youth, and the penalty of neglecting this duty is excommunication (Minkin 286). This responsibility is undertaken by the people of Springfield in the episode titled \"The PTA Disbands\" (Richmond 172). When Principal Skinner is forced to cut back funding for school supplies and teachers' salaries, the teachers decide to call a strike. Instead of panicking and having children run wild through the streets, members of the community step forward and take the teachers' place until an agreement can be met. The eccentric Professor Frink (also voiced by Azaria) teaches his nursery school class the physics behind many of their beloved toys and Marge Simpson lectures to Bart's class on geography.\n\"The Simpsons\" often utilizes the technique known as irony to illustrate a particular message. In short, by showing one thing, the writers hope to preach the very opposite. This is the case with the teachers of Springfield Elementary School. They show the teachers in a certain light, and because the viewer ridicules this presentation, they tend to agree with the opposite. Maimonides preaches for teachers to have patience with their disciples, as he said \"If the teacher taught and his pupil did not understand he should not be angry with them or fall into a rage, but should repeat the lesson again and again till they have grasped the full meaning\" (Minkin 288). In \"Summer of 4 ft. 2,\" Mrs. Hoover, a second grade teacher, is speaking about the Abraham Lincoln assassination when she finds that she is under time pressure. When one of her students is perplexed about the situation and asks, \"Was president Lincoln ok?\" Hoover angrily and sarcastically remarks that President Lincoln was fine, in order to leave sooner. The writers behind \"The Simpsons\" are preaching that a certain degree of patience is necessary for a teacher to be effective, in agreement with Maimonides. Another example of this frustration expressed openly by faculty members of Springfield Elementary occurs when Principal Skinner blurts out \"You and I both know these children have no future!\" to a lunchroom filled with students (Richmond 172). Neither Maimonides nor any self-respecting Sephardic teacher would ever approve of such outrageous display.\nMaimonides also states that a pupil should have a great deal of respect for his teacher, as he wrote \"he is under obligation to honor and revere his teacher, even to a greater extent than to his father; for his father gave him life in this world, while his teacher who instructs wisdom, secures for him life in the world to come.\" (Minkin 289). Bart Simpson, who can be seen as the yetzer ha-ra personified, shows no respect for his teachers, and thus damages his ability to learn. In the episode entitled \"Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie,\" we learn that Bart once replaced his teacher's birth control pills with tic-tacs, and in \"Bart The Lover\" he forged love letters to her. Bart spends most of his time getting into mischief rather than studying. This could be perhaps traced back to his lack of respect for his teacher. Bart consistently gets bad grades, dreads school, and has no desire to learn. These are the dangers that Maimonides was warning about when the proper method of education is not implemented.\nA typical curriculum for a Jewish boy in 13th century Spain was divided into three sections, the first being bible and Talmud, the second being ethical and philosophical works, and the third being scientific studies such as logic, astronomy, physics and metaphysics and mathematics (Sassoon 8-9). These diverse topics of study helped Sephardic Jews grow up to be great thinkers. Unfortunately, the students at Springfield Elementary don't have the same luxuries. All of the writers on \"The Simpsons\" have gone to great undergraduate and graduate universities, over 21 of who hail from Harvard, and thus know the importance of a diverse education. This is displayed by showing the opposite of the ideal at Bart and Lisa's school. For example, they only books the school can afford are ones banned by other schools like, Tek War and The Satanic Verses. The fourth grade teacher Ms. Edna Krabappel and Principal Seymour Skinner also take little care in finding diverse material to teach their pupils. Instead, in \"Grade School Confidential,\" Skinner admits that he loves working at an elementary school because \"The children will believe anything you tell them.\"\nThe hope of the Sephardic community in providing a diverse education was to mold an adult who was adept at many things. The term often used today for such a person is \"Renaissance man,\" but aside from people like Leonardo da Vinci who had exceptional talents in a range of fields, many Sephardic Jews also fit this category. This Sephardic versatility is now indicative of the tradition. For example, many great Rabbis were also physicians, such as Maimonides, Nachmanides, and Rabbenu Nissim ben Reuben. Others were statesman-scholars, such as Isaac Abravanel, who was Ferdinand and Isabella's treasurer as well as the author of some very popular biblical commentary (Sassoon 23). In addition, many Sephardic poets were also well known in other spheres, such as Samuel ha-Nagid, who was a commander in the military, grand vizier to Grenada, grocery store owner, and halachist.\nThis Sephardic tradition is kept alive in Lisa Simpson, the brilliant and talented middle child of the Simpson family. Many of the members of the Springfield community have questionable morals and talents, but not Lisa. She is far and away the most respectable character. \"Lisa, is not only pro-intellectual, she is smart beyond her years. She is extremely intelligent and sophisticated, and is often seen out-thinking those around her.\" (Irwin 26). Aside, from her immense knowledge of history, mathematics, and the sciences, Lisa is also an accomplished musician. She plays the saxophone for her school band, and also plays the bass, bongo drums, didgeridoo and acoustic guitar. In addition, she is a skillful horse back rider and at one time took care of a pony of her own. Lisa is also politically active. In \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington,\" she exposes a corrupt congressman for taking bribes (Richmond 63). Lisa is a devoted feminist. In \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy,\" she creates a doll of her own for little girls to respect as opposed to the popular \"Barbie\" like Malibu Stacy, which is nothing more then a chauvinistic male stereotype. Finally, Lisa is a devoted sister and daughter who loves her family very much, and while she may be the classic \"overachiever,\" she nevertheless remains the model of Sephardic versatility.\nEven though many of the traditions of Sephardic culture were created generations ago, it still lives on today. The Sephardic tradition has come a long way from the days of the Inquisition, where people had to hide their roots, to today's modern culture, where it is ubiquitous. Nowadays, one of the country's most popular television shows overtly displays numerous facets of Sephardic culture. \"The Simpsons\" has an audience that ranges from young children to adults, and affects viewers on many levels. Countless viewers take what they see on the show and make it part of their lifestyle, which invigorates Sephardic thoughts and teachings into society. In this case, life is truly imitating art.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeinart, Haim. \"The Converso Community in 15th Century Spain.\" Barnett, Richard, ed.\nThe Sephardic Heritage.

[26] From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven . Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. [45] Repeat \"special guest\" cast members include Albert Brooks , Phil Hartman , Jon Lovitz , Joe Mantegna , and Kelsey Grammer . [46] Following Hartman's death in 1998, the characters he voiced were retired. [1]\nEpisodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \" Dancin' Homer \". [47] The Simpsons holds the world record for \"Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series\". [48]\nThe show has been dubbed into several other languages , including Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both French and Quebec French . [49] The Simpsons has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the life-long Simpsons fans in the area. [50]\nAnimation\nAnimation director David Silverman , who helped define the look of the show. [6]\nSeveral different U.S. and international studios animate The Simpsons. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo . [5] With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several international studios, located in South Korea. [5] These are AKOM , [51] Anivision , [52] Rough Draft Studios , [53] USAnimation , [54] and Toonzone Entertainment . [55] A subcontractor connection to the North Korean SEK studio has been suspected but not confirmed. [56] Artists at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draw storyboards , design new characters, backgrounds, props and draw character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens , ink and paint , and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later. [57]\nFor the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated The Simpsons in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films , switched domestic production to Film Roman , [58] who continue to animate the show as of 2010. In Season 14 , production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint . [59] The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \" Radioactive Man \" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the Season 12 episode \" Tennis the Menace \", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed \"Tennis the Menace\" was broadcast as made. [60]\nThe series began high-definition production in Season 20; the first episode, \" Take My Life, Please \", aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. [61] Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation. [62]\nCharacters\nMain article: List of characters in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.\nThe Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional \" Middle American \" town of Springfield. [63] Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie , the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier . The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper , and a cat, Snowball V , renamed Snowball II in \" I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot \". [64] Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. [65]\nThe show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV . [66]\nSetting\nMain articles: Springfield (The Simpsons) and List of locations in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons takes place in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state . The show is intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield's location. [67] Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. [68] Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland , Oregon , the city where he grew up. [69] The name \"Springfield\" is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. [70] Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best . He \"figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do.\" [71]\nThemes\nMain articles: Media in The Simpsons , Politics in The Simpsons , and Religion in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, [63] serving as a satirical parody of a working class American lifestyle. [72] However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. [73] Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School , the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels\u2014from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry. [74]\nSome commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. [75] Al Jean admitted in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" [76] The writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. [77] The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. [76] Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. [78] Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions. [79]\nHallmarks\nMain article: The Simpsons opening sequence\nThe Simpsons' opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title towards the town of Springfield . The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The opening was created by David Silverman , the first task he did when production began on the show. [80] The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career. [81]\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the segments change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, [80] Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone, and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch. [82] On February 15, 2009, a new opening credit sequence was introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV. The sequence had all of the features of the original opening, but added numerous details and characters. [83]\nHalloween episodes\nMain article: Treehouse of Horror (series)\nThe special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. \" Treehouse of Horror \" first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. [84] These pieces usually involve the family in some horror , science fiction , or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. [85] They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the Treehouse series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox 's current contract with Major League Baseball 's World Series . [86]\nHumor\nThe show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. [87] Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. [87] The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere. [88] The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show. [88] Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a \"...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.\" [89]\nOne of Bart's early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name . Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings . Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \"Red\" Deutsch , whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. [90] As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. [91] [92] The Simpsons also often includes self-referential humor. [93] The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. [94] For example, the episode \" She Used to Be My Girl \" included a scene where a Fox News van drove down the street while displaying a large \"Bush Cheney 2004\" banner and playing Queen 's \" We Are the Champions \", in reference to the 2004 presidential election . [95] [96]\nThe show uses catchphrases , and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. [97] Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt \" D'oh! \", Mr. Burns' \"Excellent...\" and Nelson Muntz 's \"Ha-ha!\". Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as \" \u00a1Ay, caramba! \", \" Don't have a cow , man!\" and \"Eat my shorts!\" appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days. [98] However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising . The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode \" Bart Gets Famous \" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show solely for saying \"I didn't do it.\" [99]\nInfluences on culture\nIdioms\nA number of neologisms that originated on The Simpsons have entered popular vernacular. [100] [101] Mark Liberman , director of the Linguistic Data Consortium , remarked, \"The Simpsons has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.\" [101] The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: \" D'oh! \" So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the Oxford English Dictionary , but without the apostrophe. [102] Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson , an actor in early Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of The Simpsons told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series. [103]\nGroundskeeper Willie 's description of the French as \" cheese-eating surrender monkeys \" was used by National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq . The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. [101] [104] \"Cromulent\" and \"Embiggen\", words used in \" Lisa the Iconoclast \", have since appeared in the Dictionary.com 's 21st Century Lexicon, [105] and scientific journals respectively. [101] [106] \"Kwyjibo\", a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in \" Bart the Genius \", was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm . [107] \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", was used by Kent Brockman in \" Deep Space Homer \" and has become a common variety of phrase. [108] Variants of Brockman's utterance are used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor. [109] It has been used in media, such as New Scientist magazine. [110] The dismissive term \"Meh\", believed to have been popularized by the show, [101] [111] [112] entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. [113] Other words credited as stemming from the show include \"yoink\" and \"craptacular\". [101]\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations includes several quotations from the show. As well as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", Homer's lines, \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \" Burns' Heir \" ( season five , 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \" Eight Misbehavin' \" ( season 11 , 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007. [114]\nTelevision\nThe Simpsons was the first successful animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. [115] During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception. [5] The use of Korean animation studios for tweening , coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series. [5] This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park , Family Guy , King of the Hill , Futurama , and The Critic . [5] \"The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years\", said Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane . \"As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways\u2014you could classify it as\u2014a wholly new medium.\" [116] South Park later paid homage to The Simpsons with the episode \" Simpsons Already Did It \". [117] In Georgia , the animated television sitcom The Samsonadzes , launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with The Simpsons, which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged. [118] [119] [120]\nThe Simpsons has also influenced live-action shows like Malcolm in the Middle , which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. [121] [122] Malcolm in the Middle debuted January 9, 2000 in the time slot after The Simpsons. Ricky Gervais has called The Simpsons a major influence on his British comedy The Office , which also dispenses with a laugh track. [123] Fellow British sitcom Spaced was, according to its director Edgar Wright , \"an attempt to do a live-action The Simpsons.\" [124]\nReception, legacy and achievements\nEarly success\nThe Simpsons was the Fox network's first television series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. [125] While later seasons would focus on Homer, Bart was the lead character in most of the first three seasons. In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \"Bartmania\". [126] [127] [128] [129] He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts . In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; [130] as many as one million were sold on some days. [131] Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" and \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\". [132] [133] [134] The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. [132] Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot. [135]\nDue to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch The Simpsons' time slot so that it would move from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it would compete with The Cosby Show on NBC , the number one show at the time. [136] [137] Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \"Bill vs. Bart\" rivalry. [131] [136] \" Bart Gets an F \" ( season two , 1990) was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show, and it received a lower Nielsen ratings , tying for eighth behind The Cosby Show, which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, [138] and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons. [139]\nThe Simpsons has been praised by many critics, being described as \"the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.\" [140] In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described it as \"the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.\" [141] Tucker would also describe the show as a \"pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.\" [142]\nRun length achievements\nOn February 9, 1997, The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones with the episode \" The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show \" as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States. [143] In 2004, The Simpsons replaced The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action ) in the United States. [144] In 2009, The Simpsons surpassed The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet's record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). [145] [146] In October 2004, Scooby-Doo briefly overtook The Simpsons as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes. [147] However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled Scooby-Doo, which finished with 371 episodes, and The Simpsons reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season. [148] In May 2007, The Simpsons reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While The Simpsons has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed The Simpsons. [149] For example, the Japanese anime series Sazae-san has over 3,000 episodes to its credit. [149]\nIn 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled \"Best. 20 Years. Ever.\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Simpsons. One of the first parts of the celebration is the \"Unleash Your Yellow\" contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show. [150] The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost twenty years after \" Bart the Genius \" aired on January 14, 1990) with The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special - In 3-D! On Ice! , a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the \"cultural phenomenon of The Simpsons\". [151] [152]\nAs of the twenty-first season (2009\u20132010), The Simpsons became the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series, having surpassed Gunsmoke . However, Gunsmoke's episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses The Simpsons, which would not reach that mark until its approximate 29th season, under normal programming schedules. [144] [153] In October 2011, Fox announced that The Simpsons had been renewed for a 24th and 25th season, which means the show will reach 559 episodes. [154] [155]\nAwards\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons have been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards , [48] 30 Annie Awards [156] and a Peabody Award . [157] In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, Time magazine named The Simpsons the century's best television series. [158] In that same issue, Time included Bart Simpson in the Time 100 , the publication's list of the century's 100 most influential people. [159] Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . [160] Also in 2000, Entertainment Weekly magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named The Simpsons the greatest television show of the 1990s . Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted The Simpsons at the top of two polls: 2001's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows, [161] and 2005's The 100 Greatest Cartoons, [162] with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters. [163] Homer would also place ninth on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\". [164] In 2002, The Simpsons ranked #8 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time , [165] and in 2007 it was included in TIME's list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". [166] In 2008 the show was placed in first on Entertainment Weekly's \"Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years\". [167] Empire named it the greatest TV show of all time. [168] In 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Homer \"the greatest character of the last 20 years.\" [169]\nCriticism and controversy\nBart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. [170] [171] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \"threat to learning\" because of his \"underachiever and proud of it\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. [172] Others described him as \"egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited\". [173] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \"angry, confused, frustrated\". In response, Matt Groening said, \"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\" [174] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" [132] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of \" Stark Raving Dad \" in which Bart replied, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\" [175] [176]\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in \" Bart vs. Australia \" ( season six , 1995) and Brazil in \" Blame It on Lisa \" ( season 13 , 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. [177] In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board\u00a0\u2013 who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations\u00a0\u2013 went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. [178] Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \" A Star Is Burns \" ( season six , 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic . He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode \"violates the Simpsons' universe.\" In response, Brooks said \"I am furious with Matt, [...] he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [...] his behavior right now is rotten.\" [179] [180] \" The Principal and the Pauper \" ( season nine , 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner , a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer , who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\" [181]\nThe show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, \"in an effort to protect China's struggling animation studios.\" [182] In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was \"unsuitable for children\". [183] The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded The Simpsons, South Park and some other Western cartoons to be put off air \"for propaganda of various vices\" and the broadcaster's license to be revoked. However, the court decision later dismissed this request. [184]\nCriticism of declining quality\nCritics' reviews of early Simpsons episodes praised the show for its wit, realism, and intelligence. [8] [185] In the late 1990s, around the airing of season ten, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show \"tired\". [186] By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. [187] [188] [189] The BBC noted \"the common consensus is that The Simpsons' golden era ended after season nine \", [190] while Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated \"for many fans [...] the glory days are long past.\" [189] Jim Schembri of the Sydney Morning Herald called the show \"a cultural touchstone for at least two\u2014possibly three\u2014generations of couch potatoes\", but claimed that the show has declined in quality. He attributed this to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favour of and overuse of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote: \"The central tragedy of The Simpsons is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.\" [191]\nAuthor Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as \"hogwash\", saying \"The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.\" [192] Mike Scully , who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve , has been the subject of criticism. [193] [194] Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that \"under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck . The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.\" [193] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, \"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\" [195]\nIn 2003 , to celebrate the show's 300th episode \" Barting Over \", USA Today published a pair of Simpsons related articles: a top-ten episodes list chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive fansite, [196] and a top-15 list by The Simpsons' own writers. [197] The most recent episode listed on the fan list was 1997's \" Homer's Phobia \"; the Simpsons' writers most recent choice was 2000's \" Behind the Laughter \". In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so Season Four looks very good to me now.\" [198] In response, Dan Castellaneta stated \"I don't agree, [...] I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.\" [199]\nDespite the criticism, The Simpsons manages to maintain a large viewership and attract new fans. While the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewers per episode in the U.S., [125] the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers. [200] In an April 2006 interview, Matt Groening said, \"I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit.\" [201]\nOther media\nMain article: The Simpsons (franchise)\nComic books\nNumerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. So far, nine comic book series have been published by Bongo Comics since 1993. [202] The first comic strips based on The Simpsons appeared in 1991 in the magazine Simpsons Illustrated , which was a companion magazine to the show. [203] The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled Simpsons Comics and Stories , containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. [204] The book was a success and due to this, the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison , Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. [204] Issues of Simpsons Comics , Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror and Bart Simpson have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins . [205] [206] [207]\nFilm\nA Seattle 7-Eleven store transformed into a Kwik-E-Mart as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie .\n20th Century Fox , Gracie Films , and Film Roman produced The Simpsons Movie , an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007. [208] The film was directed by long-time Simpsons producer David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, Mike Reiss , John Swartzwelder , Jon Vitti , David Mirkin , Mike Scully , Matt Selman , and Ian Maxtone-Graham . [208] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded. [208] There had been talk of a possible feature-length Simpsons film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode \" Kamp Krusty \" was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. [209] For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project. [201]\nMusic\nMain article: The Simpsons discography\nCollections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums Songs in the Key of Springfield , Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons and The Simpsons: Testify . [210] Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been featured on the show. The album The Simpsons Sing the Blues was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200 [211] and becoming certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . [212] The first single from the album was the pop rap song \" Do the Bartman \", performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Michael Jackson , although he did not receive any credit. [213] The Yellow Album was released in 1998, but received poor reception and did not chart in any country.\nThe Simpsons Ride\nThe Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida .\nIn 2007, it was officially announced that The Simpsons Ride , a simulator ride , would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood . [214] It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida [215] and May 19, 2008 in Hollywood. [216] In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown . However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family . [217] It features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden , Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer . [218] Harry Shearer decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts. [219]\nVideo games\nFurther information: List of The Simpsons video games\nNumerous video games back on the show have been produced. Some of the early games include Konami 's arcade game The Simpsons (1991) and Acclaim Entertainment 's The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants (1991). [220] [221] More modern games include The Simpsons Road Rage (2001), The Simpsons Hit & Run (2003) and The Simpsons Game (2007). [222] [223] [224] Electronic Arts , who produced The Simpsons Game, have owned the exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005. [225] In 2010 they released a game called The Simpsons Arcade for the iPhone . [226] Two Simpsons pinball machines have been produced; one that was available briefly after the first season, and another that is still available for purchase. [227]\nMerchandise\nSee also: List of The Simpsons books and List of The Simpsons DVDs\nThe popularity of The Simpsons has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry. [132] The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from t-shirts to posters. The Simpsons has inspired special editions of well-known board games, including Clue , Scrabble , Monopoly , Operation , and The Game of Life , as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons Jeopardy! . Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show . [228] In particular, seasons one through fourteen have been released on DVD in the U.S. ( Region 1 ), Europe ( Region 2 ) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America ( Region 4 ) with more seasons expected to be released in the future. [229]\nIn 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use Simpsons characters in their advertising. [230] As a promotion for The Simpsons Movie , twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold The Simpsons related products. These included \"Buzz Cola\", \"Krusty-O\" cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and \"Squishees\". [231]\nIn 2008 consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise related to The Simpsons, with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009 20th Century Fox increased merchandising efforts. [232] On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show's twentieth anniversary. [233] The Simpsons is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. [234] [235] The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. [236] Approximately one billion were printed. [237]\nNotes\n^ a b BBC (2000) (DVD). 'The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD).

[26] From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven . Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. [45] Repeat \"special guest\" cast members include Albert Brooks , Phil Hartman , Jon Lovitz , Joe Mantegna , and Kelsey Grammer . [46] Following Hartman's death in 1998, the characters he voiced were retired. [1]\nEpisodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \" Dancin' Homer \". [47] The Simpsons holds the world record for \"Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series\". [48]\nThe show has been dubbed into several other languages , including Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both French and Quebec French . [49] The Simpsons has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the life-long Simpsons fans in the area. [50]\nAnimation\nAnimation director David Silverman , who helped define the look of the show. [6]\nSeveral different U.S. and international studios animate The Simpsons. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo . [5] With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several international studios, located in South Korea. [5] These are AKOM , [51] Anivision , [52] Rough Draft Studios , [53] USAnimation , [54] and Toonzone Entertainment . [55] A subcontractor connection to the North Korean SEK studio has been suspected but not confirmed. [56] Artists at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draw storyboards , design new characters, backgrounds, props and draw character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens , ink and paint , and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later. [57]\nFor the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated The Simpsons in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films , switched domestic production to Film Roman , [58] who continue to animate the show as of 2010. In Season 14 , production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint . [59] The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \" Radioactive Man \" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the Season 12 episode \" Tennis the Menace \", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed \"Tennis the Menace\" was broadcast as made. [60]\nThe series began high-definition production in Season 20; the first episode, \" Take My Life, Please \", aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. [61] Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation. [62]\nCharacters\nMain article: List of characters in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.\nThe Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional \" Middle American \" town of Springfield. [63] Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie , the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier . The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper , and a cat, Snowball V , renamed Snowball II in \" I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot \". [64] Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. [65]\nThe show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV . [66]\nSetting\nMain articles: Springfield (The Simpsons) and List of locations in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons takes place in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state . The show is intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield's location. [67] Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. [68] Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland , Oregon , the city where he grew up. [69] The name \"Springfield\" is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. [70] Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best . He \"figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do.\" [71]\nThemes\nMain articles: Media in The Simpsons , Politics in The Simpsons , and Religion in The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, [63] serving as a satirical parody of a working class American lifestyle. [72] However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. [73] Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School , the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels\u2014from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry. [74]\nSome commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. [75] Al Jean admitted in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" [76] The writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. [77] The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. [76] Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. [78] Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions. [79]\nHallmarks\nMain article: The Simpsons opening sequence\nThe Simpsons' opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title towards the town of Springfield . The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The opening was created by David Silverman , the first task he did when production began on the show. [80] The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career. [81]\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the segments change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, [80] Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone, and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch. [82] On February 15, 2009, a new opening credit sequence was introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV. The sequence had all of the features of the original opening, but added numerous details and characters. [83]\nHalloween episodes\nMain article: Treehouse of Horror (series)\nThe special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. \" Treehouse of Horror \" first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. [84] These pieces usually involve the family in some horror , science fiction , or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. [85] They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the Treehouse series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox 's current contract with Major League Baseball 's World Series . [86]\nHumor\nThe show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. [87] Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. [87] The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere. [88] The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show. [88] Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a \"...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.\" [89]\nOne of Bart's early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name . Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings . Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \"Red\" Deutsch , whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. [90] As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. [91] [92] The Simpsons also often includes self-referential humor. [93] The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. [94] For example, the episode \" She Used to Be My Girl \" included a scene where a Fox News van drove down the street while displaying a large \"Bush Cheney 2004\" banner and playing Queen 's \" We Are the Champions \", in reference to the 2004 presidential election . [95] [96]\nThe show uses catchphrases , and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. [97] Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt \" D'oh! \", Mr. Burns' \"Excellent...\" and Nelson Muntz 's \"Ha-ha!\". Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as \" \u00a1Ay, caramba! \", \" Don't have a cow , man!\" and \"Eat my shorts!\" appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days. [98] However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising . The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode \" Bart Gets Famous \" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show solely for saying \"I didn't do it.\" [99]\nInfluences on culture\nIdioms\nA number of neologisms that originated on The Simpsons have entered popular vernacular. [100] [101] Mark Liberman , director of the Linguistic Data Consortium , remarked, \"The Simpsons has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.\" [101] The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: \" D'oh! \" So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the Oxford English Dictionary , but without the apostrophe. [102] Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson , an actor in early Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of The Simpsons told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series. [103]\nGroundskeeper Willie 's description of the French as \" cheese-eating surrender monkeys \" was used by National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq . The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. [101] [104] \"Cromulent\" and \"Embiggen\", words used in \" Lisa the Iconoclast \", have since appeared in the Dictionary.com 's 21st Century Lexicon, [105] and scientific journals respectively. [101] [106] \"Kwyjibo\", a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in \" Bart the Genius \", was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm . [107] \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", was used by Kent Brockman in \" Deep Space Homer \" and has become a common variety of phrase. [108] Variants of Brockman's utterance are used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor. [109] It has been used in media, such as New Scientist magazine. [110] The dismissive term \"Meh\", believed to have been popularized by the show, [101] [111] [112] entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. [113] Other words credited as stemming from the show include \"yoink\" and \"craptacular\". [101]\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations includes several quotations from the show. As well as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", Homer's lines, \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \" Burns' Heir \" ( season five , 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \" Eight Misbehavin' \" ( season 11 , 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007. [114]\nTelevision\nThe Simpsons was the first successful animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. [115] During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception. [5] The use of Korean animation studios for tweening , coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series. [5] This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park , Family Guy , King of the Hill , Futurama , and The Critic . [5] \"The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years\", said Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane . \"As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways\u2014you could classify it as\u2014a wholly new medium.\" [116] South Park later paid homage to The Simpsons with the episode \" Simpsons Already Did It \". [117] In Georgia , the animated television sitcom The Samsonadzes , launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with The Simpsons, which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged. [118] [119] [120]\nThe Simpsons has also influenced live-action shows like Malcolm in the Middle , which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. [121] [122] Malcolm in the Middle debuted January 9, 2000 in the time slot after The Simpsons. Ricky Gervais has called The Simpsons a major influence on his British comedy The Office , which also dispenses with a laugh track. [123] Fellow British sitcom Spaced was, according to its director Edgar Wright , \"an attempt to do a live-action The Simpsons.\" [124]\nReception, legacy and achievements\nEarly success\nThe Simpsons was the Fox network's first television series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. [125] While later seasons would focus on Homer, Bart was the lead character in most of the first three seasons. In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \"Bartmania\". [126] [127] [128] [129] He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts . In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; [130] as many as one million were sold on some days. [131] Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" and \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\". [132] [133] [134] The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. [132] Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot. [135]\nDue to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch The Simpsons' time slot so that it would move from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it would compete with The Cosby Show on NBC , the number one show at the time. [136] [137] Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \"Bill vs. Bart\" rivalry. [131] [136] \" Bart Gets an F \" ( season two , 1990) was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show, and it received a lower Nielsen ratings , tying for eighth behind The Cosby Show, which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, [138] and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons. [139]\nThe Simpsons has been praised by many critics, being described as \"the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.\" [140] In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described it as \"the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.\" [141] Tucker would also describe the show as a \"pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.\" [142]\nRun length achievements\nOn February 9, 1997, The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones with the episode \" The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show \" as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States. [143] In 2004, The Simpsons replaced The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action ) in the United States. [144] In 2009, The Simpsons surpassed The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet's record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). [145] [146] In October 2004, Scooby-Doo briefly overtook The Simpsons as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes. [147] However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled Scooby-Doo, which finished with 371 episodes, and The Simpsons reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season. [148] In May 2007, The Simpsons reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While The Simpsons has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed The Simpsons. [149] For example, the Japanese anime series Sazae-san has over 3,000 episodes to its credit. [149]\nIn 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled \"Best. 20 Years. Ever.\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Simpsons. One of the first parts of the celebration is the \"Unleash Your Yellow\" contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show. [150] The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost twenty years after \" Bart the Genius \" aired on January 14, 1990) with The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special - In 3-D! On Ice! , a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the \"cultural phenomenon of The Simpsons\". [151] [152]\nAs of the twenty-first season (2009\u20132010), The Simpsons became the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series, having surpassed Gunsmoke . However, Gunsmoke's episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses The Simpsons, which would not reach that mark until its approximate 29th season, under normal programming schedules. [144] [153] In October 2011, Fox announced that The Simpsons had been renewed for a 24th and 25th season, which means the show will reach 559 episodes. [154] [155]\nAwards\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by The Simpsons\nThe Simpsons have been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards , [48] 30 Annie Awards [156] and a Peabody Award . [157] In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, Time magazine named The Simpsons the century's best television series. [158] In that same issue, Time included Bart Simpson in the Time 100 , the publication's list of the century's 100 most influential people. [159] Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . [160] Also in 2000, Entertainment Weekly magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named The Simpsons the greatest television show of the 1990s . Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted The Simpsons at the top of two polls: 2001's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows, [161] and 2005's The 100 Greatest Cartoons, [162] with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters. [163] Homer would also place ninth on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\". [164] In 2002, The Simpsons ranked #8 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time , [165] and in 2007 it was included in TIME's list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". [166] In 2008 the show was placed in first on Entertainment Weekly's \"Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years\". [167] Empire named it the greatest TV show of all time. [168] In 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Homer \"the greatest character of the last 20 years.\" [169]\nCriticism and controversy\nBart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. [170] [171] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \"threat to learning\" because of his \"underachiever and proud of it\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. [172] Others described him as \"egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited\". [173] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \"angry, confused, frustrated\". In response, Matt Groening said, \"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\" [174] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" [132] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of \" Stark Raving Dad \" in which Bart replied, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\" [175] [176]\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in \" Bart vs. Australia \" ( season six , 1995) and Brazil in \" Blame It on Lisa \" ( season 13 , 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. [177] In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board\u00a0\u2013 who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations\u00a0\u2013 went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. [178] Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \" A Star Is Burns \" ( season six , 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic . He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode \"violates the Simpsons' universe.\" In response, Brooks said \"I am furious with Matt, [...] he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [...] his behavior right now is rotten.\" [179] [180] \" The Principal and the Pauper \" ( season nine , 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner , a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer , who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\" [181]\nThe show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, \"in an effort to protect China's struggling animation studios.\" [182] In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was \"unsuitable for children\". [183] The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded The Simpsons, South Park and some other Western cartoons to be put off air \"for propaganda of various vices\" and the broadcaster's license to be revoked. However, the court decision later dismissed this request. [184]\nCriticism of declining quality\nCritics' reviews of early Simpsons episodes praised the show for its wit, realism, and intelligence. [8] [185] In the late 1990s, around the airing of season ten, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show \"tired\". [186] By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. [187] [188] [189] The BBC noted \"the common consensus is that The Simpsons' golden era ended after season nine \", [190] while Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated \"for many fans [...] the glory days are long past.\" [189] Jim Schembri of the Sydney Morning Herald called the show \"a cultural touchstone for at least two\u2014possibly three\u2014generations of couch potatoes\", but claimed that the show has declined in quality. He attributed this to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favour of and overuse of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote: \"The central tragedy of The Simpsons is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.\" [191]\nAuthor Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as \"hogwash\", saying \"The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.\" [192] Mike Scully , who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve , has been the subject of criticism. [193] [194] Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that \"under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck . The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.\" [193] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, \"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\" [195]\nIn 2003 , to celebrate the show's 300th episode \" Barting Over \", USA Today published a pair of Simpsons related articles: a top-ten episodes list chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive fansite, [196] and a top-15 list by The Simpsons' own writers. [197] The most recent episode listed on the fan list was 1997's \" Homer's Phobia \"; the Simpsons' writers most recent choice was 2000's \" Behind the Laughter \". In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so Season Four looks very good to me now.\" [198] In response, Dan Castellaneta stated \"I don't agree, [...] I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.\" [199]\nDespite the criticism, The Simpsons manages to maintain a large viewership and attract new fans. While the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewers per episode in the U.S., [125] the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers. [200] In an April 2006 interview, Matt Groening said, \"I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit.\" [201]\nOther media\nMain article: The Simpsons (franchise)\nComic books\nNumerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. So far, nine comic book series have been published by Bongo Comics since 1993. [202] The first comic strips based on The Simpsons appeared in 1991 in the magazine Simpsons Illustrated , which was a companion magazine to the show. [203] The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled Simpsons Comics and Stories , containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. [204] The book was a success and due to this, the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison , Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. [204] Issues of Simpsons Comics , Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror and Bart Simpson have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins . [205] [206] [207]\nFilm\nA Seattle 7-Eleven store transformed into a Kwik-E-Mart as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie .\n20th Century Fox , Gracie Films , and Film Roman produced The Simpsons Movie , an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007. [208] The film was directed by long-time Simpsons producer David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, Mike Reiss , John Swartzwelder , Jon Vitti , David Mirkin , Mike Scully , Matt Selman , and Ian Maxtone-Graham . [208] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded. [208] There had been talk of a possible feature-length Simpsons film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode \" Kamp Krusty \" was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. [209] For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project. [201]\nMusic\nMain article: The Simpsons discography\nCollections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums Songs in the Key of Springfield , Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons and The Simpsons: Testify . [210] Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been featured on the show. The album The Simpsons Sing the Blues was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200 [211] and becoming certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . [212] The first single from the album was the pop rap song \" Do the Bartman \", performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Michael Jackson , although he did not receive any credit. [213] The Yellow Album was released in 1998, but received poor reception and did not chart in any country.\nThe Simpsons Ride\nThe Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida .\nIn 2007, it was officially announced that The Simpsons Ride , a simulator ride , would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood . [214] It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida [215] and May 19, 2008 in Hollywood. [216] In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown . However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family . [217] It features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden , Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer . [218] Harry Shearer decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts. [219]\nVideo games\nFurther information: List of The Simpsons video games\nNumerous video games back on the show have been produced. Some of the early games include Konami 's arcade game The Simpsons (1991) and Acclaim Entertainment 's The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants (1991). [220] [221] More modern games include The Simpsons Road Rage (2001), The Simpsons Hit & Run (2003) and The Simpsons Game (2007). [222] [223] [224] Electronic Arts , who produced The Simpsons Game, have owned the exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005. [225] In 2010 they released a game called The Simpsons Arcade for the iPhone . [226] Two Simpsons pinball machines have been produced; one that was available briefly after the first season, and another that is still available for purchase. [227]\nMerchandise\nSee also: List of The Simpsons books and List of The Simpsons DVDs\nThe popularity of The Simpsons has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry. [132] The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from t-shirts to posters. The Simpsons has inspired special editions of well-known board games, including Clue , Scrabble , Monopoly , Operation , and The Game of Life , as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons Jeopardy! . Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show . [228] In particular, seasons one through fourteen have been released on DVD in the U.S. ( Region 1 ), Europe ( Region 2 ) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America ( Region 4 ) with more seasons expected to be released in the future. [229]\nIn 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use Simpsons characters in their advertising. [230] As a promotion for The Simpsons Movie , twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold The Simpsons related products. These included \"Buzz Cola\", \"Krusty-O\" cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and \"Squishees\". [231]\nIn 2008 consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise related to The Simpsons, with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009 20th Century Fox increased merchandising efforts. [232] On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show's twentieth anniversary. [233] The Simpsons is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. [234] [235] The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. [236] Approximately one billion were printed. [237]\nNotes\n^ a b BBC (2000) (DVD). 'The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD).

The ratings for Bart Gets a Z say it got over a million viewers more than Cleveland last week, yet here it says Cleveland beat The Simpsons \u201cfor the third week running.\u201d\nAnyway, I was surprised by how good this episode was, especially considering the premise, which seemed rather silly on paper but worked surprisingly well in practice.\nCleveland, meanwhile, disappointed me. After the first two eps I thought it was going to distinguish itself by having a little more heart than Family Guy or American Dad, but it looks like it\u2019s on track to be a cheap copy of FG.

", "explanation": null, "document": "The Simpsons Are Staying, For One More Year\nEarlier this week we learned that The Simpsons was facing cancellation once again due to Fox claiming money woes.\u00a0 The show has been on for twenty-three years and is arguably one of the most influential shows in animation and the medium of television.\u00a0 Fox has come to the conclusion that The Simpsons will continue to generate money for a long time with or without new shows, and so paying high salaries to actors and producers may no longer make sense.\nThe core cast members (Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner,\u00a0 Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer), each make about $8m per year, they were asked to take a smaller paycheck. Now unnamed members of the top producing team (Al Jean, John Frink, James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Matt Selman and Sam Simon) say they\u2019ve cut their fees to keep the show on the air. And even if contracts are inked for a twenty-fourth season, it will likely be the last.\nThe Wrap says that Fox \u201cwants The Simpsons for one more season at most,\u201d and that season will only happen if the show costs 25-30% less than it does now.\nSo where do we stand?\u00a0 Producers on the show have cut their fees, and the six core actors have until noon tomorrow (Friday, Oct 7th) to decide whether or not they\u2019ll take a 45% pay cut. Earlier this week the cast put on the table a 30% pay cut offer, contingent upon also receiving back end points, but Fox rejected that offer.\nOne unnamed exec told the Wrap: The cuts proposed to actors are in line with cuts proposed to others involved in the show. The object here is not for the actors to pay personally for the reduction. The cost is that the cast is a component of the show, all of which is being downsized to do a final season.\nWow, this just got real.\u00a0 One more season, TV is losing something special that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0 Sure syndication will live on forever, but to me there is still nothing like seeing those clouds open up on Sunday with a brand new episode of The Simpsons.\u00a0 I\u2019m sad already.\nPosted By: Graham\n28 Responses to \u201cThe Simpsons Are Staying, For One More Year\u201d\nmatt 6 October 2011 at 3:01 pm #\nits very sad to see there is one more season wow been a fan of the simpsons since i was little wow\nReply\nc3vzn 7 October 2011 at 1:47 am #\nI haven\u2019t been on this site for more than 3 years.

This isn\u2019t just a trans issue, is a problem for all groups outside the privileged minority, but I\u2019m trans so I\u2019m gonna talk about trans stuff. The reason why transfolks (and queers) are included in media is because we are considered weird and fascinating. We\u2019re an interesting hook. Many people take it as a compliment when, to repeat previous sentiments , Pop Culture throws us a bone with a \u201cits better than nothing\u201d mentality. Me, I would rather be ignored than have to deal with mainstream adaptations of my people based on what outsiders think we are.\nThis week, The Simpsons , an old school favorite of mine (until it stopped being funny around season 20, but I still love the old episodes) has finally got on the culture-crash band wagon and making jokes about trans folk. I have to admit that unlike last years\u2019 Family Guy disaster, the Simpsons trans cameo was far from monstrous, but it wasn\u2019t anything to cheer about.\n"}, {"score": 1084.9703, "uuid": "5151e300-8a37-546d-a33e-3453c6ac3fda", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0609wb-41-04807", "target_hostname": "www.snpp.org", "target_uri": "http://www.snpp.org/guides/booklistus04.html", "page_rank": 1.390695e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> Archive: <em>Simpsons</em> Books - Unofficial Books - United States", "snippet": "There are many benefits to using <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> in <em>the</em> classroom, <em>the</em> most obvious of <em>which</em> <em>is</em> that it\u2019s funny.

They live in the suburbs in an obscure part of New England. Each episode is a separate scenario with no ongoing story. And, yes, it is a bit like The Simpsons.\nComments: This show is still in production despite having been cancelled twice. Having now watched a few of the early episodes, I can see both why it got canned but also why plenty of people bought the DVDs and brought about its resurrection. Family Guy has moments where it is hilarious but they leap out unexpectedly in the midst of something which is patently a wannabe of The Simpsons, except wackier and not as clever. Since there are already about a million episodes of The Simpsons, a knock-off isn't going to get anyone excited. It is funny, though. Basically, it's the kind of thing you wouldn't turn on specially but that's a real score if you're flicking channels while sitting up late with a grouchy baby.\nThe best bits are always the brief flash-back and 'what if' scenes that pop up frequently, introduced by lines such as, \"I'm not so sure that's a good idea, remember the last time I did the laundry...\" These provide nearly all the laugh-out-loud moments. (Some of the references are overly American, however, and some are out-of-date now).\nIn contrast, the actual story-lines affirming that lazy, idiot dads are really heroes can be tedious. We've seen it all before. Family Guy is far better when things revolve around Stewie's plans for world domination. With luck, later episodes feature more of Brian and Stewie while making the other characters a little more memorable.\nThat said, watching an episode of Family Guy is a better way to spend twenty minutes last thing at night than hunting around on Teletext for something interesting because you can't be bothered to go to bed. Just remember not to end up doing the Teletext thing as well... It's never pleasant waking up up on the sofa at half-seven in the morning with a small child sitting on your head playing Mario Kart.\nConclusion: I'll rent the second disc at some point but I'm in no great rush. It might even be better just going straight to season four and seeing if the show ever really finds its feet. If you're desperate for some American comedy, try My Name is Earl first - it's consistently funnier and more interesting. Or you could just set your Sky+ box to record repeats of The Simpsons. That will keep you busy for awhile.\nExplosions: Occasional.\nJokes about President Clinton: Some.\nBrilliant comic characters: Two.\nGeneric comic characters: The rest.\nSimilarity to The Simpsons: Obvious.\nChances of a Family Guy fanboy slagging me for daring to suggest any similarity to The Simpsons whatsoever: High.\nRating: 3/5.\n"}], [{"score": 1079.0831, "uuid": "e0facd66-60f8-57bd-ae06-7316f7421da6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-84-23107", "target_hostname": "lilt.ilstu.edu", "target_uri": "http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/simpson.htm", "page_rank": 1.1773429e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>simpson</em>", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> it okay to call someone &quot;black&quot; <em>or</em> African-American? <em>Is</em> there a difference?

The black members of the civil rights generation in America had a purpose; they shared the struggle to integrate and to be accepted in the mainstream culture. They came together to oppose racism and through their strife helped to define what it meant to be a black American. Black Americans have historically shared a common bond, being black, brings with it a history of oppression and hope.\nBut, is this bond felt by black members of the post-civil rights generation. Without a common purpose, largely believing that racism is a sin of the past and disillusioned by unfulfilled promises of white America, what does \"being black,\" mean today? Simpson interviewed young black college students across the political spectrum to find out, \"what it means to be black to members of a generation that many hoped would never have to ponder such a question\" (1).\nThe first interviews Simpson presents are of conservative blacks, she calls \"Republican Race Men.\" Like many Republicans, these students come from upper-middle class, two parent households. Their households happen to be very traditional as both of them cite the presence of a strong father figure (33). They are optimistic about opportunities awaiting them, products of the Reagan-Bush Era they believe in the free market and are active members of the Young Republicans. Currently, they are very excited about the \"sweat-equity politics\" of Jack Kemp. Both students were integrated with whites at an early age and had substantial friendships with them.\nYet, even though they hesitate to shout \"Racism\" they feel alienated from many of their previous white friends and have, in large part rejected them. Further, although they do not identify with whites they do not feel there is a common black culture. One student states When I walk into a room I know I have nothing in common with those people [whites]. More than likely, I\u0092ll have something in common with at least one [black] person there- and even if I don\u0092t, it\u0092s a lot easier for me to disagree with [blacks] than it is to disagree with [whites]. (36)\nThe \"Republican Race Men,\" like all the conservative students interviewed, attend historically black colleges. They feel that attending black institutions have been a liberating experience in terms of expressing their political views and individuality. There, there is no pressure to \"fit the mold\" of what people think being black means, they do not feel pressure to \"create a unified front\" that many blacks at majority white institutions reported. One student articulates his rejection of afro-centric unity by stating, \"Even if I\u0092m wrong, even if we\u0092re both wrong, we have to be there [together] no matter what\" (40). Moreover, Simpson writes In majority white environments, the racial tie that binds grows tighter. In majority black environments it comforts and redeems the individual within, freeing each one to discover his or her own truths about race (146).\nThese students do not feel strongly attached to blacks in general but do feel it is their responsibility to help them, help themselves. For them, \"individuals are in control, and systemic inequities may be overcome\" (44). If blacks can\u0092t make it in America it is because they did not try. Other students interviewed were also conservative but Simpson deemed them, \"Old School Conservatives,\" by this she meant, they were more conservative on moral and cultural issues that he Republican Race Men were. They also more readily accept the notion of a black identity than the other conservative students do. The qualification for accepting \"black identity\" is the idea that it is very diverse, they do not believe acting \"ghetto\" equal being \"black.\" According to them, someone can wear a three-piece suit, speak white and still have a black identity (45). One student states that the \"black identity\" comes from sharing a history of oppression (49).\nThese students, like the Republican Race Men, shared the effects of an upper class upbringing and a strong father figure in their lives that helped shape their political attitudes. Further, these students also happen to attend historically black colleges, which has certainly effected their ability to express their conservative views. Both of these students express frustration with experiences with whites and exhibit a skepticism about their motives.\nThey reason that blacks cannot look to whites for help since they are the ones who oppressed them in the first place. They belong to the Republican Party but say of their membership Just like there are white people in the NAACP, white people here at Barnett, watching us seeing what we\u0092re doing. There are black people watching the Republicans, and seeing what they\u0092re doing (51).\nMore cynicism of whites is expressed when the same student jokes that separatism is not the answer for blacks because; \"A black state would be too easy to pick off.\" To them, the reason black people don\u0092t make it in America is because, \"they did not take the initiative to move on\" (52). The last group of conservative students interviewed was conservative because they came from regions, like the south, or rural areas, with strong traditions of conservatism. Unlike the first two groups of conservative students they had not experienced integration at an early age, growing up in the segregated south they had not had much contact with white people. The strong role of religion in the lives of these young people also helped shape their conservative views.\nThis group is more diverse than the previous two because it includes a women who is liberal on women\u0092s rights issues and also attends a majority white institution. Overall, they are much more tolerant of social issues than the other conservative students.\nOnly one student is conscious of his racial identity a great deal of the time and feels that his fate is strongly linked to the fate of the black community. The other two express feelings that they are connected to the black community only \"somewhat.\" Although, they recount experiences that many would deem racist, they are hesitant to make that distinction. Two of these group members do not support affirmative action initiatives. One replies to the affirmative action question by stating, \"if blacks don\u0092t make it, it is because they don\u0092t try hard enough (68). They do not tend to support government solutions like racism to problems within the black community.\nThe only intervention that is seen as really positive is increasing the minimum wage. Altogether, they blend a message of self-help for blacks with one of community responsibility. One says, \"[blacks need] the proper nourishment, as well as the proper tools for succeeding. Those tools are a proper education, combined with a community support system (65).\nThe last two conservative students Simpson writes about are those that come from wealthy families, again with strong father figures. They live a contradictory life-style for, although they are certainly upper class, they feel that their skin color betrays their status. One young woman in this group remarks that growing up in an affluent community she has internalized all the negative stereotypes about black people. This has made it very hard for her to identify with other blacks. Although she currently is very resentful and hateful of whites, she also struggled very much with the fact that she was black and opts to wear light colored contact and synthetic hair extensions.\nTo her there is no black identity she observes Race is a very tedious description to me. What does that mean blacks have to define [black identity] individually for themselves. There is no standard for blackness (72). Further, since she has very dark skin, she ahs endured racism from other members of the black community, which has led to participation in multi-cultural clubs where she feels more accepted.\nPolitically, she is liberal on certain social issues concerning women; she does not liberal views concerning welfare, affirmative action or responsibility to help blacks out of poverty. She thinks that one of the biggest problems black currently have is their mind-set which blames \"the white man\" for everything.The next group of students presented were those deemed to be moderate on issues concerning race.\nIt includes three women and three men. Simpson points out the commonalties among them. She relates First, all but one are solidly middle class; second, they have not experienced much discrimination; third, all but two attend majority-white institutions; and fourth, all point to the failure of both whites and blacks to solve racial problems (81).\nThis group also did not share the characteristic of mostly coming from two-parent households and having strong father figures, as the majority of conservative students had. Simpson believes that these students have a tendency to ignore or diminish adverse affect of race in their lives. They are inclined to be very individualistic and don\u0092t think that racism can be used as an excuse for not succeeding. On the other hand, they can point to such things as sub-standard education for blacks holding them back. One student relates, \"In my city you cannot come out of a public school socially ready to function in this society. You just don\u0092t have the background. You don\u0092t have it\" (84).\nAnother student expresses an interesting mix of conservative and liberal ideas when she explains that black people haven\u0092t made it in America because, \"opportunities were not available to them, or they didn\u0092t take advantage of the opportunities that were available to them\" (87). Again, there is a skepticism of the ability of government to improve the condition of blacks. Consider one student\u0092s remarks When are you going to realize that you can\u0092t expect the people who got you into these situations to get you out...If they wanted to get you out, they wouldn\u0092t have put you there in the first place. . I blame a lot of the problems in our community on ourselves...we have a long way to go (98).\nEven though these students do not all claim to share a racial identity with other blacks they do believe that it is the responsibility of middle class blacks to \"give a hand up\" and help impoverished blacks.One student in this group does say that he has experienced overt racism in high school placement and at other times in his life. Thus, he was the most apt to claim that he thinks about \"being black\" a lot and states that there is a black identity. He states, \"Experiences with discrimination bind all blacks (89). In his mind, it does not matter how successful you are; white America will always have a negative image of you.\nThis sense of not fully being accepted at their majority white institutions has reinforced the ideal of helping other blacks and helped create unity among these students. Perhaps another outgrowth of attending majority white institutions, is that although they profess to believing in a black identity they are very adverse to black stereotyping. There is a consensus that education is what the black community needs that the government can only provide a limited amount of help. One moderate student relays It really boils down to education overall. Because if someone is educated, they can always move forward because they want to move forward. That\u0092s what education does for you (98).\nThe last group of students represented the liberals along the ideological scale. They expressed much more frustration with white\u0092s than either the conservatives or the moderates interviewed. This is a large group of students who were mostly from single parent households, only two of them attend historically black universities and most of them are from lower income backgrounds (105).\nMany of them experienced integration early in their lives but felt that race had become more important to them as they grew older and rejected friendship with whites. All of them can relate instances of racism and were much more forthcoming about them than the students in any of the other groups were. For those that attend majority white institutions many feel that racist attitudes and stereotypes isolated them from the social scene. This isolation has helped to forge a strong feeling of black identity and unity.\nOne student explains We are all a family even though we are spread across the Earth. I just feel there is a link somewhere inside. [There is an unspoken rule that blacks must acknowledge each other when they meet, whether they know each pother or not. We pull ourselves together for the sake of being together] (110). >From the above excerpt we can see that these students believe that what happened to other blacks effects them a lot and the fate of all blacks is tied together. These students are apt to believe that the government and whites have been guilty of oppressing blacks in the past and should be accountable for helping them out now. This does not mean, though, that they articulate a sense of trust towards whites.\nThey think that programs like affirmative action and welfare are viable and needed. They also think that the government has a major responsibility to improve education in the black community. Indeed, most of these students have been frustrated with experiences of academic difficulty at majority white institutions. At least one instance can be ascribed to blatant racism on the part of a professor, but many others can be attributes to internalized feelings of inferiority or the disadvantage of coming from an inferior education system. One student asserts, \"Poor blacks are victims of a poor public education system. Educational tracking...is one aspect of the system that is harmful to black students\" (123).\nIt\u0092s hard to come up with concrete theories about race from this book because you have competing factors like socioeconomic status, class, majority white or majority black college attendance. Further confounding things, is the fact that these respondents are quite young and probably still developing ideas on race and integration, coming into play. Sometimes it seems that attitudes do break down more along class lines than race lines. We can see from the attitudes expressed and stories relayed by these different students that \"being black,\" means different things to different people in the post-civil rights generation. There is not an expression of unity as there was in the past except among liberal students at majority white institutions.\nYet, although there is divergence on whose responsible for getting blacks out of impoverished situations, students across all political beliefs agreed that education is the key to revitalizing the black community. The other commonality of most students that is very distressing is the lack of trust they hold for white people. Even those with weak racial identities, early integration and conservative attitudes express feelings of not being full comfortable in the \"white world.\" Considering the slights that almost all students have endured it\u0092s easy to understand they\u0092re uneasiness. I think this exemplifies a major problem that halts dialogue between the white and black community, it seems each side is second-guessing what the other really thinks.\nAs we can see, simple integration will not solve everything. Indeed, many of those with early integration experiences have completely rejected the lifestyles and friendships from the white culture. There needs to be real communication and interaction between whites, blacks other minorities on race as well as class. Simpson, says the \"tie that binds\" is \"being black,\" maybe it would be more correct to say that a lack of open communication and discussion among diverse groups is really the tie that binds. If that\u0092s the case it does not only constrain individuals, but has proven to hold our society and culture hostage for centuries.\n"}, {"score": 1044.3596, "uuid": "a420d593-dea2-5266-b735-d43e52550dc3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-00-30812", "target_hostname": "www.thegamereviews.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thegamereviews.com/article-6386-the-simpsons-arcade-game.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> Arcade Game | <em>The</em> Game Reviews", "snippet": "<em>The</em> biggest redeeming feature of this game <em>is</em> <em>the</em> on-line play and <em>the</em> multiplay elements, <em>which</em> I found fun, but don&#x27;t bother if you want to play on your own. <em>THE</em> <em>SIMPSONS</em> ARCADE GAME <em>is</em> a nice harks back to a bygone era, <em>the</em> repetitive music, easy gameplay and bright graphics.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Simpsons Arcade Game\nBy Dayvid, on February 14th, 2012\nLet us go back to 90's, a time when games were simpler. Well with the release of THE SIMPSONS ARCADE GAME on Xbox Live Arcade\u00a9, those days are here again my friends. You can either look at this release from KONAMI and wonder why they bothered, or view it as a refreshing retro look back. I am not sure personally, maybe some things need to stay in the past. I must admit I did have fun playing this game for a while(ten minutes), but the lack of any challenge what so ever, along with the infuriating endless arcade music, quickly began to grate on me.\nOriginally released way back in 1991, it does show how far the gaming world has progressed over the years. It seems the video game industry's recent fad is to release updated, HD ready versions of old classics like HALO and METAL GEAR SOLID.Is this a sign the games companies are running out of ideas? I mean let\u2019s face it back in the day when we knew no better, this franchised tie-in was the best thing in the arcade (maybe), but do we really want to be bothered with it again? It does look dated. Mind you as an app or a tablet game it might be distracting for a while. But as a console game, I don't know.\nThe story revolves around an evil SMITHERS (I know, who thought of that one? ) stealing a gem from Mr BURNS, which ends up being swapped for MAGGIE'S dummy, resulting in SMITHERS becoming a child snatcher (dodgy ground to be on for a game story). The ensuing chaos gives the go ahead for the other main characters to pursue SMITHERS through the street s of Springfield, fighting a variety of foes, including bosses at the end of each level. Each family member has different special move (if that\u2019s what you can call them). BART uses his skateboard, MARGE can use the vacuum, all pretty basic stuff. As for game play, well it's what you would expect. You use two buttons, one for jumping, one for fighting and that\u2019s it really. Alright you can pick up objects and throw them, and there are weapons like a hammer that can be used.\nAll of this doesn't take away from the age of this game. The simplicity will put off many gamers because we have all become way more sophisticated than this kind of thing. Ok if you are into retro gaming. then please invest your 800 Microsoft\u00a9 points on it. And there possibly are some gamers out there who missed this first time round that perhaps want to be reminded of how far gaming has come in the past 20 odd years. Personally it\u2019s nice to see how polished and graphically superior this game was in its day. Like I said, SIMPSONS ARCADE would make a great app, but as a game that is moderately expensive for what you get, it isn't really worth it. I have played free games that are way more of a challenge and are more sophisticated than this.\nThe biggest redeeming feature of this game is the on-line play and the multiplay elements, which I found fun, but don't bother if you want to play on your own.\nSummary\nTHE SIMPSONS ARCADE GAME is a nice harks back to a bygone era, the repetitive music, easy gameplay and bright graphics. All of which is nice and nostalgic, but somewhat dated, with the new features and unlockables (open up Japanese version on completion). I can see the KONAMI has put some thought into it, as a multiplayer this is a fun game to play. It\u2019s just a little too dated for my taste. I will give it 6 out of 10 as I do think it is a touch too easy and overpriced.\nThe Simpsons Arcade\n"}, {"score": 1040.4003, "uuid": "f6f364aa-b35f-50ba-844d-9cb2f13b2111", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1804wb-01-05291", "target_hostname": "www.thetriangle.org", "target_uri": "http://www.thetriangle.org/news/2004/11/12/Entertainment/The-Simpsons.Desperately.Deserves.Cancellation-802831.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2573995e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> desperately deserves cancellation - Entertainment", "snippet": "Also, most audiences who watch shows like that don&#x27;t care as much about <em>the</em> quality and character development, <em>which</em> FOX has shown by bringing back <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> instead of Futurama because it got <em>better</em> re-run ratings and more dvd sales.", "explanation": null, "document": "Email\nPage 1 of 3 next >\nAbout four years ago, the first \"cancel The Simpsons opinion articles were released onto online periodicals.

With the series-long love-hate affair between Fry and Leela, its characterization was superlative. Even with pseudo-topical humor, episodes such as the patriotism-questioning \"A Taste of Freedom\" are without equal. All at once, I am incredibly angry that Futurama was cancelled so early on only because of its inconvenient timeslot (often swallowed by Sunday Night Football), and yet also relieved that it was saved from the fate that its sister series has befallen.\n\"But it could get better,\" you say. Well, unfortunately, we've been saying that for four years now, which is a practical eternity when it comes to television, and a second coming seems unlikely. Luckily, more people are starting to get just how dreadful the show has become. Harry Shearer, the brilliant character actor who voices characters such as Principal Skinner and Mr. Burns, has stated that he has become dissatisfied with his role in the series, and would like to quit. I say, more power to him, because it seems the only way that the show will end is if several major voice actors are left permanently unavailable to perform. It seems unlikely, considered the exorbitant pay raises that the actors fought so hard for (now up to $250,000 per episode). No ill will is wished upon these actors - Dan Castellaneta is brilliant no matter where he goes - but, please, use your talents elsewhere.\nOf course, few shows are totally without merit, and The Simpsons still manages a few laughs now and again. Furthermore, I could just shut my yap and stop watching it altogether, not even for a passing glance. But my concern is that I still proudly consider The Simpsons a part of my personal culture. It has had immeasurable impact on the artist, the critic, and the very person I am today. I am heartbroken that such an important measure of my life has been so greatly diminished over a depressingly short period of time. For the sake of my adolescent memories, please, end The Simpsons now, before the number of awful episodes outweighs the number of brilliant ones.\nIan Pugh is a junior majoring in Film and Video.

Their title of \"most guest stars on a television series\" was once worn with pride, with such eclectic stars as Donald Sutherland, Peter Frampton, Ron Howard, and three of the four Beatles. Now look at the lineup from the past several years: Simon Cowell? Jonathan Taylor Thomas? Sarah Michelle Gellar? That's bad enough, but even brilliant actors like Steve Buscemi and Sir Ian McKellen are only given two lines, as if only to add to the hundreds of names to that list of guest stars! They're not even trying anymore.\nPerhaps worst of all is the \"topical\" humor. The show has always flirted with current events, along with hilarious parodies of classic television and film - yet nothing too intrusive. Now... well, it's different. One truly awful episode from last year, \"Co-Dependence Day,\" spends ten minutes parodying the political snorefest that is Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, complete with overlong senatorial hearings and an purposely offensive Rastafarian parody of Jar-Jar Binks. Bart and Lisa go to visit the creators of the \"Cosmic Wars\" series, \"Randall Curtis,\" to personally complain. I get it! It's supposed to be like Star Wars and George Lucas!

Now, for the most part, I have stopped watching the show, but I still check up on it... and I weep, because \"The Simpsons\" used to be the best television series on television, bar none. My opinion of the show as a whole has suffered; I can still watch a fourth season episode and laugh heartily, but can't help but stop to think - those were the days.\n< prev Page 2 of 3 next >\nArticle Tools\n"}, {"score": 1037.9635, "uuid": "333d1d6d-045a-58b4-9acd-e219b6f14bb4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-66-15697", "target_hostname": "www.extraguy.com", "target_uri": "http://www.extraguy.com/2012/02/the-simpsons-arcade-game-review-doh/", "page_rank": 3.7643546e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> Arcade Game review: D\u2019oh", "snippet": "<em>The</em> start of <em>the</em> game offers <em>the</em> choice of <em>the</em> four, non-Maggie members of <em>the</em> <em>Simpsons</em>\u2019 immediate <em>family</em>.

The Simpsons Arcade Game is a prime example of this phenomenon. It\u2019s a game that was designed to take your quarters, plain and simple. This makes it impossible to complete unless you have free play enabled, simultaneously nullifying any semblance of challenge.\nThe start of the game offers the choice of the four, non-Maggie members of the Simpsons\u2019 immediate family. None of the characters are any better or worse than the others \u2014 pick which one you like the most, or you find has the least annoying voice. Of course, you can have the whole family on the screen at once since the game supports four players. As with most brawlers, more people playing can increase the enjoyment factor.\nThe more people there are, the more you\u2019ll be distracted from the lack of depth in the combat. Or the lack of any sort of level design. You just move right, jam on attack and occasionally jump to avoid enemies. There are plenty of games that have used this formula to greater success \u2014 The Simpsons just feels empty in comparison.\nThe graphics still hold up and the sound is charming in that low-quality, digitized way, but it\u2019s a bad sign when the license is the strongest part of the package. The Simpsons Arcade Game is a relic of the past best left in your memories.\nAbout Anthony\nAnthony\u2019s gaming love began with River Raid on the Atari 2600, but he has been through every console cycle since with battle scars to show. While his love for all things gaming makes him excited to see where the industry goes next, he strongly hopes that developers don\u2019t forget where it\u2019s been in the process.\nNo Comments\n"}, {"score": 1037.1234, "uuid": "a29c2976-b368-5d93-9748-69f57a7c9b96", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0712wb-08-06652", "target_hostname": "teaandzebrastripes.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://teaandzebrastripes.deviantart.com/journal/poll/625597/", "page_rank": 1.3378556e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> <em>or</em>", "snippet": "* Jun 21, 2009 Out of these, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> your favorite Pokemon type? * Jun 20, 2009 -Needs to think of a poll question- Erm... <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> <em>or</em> <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>? * Jun 17, 2009 &#x27;Crystal Memories&#x27; has won <em>the</em> poll!", "explanation": null, "document": "-Needs to think of a poll question- Erm...

While shows like \"SpongeBob\" and \"Fairly OddParents\" are good shows, they are not doing the same type of program as a show like \"The Simpsons\" or \"Family Guy.\" It's apples and oranges. It's doing two different things, producing for two different audiences. The process is much more analogous to what shows like \"Two and a Half Men\" or \"The Office\" do. The sitcom process is a different medium. The only thing that should be relevant is if you are doing a quality show or not.

I\u2019m finishing a rewrite on the pilot,\u201d MacFarlane explained . \u201cWe\u2019re trying to, essentially, stay true to what that show is. There\u2019s something cool to me about, in 2013, turning on your TV and seeing \u2018The Flintstones\u2019 and having it look like \u2018The Flintstones.\u2019\u201d\nAs you can gather from the quote, the reboot wouldn\u2019t be launched until sometime next year. It will also be on Fox, home to MacFarlane\u2019s other shows, \u2018Family Guy,\u2019 \u2018American Dad\u2019 and \u2018The Cleveland Show.\u2019\n\u201cThey invented the template that we\u2019re using in animation,\u201d MacFarlane continued, speaking about Hanna-Barbera, the animation greats who created \u2018The Flintstones\u2019 and \u2018The Jetsons.\u2019 He added, \u201cWe kind of want to keep it more or less the same. The stories that we tell will be a little more current.\u201d\n\u2018The Flintstones,\u2019 which originally ran between 1960 and 1966, is considered the first primetime cartoon, and was intended for adults as much as it was for kids.\nOf course, MacFarlane\u2019s cartoons can get pretty racy. So, along with the excitement that he is bringing back to the modern stone-aged family, there is going to be concern that he may bring too much edge (along with his trademark random cutaway gags) to The Flintstones\u2019 old-fashioned sensibilities.\nAlso, do you think MacFarlene would dare mix \u2018The Flinstones\u2019 into his other cartoon universes? Because we\u2019ve always wanted to see Stewie and Bam Bam square off for animated baby supremacy.\n"}, {"score": 1002.91174, "uuid": "3844b9bb-83b5-58a0-bf4d-8ce12e9ec8bb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0805wb-88-15662", "target_hostname": "joeposnanski.si.com", "target_uri": "http://joeposnanski.si.com/2010/10/11/the-simpsons-baseball-edition/", "page_rank": 1.2145955e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Joe Posnanski \u00bb Posts <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> Baseball Edition \u00ab", "snippet": "Terms under <em>which</em> this service <em>is</em> provided to you.

I fondly remember the series premiere Xmas episode. Since then, The Simpsons has served as something of a screen through which I view life, informing my worldview both humorously and philosophically. I was an adult before I realized how much I owed my brand of humor and socio-political sensibilities to the world of Springfield. Had I spent a lifetime religiously watching, say, Home Improvement, I would be a much different person than I am today. So for that, I offer my eternal gratitude to Matt Groening, Al Jean, and all the rest.

I\u2019ve been watching the simpsons since I was in diapers, I am about two months older than the series itself, 3 months older if you don\u2019t count the christmas special. Through good episodes (Who Shot Mr.Burns Part 1 and 2) and bad (The principal and the Pauper) and through personality changes (like when Lisa became a vegetarian), a plethora of guest stars and a movie. I guess you could say I grew up with the simpsons, even though they haven\u2019t aged at all since premiering, through the series (and comic book) and a couple of episode guides. And I\u2019m still waiting for the second movie! When the show does end(who knows when), a hole will be punctured in pop culture that cannot be filled no matter how much a Seth Macfarlane creation would attempt to fill it, it won\u2019t be full. This concludes my short speech\nReply\nRedPatriot 19 February 2012 at 8:31 pm #\nWhat 500 episodes means to me is that, of all the change I\u2019ve experienced in my life and I\u2019m sure other fans have experienced in their lives, there has been one constant for all of us for over two decades now, The Simpsons. This show has seen us through so much, through good times and through bad, through peace and through war, through ecstasy and through heartbreak. We have been fortunate to have had this gift, and while every episode is not perfect and the characters themselves have changed in some respects, for over twenty weeks a year we know we can turn on the television and enter a world that has been with us since the 80s, before many of us were even alive. The Simpsons is a part of our culture, part of who we are, how hard is it to find someone that has not seen at least one of the now 500 episodes, not just in this country but all around the world. The Simpsons are America\u2019s family, they are our family, and no matter what happens in our lives we shall always have Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and all the others. They will always be there for us, through the best of times and the worst of times. And while I recognize there has been a decline in quality I also recognize there are still many good episodes produced today and believe that many who condemn the modern show are simply looking back through rose colored glasses ignoring old flaws. I can only hope that this, our constant, be it on television or now the internet where so many of us catch the newest episodes instead of hoping they won\u2019t be overtaken by sports or becouse our busy schedules forbid us from watching television at that time on Sunday nights, that our cultural constant, our shared family shall continue to tell us good, enjoyable stories for years to come and hope to share a positive celebration of 750 episodes one of these days. Though if we are not, we have been given hundreds more episodes than many other shows get and we should count ourselves lucky for that alone.\nReply\nLee 20 February 2012 at 10:41 am #\nIt means everything to me.

I fell in love with the show.\nUnfortunatly, back then I didn\u2019t knew, that it was still running.Sadly,there were a lot of re-runs on TV.\nFew years later,my life changed and I moved to States. I lived there for 4 years.I immediatly found out, that the show never closed and I had a lot of cathing up to do! I was so happy!\nSince then, I am a fan.\nThe Simpsons are always with me!\nI have found a lot of daily wisdom, interesting views for life and way to live. I mean,they are still fun to watch! Maybe noy every time, but I will never stop watching them. They are mine little american family(althoug personaly I think they are a kind of family,that could have lived in any country) which I love and adore.\nI qoute simpsons a lot. They propagandize fun ,family love and show inquisitiveness.\nAlthogh I sometimes feel ashemed for the new episodes(they can do better, I know!), I still can\u2019t wait for the new episode!\nThank you all for your work!!!

Greydanus\nThe Guys is a small, intimate meditation on grief and loss in the days after September 11, 2001. Set less than two weeks after that fateful day, it relates an encounter between a New York fire captain named Nick and a writer named Joan, who meet to discuss the eulogies Nick has been called on to deliver for a number of his fallen brothers.\nThe film is based on a stage play of the same name, commissioned in the weeks after 9/11 by the Flea Theater, located a few blocks away from Ground Zero. The play was written by journalist and first-time playwright Anne Nelson, based on her own experiences writing eulogies with a real fire captain.\nSigourney Weaver \u2014 who is married to Flea founder Jim Simpson \u2014 played Joan in The Flea\u2019s first stagings of The Guys, sometimes opposite Anthony LaPaglia as Nick. Weaver and LaPaglia reprise their roles for this film version, directed by Weaver\u2019s husband Simpson from Nelson\u2019s own adapted screenplay.\nUnsurprisingly, the film is true to its theatrical roots: low-key, set mostly within the confines of an upper West Side apartment, centered on the conversation between the fire captain and the writer. In keeping with the minimal production values of the stage play, the film was shot in nine days on a limited budget. Dramatic 9/11 footage, flashbacks of the missing firefighters, even a romance between Nick and Joan were all proposed by Hollywood producers, but the filmmakers rightly sensed that anything like this would have been disastrous.\nThe Guys is not an entertainment, or even a story, but a simple, direct portrait of grief amid overwhelming circumstances. There\u2019s a transparent honesty to this film, an immediacy and insistence of emotion, that makes clear this is not a product of a calculated decision about the topicality of 9/11 stories. The deliberate lack of artifice makes The Guys a quietly moving experience; given another approach, it could easily have come off as crassly opportunistic or sensational.\nThe Guys is about its two main characters, but it\u2019s also about four or five men who never appear onscreen: Bill, Jimmy, Patrick, Bernie (and Dave, Bernie\u2019s partner in crime). By the end of the film\u2019s 88-minute running time, we know more about these absent men than we do about the main characters in many another film. The Guys is about remembering the dead, and is itself a sort of eulogy \u2014 though we learn more about these fallen firefighters than we would have from the eulogies alone, and also more about the living who remember them.\nNick is clearly uncomfortable coming to Joan\u2019s apartment, and isn\u2019t really ready to talk about his men. He\u2019s still in shock, distracted by details: Eight families, he says, want services for their loved ones, though no bodies have been found; if and when the bodies are found, they may want funerals as well. But 350 firefighters have been lost. \"If they all want funerals and services,\" he frets inconsequentially, \"that\u2019ll be 700.\"\nLike many surviving firefighters, police officers, and rescue workers, Nick is uncomfortable with all the \"hero\" language being bandied about him and his men. He doesn\u2019t feel like much of a hero himself, and doesn\u2019t think of his friends that way either. \"All this hero stuff, like they were guys in a movie. But Bill wasn\u2019t like that at all.\" Bill, Nick tells us, was the kind of guy that no one would even notice when he came into the room. \"You can\u2019t say that in a eulogy,\" he mutters.\nSlowly, with gentle questions, Joan elicits comments from Nick about each of the four men that provides the substance of the eulogies. The process proves cathartic for both of them, as Nick confronts his grief and survivor guilt and Joan gets to contribute in some small way to the comfort and support of those who lost so much more than she did.\nOver the course of the afternoon, as Nick and Joan become more comfortable with one another and their collaborative process, there\u2019s a subtle shift, noticed by neither of them, as scrupulous fidelity to Nick\u2019s memories gives way to slight departures here and there. The first eulogy is taken almost word for word from Nick\u2019s comments; later, Nick notices small inaccuracies creeping in, but decides to let them stay: \"It sounds good.\"\nThis might have led to a moment in which Nick looks at one of the finished speeches, perhaps at the service itself, and realizes that the essence of the man has been lost. That, despite our best efforts to hold onto the dead, they inevitably slip away from us somehow; the past becomes colored in our memories, then distorted, and eventually starts to fade away.\nBut no. The hurt is too new, too raw for Nick to be aware of this process. (There was one guy, a new recruit, whose face Nick can\u2019t remember \u2014 but who knows if he would have been able to picture his face even on September 10?) The time will come for that, but not in this film.\nThere are a number of poignant observations about grief and tragedy: The ever-expanding meaning of the words \"Are you okay?\" \u2014 so ubiquitous on and after September 11 \u2014 is explored, as is the sheer fact of interactions between people like Nick and Joan who, in a sense, should never have met. A scene in which Joan looks with new eyes at a small group of firemen standing in front of their firehouse, then asks them a few semi-knowledgable questions based on things she\u2019s learned from Nick, is especially touching.\nIn a shop, a clerk surprises Joan by saying \"God bless America\" as he makes change. She\u2019s used to hearing God invoked in her native Oklahoma, but not here in New York: \"Here, you can\u2019t be sure if people have a God \u2014 or, if they do, if it\u2019s the same God, who wants the same things.\"\nWhat God wants and how we can relate to him is the underlying question in an extended monologue toward the end of the film. Joan has told us how she used to make \"deals\" with God; now, confronted with such enormity, she asks, \"How can you cut deals with God under these conditions?\" She knows what she would want to bargain for: \"I want them back, all of them. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll settle for.\" There\u2019s just one problem: she has \"nothing to bring to the table.\"\nThe Guys doesn\u2019t probe beyond these observations to deeper issues of faith, trust, and redemption; yet it succeeds in taking false options off the table. Realizing that neither cutting such \"deals\" with God nor \"settling\" for tragedy and evil is a viable possibility can be a first step toward a genuine relationship with God on his own terms \u2014 or at least a step away from superstition and despair.\nSome viewers may find The Guys difficult to watch, either because of its frank treatment of painful subject matter or because of its stark conversational format. But those who are\u2019t put off by the film\u2019s austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them.\nComing Soon\n"}, {"score": 977.06244, "uuid": "745a5500-d1c6-52a5-ba0f-69bd24d8ae74", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0501wb-07-31520", "target_hostname": "www.ew.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273010,00.html", "page_rank": 1.2142722e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em> Review | TV Reviews and News | EW.com", "snippet": "saga of a Texas <em>family</em> <em>guy</em>, not to be confused with Fox&#x27;s new show <em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>, <em>the</em> saga of a Rhode Island clan, <em>which</em> <em>is</em> a cruder-in-every-sense cartoon show with more buzz.", "explanation": null, "document": "EW's GRADE\nD\nDetails Start Date:\u00a0Jan 31, 1999; Genres: Cartoons/Animation , Comedy ; With: Alex Borstein , Seth Green , Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane ; Network: Fox ; More\nNearly lost among the sudden proliferation of prime-time cartoon series has been a succession of superior fresh episodes from King of the Hill, the saga of a Texas family guy, not to be confused with Fox's new show Family Guy, the saga of a Rhode Island clan, which is a cruder-in-every-sense cartoon show with more buzz.\nWhen King debuted in 1997, it was a pleasant surprise: Who knew Mike Judge, progenitor of Uberlouts Beavis and Butt-head, had it in him to create such a subtle, detailed portrait of contemporary middle-class life? This season, the show's only gotten better \u0097 deeper, richer, more true to its guiding intention of presenting people with Texas twangs as something other than the media cliche of rubes with bad taste.\nInstead, propane-gas salesman Hank Hill, his substitute-teacher wife, Peggy, their 12-year-old son, Bobby, and their live-in niece, Luanne, have become vivid, sympathetic people with bad taste (notwithstanding the recent episode in which Bobby evinced a precocious predilection for capers). King of the Hill has faltered in the ratings since moving to Tuesdays, which is a shame because artistically it has surged. Cocreators Judge and Greg Daniels have spent the new season providing vivid showcase episodes for every member of the Hill family.\nRecently, Hank took a car trip with his elderly mother and some of her friends (the varied voices included those of Phyllis Diller, Betty White, and Uta Hagen). They ended up in the middle of a town inundated with college kids letting loose with an MTV Spring Break crew. The mixture of rage, panic, and protectiveness on Hank's part was a marvel of filial complexity.\nAnd the Feb. 23 episode was as remarkable a study in comic behavior as any live-action sitcom this year. If I tell you the primary plot concerned Hank being sexually assaulted by a dolphin, with a parallel subplot about Luanne being sexually harrassed at her golf-course job, you'll just have to trust me that this was handled with a combination of tact, drama, and a cogent critique of a certain New Age strain of anthropomorphism that still has me in awe.\nThe King writers seem particularly attuned to Bobby, a sensitive little lump whose fondness for show-business fantasies and solitary play, as well as a whining reluctance to take part in his dad's lifeblood, football, render the kid a lovable outcast. The March 23 episode summarized all this brilliantly: Bobby was thrilled when a ''New York-style'' deli opened in the Arlen mall and proceeded to stuff himself on such exotic fare as chopped chicken liver, which in turn brought on a case of gout. (The doctor gives him a cane for his inflamed foot, which Bobby immediately deploys for a little vaudeville song-and-dance act.) If only live-action sitcoms were as in touch with their characters' psyches as King is with Bobby's.\nThe real-life details that make King of the Hill so compelling are precisely what Family Guy seeks to avoid. Much attention has been paid to Guy's 25-year-old creator, Seth MacFarlane, who's traveled quickly from the Rhode Island School of Design to a job at Hanna-Barbera writing scripts for series like the Cartoon Network's pseudo-hip, mediocre Johnny Bravo, to overseeing his own ballyhooed creation \u0097 Fox gave Family Guy a prime debut after this year's Super Bowl, and has slotted it cozily between The Simpsons and The X-Files.\nMy fondest hope is that the smart people who watch those last two shows will use the Family Guy half hour to turn off the set and jump-start a quick debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. Family Guy \u0097 about dumbbell dad Peter Griffin, his wife, three children, and dog \u0097 is The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows. Whenever MacFarlane and his writers aren't spoofing tired targets like Fox disaster specials (Fast Animals, Slow Children \u0097 har-har), they're trading on South Park's breakthrough bad taste to make ''jokes'' about, for example, African Americans (the pilot went out of its way to make a stupid Aunt Jemima jibe; the second episode featured a white newscaster who thinks she's not on the air when she says, ''I just plain don't like black people'' \u0097 I dare you to har-har).\nWhat is laughable is the clunky animation, which makes the static, retrograde stuff pumped out by MacFarlane's old employer, Hanna-Barbera, seem state-of-the-art. Combine all of the above, and the acclaim for writer-artist-actor MacFarlane (who does three regular voices on the show) is shaping up to be the hollowest hype of the year.\nKing of the Hill: A\nFamily Guy: D\nSign up for EW.com's What to Watch Newsletter!\nWhat to watch on TV.

No one would go up for second helpings until they knew everyone had eaten,\u201d he says.\nHe is now a regular volunteer for the overnight shift at the men\u2019s shelter. Overnight volunteers provide an awake presence overnight and assist Simpson staff members with the overall running of the shelter. \u201cI am envious of the strength of the shelter guests. I couldn\u2019t do it. Most will never have any idea of how they positively impact me as a volunteer of Simpson.\u201d\nStepanie Sibet: Shelter Overnight Volunteer\nThis Simpson volunteer heard about us when she was a first year student at the University of Minnesota. She volunteered because of her genuine interest in the issue of homelessness, not as a course requirement.\nSince March of 2005, Stephanie has volunteered for over 65 overnight shifts in the men\u2019s shelter, sharing over 870 hours of her time with shelter guests (2008 stats), while working full time as a bike messenger. She can be counted on to sign up for at least two nights a month at the men\u2019s shelter and she can also be counted on to fill in at the last minute.\nComments from the shelter staff include: \u201cThe guys always remember Stephanie and they light up when they see she is the volunteer that night.\u201d \u201cThe guys think she is really tough because she is a bike messenger.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing volunteer who really makes a difference.\u201d \u201cShe is quiet, but has this amazing sense of humor. The guys just open up when they talk to her. She goes above and beyond. She\u2019ll even stay up all night and sort the supply room.\u201d When the men\u2019s shelter team was asked who they would like to see win the 2007 Volunteer Service Award they unanimously agreed: Stephanie Sibet.\nPhoto: Stephanie and shelter guest Michael\nSt. Thomas the Apostle\nThe 2009 Simpson Celebrates Community Volunteer Service Award was presented to St. Thomas the Apostle, who has made a substantial contribution to Simpson Housing Services and the people we serve.\nThis church\u2019s work with us began over two years ago, fueled by kindness, love, enthusiasm, passion and the idea of furnishing the homes of families entering our transitional housing program who could not utilize the services of Bridging (as Bridging is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity).\nA team of church member\u2019s educated their parish on issues of homelessness and of the work of Simpson Housing Services. They encouraged members to donate furniture so that people could move into apartments that feel like a home. The church community rallied together and the items began to flood in. In addition to furniture, members also donated framed art, lamps, rugs, as well as new household items.\nIn addition to the items, the parish members donate countless hours of time and limitless amounts of energy. Volunteers pick up items from various locations and deliver directly to the new homes of families. In November 2007, the first family received items through their efforts and since the beginning of the partnership, they have furnished the homes of 14 families in our family housing program. The families who have received these items have benefited greatly from the feeling of being home.\nThis group is an overall supporter of the mission of the agency. In late 2008, they set out to raise additional funds for the agency and in early 2009 donated over $14,000 to Simpson Housing Services.\nFamily Housing Program Manager Cincere Burns says: \u201cThe commitment and passion of this group is truly amazing to me. I am honored to have worked with them from the beginning of this project. They are committed to both the homeless community and to Simpson Housing Services. Everyone who has contributed from this group truly is a shining star.\u201d\nPhoto: St. Thomas volunteers help a family move into its new home.\nGinger and Adelle: The first volunteers to serve dinner at the women\u2019s shelter continue cooking after seven years\nGinger and Adele, from Good Samaritan United Methodist Church in Edina, were the first volunteers to cook and serve dinner at the Simpson Women\u2019s Shelter seven years ago. They have returned nearly every month with their kettles of hot food, colorful tablecloths, cheery flowers, and their warm smiles.\nThe guests staying at the shelter love to see them come. And when they\u2019re asked why they continue to volunteer, they respond, almost simultaneously: \u201cWe just love it. We love the friends we make and the interaction with the women. And it\u2019s nice to help out and give back to the community.\u201d\nGinger and Adele believe that the chocolate they bring every month is perhaps the most welcome sight when they visit. The bags of make-up, toiletries, purses, paperbacks, coats and gloves are also treats. Ginger says: \u201cWe like things to be special. Everyone likes the same things and we like to bring the extras that the women may not get very often.\u201d\nWhen everyone is sitting around after dinner (guests, volunteers, and staff), sipping coffee, eating brownies, chatting, and learning to crochet from Adele and Ginger, the shelter is more than just a safe place for the night-it\u2019s a coffee clutch and a place to belong. \u201cWe recognize that homelessness can happen to any one of us. Anyone can have a little bad luck.\u201d\nGaylord Girl Scout troop reaches out to people experiencing homelessness\nGaylord Girl Scout Troop #30743 from Gaylord, Minnesota, led by Jodi Sprandel, made a difference in the lives of people experiencing homelessness. In December and January, the troop served two separate evening meals at the Simpson Housing Women\u2019s Shelter in Minneapolis.\nWhat would appear to be a regular evening meal to many (spaghetti, salad, garlic bread, and pie) is quite often the highlight of many of the shelter guest\u2019s day and sadly, quite often the first meal of the day. The troop reported that they were a little nervous, not knowing what to expect. Nerves quickly turned to smiles and laughter. \u201cOur favorite part of the evening was sitting down and eating with the women, getting to know them and hearing their stories,\u201d reports troop leader Jodi. The troop actually had to be coaxed to leave at the end of the evening, as they were enjoying the experience so much.\nImpacted by their contact with the women, Jodi and her scouts wanted to do more. The troop took advantage of the Girl Scout 2008 Thinking Day event and shared their experiences with the other Gaylord Girl Scouts and together made 200 sandwiches for shelter guests to take with them when they leave the shelter at 7 a.m.\n\u201cThis experience forced all of us out of our comfort zones and into someone else\u2019s shoes for a day,\u201d Jodi says. \u201cWe thought about what we like to eat when we chose what to serve in the shelters and what to put in the sandwiches,\u201d added troop member Sonja Sprandel. By connecting with their community, Troop #30743 learned that all of our commonalities are a lot greater than our differences.\nSheryl B. and friends\nWhen Sheryl Burkhardt volunteers her food service skills to Simpson, it\u2019s a family affair.\nIt all began about seven years ago when Sheryl\u2019s eldest daughter, Hilary served dinner at a Simpson Soar program parenting workshop with her Girl Scout troop. \u201cFor every fun thing that the troop got to do, I made sure that we also performed an act of community service,\u201d says Sheryl.\nThat first act of community service at the workshop stuck and seven years later Sheryl B. and friends, as the group is known, has served some 35 meals for Simpson. Most of the meals the group serves are for the Soar program, but they also serve meals at the men\u2019s and the women\u2019s shelters. \u201cI come from a large family and my mom and dad are food people. Serving the 20 or so guests at the women\u2019s shelter is about like cooking dinner for everyone at the holidays.\u201d\nThe meals at the men\u2019s shelter are a bit more of a challenge, with up to 80 people being served, but every bit as rewarding. \u201cI would have my son come along and he would grumble at first, but after chatting with the men at the shelter, I always noticed a change in his attitude.\u201d\n\u201cOne night one of the overnight volunteers asked him to hold his seat while he went to get a blanket for one of the men who was eating, but wasn\u2019t sleeping at the shelter. I think it was then that it truly hit him that there really are people spending the night outside in the winter.\u201d\nOn one particular August night in the men\u2019s shelter, Sheryl B. and friends were busy making turkey sandwiches from freshly roasted turkeys and warming up mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. Watermelons were being sliced into wedges, coleslaw was being tossed with dressing and a variety of homemade bars were being cut and plated.\nWhen asked for some tips on making such a big meal Sheryl responds, \u201cMy dad was a bargain-hunter and I am a really good shopper. I hunt down what is on sale during the weeks before we serve. The cost of the food is a really worthwhile donation to Simpson. And the men are so appreciative of the hot meal.\u201d\nNote: Sheryl B. was the recipient of the 2008 Simpson Celebrates Community Award.\nA Simpson volunteer tells how she came to serve dinner at the women\u2019s shelter\nIt was August of 2006 and because of roommate circumstances I was forced from my apartment. I managed to stay with friends for about a week, but they had their own families and lives. Although I was fortunate enough to have a job at a warehouse, I was without a place to live. I knew if I saved every penny from my checks, except for bus fare, I would have enough to get into a small efficiency apartment in about a month. But, what to do in the meantime?\nThrough a miracle, I found the Simpson Women\u2019s Shelter and it was there I was taken in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to a wonderful hot meal, a chance to shower, wash clothes and even given toiletries, socks and underwear. Each morning I was given sandwiches for my lunch at work and I had a safe place at night.\nTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t how I ever envisioned myself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 having to rely on the grace of others. Every night groups of caring souls with smiles and piles of delicious food came just for us. I realized there is always another side of the story and if I ever had the means and opportunity to reciprocate, I wanted to be the one to bring a \u201csmile and a pile.\u201d\nIt took almost exactly a month, but I got my little efficiency. Since then, I moved up to a better apartment and my warehouse job turned out to be the experience I needed to get into an actual career (with a Fortune 500 company no less!) So, recently when my daughter wanted to do some volunteer work, the Simpson Women\u2019s Shelter offered the perfect chance to give back. We brought in piles of lasagna and our smiles. Sometimes we are blessed by others and don\u2019t even realize it. I was fortunate enough to realize this, and I\u2019ve never forgotten.\nTo all of you who give (or are thinking of giving) your time, money and cooking talents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 many, many thanks!\n-Tammy A.\nA Special Dinner: A first hand account of dining with people experiencing homelessness\nby Jenny Finden-Watson\nFeeling nervous and excited, Heather Saliba, Karen Alexander and I rang the doorbell of the Simpson Women\u2019s Shelter. We waited and we wondered. Had we made enough food? Would someone show us the ropes? Would the oven take an eternity to heat up?! Would the women be friendly or prefer to be left alone? This was the first meal St. James on the Parkway would serve at the shelter, and we weren\u2019t sure what to expect.\nThe door flew open. \u201cWelcome!\u201d said Jim the smiling caretaker. He wasted no time in explaining the kitchen layout and warning us that we had a very hot oven (oh joy). The women would arrive about 6 p.m. and we could begin serving whenever our food was ready. \u201cWill you be eating with us?\u201d he asked. We said we were planning on it, to which he responded \u201cGreat, that\u2019s what we like.\u201d We felt like this could be fun.\nSoon the smells of homemade garlic bread, savory sauce, meat and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms filled the air. And the pasta was heating up nicely, (thanks to the hot oven). Karen\u2019s colorful salad was coming together complete with two dressings. We grated cheese, shredded basil, dished hot peppers, and piled fruit and cookies high on their plates. Dinner was ready.\n\u201cSomething smells delicious\u201d the first woman commented as she entered the room. \u201cMmmmm, what smells so good?\u201d asked another. Now we knew we were going to have a fun night. The thirteen guests served themselves and commented excitedly when they came to an item they really liked. We dished up our plates too and sat down at the tables to eat and chat with our guests.\nA large screen TV was tuned to the local news. Everyone was interested in the weather. \u201cWhat did you do to beat the 100 degree heat the other day?\u201d I asked my table. \u201cWalked to the park and hung out at the kiddy pool all day,\u201d said one woman. She went on to explain about being able to watch the local forecast, especially in the morning. The women have to leave the shelter at 7 a.m. and cannot return until 6 p.m. so it\u2019s good to be prepared.\n\u201cYou look tired, is it your new medication?\u201d one concerned guest asked another at my table. Yes, she thought it was. The women seemed very concerned about one another and to know each other well. The shelter has no limits on how long a person can stay. And as a result relationships develop.\n\u201cI love mushrooms!\u201d \u201cGood salad!\u201d \u201cThis is really good, thank you.\u201d Everyone was enjoying their meals and there was a lot of going back and forth for seconds\u2026and even thirds. They made sure to let us know what they really enjoyed.\nWe wanted to know what the guests liked to have served, so we asked. \u201cBelieve it or not, hot dogs and hamburgers with all the fixings, you know, a really good hamburger, not like in the fast food restaurants.\u201d \u201cPickles, we love pickles!\u201d \u201cTuna, like in a pasta or rice salad is always good.\u201d \u201cPotato salad always goes over well.\u201d One woman even mentioned venison in white wine. What don\u2019t they want? Almost in unison they exclaimed, \u201cColeslaw, only one of us eats it!\u201d\nAs we cleaned up the kitchen, the women took out their mattresses and bedding. Some went to the lockers for their belongings and tidied up for bed. Some took turns at the telephone. Others lounged on old car seats outside the back door having a smoke and enjoying the beautiful breeze.\nAt the end of the evening many of the women thanked us for a delicious meal. We felt it was a treat not only to serve, but to visit with the guests as well. We had taken part in something very special\u2026and we can\u2019t wait to do it all over again!\nJenny Finden-Watson is the meal coordinator for St. James on the Parkway Episcopal Church in Minneapolis.\nWanda Kanwischer, Assistant Director of Student Life and the Director of Service Learning at Normandale Community College and Normandale Community College\nWanda Kanwischer and Normandale Community College began partnering with Simpson about 10 years ago to provide college students with a service learning experience and to fulfill a need for overnight shelter volunteers.\nService-Learning is an exciting teaching strategy that integrates classroom theory with meaningful community service projects in an effort to enhance curriculum and promote civic responsibility.\u00a0Students engage in activities that benefit their community while developing a connection between classroom instruction and real-life situations.\nWanda has dedicated her time and resources to fostering a relationship with Simpson that is beneficial to both the students and the people Simpson serves. Some of the classes that she has paired with Simpson have been: Drug Use and Abuse, Police and Community, Families in Crisis, Family Communication, Service Learning, American Minorities, and Ethics.\u00c2\nPairing the colleges Criminal Justice academic department with the overnight shelter opportunity has been amazing. Students wishing to pursue careers in criminal justice are required to take the course, \u201cPolice and Community,\u201d which examines the interactions between peace officers with community members, most specifically minorities. \u201cPolice and Community\u201d strongly encourages students to commit to a 55 hour overnight shelter opportunity, thus educating future law enforcement personnel about homelessness and poverty.\nWanda has also organized a group called Hats for the Homeless. Students gather once a week to knit and crochet hats, mittens, and scarves for people experiencing homelessness. There is also a learning component so the students understand how their donations are making an impact. In addition to the Service Learning classes and Hats for the Homeless, she has coordinated many sandwich making events, and has become the person faculty and staff come to when they have donations for Simpson.\nSince we\u2019ve had the ability to track volunteer time in our database, this person and institution has provided Simpson with over 260 overnight volunteers and countless hours of service. Thank you Wanda Kanwischer (pronounced can-wish-er), Assistant Director of Student Life and the Director of Service Learning at Normandale Community College and Normandale Community College\nPhoto: Wanda with Julie Manworren, Simpson Executive Director\nFour decades on the streets: Patrick Wood, longtime advocate and Simpson board member has devoted his life to helping people find home\nOn any given night in Minnesota, 9,200 people are experiencing homelessness. After speaking with Patrick Wood, you get the sense that he has met most of them.\nPatrick has been a long time advocate for people experiencing homelessness. Patrick doesn\u2019t do his work at a desk or a podium. He scales river banks, camps out under bridges, and sits beside the people who are out on the streets. He listens when no one else will and looks into the eyes of those that many choose to avoid.\nThroughout the last 40 years, Patrick has been helping the homeless see that they are a vital part of the community. He helps people see that they are important and they belong.\nPatrick cut his teeth in the late 1960s in Detroit, working at the infamous Eloise Hospital, helping de-institutionalized patients find their way in the community. Patrick began to see people in need of mental health services slipping through the cracks of society.When a friend encouraged him to move to Minneapolis, Patrick thought: \u201cWhy not? I love the cold.\u201d And he knew that there would be people in need of his help wherever he went. Having weathered his own bouts with mental illness, Patrick had a way with people who had trouble fitting into what could be referred to as main stream society.\nLearning the lay of Minneapolis by working as a cab driver, Patrick first stayed in what is commonly referred to as a flop house or transient hotel. \u201cA person grows up by being around grown-ups. These houses were close-knit communities and for $2 a night, you were connected to a guy at the front desk who knew everything,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cNo community is made better by people living under bridges,\u201d asserts Patrick. And throughout the 1980s, Patrick was seeing more and more people making their homes there. \u201cBrilliant, resourceful people were being wasted. What we needed was to build real bridges for them back into community.\u201d\nPatrick was working as a mental health outreach counselor and saw a large chunk of the homeless population being underserved. Patrick had a dream of a clinically-based outreach program to help connect people to available benefits and services. Many in the homeless community were distrustful: Patrick had an in. He knew where they lived and he knew the homeless community gatekeepers who were his entr\u00e9e into deeper levels of the homeless society. He dressed like they did and most importantly, he listened to what they had to say. He allowed them to be, as he puts it, \u201carchitects of their own success.\u201d\nThe roster of people Patrick has helped is endless. Eugene sticks out. A Vietnam vet, \u201cGene\u201d had been on the streets for 25 years, the last 15 in a dumpster behind a Minneapolis warehouse. Patrick\u2019s four-year patience with Gene paid off. He got him connected with his VA benefits and most importantly, convinced him that there was a better life for him. Patrick smiles when he thinks about Gene in his apartment. Sadly, many of the people he has known throughout the years have died.\nPatrick is a quiet, dignified, soft and well-spoken gentleman. He believes that to permanently house people, we must help them see themselves as part of the community and a citizen of this country. \u201cRecent initiatives to register homeless people to vote are a solid start to giving them the voice that is theirs.\u201d\nBen Reed: Volunteering with Simpson has been a life changing experience\nA member of the Simpson Board of Directors and Volunteer Coordinator at Children\u2019s Hospitals and Clinics, Ben Reed was born in Pusan City, South Korea and was adopted at the age of three.\nGrowing up in St. Paul, Ben graduated from Carleton College with a B.A. in Biology. He currently lives in Minneapolis. A passion for the work of non-profits was instilled in Ben at an early age by his parents. \u201cBoth my mom and dad encouraged me to seek out opportunities to help others and taught me that it is my responsibility to do so.\u201d\nBen admits that when he was invited to join the Simpson Board of Directors his knowledge of the issue of homelessness was limited to what the media told him. Determined to change that, Ben jumped in with both feet and began volunteering overnight in the men\u2019s shelter. The experience has changed his life.\n\u201cI wanted to hear from the guys about their lives and experiences. I was hooked after my first shift. The men at the shelter have amazing stories and are some of the most courteous people I have ever met. I encourage anyone who can devote some of their time to seriously think about becoming a volunteer. It is something that I look forward to doing,\u201d Ben says.\nSince volunteering with Simpson, Ben\u2019s passion for ending homelessness has grown. So has his belief that it is possible. \u201cHomelessness is something that can be realistically ended and everyone who works with the issue firmly believes this. Simpson views every individual and family member served as a person worthy of respect. I hear the people who utilize the shelter while they are in transition say that Simpson is the \u201cCadillac\u201d of shelters and from my point of view, Simpson is a leader among organizations who are working to end homelessness.\u201d\nFocus on Margaret Jones\nMargaret Jones learned about Simpson Housing Services in March of 2001 when she and her children needed a place to call their own. A friend told her about the agency and suggested that she call. Margaret called and was lucky enough to get selected in the Family Housing lottery.\nDuring her tenure in the Transitional Housing Program she worked weekly with Janelle Leppa, her Advocate. Margaret worked diligently to finish high school, nurture her children, and earn a living. In September, she exited the program early stating, \u201cI think that someone else now needs this opportunity more than I do.\u201d\nLast fall, Margaret was elected to serve a 3 year term on the Simpson Housing Board of Directors. (Margaret served form 2007\u20132010.) Margaret has a demonstrated passion to help other people, particularly troubled teens and teen parents. She wants to share her life story and experience as a means of providing hope and guidance to young people.\nHer dream is to start a non-profit agency some day. Her advice for parents includes, \u201cPour love into your children rather than telling them that you can\u2019t wait for them to turn 18.

Who&#x2F;what inspired you to create it?", "explanation": null, "document": "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCould you tell who are you, where you live and how old are you?\nI\u2019m Jon Hillier and 17 years old. I mess around with the Internet in spare time, but my passions are art/media and politics. I\u2019m currently living in a small village called Sandwich, in England.\nHow did you become a Simpsons fan?\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed animation, and the Simpsons stood out to me as a kid. My parents bought me one a Bart \"eat-my-shorts\" T-shirt in 1991, and I guess this must have been my first exposure to it. I remember watching my first episode, \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\", after hearing all the hype about it, and realising it was far better than I had expected. I was hooked from there on.\nWhat is your favorite Simpsons episode and why?\nI don\u2019t think any fan could choose just but one, but it would probably be a toss up between Flaming Moe\u2019s or Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment. I\u2019m not totally sure why these two leap out at me, but I certainly would rate these as two of the highest. I like well written storylines, and these two were prime examples of such.\nHow do you see future of The Simpsons?\nI\u2019m optimistic, the show as it is, with such amazing support isn\u2019t going to finish anytime soon. The episodes are slowly improving, so I see no reason why they can\u2019t carry on making us laugh. My one wish for the future is that the writers remain true to the fundamental theme \u2013 an average American family. We\u2019ve had enough of the wacky adventures \u2013 lets leave that to Family Guy.\nYou have website dedicated to Mr. Burns on the net called Serious Burns. Who/what inspired you to create it?\nI\u2019m sure my story is much the same as others. I\u2019d sat and watched the Simpsons for years, so I felt like giving a little back. I had originally intended to create a general Simpsons site, but felt that what could be done, had been done. The website, \"A Burns for all Seasons\" was what originally inspired me to create it. I felt character sites still had a whole lot more to gain, so I set about working on my own. I never expected it to be a long-term project, but four years later, I\u2019m still here.\nAre you a huge Mr. Burns fan?\nOf course, I couldn\u2019t continue running my site if I wasn\u2019t. I love Burns\u2019 old-fashioned approach to the world, his ruthless and self-centred attitude, but also the compassion he occasionally displays. Mr. Burns represents every selfish, bitter old man unashamedly, and that\u2019s why I like him.\nQuick quiz question: What is Mr. Burns favorite lunch?\nI believe that would be a pillow of shredded wheat, steamed toast, and sometimes the occasional Dodo egg.\nYou're current design at Serious Burns is quite clean and doesn't have any flaws on it. How long process is to create good website?\nThanks for the compliment! For me personally, the whole process of creating a design can take several months. I love being able to try something new, if only to impress myself. I\u2019d deem myself a perfectionist, so the majority of my time is spent reworking a basic design until I\u2019m happy with it myself. I\u2019ve seen site after site with the same style, colours and graphics, so I think it\u2019s important that people take their time deciding what they want their site to become. A site won\u2019t get anywhere if it\u2019s indistinguishable from another, so the majority of my time is spent trying to think of unique methods of presenting content differently.\nWhat are your tools for your website?\nThe majority of my designing is done in PSP, but I\u2019ll often transport designs over to Photoshop to fine touch them. For the coding, I just don\u2019t have the time (or patience) to learn html off by heart. So, for the coding\u2026 I confess, I prefer working with Dreamweaver \u2013 it\u2019s just the obvious choice.\nYou have this Burns on Location competition running on your website. Could you tell me more about it?\nThe idea is simple. Visitors print off our poster and take a photo featuring it in a strange, unusual or amusing location. I did it last year, but thought it would be better saved for a latter date. This year, it\u2019s got some rather good prizes as well \u2013 mostly Simpsons toys, books and CD\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the winner\u2019s choice of which they want to take. If you haven\u2019t entered yet, make sure you do!\nWhat do you think about today's simp-sites on the net?\nPeople always take sites for granted \u2013 so whilst the sites are around, we complain about them, but when they go, we complain that they\u2019re gone. On the most part though, I think there\u2019s a lot of potential. We\u2019re in the phase where some of the guys are a lot older, and their sites are disappearing with them, opening the space up for younger talents. Personally, I think today\u2019s sites could do with a real boost in individuality. If you\u2019re thinking about starting your own website, for god\u2019s sake, be original, strive to be different!\nDo you have any favorites?\nThe folder of course! Other than that I\u2019m a big fan of Springfield Weekly, Simpson Crazy and Eye on Sprinfield.\nWhat about worst Simpsons site you have visited. Are there any?\nOoh, cruel! I shouldn\u2019t name names, that\u2019s unfair, but basically I base my feelings on first impressions. Any site that\u2019s untidy needs sorting out \u2013 I consider it a sin to own a cluttered website. Oh, and contrary to popular belief, I kind of like cloud backgrounds.\nAny defunct Simpson's site you miss?\nNew Springfield. It was simply superior to the majority of sites out there, in both content and design. Further back, I enjoyed visiting the Simpsons Sourcebook.\nHow do you see future of the simpsons community?\nThe community will exist for as long as The Simpsons does. Hell, it\u2019ll go on long after it. I can\u2019t predict the future, but I hope there\u2019ll be a few more big-time legendary sites. We\u2019ve had a few of them (Evergreen Terrace etc\u2026), so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s time for another.\nName 3 people from the community that you could also meet in real life.\nAlex S, Jouni and Jon Levin.\nDescribe your desktop. What do you see around your computer?\nSheesh, it\u2019s a real mess. Let\u2019s see\u2026 several cans of Coca-Cola, many music CD\u2019s, and of course a dying pot plant.\nAny final comments?\n"}, {"score": 971.48724, "uuid": "7c9a2814-49c3-5088-be9d-4d9ba6885286", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1212wb-35-09949", "target_hostname": "www.insomniacmania.com", "target_uri": "http://www.insomniacmania.com/node/12221", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Simpsons</em> Movie | Insomniac Mania", "snippet": "I guess it&#x27;s <em>better</em> that King of <em>the</em> Hill got renewed because it&#x27;s around as long <em>or</em> so as South park and it&#x27;s an ok show.

And the \"cast\" is ok I mean Dan Castellenata voiced\non two cool videogames Metal Arms and Kingdom Hearts, but beside that he has'nt really done much. Nancy Cartwright is ok but there are way better voice actresses above like even Kath Soucie and Tress MacNellie. I'm really\nnot that thrilled about a movie and not really looking forward to it. I guess it's\nbetter that King of the Hill got renewed because it's around as long or so as South park and it's an ok show.\nLog in or register to post comments\nPermalink Submitted by ScottC on Sun, 04/02/2006 - 15:11\nA teaser trailer has emerged for the movie, which parodies Superman.\nIt begins with a big S shield, then an annoucer talks about one of the greatest american heroes coming to the big screen. The camera then pans back from the s, which is worn by Homer on a shirt, whilst he's sitting on the couch in his underwear. He then says:\n\"I forgot what I'm supposed to say...\"\nTrailer then ends with \"The Simpsons Movie...Coming July 27th 2007\".\nSo it's now official, we will see the movie in just over a year. I only hope that they really invest in this movies script. I hate to ay it but most of the episodes from Season 10 onwards just weren't funny.\nThe proof lies in the fact that I have seen episodes from the first 10 years repeated countless times, and still enjoyed them, yet most of the new ones, I will see once, and probably instantly forget, or just sigh at their attempt to inject humour.\nAs long as this movie has a humourous scene involving Superintendent Chalmers shouting \"Skkkkiiiiiiinneer!\" at some amusing predicament the Principle has placed him in, then I'll be happy.\nLog in or register to post comments\nPermalink Submitted by Zeuss101 on Mon, 04/03/2006 - 22:51\nThis is gonna be some sweet shit!!!

I sure hope that this scene isn't actually in the movie, because if it was, then it is a waste of ink.\nThe whole scene relies on slapstick, and the end pay off is that Homer falls through the roof of his house!?!\nAnyway trust me when I say I think the writers have really run out of ideas. Everything I have seen so far makes me believe this movie is going to be in the style of all the subpar seasons we have seen in the last eight years, and not the timeless quality of the first ten or so seasons.\nWhatever happened to the time when The Simpsons was a laugh a minute and actually had some clever satricial jokes that poked fun at all angles of popular culture, instead of relying on stupid slapstick, and Homer constantly being a dumbass!\nLog in or register to post comments\nPermalink Submitted by ScottC on Mon, 02/19/2007 - 12:58\nAnother new trailer with more disappointing humour. Maybe they're just putting all the crap in these trailers and saving the good stuff for the movie, but I doubt it.\nThe only good thing about this trailer is that it appears they are trying to give the movie a somewhat epic storyline that has worldwide consequences, but I still have a bad feeling that most of the comedy scenes will not make me laugh.\nWhat hope is there when the newest trailer ends with Homer blowing rasberries on a pig, and doing his trademark strangle on bart and delivering one of the worst lines I have heard in the shows history!\nLog in or register to post comments\nPermalink Submitted by deadwiz on Wed, 02/21/2007 - 03:52\nYeah, Looks pretty bland to me, but I will still go watch it.\nLog in or register to post comments\nPermalink Submitted by xtremekornfreak on Wed, 02/21/2007 - 07:14\n[quote=\"deadwiz\"]I've lost interest in The Simpsons, Haven't really watched it in a long time.

It simply got too repetative with the jokes and the jokes simply weren't funny anymore. I still understand the appeal for it, but Its just not for me anymore. The same goes for family guy. The first couple of seasons were good, and then I got bored with the show and its set up.\nAs for a simpson's movie, I'm sure its gunna do insanely well at the box office and will probably lead to a slough of sequels and spin offs. I though have no real interest in the movie. I might see it if I get dragged in with friends.

There is little in the way of precedent for Family Guy's amazing resurrection-- Star Trek came back, but with a new cast and concept. The two major driving forces behind Family Guy's unlikely return from the \"Isle of the Dead TV Series,\" are the possibility of syndication and the profitability of DVD sales. The Family Guy First Season DVD sold an amazing 2.2 million units, but profits from DVDs alone are not enough to fuel production of a major animated series, not even with the fees the show will receive from the Cartoon Network, which plans to start showing the new Family Guy episodes in early 2005. The deciding factor behind the revival of the Family Guy was the possibility of off-net syndication, which typically requires that a series have at least 100 episodes (Fox produced 50 episodes in the show's first three seasons). Even with potential DVD profits, Cartoon Network licensing fees, and the potential of syndication, Fox only agreed to resume production if the budget for the show was cut by 10%.\nThere is a fair amount of Family Guy merchandise available including two DVD collections, posters, t-shirts, and hats. The production of new episodes could stimulate the creation of additional tie-in merchandise.\nFuturama, another prematurely cancelled animated series, which follows Family Guy on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, has also done well on DVD, but Futurama's production costs were even higher than Family Guy's (and it showed on the screen, the animation was much better), making its comeback more unlikely. But if Fox is able to place the new episodes of Family Guy on a broadcast network before they go to cable (as its deal with the Cartoon Network allows) who knows?\nI'm very excited about Family Guy coming back. I'm glad to hear that Futurama's DVDs are having high sales as well, and it would be fantastic ig that show was also resurrected.\nShare this Page:\n"}, {"score": 955.43335, "uuid": "1fb48af6-0614-516d-ae8b-fd4d203bd358", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200wb-36-10805", "target_hostname": "www.hurm.com", "target_uri": "http://www.hurm.com/news/archives/2003/11/family_guy_retu.php", "page_rank": 1.1948064e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Hurm News Archives: \u0093<em>Family</em> <em>Guy</em>\u0094 Returns to TV?", "snippet": "<em>The</em> next post in this blog <em>is</em> \u0093<em>The</em> Year in Books 2003: Comics\u0094.

Apparantly, the renewed interest in this cartoon has inspired more than just the one-time reprise.\nUSA Today reports that Family Guy may actually return for a new season in January 2005.\nHere's the whole article:\nBy Gary Levin, USA TODAY\nPosted 11/18/2003 8:30 PM, Updated 11/18/2003 8:30 PM\nIn a sign of the growing importance of DVD sales to Hollywood, 20th Century Fox is considering a plan to resume production of Family Guy, a sometimes crude animated comedy that the Fox network took off the air more than 18 months ago.\nAs many as 35 new episodes could return in January 2005, marking the first time that a canceled series has been revived based on strong DVD demand and ratings in syndication.\nFox Television Entertainment Group chairman Sandy Grushow said a decision is expected soon and called the series a late-blooming phenomenon that may have aired before its time.\nA DVD set of the show's first 28 episodes released in April has sold nearly 1 million copies, making it this year's top-selling TV show and the No. 4 television title ever, according to Video Store magazine. A second collection, of 22 episodes, has sold 520,000 copies. And the series is Cartoon Network's most popular among adults.\nFamily Guy premiered with a big audience \u0097 22 million viewers \u0097 and some controversy after Fox's 1999 Super Bowl telecast. In the pilot episode, Stewie, a talking toddler with a clipped British accent, was openly contemptuous of his loutish dad and bent on killing his sweet-natured mother in a quest for world domination.\nCreator Seth MacFarlane, then 24, wrote scripts, drew characters, provided voices and infused the show with rapid-fire sight gags, a nod to The Simpsons. But ratings faded, and the show ended with a whimper early last year.\nThe relatively short network run may have helped DVD sales, Video Store's Judith McCourt says. \"It really speaks to something that had a following, was cut off network TV, and people said, 'What did I miss?' \"\nDVD and cable viewers have \"created kind of a groundswell that could lead to better ratings\" on Fox, Grushow says, although new episodes could end up going directly to Cartoon Network.\nA decision to restart the show suggests a reversal from the old TV business model, in which a network hit predicts a profit windfall in syndication. This time, the promise of DVD and syndication gold could justify a show's return even if low network ratings didn't.\nBut canceled favorites aren't likely to rise from the grave en masse. Family Guy has one major advantage: With no actors and no sets, it can simply be drawn back into existence.\nShare this Page:\n"}], [{"score": 953.3762, "uuid": "77219fc9-ebef-5da4-b57a-608a759d273a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-19-32059", "target_hostname": "www.snpp.org", "target_uri": "http://www.snpp.org/guides/capfaq.html", "page_rank": 1.1797108e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Simpsons</em> Archive: Episode Capsule FAQ", "snippet": "<em>The</em> best way to help <em>is</em> to keep pointing out <em>the</em> jokes that other people might have missed.

Simpson. But equally important, this chapter touches on another \u0093problem,\u0094 namely that by the time they went to trial, both the investigators and the prosecutors, probably, knew that O.J. was innocent and that a police officer \u0096 most likely Detective Mark Fuhrman \u0096 was the murderer.\nThe best way to briefly introduce you to this theory, is to refer to the inside and outside rear cover of my book. [Quote]:\nO.J. did not kill Nicole and Ron!\nWhen properly scrutinized, not a single piece of evidence implicates O.J.\nPolice investigators lied and covered up! Evidence was mishandled and contaminated! Evidence disappeared! Evidence was fabricated!\nNo eyewitnesses \u0096 fingerprints \u0096 murder weapon \u0096 bloody clothes \u0096 or bloody shoes! No motive! And not enough time!\nThe \u0093M.O.\u0094 didn\u0092t fit! The gloves didn\u0092t fit! And how could O.J. have killed two strong, healthy people simultaneously, with a knife, without any of them screaming for help?\nAgainst such astounding facts and contradictions, how can anyone claim that O.J. killed Nicole and Ron?\nThe LAPD did not solve this murder case. This book does!\nA central part of the murderers\u0092 plot was not just to frame O.J., but to \u0093set up\u0094 the investigators to complete the framing \u0096 with evidence the murderers did not have access to. That nailed O.J. But it also nailed the investigators \u0096 so they could never, later, pursue the real killers.\nBy the time Detective Vannatter realized he was \u0093set up\u0094 \u0096 it was too late! He had to continue pursuing O.J. \u0096 not to solve a murder case, at this point, but \u0096 to cover himself! The LAPD\u0092s \u0093code of silence\u0094 which protected Vannatter and his colleagues \u0096 also protected the murderers!\nThis theory is supported by overwhelming, new (and suppressed) evidence \u0096 much of it uncovered after the two trials.\n\u0093Solving the Simpson Murder Mystery\u0094 \u0096 does what the title suggests. Logically and convincingly this book demonstrates how all the evidence \u0096 also the blood and the Bruno Magli shoes \u0096 point to the same person \u0096 and he is not O.J.! [End of quote]\nIt is my contention that Mark Fuhrman was directly involved in the murders of Nicole and Ron. But Fuhrman set up the investigators, Vannatter in particular, so cleverly, that by the time Vannatter realized that O.J. was innocent, Vannatter could not admit it and pursue the real killer(s), without exposing the blood evidence fabrication he had already orchestrated. Vannatter could be facing 20 years in prison for evidence fabrication.\nEventually, also the prosecutors were informed about this situation. And they all decided to sacrifice O.J. and cover for Detective Fuhrman \u0096 not out of sympathy with Fuhrman, by any means, but in order to protect themselves and cover up, perhaps the greatest scandal in our nation\u0092s jurisprudence and to avoid, possibly, the worst riot since the Civil War!\nNow, you know my overall theory about the Simpson case: Fuhrman was directly involved in the killings and had \u0093set up\u0094 both O.J. and the investigators. Detective Vannatter had swallowed Fuhrman\u0092s \u0093bait\u0094 and, irreversibly, fabricated false blood evidence against O.J. Eventually the prosecutors knew it, too. From then on, they all decided to sacrifice the African-American \u0093wife beater,\u0094 O.J. Simpson, rather than their own and their colleagues\u0092 careers and futures.\nRealizing, also, that the truth about the Simpson case would totally destroy whatever little credibility and respect the LAPD had left, and almost certainly ignite another riot that would make the Rodney King riot seem like a high school football skirmish in comparison, Prosecutor Marcia Clark, Detective Vannatter, and their colleagues found plenty of reasons to justify their despicable actions!\nFollowing this introduction, the up-coming sample chapter \u0096 although taken out of context \u0096 may be more easily understood. However, don\u0092t form your opinion about the Simpson case based on this chapter alone! There is overwhelming evidence \u0096 much of it never before publicized \u0096 to support my theory. More specifically, my theory is corroborated by 54 chapters and some seven hundred pages full of evidence. Also included are 12 original illustrations depicting how Nicole and Ron were murdered \u0096 not according to the prosecution\u0092s absurd theory, but according to what the evidence tells us!\nIf you want to know the truth about the Simpson case \u0096 not the misinformation, the desinformation and the cover-ups the investigators and the prosecutors present us with in their books \u0096 then, instead, read my book, \u0093Solving the Simpson Murder Mystery\u0094!\nChristopher Springer\nCHAPTER 19\nMark Fuhrman\u0092s \"Alibi\"\nAt the time of the criminal trial, Detective Mark Fuhrman was never required to provide an alibi for the night of the murders, because he was never a murder suspect.\nAccording to Fuhrman himself, however, he attended a \"Protective League\" seminar at the La Quinta resort near Palm Desert, CA, because he was a delegate in the Protective League. Palm Desert is about a 2 1/2 hours drive from Detective Fuhrman\u0092s former home in Thousand Oaks, Los Angeles, and a bit shorter distance from Brentwood, where both Nicole and O.J. lived. Brentwood, again, is about 15 minutes from Fuhrman\u0092s L.A. home.\nLet me quote a passage from Detective Fuhrman\u0092s direct testimony during the criminal trial. Prosecutor Marcia Clark questioned Fuhrman about the night of the murders [the \"highlighting\" is done by me].\nMs. Clark: On the evening of June 12, 1994, at approximately 8:00 pm, where were you?\nFuhrman: At approximately 8:00 pm, I was in \u0096 east of Palm Desert, in La Quinta Resort, at a Protective League seminar.\nMs. Clark: Was that a police officers\u0092 function, Sir?\nFuhrman: Yes. I am a delegate in the Protective League \u0096 or was at that time.\nMs. Clark: Okay. And what time did you leave?\nFuhrman: I believe I left somewhere around 8:00 o\u0092clock, just as the barbecue was starting.\nMs. Clark: And you left \u0096 when you left, you drove where?\nFuhrman: I drove to my home.\nMs. Clark: Remember what time you got home, Sir?\nFuhrman: About \u0096 about 10:30.\nMs. Clark: And was anyone home when you got there?\nFuhrman: My wife.\nMs. Clark: What time did you go to bed?\nFuhrman: I believe about 11:00, maybe a little later.\nMs. Clark: Did you receive a call at some point that night?\nFuhrman: Yes, I did.\nMs. Clark: After you went to bed?\nFuhrman: Excuse me? \u0096 Yes I did.\nMs. Clark: And what time did you get that call?\nFuhrman: At 1:05 in the morning.\nMs. Clark: Did it wake you up?\nFuhrman: Yes.\nMs. Clark: And what were you told in that call?\nFuhrman: I was told by my supervisor, the homicide coordinator, Detective Ron Phillips, that we had a double homicide, and it was at 875 South Bundy, and that I would meet him at the station, and we would get a vehicle with a homicide kit and go out to the scene from there.\nMs. Clark: Were you told anything about the identity of either victim?\nFuhrman: Yes. Detective Phillips said that the female victim might be the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson.[End of Quote].\nFuhrman, allegedly, came home about 10:30 pm, went to bed a\nlittle after 11:00 pm, and was awakened, about 1:05 am, by a call from his supervisor, Detective Ronald Phillips. Together they drove to the murder scene at Bundy.\nThat is Fuhrman\u0092s alibi. As a matter of fact, as Fuhrman\u0092s \"alibi\" appears, it is not much different from O.J.\u0092s \u0096 except for Fuhrman\u0092s wife possibly supporting his alibi \u0096 should that ever become necessary!\nAfter Detective Phillips had called Fuhrman, they agreed to meet at a police station in West Los Angeles, where they picked up a police car with a homicide kit. Eventually they arrived at Bundy about 2:10 am.\nThere are several things that bother me regarding Detective Mark Fuhrman\u0092s alibi.\nAs close as I recall it, Detective Phillips testified that before Fuhrman left for the seminar that weekend, he had said (in essence):\nIf something comes up Sunday night, then don\u0092t call me until after one o\u0092clock, because I won\u0092t be home until then!\nDetective Phillips complied, so although the watch commander, Sgt. David Rossi was notified about the murders at 11:50 pm\n\u0096 nobody called Detective Fuhrman until 1:05 am.\nAt 12:10 am, Sgt. Rossi called Sgt. Robert Riski, who was in a patrol car. Sgt. Riske drove to the murder scene where he arrived at about 12:17.\nAccording to Detective Phillips, Sgt. Rossi did not call him until 12:55 am. Allegedly, Phillips, in turn, called someone else first, and then Detective Fuhrman at 1:05 am.\nNone of this makes any sense to me. I doubt that this is what happened at all. In the case of a double homicide, of course, time is essential. The police stand a much better chance of catching the killer if they can get to the murder scene immediately. For all they know, the murderer could have lost his ID at the murder scene, or an eyewitness could perhaps identify the murderer.\nSgt. Rossi, and Detective Phillips couldn\u0092t know what they would find at the murder scene. Perhaps the murderer was on his way to the Mexican border or to the airport, already! Besides, what could be more important that night than a double homicide?\nOf course, the watch commander, can get dispatched through to Sgt. Riske\u0092s patrol car immediately. Sgt. Riske should have been on his way to Bundy within one minute.\nYet, Sgt. Rossi, allegedly, did not call anyone who could respond to the murder scene, for 20 minutes. Do you believe that!\nNext problem: Detective Phillips, the homicide coordinator on stand by duty that night, should be notified immediately \u0096 also within a minute or two, or perhaps three, at the most! Yet, according to Detective Phillips, he was not notified until 12:55 am \u0096 one hour and five minutes after Sgt. Rossi was notified of the murders! What is going on here?\nPhillips then, knowing that Detective Fuhrman would not be home until after 1:00 am, called some other detectives first. Then, at 1:05 am, he called Fuhrman at home.\nBy the time of the criminal trial, I think both the investigators, the prosecutors and the rest of the DA\u0092s office knew that Fuhrman was the murderer. I shall soon pick Fuhrman\u0092s alibi apart, and justify that Prosecutor Marcia Clark knew that Fuhrman was committing perjury with respect to the alibi Ms. Clark helped him concoct during his testimony.\nSomehow, the first priority was to protect Detective Fuhrman! They all knew he was the murderer, but they could not allow the scandal to become public. Hence, to explain why Detective Phillips, allegedly, did not call Fuhrman until 1:05am, I think the LAPD on orders from the prosecutors, \"fixed\" the telephone records to make it appear that Sgt. Rossi \u0096 rather than Phillips or Fuhrman \u0096 was the one who messed up and didn\u0092t call Phillips or Fuhrman until one full hour after Rossi was notified about the murders.\nThere are some indications that \"something\" went on during those first 65 minutes. The prosecutors blacked out several phone calls on the official phone records. Did Sgt. Rossi, or Detective Phillips call Fuhrman much earlier, but learn that he was not home?\nAfter eventually calling Fuhrman at home, Detective Phillips called another number. Phillips himself said he just dialed the \"wrong number.\" Yet, the prosecution would never release that \"wrong number.\" Why not?\nCould it be that Phillips called Fuhrman at home before 1:05 am, but nobody answered, because Fuhrman was out, disposing of the murder clothes and shoes \u0096 or planting evidence at Rockingham? So then Phillips had to call Fuhrman on his mobil phone?\nOf course by the time we got around to the trial, the investigators and the prosecutors had to hide the fact that Fuhrman was not at home on the night of the murders. So the prosecution blacked out phone calls that could expose this?\nConsidering that Fuhrman, allegedly, came home about 10:30 pm, the murders were reported at 11:50 pm, and the first police officers arrived at Bundy at 12:17 am \u0096 I find it strange that Fuhrman didn\u0092t call his supervisor, Detective Phillips \u0096 as well as his watch commander, Sgt. Rossi \u0096 as soon as he got home, to inform them that he got home earlier than expected, and was back on stand-by duty.\nDid Fuhrman want to emphasize that he would be out of town until after 1:00 am, because he actually had decided to murder Nicole at 10:30 pm and fabricate a false alibi?\nDid Fuhrman instruct his supervisor not to call him until after 1:00 am, because he didn\u0092t want anyone to call him and find out that he wasn\u0092t home until, say 11:40 pm \u0096 although he allegedly left the seminar at La Quinta around 8:00 pm?\nDid detective Fuhrman \"anticipate\" that \"something\" would come up that night, and which he eventually would have to investigate? Or did Fuhrman, perhaps, know that something would come up?\nDid Fuhrman know that he was going to kill Nicole that night? Is that why he didn\u0092t want to be called at home before one o\u0092clock?\nSuppose Fuhrman is the murderer! He wanted to establish a false alibi (in case he should ever become a suspect) \u0096 if necessary using his wife\u0092s testimony that he came home at 10:30 \u0096 while he in fact were out murdering Nicole and Ron, and trying to plant one of the murder gloves on O.J.\u0092s property, or getting rid of his bloody shoes, clothes, and knife \u0096 and didn\u0092t come home until, say 11:40 pm.\nAgain, suppose Fuhrman is the murderer. What if the bodies of Nicole and Ron had been discovered by a neighbor \u0096 just minutes after the murders \u0096 say about 11:00 pm? If so, normally, the police would have been alerted, someone would have called the homicide coordinator, Detective Phillips, and Phillips would have called Fuhrman at 11:05, while Fuhrman, perhaps, was still on his way home from O.J.\u0092s Rockingham estate [where he tried to plant the glove] or from some other place where he had dumped the clothes, the shoes, and the knife!\nSomeone had to answer the phone, so Mrs. Fuhrman would pick it up. Phillips would ask for Fuhrman, and Mrs. Fuhrman would have to inform Phillips that her husband wasn\u0092t home from La Quinta yet!\nHowever, the other seminar participants would later testify to when Fuhrman left the seminar. So Fuhrman should have been home before 10:30 even! Fuhrman\u0092s alibi goes down the drain!\nHowever, if no one calls Fuhrman, and Mrs. Fuhrman agrees to back up Fuhrman\u0092s alibi, Fuhrman can claim that he got home at 10:30 pm \u0096 even if he didn\u0092t come home until 11:40!\nIt doesn\u0092t make sense that Fuhrman should tell Phillips \u0096 and perhaps Sgt. Rossi \u0096 not to call him at all, until after 1:00 am.\nAnd it doesn\u0092t make sense, either, that his instruction to Phillips and Rossi, about not calling him, was so \"strict\" that neither of them even tried to call Fuhrman, just to check if Fuhrman, perhaps, might have gotten home earlier than expected!\nLet\u0092s assume, hypothetically, that something very important came up \u0096 like someone detonating a bomb \u0096 and causing multiple casualties \u0096 in an apartment building in Fuhrman\u0092s police district, or perhaps even in the police station itself \u0096 at, say about 11:55 pm!\nWhat\u0092s wrong with Phillips \u0096 or Sgt. Rossi \u0096 calling Fuhrman, say about midnight, just in case Fuhrman happened to walk in the door exactly at that time?\nOr why couldn\u0092t Phillips \u0096 or Rossi \u0096 have called at 12:05 am, just to leave a message with Mrs. Fuhrman, that Fuhrman should call Phillips \u0096 or the watch commander \u0096 as soon as he got home from La Quinta? That way Fuhrman wouldn\u0092t have to be woken up again at 1:05 am, either!\nDetective Phillips, the homicide coordinator, or Sgt. Rossi,\nthe watch commander \u0096 or both of them \u0096 were sitting on their \"behinds\" \u0096 waiting for 75 minutes \u0096 before any of them even tried to give Detective Fuhrman a call! If we can believe them.\nWhat if Fuhrman had gotten \"indisposed\" at La Quinta, so that someone would have had to substitute for him? Things like that happen, you know. If so \u0096 because Rossi or Phillips did not even try to call Fuhrman \u0096 the police would have wasted more than an hour of valuable investigation time!\nFuhrman\u0092s and Phillips\u0092 \"story\" doesn\u0092t make sense \u0096 not by a long shot! There is something wrong with Detective Fuhrman\u0092s so-called \"alibi\" (\u0096 and you shall soon learn what it is)!\nDo you see? There is something \"fishy\" about Fuhrman\u0092s instruction to Phillips (and perhaps, also to Sgt. Rossi):\nIf something comes up tonight, then don\u0092t call me until after 1:00 am, because I won\u0092t be home until then!\nAnd there is something just as \"fishy\" about the fact that Detective Phillips \u0096 and Sgt. Rossi \u0096 did not even try to call Fuhrman before 1:05 am \u0096 just to check if he, perhaps, had come home earlier than expected! After all, they had a celebrity double homicide on their hands!\nAllow me to gloat \u0096 just a little! Back in 1995, I did not know what alibi Detective Fuhrman, eventually, would come up with during his direct testimony in the criminal trial \u0096 or if he would even come up with an alibi. He was, after all, not a murder suspect, so he did not need to present an alibi if no one questioned him about it. I was too busy the day Fuhrman testified, so I did not even watch his testimony. I totally missed it \u0096 something that will become evident when you read my quote below.\nHowever, I felt, so certain about my theory of Detective Mark Fuhrman being directly involved in the murders of Nicole and Ron, that I wrote, already then, in my first book, titled \"If O.J. Didn\u0092t ...\" (Chapter 15, \"Framing O.J.\"; page 95). Quote:\n\"Regardless of what alibi Fuhrman may come up with, he was out prior to one o\u0092clock on the night of the murders. What time he left his home, where he went, what he did, and who saw him during that night, ought to be subject to scrutiny, just as O.J.\u0092s alibi was.\nAlibis may be manufactured! So even if Detective Fuhrman arguably spoke in front of 1,500 people at an out-of-state churchgoers\u0092 convention, between 10:30 and 11:00 o\u0092clock on the night of June 12, 1994, his alibi ought to be checked and rechecked, together with whoever supported it.\" [End of quote].\nAs you have just learned \u0096 although there was no need for him to do it \u0096 Fuhrman did present an alibi during his direct testimony for Prosecutor Marcia Clark, March 10, 1995.\nSubstitute \"1,500 people at an out-of state churchgoers\u0092 convention\" (as I prophesized in my first book) with \"a couple of hundred people at an out-of-town police officers\u0092 convention\" (at La Quinta) \u0096 and I predicted Mark Fuhrman\u0092s actions \u0096 or his false alibi, rather \u0096 almost as if I were psychic! That will become evident once you read on.\nThere is more, regarding Fuhrman\u0092s alibi. First of all, if it took Fuhrman from 8:00 to 10:30 pm to drive from La Quinta to his home in Los Angeles, and assuming he was driving at the legal speed limit, 55 mi/hr in 1994, he could have been at Bundy as early as 9:30 pm, if he had put a portable flashing red light on the roof of his car and gone 90 mi/hr instead!\n90 mi/hr is not fast at all for a police car with a flashing red light. Many ordinary motorists, even, go 90 mi/hr on the same interstates today.\nRegardless of when he actually got home, Fuhrman could have had plenty of time to murder Nicole and Ron around 10:30 pm. He could even have had time to stop by Nicole\u0092s home around 9:30-10:00 pm to make sure she was home, and that she would be alone later that night!\nOne more thing. Isn\u0092t it \"convenient\" that the only person who\ncould corroborate, or destroy, Fuhrman\u0092s alibi, was Mrs. Fuhrman \u0096 who could never be subpoenaed to testify against her husband, if she refused to?!\nNothing wrong said about Mrs. Fuhrman. I never met her, and know nothing about her. I am just philosophizing at this point.\nIt takes a special kind of woman to be married to a man like Fuhrman. Go back to your \"book mark\" (if you left one), where I discussed \"The Fuhrman Tapes\"!\nHere is a man who uses the foulest of language \u0096 despises women in general \u0096 is the Grand Marshal of MAW ( Men Against Women) \u0096 is a racist \u0096 advocates genocide \u0096 hates interracial couples \u0096 is a brutal sadist \u0096 didn\u0092t hesitate to grab a young girl by her hair \u0096 put a gun to her head \u0096 called her a bitch \u0096 threatened to kill her \u0096 and threw her down the stairs, just because she happened to live in the same building as four suspects! And he is a neo-Nazi who celebrates Hitler\u0092s birthday as a holiday!\nI would guess that Fuhrman\u0092s wife either shares her husband\u0092s Nazi philosophies, his hatred for blacks and for interracial couples, and that she loves him very much \u0096 or that she is totally dominated by her husband, to the point where she dares not oppose him or have an opinion of her own. Accordingly, I don\u0092t rule out the possibility that Fuhrman\u0092s wife would be willing to support a false alibi for her husband \u0096 if necessary.\nLet\u0092s go back to the seminar! It didn\u0092t make sense that Fuhrman,\nas a delegate, left before the rest of the participants. Furthermore, it was a weekend seminar. So for two days they had discussed all the \"boring stuff.\" Then \u0096 according to Fuhrman \u0096 about 8:00 pm on Sunday night, the \"serious\" part of the seminar was over. It was time to relax, socialize, have some fun, and get something good to eat from the barbecue.\nBut what did Fuhrman do? He said \u0096 if we can believe him:\nThe heck with hamburgers and chicken legs! I am out of here!\nThen he jumped in his car, and headed for Los Angeles! Did that make sense? Of course not! But now listen to this!\nFuhrman used the barbecue as a \"time clock\" for when \u0096 and an excuse for why \u0096 he left the seminar at 8:00 pm, in time to reach Los Angeles and his home at 10:30 pm.\nHowever, the \"barbecue\" was not on Sunday \u0096 as Fuhrman testified to! It was on Saturday!\nFurthermore, on the night of the murders \u0096 when Detective Fuhrman allegedly left the seminar to drive to Los Angeles at 8:00 pm \u0096 there was not, even, any seminar!\nSteven Worth, co-author \u0096 with Carl Jaspers \u0096 of the book, \"Blood Oath\" [Rainbow Books, Inc.; Highland City, FL] have researched Fuhrman\u0092s so-called \"alibi\" for the time of the murders. According to Mr. Worth, three participants at that seminar have confirmed that the itinerary for the seminar on Saturday, June 11, and Sunday, June 12, was as follows.\nSaturday June 11: The seminar lasted till 3-4:00 pm. Then there was an afternoon break. At seven o\u0092clock in the evening there was a reception at the tennis court, and at eight o\u0092clock in the evening there was a barbecue dinner.\nSunday June 12: The seminar had a morning session from 8:00 am, till 11:00 am \u0096 which marked the end of the seminar. The paricipants at the seminar checked out from the hotel before noon. There was no seminar \u0096 and certainly no barbecue \u0096 Sunday evening!\n\u0096 Why did Fuhrman lie about the barbecue?\n\u0096 Did Fuhrman \"move\" the barbecue to Sunday, in order to make it more \"edible\" that he left La Quinta at 8:00 pm on the night of the murders?\n\u0096 Did Fuhrman lie about the barbecue to cover up the fact that he wasn\u0092t in La Quinta at all on the evening of the murders?\nCould Fuhrman have confused the two seminar days \u0096 Saturday and Sunday? Did he perhaps drive home after the barbecue on Saturday night \u0096 and just get his days mixed up during his testimony, thinking that the barbecue was on Sunday.\nNo chance! First of all, if he had any doubts, he should have checked with the organizers of the seminar, to make sure he was telling the truth during his sworn testimony. And if he didn\u0092t think of doing that, Prosecutor Clark should have thought about it when she prepared Fuhrman for his testimony!\nBesides, if Fuhrman drove home after the barbecue (on Saturday) he must have planned to get up again at 4:30 am on Sunday, to drive back for the morning session of the seminar on Sunday!\nFuhrman may \u0096 perceivably \u0096 have forgotten that the barbecue was on Saturday instead of Sunday. But he would not have forgotten it, if he drove home Saturday night, requiring him to get up at 4:30 am Sunday morning \u0096 to drive back to La Quinta for the Sunday morning session from 8-11:00 am.\nBy the way it sounds correct that the seminar ended after the morning session at 11:00 am on Sunday. That is normal for such weekend seminars. It gives the delegates time to check out before noon, so they don\u0092t have to pay for an extra night at the hotel.\nIt is hard to prove today, about three years after the murders,\nwhether Furman\u0092s \"alternative\" alibi holds up or not. But I can say this:\nIn my opinion, Fuhrman has less of an alibi than O.J.! Besides, Fuhrman lied about his alibi in court!\nI shall return to Fuhrman\u0092s busted alibi later in this chapter. But first, it is time to say something about Prosecutor Marcia Clark.\nI have earlier claimed that both the investigators and the prosecutors knew that O.J. was innocent, and that Mark Fuhrman, most likely, is the killer. However \u0096 for various reasons \u0096 they had to cover it up. My allegation will be corroborated later. But here is an \"aperitif.\"\nAs a prosecutor, sometimes, you don\u0092t know what to expect from a hostile witness. But \"the first rule in the book,\" for a prosecutor about to examine his or her own witness, is that you prepare your own witness \u0096 so that you never risk asking a question you don\u0092t know the answer to.\nIndisputably, Prosecutor Clark must have gone over her questions with Detective Fuhrman in advance. The questions and answers clearly indicated that she had.\nWith all the suspect \"baggage\" Fuhrman carried at that time \u0096 being accused of having planted the Rockingham glove and the blood in the Bronco, being accused of racism and of having used the \"N-word,\" etc. \u0096 Prosecutor Clark must have checked out Fuhrman\u0092s information about the seminar.\nImagine the scandal, if Fuhrman, for instance, hypothetically, had lied about even being at the seminar, to cover up that he were having an affair \u0096 and that had surfaced later!\nObviously, Prosecutor Marcia Clark must have checked out Fuhrman\u0092s answers. Hence, the prosecutor must have known that Detective Fuhrman lied! All it took for Prosecutor Clark to establish that, was a phone call to someone in the \"Protective League.\" As I said then, and will repeat on several occasions in my book:\nAt the time of the trial, the prosecution knew that O.J. was innocent \u0096 and that Fuhrman was lying about almost everything. They must have known!\nHowever \u0096 forget for a while the fact that Fuhrman was lying! Far more interesting is the question: Why was Fuhrman lying?\nRemember, at that time, Fuhrman was only suspected of having planted the Rockingham glove behind O.J.\u0092s house, at 6:15 am! He certainly didn\u0092t need a false alibi for the time of the murders, around 10:35-10:45 pm (and perhaps, for a subsequent trip to Rockingham, in an effort to plant the glove, and then home, by around 11:15 pm) \u0096 to prove that he didn\u0092t plant the glove behind O.J.\u0092s house eight hours later!\nFuhrman only needed a false alibi for 10:30-11:15 pm \u0096 if he actually is the killer, and he didn\u0092t want anyone, to even begin, to suspect him!\nLet us, therefore, continue to scrutinize Detective Fuhrman\u0092s alibi, as well as public statements he and his wife have made.\nOn \"Rivera Live,\" sometime after the preliminary hearings in 1994, someone accused Detective Fuhrman of having planted the Rockingham glove behind O.J.\u0092s house. I didn\u0092t watch that particular program, but one of my sources have informed me that Mrs. Fuhrman, subsequently, called up Geraldo Rivera. Mr. Rivera, at that time, actually answered his phone, personally!\nAccording to my source, Geraldo recounted the conversation on his program the next day. Allegedly, Mrs. Fuhrman sounded very nervous and had said (in essence):\nMark [Fuhrman] could not have planted the Rockingham glove behind O.J. Simpson\u0092s house \u0096 because he was in bed with me at the time of the murders!\nThink about that for a second! First of all, the murders took place at 10:35-10:40 pm. According to Detective Fuhrman\u0092s sworn testimony (to Prosecutor Clark), Fuhrman got home at 10:30 pm and did not go to bed until \"about 11:00 pm \u0096 maybe a little later\"!\nSo Mark Fuhrman could not have been in bed with his wife at the time of the murders \u0096 if Fuhrman is telling the truth! Either Mr. Fuhrman, or Mrs. Fuhrman, was lying!\nThat is the first problem! But now it gets more serious! Fuhrman was never accused of having planted the glove about the time of the murders. Fuhrman was being accused of having planted the glove about 6:15 am \u0096 when he said he \"found\" it. That is almost eight hours after the murders!\nSo, what did Mrs. Fuhrman mean when she called up Geraldo Rivera and said [in essence]:\nMark [Fuhrman] could not have planted the Rockingham glove behind O.J. Simpson\u0092s house \u0096 because he was in bed with me at the time of the murders!?\nMy observant readers have, of course, understood that Mrs.\nFuhrman, who is the only one to corroborate her husband\u0092s \"10:30 alibi\" \u0096 was lying to protect her husband! Mark Fuhrman was not in bed with Mrs. Fuhrman at the time of the murders \u0096 as Mrs. Fuhrman claimed.\nOf course, Mrs. Fuhrman was trying to protect her husband from the accusation that he planted the Rockingham glove behind O.J.\u0092s house. But the protection \"alibi\" she gave her husband did not cover the time when Mark Fuhrman was accused of having planted that glove?\nDetective Fuhrman was being accused of having planted the glove around 6:15 am \u0096 while Mrs. Fuhrman tried to cover for him by saying that he was in bed with her at 10:35 pm. And even that was an obvious lie \u0096 according to Fuhrman\u0092s own sworn direct testimony to Marcia Clark! What is going on here?\nI think I know what is going on! Mrs. Fuhrman knew that her\nhusband murdered Nicole and Ron! And she knew that her husband planted the glove behind O.J.\u0092s house, in order to frame O.J.!\nMrs. Fuhrman was afraid of losing her husband, should he be exposed! So she tried to protect him by giving him a false alibi.\nHowever, Mrs. Fuhrman didn\u0092t know all the details \u0096 only that the murders were committed around 10:35-10:45 pm and that her husband planted the glove behind O.J.\u0092s house, shortly thereafter.\nShe didn\u0092t know \u0096 at that time \u0096 that her husband did not plant the glove at 10:40-10:42 \u0096 when Kato heard the three loud, heavy \"thumps\" on his wall \u0096 but that her husband returned to Rockingham the following morning, together with the investigators \u0096 and planted the glove then!\nMrs. Fuhrman thought that her husband committed the murders at around 10:30-10:40 pm, and that he planted the glove shortly thereafter. So when Detective Fuhrman was being accused of having brought the second glove from Bundy to Rockingham, and planted it behind O.J.\u0092s house \u0096 Mrs. Fuhrman panicked!\nThat\u0092s when she called up Geraldo Rivera personally, and \u0096 apparently very nervously \u0096 claimed that her husband could not have brought the glove from Bundy and planted it behind O.J.\u0092s house, \". . . because he was in bed with me at the time of the murders\"!\nObviously, that was a lie! Shortly, I shall prove that Mrs. Fuhrman not only lied about the exact time she and her husband, allegedly, were in bed together, but that her statement wasn\u0092t even close to the truth! Mark Fuhrman \u0096 if we can believe him, at all \u0096 didn\u0092t come home until 11:15-11:30 that night, at the earliest! [But bear with me on that!]\nNormally I wouldn\u0092t have accused Mrs. Fuhrman of lying,\nor of knowing about the murders. But her statement is obviously false. She made her statement to protect her husband with a false alibi. Later, Mark Fuhrman changed his story in a way that made Mrs. Fuhrman\u0092s statement even more incorrect.\nHence, if I am wrong about this, then Mr. and Mrs. Fuhrman should blame themselves. Let me, anyway, remind my readers that I am just expressing my opinions and theories in this book. It is impossible to know, for sure, all the facts. I have to speculate to try to make some sense out of all the strange things that happened in this case.\nWhat am I leading up to here? Well, a mysterious phone call was made by a woman, to an LAPD dispatcher, at around 10:30 to 10:45 pm on the night of the murders. The woman identified herself as calling from Channel 4 News. Investigations revealed that no one from Channel 4 made that call!\nThat is not strange \u0096 obviously the woman didn\u0092t want to disclose her identity \u0096 so she was not from Channel 4. What is strange, however, is that the woman asked if the police were \"sitting on two dead bodies in West L.A.\"!\nWow! This phone call occurred, in other words, just before, or at the exact same time as the murders took place at Bundy! And the bodies of Nicole and Ron were not to be discovered for another hour and a quarter, approximately!\nMy readers didn\u0092t know about this? Well, if so, the reason is probably that this mysterious phone call has confused everyone who learned about it, to such an extent that they simply refuse to speculate over it. When people try to explain this \u0096 they get a \"headache\"! Who made that call? Nicole, only, was the intended target \u0096 Ron just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. So how did the caller know that two people were being murdered \u0096 or just about to be murdered \u0096 in West L.A.? Was a woman involved in the murders.\nMy readers\u0092 guesses are as good as mine, I am sure. But there has to be an explanation! Here is what I think!\nRemember what I suggested earlier? Mrs. Fuhrman knew that her husband and some accomplices, were out to murder Nicole that night. It seems logical to conclude that, from Mrs. Fuhrman\u0092s own phone call to Mr. Rivera, during which call, she gives her husband a false alibi for the time of the murders \u0096 when he doesn\u0092t, yet, need one!\nMrs. Fuhrman was not directly involved. She had just picked up bits and pieces. But her husband had informed her that she had to cover for him, by supporting his false alibi.\nMrs. Fuhrman had heard the names of both Nicole and O.J. mentioned. But she didn\u0092t know, at that time, that only Nicole was to be killed, while O.J., instead, was to be framed for the murder.\nMrs. Fuhrman thought both Nicole and O.J. were to be murdered.\nMrs. Fuhrman either shared her husband\u0092s racist attitudes and loved her husband enough to go along with him, and protect him \u0096 or she feared her husband strongly enough that she dared not oppose him or expose him.\nMrs. Fuhrman knew the murders were to take place around 10:30 pm, because that is the time she had been told by her husband to confirm that he came home!\nSo, here was Mrs. Fuhrman, sitting at home, alone, anxiously and nervously awaiting her husband\u0092s arrival! The time was 10:25.\n\"Have they done it yet?\" she wondered. Of course, she was worried that something might have gone wrong. Perhaps her husband had been arrested. Perhaps he would be convicted and sentenced to death!\nMrs. Fuhrman jumped a little at the sound of the clock on the wall, as it struck 10:30 pm. A little later the clock showed 10:35. Anxiously, Mrs. Fuhrman looked at the door. The clock showed 10:37.\nIf the bodies had been discovered \u0096 but her husband was not yet back \u0096 it could mean that something had gone wrong, and that he had been arrested. However, if the bodies had not yet been discovered, her husband might be \"just around the corner.\"\nMrs. Fuhrman could not stand the uncertainty any longer. She had to know! Determined, she picked up the phone and called a local LAPD station in West L.A.\nShe could not introduce herself as \"Mrs. Fuhrman,\" of course! But at the same time, she had to give the dispatcher a plausible reason for her strange inquiry. So, introducing herself as a news reporter from Channel 4, she asked if the police were\n\"sitting on two dead bodies in west L.A.\"\nThe dispatcher denied that. Mrs. Fuhrman hung up. Now she could relax a bit. Nothing had gone wrong \u0096 so far, at least!\nToo far out!? Possibly! But if you think so, why don\u0092t you try to come up with a better explanation, as to why a woman, wrongfully identifying herself as calling from Cannel 4 News, could call up the LAPD in West Los Andgeles, at the exact time when Nicole and Ron were being murdered \u0096 but their bodies had not yet been discovered, and ask if the police were \"sitting on two dead bodies in west L.A.\"!\nHowever, this was just a digression. Since this phone call is, perhaps, the greatest unsolved mystery of this entire murder case, I thought I should try to put my spin on it.\nIn conjunction with Mrs. Fuhrman\u0092s attempts to give her husband an obviously false alibi for that exact time \u0096 the time of the murders \u0096 I don\u0092t think my theory about the mysterious phone call is so far fetched, after all! It is, at least, better than anything else I have heard suggested, so far!\nBack to what we do know! Do you think you have heard it all,\nnow? Think again! Here come Fuhrman\u0092s real problems:\nShortly after the murders, I was the only person who had put all the pieces together in this murder mystery, and explained how all the pieces of the puzzle fit my theory of Fuhrman being the murderer (in my first book).\nNo one else believed that at first. But gradually, more and more people started to take my theory seriously \u0096 in particular those who supported O.J. and believed in his innocence. By the end of 1996 several independent private investigators were looking into the theory that Fuhrman actually murdered Nicole and Ron.\nWhile Fuhrman had been cocky before \u0096 he suddenly became nervous. His book, which he promptly decided to write, was a clear example of \"damage control\"! He started to appear on countless TV and radio talk shows, trying to rehabilitate himself, and explain away the few mistakes he had made \u0096 and which I had discovered. He appeared confident. But that is how he appeared, also when he perjured himself during the criminal trial.\nI had understood how Fuhrman could have aborted a first attempt to plant the glove at O.J.\u0092s house \u0096 falling against the wall \u0096 and instead planted the glove the following morning. Or, perhaps the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall were deliberately caused by an accomplice. Perhaps an accomplice thumped the wall, just to make it appear that O.J. lost the glove before he left for Chicago. Perhaps Fuhrman\u0092s plan, all along, was to plant the glove the following morning, when he arrived to investigate the murders.\nHence, to me, the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall at around 10:40-10:42 pm did not represent the time when the glove was planted. I explained that in my first book, \"If O.J. Didn\u0092t ...\"\nFuhrman could have had one accomplice at Rockingham, thumping on the wall with a baseball bat \u0096 over the fence from inside the neighbor\u0092s property \u0096 as soon as Fuhrman called him on a cellular phone and said that Nicole was killed.\nAnother accomplice could have substituted for Fuhrman some place far away, using Fuhrman\u0092s credit card to give Fuhrman a false alibi. Meanwhile, Fuhrman himself could have committed the murder of Nicole (and Ron). The plan was for Fuhrman to plant the glove the following morning, but make people believe it was lost by O.J. shortly after the murders.\nAs more and more private investigators read my book (I assume) and seriously started to look into my early theory, Fuhrman grew increasingly more nervous. By the time his book surfaced, he could feel private investigators clawing at his heels.\nOne key point in this murder mystery is that the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall were caused by the murderer (or one of his accomplices) \u0096 but that was not the time when the glove was planted! Fuhrman planted the glove the next morning.\nHowever, Fuhrman could not have found the Rockingham glove at Bundy, when he came there to investigate the murders at 2:10 am. If Fuhrman planted the glove behind O.J.\u0092s house around 6:15 am \u0096 then he must have brought the glove with him to Bundy, and on to Rockingham that morning. And if he brought the glove with him to Bundy at 2:10 am \u0096 then he is the killer!\nSo, around the end of February 1997, Fuhrman was seen and heard on radio and TV talk shows, almost every day, calling everyones attention to the \"thumps\" on Kato\u0092s wall at around 10:40- 10:42 pm, and suggesting strongly, that those thumps were caused by the murderer \u0096 O.J. \u0096 depositing or losing the Rockingham glove behind his house, before leaving for Chicago. Are you still with me? O.K.\nToday, Fuhrman has to get people away from the notion that he planted the glove at 6:15 am, because that makes him part of the murder plot. Instead, today, Fuhrman must convince people that the glove was deposited around 10:42 pm. Fuhrman suddenly needed a better alibi for the time of the murders. Yes? But didn\u0092t he have an alibi? No!\nAs long as people only suspected Fuhrman of having planted the glove at 6:15 am the morning after the murders, Fuhrman was not too concerned about his alibi for the actual time of the murders. As long as his wife corroborated that he came home at 10:30 pm, that was O.K.\nHowever, by February 1997, Mark Fuhrman sensed the heat was building. Several investigators had long since found out that he lied about the barbecue, that there was not even a seminar on the evening of the murders, that his wife had lied about him being in bed with her at the time of the murders, etc., etc. Investigators began realizing that Fuhrman, probably, was the murderer.\nSo Fuhrman began emphasizing that the glove must tie in with the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall. At first, I didn\u0092t understand why he was pushing that issue so vehemently. But then, in February, 1997 on the \"O\u0092Reilly Hour\" (Fox TV), Fuhrman \"shot himself in the foot\" \u0096 because he had to, sooner or later!\n[I have to rely on one of my sources, since I didn\u0092t watch the program]. When challenged about the Rockingham glove, Fuhrman again emphasized that the glove must have been deposited \u0096 by the murderer \u0096 in connection with the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall. Then he finally said it! [In essence]:\nI know where I was at 10:40 pm! I was pumping gas in Pomona! [40-50 minutes from Bundy!]. But O.J. cannot tell us where he was \u0096 because he was behind his house, where he lost the murder glove!\nMy immediate response to my \"source\" as we were talking on the phone, was that Fuhrman must sense his \"La Quinta/barbecue alibi\" was falling apart and that private investigators were on to him. He needed a better alibi for the time of the murders. But he could not indicate that he considered himself a murder suspect in need of an alibi \u0096 so he could not come right out and present it. He had to introduce his new alibi indirectly, pretending he was simply attacking O.J.\u0092s alibi, instead.\nAs soon as my \"source\" informed me about Fuhrman\u0092s new \"pumping gas in Pomona alibi,\" I told her that Fuhrman\u0092s objective, probably, was not simply to attack O.J.\u0092s alibi \u0096 as he pretended \u0096 but to introduce his own Pomona alibi, indirectly. Hence, he must have a way of corroborating this new alibi, which he so cleverly tried to introduce.\n\"Most likely,\" I told my source, \"Fuhrman must have in his possession a credit card receipt from Pomona, showing both the date, June 12, 1994, and the time, approximately 10:40 pm! I think he will tell us that himself \u0096 not yet, but shortly\"!\nRight on! Some time later (February 28, 1997), on \"Talk Back Live\" (CNN), Fuhrman, again, repeated the same statement in the context of attacking O.J.\u0092s alibi!\nApparently, Fuhrman was just accusing O.J. of not having an alibi for the time when the thumps on Kato\u0092s wall occurred \u0096 which, according to Fuhrman, coincided with the Rockingham glove being lost (by O.J.).\nThen \u0096 \"casually,\" in the same sentence \u0096 he added, that he himself, for instance, knew exactly where he was at that time, because he had used his \"Gold American Express\" credit card to pump gas in Pomona, at the time Kato heard the thumps on his wall!\nToday, apparently, Fuhrman wants us to believe that he can prove that he stopped for gas in Pomona, on his way from La Quinta to his home, on the night of the murders.\nBut this is where things are starting to fall apart for Fuhrman. If Fuhrman was pumping gas in Pomona at 10:40 \u0096 he could not have been home until 11:15 -11:30 pm!\nIf so, not only did he lie under oath in his direct testimony for Prosecutor Clark, when he said he got home around 10:30 pm. His wife must also have lied when she said that Fuhrman was in bed with her at the time of the murders!\nFuhrman was clever, too, though \u0096 or tried to be! He did not want to mention directly that he had a \"credit card alibi\" for the time of the murders. So he didn\u0092t bring this up until the end of February, 1997. Furthermore \u0096 when he eventually brought up his \"Pomona alibi\" \u0096 he introduced it through the \"back door\" \u0096 by using it, indirectly, to attack O.J. in connection with the glove behind O.J.\u0092s house.\nWhy didn\u0092t Fuhrman come forward with his c/c receipt from Pomona during his testimony in the criminal trial? Why did he instead lie about getting home at 10:30 pm and going to bed at a little past 11:00 pm?\nBecause no one asked him about it! Fuhrman was not a murder suspect at that time. After the murders he didn\u0092t want to volunteer the information about pumping gas in Pomona at 10:45. He didn\u0092t want to \"explain\" that he had a \"credit card alibi\" for the time of the murders \u0096 as long as no one accused him of being the murderer.\nThe \"trick\" about letting someone else use your credit card at an automated credit card machine, like a gas pump, is as old as such gas pumps! Therefore, this is not an \"alibi\" you bring up yourself! You just keep it \u0096 in case someone else asks you:\n\"Where were you at 10:30 on the night of the murders?\"!\nEveryone speculated about Fuhrman having planted the Rockingham glove \u0096 at 6:15 am. But no one could explain how he could have done it \u0096 because there were already seventeen officers at Bundy when Fuhrman arrived there to investigate, around 2:10 am, and neither of them had seen a second murder glove.\nHad Fuhrman come forward and said: \"By the way, I have a credit card receipt showing that I was in Pomona, pumping gas \u0096 when Nicole and Ron were killed [. . . so I could not have murdered them!]\" \u0096 then, someone might have asked: \"Why the heck is he telling us that?\" Someone might have figured out that a guy pumping gas in Pomona \u0096 using Fuhrman\u0092s credit card \u0096 didn\u0092t mean that Fuhrman himself was in Pomona at 10:40!\nThe next conclusion would not be far behind \u0096 namely that if someone used Fuhrman\u0092s credit card, to give Fuhrman a false alibi for the time of the murders, then Fuhrman might actually be the killer. If so, that could explain how he could have planted the Rockingham glove \u0096 why the blood on that glove was still wet when he showed it to Detective Vannatter, eight hours after the murders, etc., etc.\nThis was exactly what I pointed out in my first book, \"If O.J. Didn\u0092t ...\" (chapter 17, \"More Pieces That Fit The Puzzle,\" page 107). [Discussing Fuhrman\u0092s perjury regarding his use of the N-word]. Quote:\nSo why did he lie? What was he so afraid of?\nObviously, Detective Fuhrman was afraid that admitting to having used racial slurs, might have opened up a Pandora\u0092s box to his true character, and possibly given someone the idea that he not only planted the glove because he was a racist and wanted to harm O.J. \u0096 but that he actually murdered Nicole and Ron, and framed O.J. for the murders.\nIt seems obvious that Fuhrman planted the glove! That does not mean that Fuhrman found the second glove at Bundy when he arrived between 2 and 3 o\u0092clock in the morning. He could have had it all along, because he might actually have murdered Nicole and Ron! [End of quote].\nSuddenly the entire murder plot could have started to unravel. Therefore, during his testimony, Fuhrman said nothing about pumping gas in Pomona and, hence, that his only alibi for the time of the murders, was a credit card receipt someone else could have provided.\nIt was safer \u0096 and less conspicuous \u0096 to \"move\" the La Quinta barbecue from Saturday to Sunday, and just \u0096 casually \u0096 mention that he drove straight home from La Quinta, got home at 10:30 \u0096 and have his wife corroborate his alibi.\nSince he couldn\u0092t use his \"Pomona alibi,\" Fuhrman had to state that he came home, at least, a little before the murders took place. However, towards the end of 1996, Fuhrman sensed that private investigators were on to him. He sensed that the La Quinta story was unravelling. By late February, 1997, he needed a better alibi for his timeline, than simply the non-existing barbecue in La Quinta \u0096 and his, obviously, \"lying\" wife!\nSo, out of necessity, he dug out the old credit card receipt from Pomona, which one of his accomplices had actually provided on the night of the murders \u0096 as an alibi for Fuhrman \u0096 in case Fuhrman should become an immediate murder suspect after he \"found\" the Rockingham glove, back in 1994!\nSure enough, Fuhrman\u0092s new \"pumping gas in Pomona\" alibi directly contradicted his sworn testimony in the criminal trial. Actually, this exposed a new case of perjury by Fuhrman, which no one was aware of until now. So why would Fuhrman risk that?\nWell, it wasn\u0092t really an added risk. Just as I predicted and suggested in \"If O.J. Didn\u0092t ...,\" Fuhrman\u0092s \"alibi\" about the Protective League seminar was false. Investigators had taken my advice and revealed that. It was just a matter of time, before that \"secret\" would explode in Fuhrman\u0092s face. So he had to think further ahead, and introduce his new \"Pomona alibi\" before his \"La Quinta barbecue alibi\" got publicly busted.\nWas Mark Fuhrman\u0092s \"perfect murder\" plot beginning to fall apart around the winter of 1997?\nIs this why Fuhrman first told Larry King, cockily, on February 26, that he would be willing to debate \"anyone\" on \"Larry King Live\" \u0096 but later changed his mind when he heard that his opponent would be Pat McKenna [one of O.J.\u0092s private investigators]?\nNo question about it \u0096 Fuhrman\u0092s alibi for the time of the murder is not trustworthy. It is \"manufactured\"! Even more suspect, however, is the fact that Fuhrman has been pushing a manufactured alibi in the first place.\nWhy should Fuhrman have to manufacture a false alibi for the time of the murders \u0096 if he is not the murderer?\n"}, {"score": 926.34656, "uuid": "0dc85d4c-61c2-5a7b-bd6c-4c5d86d399ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1103wb-34-11704", "target_hostname": "declarationsandexclusions.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://declarationsandexclusions.typepad.com/foolblog/2004/02/hafnium_is_bett.html", "page_rank": 1.1726708e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "a fool in <em>the</em> forest: Hafnium <em>is</em> <em>Better</em> Than None", "snippet": "Looking over <em>the</em> reports, however, I did discover two new <em>or</em> newish links to these pages for <em>which</em> I need to offer up some thanks.", "explanation": null, "document": "February 11, 2004\nHafnium is Better Than None\nTwo days ago, this site received its highest number of daily visits yet.

That pretty much sums up how I feel about what Family Guy was, and what it has become recently. There was a time when it was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared.\nThat's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, \" Road to the Multiverse \", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline. \" Brian's Got a Brand New Bag \" and \" Jerome is the New Black \" were two episodes that felt remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing. Every other episode in the first half was a failure. It felt like the team running the show were just phoning it in and hoping that the show's previous successes would create some kind of reality distortion effect that would make people think their crappy jokes were actual comedy. And for a while, I'll admit I kind of succumbed to this effect. When the series stopped entertaining me and actually started boring me, I initially thought that maybe I just didn't \"get it\". Maybe I'd gotten too old and jaded to see the value of what the show was doing. I tried to give the series the benefit of the doubt, like a frustrated lover desperately trying to find out what was going wrong with his relationship with his once-wonderful girlfriend, only to finally realize that over the years she had become a fat, abusive, shrew. When the second half of the season produced a string of consistently bad episodes, it all became clear...\nThe show was sucking.\n- FOX\n\" Go Stewie Go \", \" Peter-assment \", and \" April in Quahog \" sealed the deal for me. These stories were full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator \"jokes\", with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny. Stewie's conversion from evil genius to gay baby was complete, Brian's left his lofty position as the voice of reason and switched to pretentious loser, and Peter was the most annoying person on TV. Peter's antics were always crude and offensive, but in the past those traits were funny because he wasn't necessarily mean-spirited, just \"petarded\" and clueless. In this season he became a purposeful, irresponsible, jackass. If that wasn't bad enough, he also had a misogynistic streak and treated his wife and daughter rather horribly in a number of episodes.\nBut something interesting happened near the tail end of the season. The show threw out all its old conventions and tried something remarkably different with \" Brian and Stewie \". This episode ditched the cutaway jokes and focused on a tale between two characters with some serious issues and a complex relationship. It was surprisingly dramatic, and had it not been for the extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out.\nThe season ended with an airing of \" Something, Something, Something Dark Side \", the Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back parody that had already been released on DVD for some time. Even though I think it was a lazy choice, it is a pretty entertaining parody, and a safe way to wrap things up. Still, it wasn't enough to make up for the failures that came before it. However, I still have hope that things can pick up next season. Seth MacFarlane's other series, American Dad, has shown a number of improvements recently, and there's no reason the same can't happen with Family Guy.\nIGN Ratings for Family Guy: Season 8\nRating\n"}, {"score": 917.68463, "uuid": "8c39c890-a798-5f77-a447-e84c3260c235", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1717wb-42-20801", "target_hostname": "m.diamondcertified.org", "target_uri": "http://m.diamondcertified.org/report/simpson-roofing-service", "page_rank": 1.179475e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Simpson</em> Roofing Service | Diamond Certified", "snippet": "Verified <em>Simpson</em> Roofing Service Customer Name Q3 &amp; Q4:&quot;That <em>the</em> owner <em>is</em> available at anytime for discussion, he <em>is</em> always on top of it and right there.

Willie's role in the Simpsons universe is pretty self explanatory, as he is the groundskeeper for Springfield Elementary.

A couple high-points for the character were being trained to be civilized (a la My Fair Lady in the episode \" My Fair Laddy \"), wrestling a wolf that was let loose in the school and becoming a substitute for the French language teacher - \"Bonjourrr!

After all, he is the character who has tried to murder Bart (amongst others) on more than one occasion. Making his first appearance in the 12th episode of the series, Bob's initial crimes - framing Krusty the Clown for robbery - were a prelude to his more homicidal and vengeful tendencies. Thanks to Kelsey Grammer's wonderful, highbrow vocal delivery, Sideshow Bob is a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac - who can forget him crooning, \"I've Grown Accustomed to Bart's Face\"? Among the several Sideshow Bob-centric episodes, the best may be \" Cape Feare ,\" which among many other highlights, introduced Bob's inadvertent comedy bit of stepping on one rake after another, causing each to hit him in the face.\n#1: Troy McClure\nVoiced By: Phil Hartman\nYou may remember Troy McClure from such films as Dial M for Murderousness, The Erotic Adventures of Hercules, and Hydro, the Man With the Hydraulic Arms, or such educational films as Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-Know-What, Mommy, What's Wrong With That Man's Face?, and Someone's in the Kitchen with DNA! Voiced with such self-promoting pomposity that only the late, great Phil Hartman can pull off, Troy McClure is not only our favorite B-movie actor but in our book he's the best peripheral character on The Simpsons. From his great introductions to his truly bizarre fish fetish and ill-fated marriage to Selma, Troy McClure is a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be.\nWant to see the Simpsons movie trailer?

That pretty much sums up how I feel about what Family Guy was, and what it has become recently. There was a time when it was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared.\nThat's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, \" Road to the Multiverse \", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline. \" Brian's Got a Brand New Bag \" and \" Jerome is the New Black \" were two episodes that felt remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing. Every other episode in the first half was a failure. It felt like the team running the show were just phoning it in and hoping that the show's previous successes would create some kind of reality distortion effect that would make people think their crappy jokes were actual comedy. And for a while, I'll admit I kind of succumbed to this effect. When the series stopped entertaining me and actually started boring me, I initially thought that maybe I just didn't \"get it\". Maybe I'd gotten too old and jaded to see the value of what the show was doing. I tried to give the series the benefit of the doubt, like a frustrated lover desperately trying to find out what was going wrong with his relationship with his once-wonderful girlfriend, only to finally realize that over the years she had become a fat, abusive, shrew. When the second half of the season produced a string of consistently bad episodes, it all became clear...\nThe show was sucking.\n- FOX\n\" Go Stewie Go \", \" Peter-assment \", and \" April in Quahog \" sealed the deal for me. These stories were full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator \"jokes\", with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny. Stewie's conversion from evil genius to gay baby was complete, Brian's left his lofty position as the voice of reason and switched to pretentious loser, and Peter was the most annoying person on TV. Peter's antics were always crude and offensive, but in the past those traits were funny because he wasn't necessarily mean-spirited, just \"petarded\" and clueless. In this season he became a purposeful, irresponsible, jackass. If that wasn't bad enough, he also had a misogynistic streak and treated his wife and daughter rather horribly in a number of episodes.\nBut something interesting happened near the tail end of the season. The show threw out all its old conventions and tried something remarkably different with \" Brian and Stewie \". This episode ditched the cutaway jokes and focused on a tale between two characters with some serious issues and a complex relationship. It was surprisingly dramatic, and had it not been for the extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out.\nThe season ended with an airing of \" Something, Something, Something Dark Side \", the Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back parody that had already been released on DVD for some time. Even though I think it was a lazy choice, it is a pretty entertaining parody, and a safe way to wrap things up. Still, it wasn't enough to make up for the failures that came before it. However, I still have hope that things can pick up next season. Seth MacFarlane's other series, American Dad, has shown a number of improvements recently, and there's no reason the same can't happen with Family Guy.\nIGN Ratings for Family Guy: Season 8\nRating\n"}, {"score": 910.9629, "uuid": "37e1b4b2-9e4e-5850-afb0-c6419bdf5c3d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0701wb-48-10028", "target_hostname": "www.simpsonschannel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.simpsonschannel.com/2009/03/ratings-gone-maggie-gone/", "page_rank": 1.1774894e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Ratings: Gone Maggie Gone | <em>Simpsons</em> Channel", "snippet": "Nice episode\u2026 seriously <em>family</em> <em>guy</em> <em>is</em> now getting <em>better</em> than <em>the</em> <em>simpsons</em>!!!", "explanation": null, "document": "nick-tick-97 16 March 2009 at 4:44 pm #\nless and less ratings each week, shame it was such a good episode.\nReply\nMarbat 16 March 2009 at 6:14 pm #\nwell i haven\u2019t yet seen it but the last 2-3 episodes were good so i hope this one is also good. can\u2019t wait to see it hope its good!\nReply\nShayna 16 March 2009 at 6:47 pm #\nI watched it last night, and really enjoyed it.

Pinsky\n\u00a9 The Orlando Sentinel, August 15, 1999.\n\"Whether or not the soul is real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything that is fine inside us.\"\n-- Lisa Simpson, age 8\nWhen the animated television series The Simpsons appeared more than a decade ago, it was denounced by many throughout the nation -- and nowhere more vigorously than from America's pulpits. The nation's moral leaders thundered that this nuclear but dysfunctional family was the latest evidence of the fall of Western civilization.\n\"We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,\" President George Bush told the National Religious Broadcasters in 1992.\nAs cartoonist Matt Groening's show approaches a new season, it continues to be a source of controversy, this time drawing criticism from a Roman Catholic watchdog organization. The group, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, cited several jokes about the church. In one case, pressure from network officials this past season forced the show's producers to alter a line about the Catholic church from the original show when the program aired in rerun this summer.\nBut both the initial denunciations and the recent controversy obscure the fact that God, Christianity and Christians are more a part of the Simpsons' daily lives than any other prime-time network series, at least shows not specifically devoted to religion, such as Touched By An Angel and Seventh Heaven.\n\"Right-wingers complain there's no God on TV,\" Groening said in a recent interview in Mother Jones magazine. \"Not only do the Simpsons go to church every Sunday and pray, they actually speak to God from time to time. We show Him, and God has five fingers -- unlike the Simpsons, who only have four.\"\nMike Scully, the series' executive producer, said the show tries to reflect through its characters the fact that faith plays a substantial part in many families' lives, although it is seldom portrayed on television.\n\"We try to represent people's honest attitudes about religion,\" he said.\nThe Simpsons is consistently irreverent toward organized religion's failings and excesses -- as it is with most other aspects of modern life. However, God is not mocked. When The Simpsons characters are faced with crises, they turn to God. He answers their prayers and intervenes in their world. The family says prayers before meals, believes in a literal heaven and hell, and ridicules cults. Their next-door neighbors are committed evangelical Christians.\nSome in the religious world have recognized this phenomenon. Three years into the series, in 1992, the show was the subject of a favorable master's thesis at Pat Robertson's Regent University. \"While it may not completely resonate with the evangelical Judeo-Christian belief system,\" wrote Beth Keller, \"The Simpsons does portray a family searching for moral and theological ideals.\"\nThe Door, a religious humor magazine, put the series on a recent cover, with an article titled \"The Springfield Blessing: The Theology of Homer Simpson.\" And in the Christian monthly PRISM, published by Evangelicals for Social Action, teacher Bill Dark wrote that the series is \"the most pro-family, God-preoccupied, home-based program on television. Statistically speaking, there is more prayer on The Simpsons than on any sitcom in broadcast history.\"\nWilliam Romanowski is looking for a video of \"Homer the Heretic,\" an episode of the Simpsons, to use in the class he teaches at Calvin College, a Christian school in Grand Rapids, Mich.\nThe author of Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment in American Life, Romanowski said the episode is instructive because \"it tries to get at the role God and religion play in people's everyday lives.\"\nThis is not to say that when the Old Testament prophet Isaiah said \"a little child shall lead them,\" he had young Bart Simpson in mind. Sometimes, it's more a case of \"suffer the little children.\" Bart's grace at mealtime is likely to be, \"Rub a dub, dub, thanks for the grub.\"\nHomer, who works at a nuclear-power plant, often expresses gratitude at the dinner table, even extending well beyond sustenance, thanking God \"most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single, proven fatality, at least in this country.\"\nThe Simpson's blessings are decidedly mixed. After a particularly disastrous Thanksgiving Day, Homer loses it as he offers thanks \"for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced . . . well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the world, or what?\"\nAs in many households, prayer at the Simpsons is most fervent in the face of disaster, like a hurricane or a comet bearing down on their cartoon town of Springfield, and often comes in the form of a bargain:\n\"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all of our friends.\"\nOr a nuclear meltdown, begun at Homer's workplace.\n\"Dear Lord,\" Marge prays, \"if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do. Ummm . . . oh, the next time there's a canned-food drive, I'll give the poor something they actually like, instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix.\"\nNot all the crises that call for prayer are cosmic events. In \"Bart Gets an F,\" the boy is threatened with repeating a grade if he fails a test for which he is not prepared. Desperate, Bart asks God for one more day to study.\n\"Prayer, the last refuge of the scoundrel,\" Lisa scoffs as she overhears her older brother. Nonetheless, a freak snow storm closes school the next day, saving him.\n\"I heard you last night, Bart,\" Lisa tells him. \"You prayed for this. Now your prayers have been answered. I'm no theologian. I don't know who or what God is exactly. All I know is: He's a force more powerful than Mom and Dad put together, and you owe him big.\"\nBart acknowledges, \"Part of this D-minus belongs to God.\"\nThe Simpsons attend Springfield Community Church, with the unctuous Rev. Timothy Lovejoy in the pulpit, and a marquee featuring a variety of challenging messages, such as \"God, the Original Love Connection,\" and \"Sunday, the Miracle of Shame.\" The denomination is not specified, and Homer's understanding of theology is undeniably hazy.\nAsked by Bart what his religious beliefs are, Homer answers, \"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work in real life. Uh, Christianity.\"\nBut Homer does not doubt the existence of God, even when he decides not to go to church. Instead, he wants to start his own sybaritic religion, which occasions a divine visitation.\n\"I'm not a bad guy,\" he tells God, who wears a robe and sandals, but whose visage is unseen. \"I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?\"\nGod replies: \"Hmm, you've got a point there. You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football.\"\n\"So I figure I should try to live right and worship you in my own way,\" Homer concludes. But he changes his mind about church and religion a few minutes later when he is dragged from his burning house by Ned Flanders, an evangelical Christian who lives next door.\nNed is a doofus -- there is no other word for him. He is such a goody-goody that he doesn't let his equally devout children use dice when playing board games because the playing pieces are \"wicked.\" Still, Ned takes his faith seriously, is righteous but not self-righteous, and is not a hypocrite. He is fired from Springfield Elementary School, where he is filling in as principal, for saying \"Let's thank the Lord\" over the intercom.\nAbused constantly by his oafish next-door neighbor, the relentlessly upbeat Ned returns only love and good works. When Flanders suffers a breakdown and is condemned by the church, Homer tells members of the congregation, \"This man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven: We'd already be there.\"\nThe Flanders family is portrayed \"fallibly but sympathetically,\" said Michael Glodo, professor of Old Testament and Preaching at Reformed Theological Seminary in Oviedo. \"They are simple, sincere, earnest -- a good package of virtue, especially in a post-modern culture where cynicism and irony and satire are the prevailing sentiments.\"\nSometimes, Flanders' zeal goes too far. Given temporary custody of the Simpson children because of their parents apparent neglect, Ned attempts to baptize the children in the Springfield River, only to be interrupted in the midst of the rite by Homer.\n\"Wow, Dad, you took a baptism for me,\" says a startled Bart. \"How do you feel?\"\nHomer -- temporarily aglow -- replies, \"Oh, Bartholomew. I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.\"\nNed is flabbergasted by this. \"Homer, what did you say?\"\nAs the glow subsides, Homer returns to his natural state: \"I said, shut your ugly face, Flanders!\"\nYet even Flanders questions his faith when his home and his business are singled out for destruction by a hurricane, comparing himself to Job:\n\"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people! I don't drink or dance or swear! I've even kept kosher just to be on the safe side! I've done everything the Bible says; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! What more could I do?\"\nMoral dilemmas frequently confront characters, everything from stealing -- cookies from a jar or an illegal cable TV hookup -- to adultery, or selling your soul to the devil, which Homer does for a donut and Bart does for a Formula One race car and for $5 in cash.\n\"What I do appreciate about The Simpsons is that evil often -- if not always -- is punished with consequences,\" said Robert Knight, director of cultural studies for the conservative, Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council.\n\"The Simpsons do function in a moral universe, and, while the show seems to make fun of moral standards, it often upholds those same standards in a back-handed way,\" said Knight, author of The Age of Consent: The Rise of Relativism and The Corruption of Popular Culture.\nWhen Otto, the stoned school-bus driver, becomes homeless he is invited by Bart to move into the Simpsons' garage.\n\"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer,\" says Marge, \"but doesn't the Bible say, 'Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me . . . ?' \"\nYes, Homer replies, \"but doesn't the Bible also say, 'Thou shalt not take moochers into thy hut?' \"\nThe Simpsons, with its numerous catch phrases (\"D'oh!\" \"Don't have a cow, man\" \"Eat my shorts\" \"Underachiever and proud of it\" \"Ay, caramba!\") has had an undeniable impact on American culture. It has been a healthy and sustained ratings performer for the Fox Network.

Pinsky\n\u00a9 The Orlando Sentinel, August 15, 1999.\n\"Whether or not the soul is real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything that is fine inside us.\"\n-- Lisa Simpson, age 8\nWhen the animated television series The Simpsons appeared more than a decade ago, it was denounced by many throughout the nation -- and nowhere more vigorously than from America's pulpits. The nation's moral leaders thundered that this nuclear but dysfunctional family was the latest evidence of the fall of Western civilization.\n\"We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,\" President George Bush told the National Religious Broadcasters in 1992.\nAs cartoonist Matt Groening's show approaches a new season, it continues to be a source of controversy, this time drawing criticism from a Roman Catholic watchdog organization. The group, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, cited several jokes about the church. In one case, pressure from network officials this past season forced the show's producers to alter a line about the Catholic church from the original show when the program aired in rerun this summer.\nBut both the initial denunciations and the recent controversy obscure the fact that God, Christianity and Christians are more a part of the Simpsons' daily lives than any other prime-time network series, at least shows not specifically devoted to religion, such as Touched By An Angel and Seventh Heaven.\n\"Right-wingers complain there's no God on TV,\" Groening said in a recent interview in Mother Jones magazine. \"Not only do the Simpsons go to church every Sunday and pray, they actually speak to God from time to time. We show Him, and God has five fingers -- unlike the Simpsons, who only have four.\"\nMike Scully, the series' executive producer, said the show tries to reflect through its characters the fact that faith plays a substantial part in many families' lives, although it is seldom portrayed on television.\n\"We try to represent people's honest attitudes about religion,\" he said.\nThe Simpsons is consistently irreverent toward organized religion's failings and excesses -- as it is with most other aspects of modern life. However, God is not mocked. When The Simpsons characters are faced with crises, they turn to God. He answers their prayers and intervenes in their world. The family says prayers before meals, believes in a literal heaven and hell, and ridicules cults. Their next-door neighbors are committed evangelical Christians.\nSome in the religious world have recognized this phenomenon. Three years into the series, in 1992, the show was the subject of a favorable master's thesis at Pat Robertson's Regent University. \"While it may not completely resonate with the evangelical Judeo-Christian belief system,\" wrote Beth Keller, \"The Simpsons does portray a family searching for moral and theological ideals.\"\nThe Door, a religious humor magazine, put the series on a recent cover, with an article titled \"The Springfield Blessing: The Theology of Homer Simpson.\" And in the Christian monthly PRISM, published by Evangelicals for Social Action, teacher Bill Dark wrote that the series is \"the most pro-family, God-preoccupied, home-based program on television. Statistically speaking, there is more prayer on The Simpsons than on any sitcom in broadcast history.\"\nWilliam Romanowski is looking for a video of \"Homer the Heretic,\" an episode of the Simpsons, to use in the class he teaches at Calvin College, a Christian school in Grand Rapids, Mich.\nThe author of Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment in American Life, Romanowski said the episode is instructive because \"it tries to get at the role God and religion play in people's everyday lives.\"\nThis is not to say that when the Old Testament prophet Isaiah said \"a little child shall lead them,\" he had young Bart Simpson in mind. Sometimes, it's more a case of \"suffer the little children.\" Bart's grace at mealtime is likely to be, \"Rub a dub, dub, thanks for the grub.\"\nHomer, who works at a nuclear-power plant, often expresses gratitude at the dinner table, even extending well beyond sustenance, thanking God \"most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single, proven fatality, at least in this country.\"\nThe Simpson's blessings are decidedly mixed. After a particularly disastrous Thanksgiving Day, Homer loses it as he offers thanks \"for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced . . . well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the world, or what?\"\nAs in many households, prayer at the Simpsons is most fervent in the face of disaster, like a hurricane or a comet bearing down on their cartoon town of Springfield, and often comes in the form of a bargain:\n\"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all of our friends.\"\nOr a nuclear meltdown, begun at Homer's workplace.\n\"Dear Lord,\" Marge prays, \"if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do. Ummm . . . oh, the next time there's a canned-food drive, I'll give the poor something they actually like, instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix.\"\nNot all the crises that call for prayer are cosmic events. In \"Bart Gets an F,\" the boy is threatened with repeating a grade if he fails a test for which he is not prepared. Desperate, Bart asks God for one more day to study.\n\"Prayer, the last refuge of the scoundrel,\" Lisa scoffs as she overhears her older brother. Nonetheless, a freak snow storm closes school the next day, saving him.\n\"I heard you last night, Bart,\" Lisa tells him. \"You prayed for this. Now your prayers have been answered. I'm no theologian. I don't know who or what God is exactly. All I know is: He's a force more powerful than Mom and Dad put together, and you owe him big.\"\nBart acknowledges, \"Part of this D-minus belongs to God.\"\nThe Simpsons attend Springfield Community Church, with the unctuous Rev. Timothy Lovejoy in the pulpit, and a marquee featuring a variety of challenging messages, such as \"God, the Original Love Connection,\" and \"Sunday, the Miracle of Shame.\" The denomination is not specified, and Homer's understanding of theology is undeniably hazy.\nAsked by Bart what his religious beliefs are, Homer answers, \"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work in real life. Uh, Christianity.\"\nBut Homer does not doubt the existence of God, even when he decides not to go to church. Instead, he wants to start his own sybaritic religion, which occasions a divine visitation.\n\"I'm not a bad guy,\" he tells God, who wears a robe and sandals, but whose visage is unseen. \"I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?\"\nGod replies: \"Hmm, you've got a point there. You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football.\"\n\"So I figure I should try to live right and worship you in my own way,\" Homer concludes. But he changes his mind about church and religion a few minutes later when he is dragged from his burning house by Ned Flanders, an evangelical Christian who lives next door.\nNed is a doofus -- there is no other word for him. He is such a goody-goody that he doesn't let his equally devout children use dice when playing board games because the playing pieces are \"wicked.\" Still, Ned takes his faith seriously, is righteous but not self-righteous, and is not a hypocrite. He is fired from Springfield Elementary School, where he is filling in as principal, for saying \"Let's thank the Lord\" over the intercom.\nAbused constantly by his oafish next-door neighbor, the relentlessly upbeat Ned returns only love and good works. When Flanders suffers a breakdown and is condemned by the church, Homer tells members of the congregation, \"This man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven: We'd already be there.\"\nThe Flanders family is portrayed \"fallibly but sympathetically,\" said Michael Glodo, professor of Old Testament and Preaching at Reformed Theological Seminary in Oviedo. \"They are simple, sincere, earnest -- a good package of virtue, especially in a post-modern culture where cynicism and irony and satire are the prevailing sentiments.\"\nSometimes, Flanders' zeal goes too far. Given temporary custody of the Simpson children because of their parents apparent neglect, Ned attempts to baptize the children in the Springfield River, only to be interrupted in the midst of the rite by Homer.\n\"Wow, Dad, you took a baptism for me,\" says a startled Bart. \"How do you feel?\"\nHomer -- temporarily aglow -- replies, \"Oh, Bartholomew. I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.\"\nNed is flabbergasted by this. \"Homer, what did you say?\"\nAs the glow subsides, Homer returns to his natural state: \"I said, shut your ugly face, Flanders!\"\nYet even Flanders questions his faith when his home and his business are singled out for destruction by a hurricane, comparing himself to Job:\n\"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people! I don't drink or dance or swear! I've even kept kosher just to be on the safe side! I've done everything the Bible says; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! What more could I do?\"\nMoral dilemmas frequently confront characters, everything from stealing -- cookies from a jar or an illegal cable TV hookup -- to adultery, or selling your soul to the devil, which Homer does for a donut and Bart does for a Formula One race car and for $5 in cash.\n\"What I do appreciate about The Simpsons is that evil often -- if not always -- is punished with consequences,\" said Robert Knight, director of cultural studies for the conservative, Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council.\n\"The Simpsons do function in a moral universe, and, while the show seems to make fun of moral standards, it often upholds those same standards in a back-handed way,\" said Knight, author of The Age of Consent: The Rise of Relativism and The Corruption of Popular Culture.\nWhen Otto, the stoned school-bus driver, becomes homeless he is invited by Bart to move into the Simpsons' garage.\n\"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer,\" says Marge, \"but doesn't the Bible say, 'Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me . . . ?' \"\nYes, Homer replies, \"but doesn't the Bible also say, 'Thou shalt not take moochers into thy hut?' \"\nThe Simpsons, with its numerous catch phrases (\"D'oh!\" \"Don't have a cow, man\" \"Eat my shorts\" \"Underachiever and proud of it\" \"Ay, caramba!\") has had an undeniable impact on American culture. It has been a healthy and sustained ratings performer for the Fox Network. And, if anything, time has enhanced the show's quality -- at least among critics.\n\"Weirdly, remarkably, the show just kept getting better,\" Jeff MacGregor wrote recently in the New York Times.\n\"Since the passing of Seinfeld last year, The Simpsons is left alone as the only laugh-out-loud show on television,\" he said. \"It is the antidote to what ails most of the medium, at once smart and anarchic, subtle and raucous. After more than a decade, it remains colorful proof that 'excellence' and 'television' needn't be concepts of mutual exclusion.\"\nConservative cultural critic Michael Medved agrees.\n\"It's generally been acknowledged that The Simpsons is one of the most serious and seriously ambitious shows on television,\" he said.\nNo one would mistake Homer Simpson and his family for saints.

But I believe there are some consolation prizes.\"\nGroening was joking, of course, in reference to the nationwide Springfield contest for \"The Simpsons Movie,\" where 14 Springfields from Colorado, New Jersey and Florida, to Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan vied for the dubious distinction of becoming the official hometown of the animated family (the Minnesota Springfield, afraid of its reputation being sullied, dropped out of the competition).\nIn the end, the honor went to Springfield, Vt., where a yellow carpet was rolled out over the weekend to host Groening and a couple thousand others, including the town's residents.\nIt's one of many ingenious ways (Kwik-E-Marts also springed up) that Fox, Groening and company have drummed up interest in the movie, which opens in theaters Friday.\nIt's only appropriate that the marketing approach for the film be irreverent, because, after all, that's what \"The Simpsons\" are all about. Not surprisingly, the film's PG-13 rating is for \"irreverent humor throughout.\"\nStill, Groening advised, the PG-13 rating isn't something that should frighten sensitive fans or young viewers away. Besides, some observers already liken the material in the television show to PG-13 content already.\n\"The movie is still very much family entertainment, but we push the boundaries gently with a little bit of language -- but nothing anybody hasn't heard on the grade-school playground,\" Groening said with a laugh.\nThen there were other pains in the butt to deal with, like the response by some to, as Groening coined it, \"the pseudo-notorious Bart skateboarding naked scene.\"\n\"We got some weird fan letters about that,\" Groening recalled. \"They were worried we were going into a vulgar direction with it. But I wrote to all of them and said, 'When you see the way we do this, you will laugh. I guarantee it.' It's one of the best scenes we've ever done. It's very funny and there's nothing unsuitable for kids about it.\"\nAnd as for unwritten PG-13 rule that allows one or two F-bombs, Groening assured that there's instead a three-letter word (with the help of an apostrophe and exclamation mark) in the script that reoccurs which packs much more wallop.\n\"When Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) hits his thumb with a hammer, he still says, 'D'oh!' That's our expletive of choice and has been for a long time, which I think is very, very funny,\" Groening said with a chuckle.\nBack To The Drawing Board\nWhile the idea of a \"Simpsons\" movie actually dates back to the show's early years, Groening and the film's core group of writer/producers -- James L. Brooks, Mike Scully and Al Jean -- didn't embark on their trip to the big-screen version of Springfield until 2003, when the \"Simpsons All-Stars\" writing team began fleshing out the script.\n\"We wrote the script for two years and kept tearing it apart -- I can't imagine how many pages we must have gone through,\" Groening said. \"Very little stayed in from the beginning to the end we changed so much. One writer quipped yesterday that we have two bad movies in the can to make up the good one.\"\nDirected by longtime show collaborator David Silverman, \"The Simpsons Movie\" finds Homer with a new pet pig -- and in a crap-load of trouble when leaky silo full of droppings sets off a monumental disaster in Springfield. Thanks to Homer's biggest blunder yet, an angry mob storms the Simpsons household as a result, which forces Homer, Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith), Maggie and Bart (Nancy Cartwright) to flee the town a divided family.\nIn addition to President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) and his EPA head Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks), the entire cast of Simpsons favorites also appear in the film, including Moe, Apu and Chief Wiggum (all voiced by Hank Azaria).\nWithout question, the biggest obstacle in creating \"The Simpsons Movie\" was coming up with a different spin, creatively, for the characters while maintaining the spirit of who the characters are. The last thing the creative team wanted was to create three episodes back-to-back-to-back (sans the commercials) and slap a \"feature film\" label on it.\nAs far as the characters were concerned, Groening said, it didn't come down to re-inventing the wheel -- just shining the hubcaps up a bit.\n\"For a while, we just tossed around what the expectations of the fans were and how we would honor the history of the show -- but then we just shoved all of that aside and decided to honor the people who worked on the show instead,\" Groening explained. \"The movie is a showcase for all the great actors that we had from the very beginning, including Hank Azaria -- who came on in the middle of Season 1 and we still refer to as 'the new guy.' Plus, we gave the crew much more ambitious animation to tackle than they are able to do on the show.\"\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the show and the film is the scope of it, Groening said.\n\"We knew that the story itself had to be bigger than a regular episode, and that it couldn't be a high-velocity, 'Simpsons'-style TV episode,\" Groening explained. \"It had to be a real story that people got caught up in. That's a tall order for a cartoon that's been on the air as long as we have. We've done more than 400 episodes and that's a lot of different stories.\"\n\"But I think we came up with a really big, summer blockbuster-type movie with an eco-catastrophe caused by Homer as well as the oddball sorts of things that you would never see anywhere else other than a 'Simpsons' movie, including Homer's relationship with his pet pig and an encounter with a wise medicine woman in the Alaskan wild,\" Groening added, laughing.\nDoing \"The Simpsons Movie\" created a weird parallel universe of sorts for Groening and company in that it was often times being produced at the same time the show was. There was a plan to treat the productions as separate entities, he said -- and for the most part, it worked.\n\"We kept the movie a secret from the TV show writers, but every so often, they would stray into territory that we were covering in the movie, like certain action sequences and jokes. They were instructed, 'Don't go there -- and we can't tell you why,'\" Groening said, laughing. \"They pretty much figured it out, and eventually, we included all the writers, and everybody who worked on the show threw in their two cents.\"\nBringing Back Brooks\nCrucial to the production of \"The Simpsons Movie\" was the return of Oscar-winning filmmaker James L. Brooks, the creative force behind such film hits as \"Terms of Endearment,\" \"As Good As It Gets\" and television's \"Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" While he's been on board as an executive producer since the beginning, he was a show-runner in the series' crucial early years.\nFox Image\nThe Simpsons (l to r): Marge and Maggie, Lisa, Homer and Bart.\n\"At the very beginning of the series, when we first talked about turning the idea from little, 15-second cartoons on the 'Tracey Ullman Show' into a full-fledged animated series, Jim said, 'We have to go for real emotion and the goal, at certain points, would be to make people forget that they're watching a cartoon,'\" Groening said. \"On the TV show, we rarely do that anymore. We're more involved in the exuberance of the comedy style that we love so much.\"\nBut with Brooks' direct participation again, Groening said fans will notice a change back in the other direction.\n\"With the movie, we're trying to go back to the roots of the show,\" Groening said. \"We're trying to choke people up at certain points. There's a core scene at the center of the movie with Marge where we recorded more than 100 takes of Julie Kavner trying different variations of this speech to make sure she got it exactly right. As it turns out, it's one of the times where the audience is very, very quiet in the theater. We're very pleased with the way it turned out.\"\nOne of the biggest questions surrounding \"The Simpsons Movie\" isn't about the movie itself, but whether the release of it is a bellwether for the end of the show. But with the announcement of the voice guest roster for the 19th season earlier this week, and the track record of another animated series after its run on the big screen, fans can take comfort: Groening, who is also heavily involved in the revival his other animated gem, \"Futurama,\" said \"The Simpsons\" isn't going away anytime soon.\nWhat he does hope goes away is a how people describe him as a certain Simpsons character: the Comic Book Guy.\n\"People pick the worst character on 'The Simpsons' to describe me,\" Groening goofed. \"Where are the redeeming features? Couldn't it have been Moe the Bartender?\"\nGiven his druthers, Groening said his Simpsons identity is actually divided between two characters.\n\"I'm a combination of Homer and Ralph Wiggum,\" Groening laughed.\nCopyright 2009, Internet Broadcasting.
