A fresh and interesting review from someone outside the Leica 'in-crowd' (and by that, I mean no offense towards Leica users -- it's just that this is perhaps a bit more interesting to read as an 'outsider'). I myself am considering buying a Leica, and while an MP is a long long way out of my budget range, your review brings up some interesting points that I believe are applicable to any recent Leica rangefinder.\nA very interesting read. Thanks.\nJoao Costa , January 10, 2006; 03:52 P.M.\nLeica today reminds me of Porsche in the late 80s: great brand equity, a company history closely associated with some of the most important technological developments in its industry, a fanatical follower base and a quirky, partly outdated product.\nPorsche has been able to survive (and prosper) because they are able to convince enough people to buy their very expensive automobiles so that they can fund their research & development. Does it matter that their products are way overpriced in comparison with less stellar auto marques? Not too much. Maybe there's a lesson for Leica there?\nOn a purely objective basis, I would much rather buy a Bessa...\nTom Westbrook , January 10, 2006; 04:18 P.M.\nI'm also a pretty recent Leica user (got a used M6 classic about a year ago) and agree with a lot of the things that Howard said. I always warn friends that just picking up the Leica can lead to instant infatuation. It is a marvelous thing to hold and take pictures with. Still, I keep finding that my Mamiya 7ii to be more my style and the final images give me more room to maneuver print-size-wise.\nThanks for the interesting review.\nP.S. I did comparison of the M6 and vs. a 8MP Panasonic DMC-LX1 (aka Leica D-Lux 2) here . Similarly unscientific, but interesting.\nTony Rowlett\n, January 10, 2006; 05:09 P.M.\nI never thought that turning the shutter speed dial to the left for a slower shutter speed, or vice versa, was the wrong way. I think of it as opening a jar for both the shutter dial and the f/stop ring. In this way they operate the same: turn them both in the \"open\" direction it to let more light in, and vice versa.\njohn perkins , January 10, 2006; 07:07 P.M.\nBeware the MP. I've had mine repaired more times than I would like, and now after 2 years and a bit, it's being repaired again - this time not under warranty. The warranty is nice, especially if you shoot a lot around salt water, deserts, fighting, or bars. Leica don't quibble, and do an express repair service for professionals, and will ship worldwide. Some camera problems: top plate comes loose, dust got in the eyepiece, shutter jammed, ASA dial jammed, broken frame counter, wind-on lever bent, sticking shutter speed dial, loose shutter speed dial. Some of these problems are pretty minor and don't stop you shooting (and I never carry a backup body), but compared to my old M6, the MP is not in the same league durability wise. Though I've also done horrible things to the M6, especially the rewind lever. Maybe it's because the MP is an early production model, before they sealed the viewfinder properly etc. Still, if it weren't for the repair policy I would have ditched this camera long ago. It's a great camera - when it works.\nSteve York , January 11, 2006; 03:52 P.M.\nI own two MPs (a 0.72 and a 0.58) -- one being relatively recent and the other being an older one with the old M6 iso dial. I've put a lot of film into the older one and have never had a problem. But the gent's experience above is disappointing. If I were he, I would demand Leica give me a new one -- sort of like the lemon law for cars. But I do think that is the exception, because I have not heard of many problems with these cameras.\nOne of the reasons I got into M photography was the mechanical nature of the cameras. I've had a few bad experiences of electronics failing w/o a backup at the wrong time. Of course, the camera is just a box, and what really counts is Leica optics.\nBut this camera, like the M6, has what I call the \"fun factor.\" Its just fun to use. I always look at photography in two ways: The taking of the picture and the final product. Now, great pics can be taken with any camera, but, for me, the joy and adventure of taking those pics is enhanced with this type of camera.\nVivek . , January 11, 2006; 04:52 P.M.\nInteresting review from someone who went to an expensive rangefinder from a failed Minilux.\nIs Howard Blumenthal a real person? I clicked on the name and it takes me to a no man's site!\nHoward B , January 11, 2006; 05:44 P.M.\nI'm pretty sure I'm a real person. As it happens, I'm also an author of a new book for creative professionals, hence the link.\nThe missing piece of the story: I've been using a Hasselblad 501CM and a Minilux. When the Minilux developed a problem, I used a different camera, realized how much I appreciated the quality of the Leica lens, and started exploring other Leica options (more grown-up than the Minilux), hence the review of the full-scale rangefinder.\nAs for the film used in the Canon, Leica and Hasselblad, it was all Iflord HP5 (400 ISO).\nHB\nVivek . , January 11, 2006; 07:48 P.M.\nThank you Mr, B., Now, I can see a profile as well.\nArthur Yeo\n, January 13, 2006; 02:20 P.M.\nHoward, we would love to see some of the images you took with this MP. THANKS for sharing your thots.\nBruno Trematore , January 14, 2006; 06:58 P.M.\nThe difference between the Canon and Leica images is impressive, given that the same film is used. Between Hassy and Leica it takes already some more attention to judge, but considering that one is 6x6 and the other 35mm... well...\nHoward B , January 15, 2006; 10:05 P.M.\nBruno:\nHere's where we get into shades of grey.\nThe Leica's superior contrast can be mimicked in the darkroom with a Hasselblad negative.\nBut, the Hasselblad's superior texture cannot be mimicked in the darkroom with a Leica negative.\nThe overall Hasselblad negative is superior because it's larger and so, it contains more information (hence the texture). Is a lens to be judged on the basis of its contrast range or on the basis of its ability to render natural textures? Let the debates begin.\nJan Virtanen , January 18, 2006; 02:54 P.M.\nLeicas and hasselblads are for different things. Sure you can buy a largeformat camera thats even cheaper than both, makes negatives that are technically far superior to either one, but it does not replace them.\nDavid Finch , February 02, 2006; 10:20 P.M.\nYes, the End Is Near. The NY Times reports that 92 percent of all camera sales is now digital. Nikon is getting out of the film equipment business (only the F6 and FM10 remain, and only temporarily); Konica Minolta isn't making any cameras anymore; Contax will soon be history; rumors are that Pentax will soon go completely digital. Soon enough the drugstore color processors will disappear, to be followed by the consumer labs.\nThat's why if I didn't already have one, I'd buy a new Leica MP before it's too late. B&W film is relatively cheap to manufacture and can be developed in the bathroom sink. It'll probably survive for decades as a niche product. The MP is a great camera, particularly for B&W. It's right up there with the M3. The MP is probably the last great artifact of film photography: When Leica goes, the MP will be gone. Unless you own one.\nGuy Hammond , February 03, 2006; 09:01 A.M.\nThe MP is probably the last great artifact of film photography: When Leica goes, the MP will be gone.\nBut we'll have the Zeiss Ikon instead...\nAndrew Robertson , February 10, 2006; 02:23 A.M.\nAnd sadly enough, Leica would prefer to cease operations than to be bought out. Probably, sooner or later, they will make a huge last run of cameras and lenses, sock them away in a warehouse somewhere, fire all the engineering and manufacturing staff (retaining the vital executives), and sell each camera and lens for $30-50K. Of course, they will keep the bold script and black paint.\nWhat Leica needs now more than ever is that mythical digital M. Not two or three years from now, as is the current plan, but NOW. Two or three years might be too late.\nBrian Minnich , February 16, 2006; 11:12 P.M.\nFire w/mp 24asph\nI purchased an MP for it's \"mechanical reliability\" but it too has been plagued with problems. First, a loose top plate, then an unresponsive shutter button, now the shutter curtain locked mid roll and was unhinged when I opened the camera. It's at Leica repair now for the 3rd time this year.\nI am quite disappointed, and hesitant to rely on the MP for a job.\nOn the upside, the 24mm asph is great, although I wish Leica lenses had a closer minimum focus.\nJD Rose , February 25, 2006; 01:51 P.M.\nI agree, bring on the Digital M...but, darn it, if it doesn't have a full frame sensor I think it will struggle.\nEtan Lightstone , March 08, 2006; 08:27 P.M.\nThe Leica market I just don't understand.\nIf you are a pro doing magazine shoots, journalism etc. you own an SLR. If you must an expensive one, but a leica rangefinder as \"magical\" as it, just doesn't get the job done. It's simply not versatile.\nWith that in mind... I can't possibly fathom spending $3,000+ on a camera like this. It certainly isn't going towards the astounding research and development going into these cameras.. because they are probably the simplest camera to design.. and the technology pretty much hasn't changed in years. The coveted Leica lenses are sharp... but its not particularly difficult or expensive to design a sharp lens the size and complexity of one for the leica M mount.\nSo someone with deep pockets who loves the gimmick buys it? I just don't follow...\nBrian Minnich , March 08, 2006; 10:53 P.M.\n4x5 w/ 80mm hp5\nI choose a mechanical camera for the same reason a writer would use a manuel typewriter over a computer. Probably the same reason Neil Young uses old Martin acoustics over Ovations. For me it helps cultivate the creative process.\nI use digital, but it's more of a client driven choice. For all my personal, and a growing number of assignment work I use a hand held 4x5 field camera w/o a view finder and a mp.\nFor me, digital is too immediate and cultivates an afterthought approach to working. A lot of the instinct, vision and intuitiveness are stripped away with automation and instant feedback from the lcd.\nSLR's, zoom lenses and all things digital provide infinite possibilities, but sometimes the raw vision in your head a simple mechanical click prove to be more powerful.\nEtan Lightstone , March 09, 2006; 12:09 A.M.\nBrian, I honestly don't buy it.\nThere is no voodoo null effect on creativity when you use a tool with more options.\nIt simply gives you more options. The mechanical simplicity of a Leica might put you in a certain state of mind of thinking simply because you know its a leica... but that's a giant load of placebo effect if you ask me :)\nBrian Minnich , March 09, 2006; 12:11 P.M.\nmp 35 f2 Fuji G 400\nThe difference in our thoughts is that for me it's not about the camera. It's about the final image not the tool in hand. I regard a leica the same as a holga.\nSome people need lots of gear with lots of options. I've progressed to the simplicity of low tech in favor of the final image.\nKen Davies\n, May 18, 2006; 05:56 P.M.\nIf a new MP is expensive and (according to several of the above, sometimes unreliable), try the original for a fraction of the price: a good used M3. You won't have to buy batteries for it. You will, though, need a reliable exposure meter.\nNeil Peters\n, June 22, 2006; 08:03 P.M.\nI've had a 35 year love affair with my M3 for a couple reasons. In one respect, its like when I play golf with my friend Chris. In his view \"its not golf if you don't carry your own bags\" (as in no cart, no caddie, lug that bag 18 holes and walk it). I think he's insane. Its exhausting. However, my MR meter has not been out of the box in 33 years. I guesstimate my exposures everytime. You get good at it, like its a lost art you get to work on, while you're also concentrating on the shot. The level of difficulty adds tremendously to the experience. Oh yes, I've lost dozens of great shots, being off on my evaluation of the light by 5+ f/stops. If its a must have shot, out comes the Elan 7. And many times I'll dupe the same shot with the Leica, now knowing the exposure. If you take alot of critical shots, I can see where this is a risky endeavor.\nThe other aspect is an article I read in the 70's. Someone using an SLR never sees the shot they just took. The mirror flips up and blocks it. Rangefinder, not an issue. Why is this important at 1/1000th of a second? Its not. The intent of the article was that an SLR user missed out on some spiritual connection at the moment of the exposure. I've never felt like I missed anything using the old F2, the Elan or the wonderful Mamiya 645. But for some silly reason, when I pick up the M3, I feel I have something extra going on. I know. I know. Its just me. But its real.\nRui Nogueira\n, July 13, 2006; 11:05 A.M.\nI do own an old Leica M3 with a 50mm F:2 lens. Nowdays I don't use it anymore. Mainly because it is meterless and loading film is a pain in the a$$. Then, when I want to shot b&w film I have a much better equipment, althought also obsolete today - a Nikon FE2 and those wonderfull nikkor AI and AI-S lenses. And the results are much better than those I used to get with the Leica. I would never pay $4K for a new Leica M and a standard lens. I think this is not a fair value for the money. Just my 2 cents.\nJorge Diaz , August 02, 2006; 02:26 P.M.\nThere's a readyness that builds up when shooting with a Leica M that accounts for the capture of those key moments that tell the exceptional story.It is related to the price you paid for the equipment cause it implies the seriousness of your endeavor.On top of that there's the performance of the hardware. I have a Leica D Lux2 and it is a nice little snapshooter but the fact that you have to look at a screen and for this compromise the angle to be able to see the screen runs against this readyness build-up.I mentioned that it is a Leica for poignancy.It could be any other brand of digital.The filtering and algorithms that the camera adopts to interpret hues,color saturation ,levels and contrast is much less controllable with a processor that your relationship to the film emultion.Just some thoughts prompted by reading the review that I don't recall reading anywhere else...and after leaving my M6 at rest in favor of the digital experience I have started missing the analog capture.Especially from a Leica M.\nRoger Beverage\n, August 24, 2006; 10:49 A.M.\nEither the Leica experience works for you or it doesn't. To me, my M3 is an ergonomic delight. The 35 and 50mm lenses can be focused with the tips of the left hand fingers, the shutter speed dial can be moved with the tip of the right index finger, with or without the meter, all without changing the grip on the body. You can shoot with both eyes open and it is as quiet as a mouse.\nSpend the extra money for lens speed if you must but the F2 Summicron remains a benchmark of optical design.\nI really don't understand the mechanical difficulties mentioned above relating to the new MP, but then, Leica is no longer controlled by the family.\nI admit that the collectiblity of Leica gear makes me a little paranoid about taking it to certain places, I don't want to get bopped over the head for it, but in spite of a growing collection of Pentax gear, it is my go-to camera for most situations not requiring macro or long telephoto capabilities, motor drive, or where noise would be an intrusion.\nAs stated more than once above, you just need to hold one once.\nRoger B\nTimothy Swan , December 02, 2006; 04:02 P.M.\nThe coveted Leica lenses are sharp... but its not particularly difficult or expensive to design a sharp lens the size and complexity of one for the leica M mount.\nIf you think the magic of Leitz optics is in the sharpness, then you really don't get it.\nSuk Hyun Joo\n, December 11, 2006; 03:30 A.M.\nI also recently purchased a leica MP. Several yrs ago I bought a Rollei RF camera because lecia M was way out of by budget. But somehow my rollei gave me some disapponinting results, and thus I made up my mind to sell my Rollei and by a lecia. it was a hard decision wether to buy the M7 or MP, and selecte3d a MO a dicision I wont regret. It is simple to use, give sharp imagaes and contrast, and also compact enough. I use 50mm/f1.4 summilux lens and Zeiss 25m m lens(I couldn't afford two lecia lenses). I too think this camera would be with me as long I can focus through the veiwfinder.\nPaul A. - Los Angeles, CA. , February 22, 2007; 06:46 P.M.\nI bought an MP because I want to see the black paint brassed. I've got it loaded w/ Kodachrome. When that is gone I'll turn to B&W.\nKermit Oswald , February 23, 2007; 05:14 A.M.\nI believe that what each of you posted here is true for you and I appreciate the chance to read your comments.I just purchased an MP this week after looking for a new black paint model for monthes.The MP will become the newest Leica in an ongoing love affair I have had with these wonderful machines since I first held one and clicked its shutter nearly five years ago.They are simply amazing cameras and I have never had a problem with any of them yet.Pushing the shutter down is like being kissed by this wonderful friend.I started photography with a Kodak Brownie 40 years ago(loading roll film is fun!).Loading Leicas is a joy no matter where I do it because it's the start of something really special.(and I have never dropped the bottom plate yet!)The M8 can't give you that joy.It's a great digital camera no doubt, and will create clean and crisp 10.3meg images but it's not film!I own nearly all the Leicas since 1926(including the M8) and shoot film through most of them regularly.The quality of the images from those early models is astonishing even by today's standards. The Leaf Company ,I understand, now has a controlling interest in Leica(I believe) and will most likely push the digital products.I've used their Leaf DCBII digital backs since 1998.Not fun like film.I agree that the drugstore photo counter is fast becoming extinct and that film developing and printing will be soon done at home.But for many of us, that's exactly where it started anyway.The Leica is simply a tool. It just happens to be one of the best tools I've ever held in my hands.As long as I can find film to load into these Leicas I will do that and smile at the possibilities that we can share together.Oskar Barnack would be proud of all of us for that.\nKevin Cotham , March 20, 2007; 10:44 P.M.\nLong live Leica and 35mm\nI'm 35, and I've used 35mm cameras since I was in high school. The digital cameras today have certain advantages, but the feel of a mechanical 35mm camera between your fingers is something that they'll never get right. I started with a Maxxum 7000i, a good camera. But bought it because the sales lady pushed me into it rather than the X-700 sitting next to it. The mechanical nature, the tactile pleasure, and the intuitiveness of twisting knobs and rings is so much superior to pushing buttons. In fact, I shoot exclusively with mechanical cameras now. My Maxxum 7000i (still running strong) sits in a drawer most of the time. I shoot with a Nikon FM3A, Bessaflex TM, Zenit 122, Zenit ET, Spotmatic II, Argus STL 1000, and a Yashicamat 124 G. It isn't often you won't find the FM3a in my hands. Why, because it's intuitive and super reliable. That all being said, I've dreamed of owning a Leica M camera for years. The images their lenses produce is unmatched. I just hope they don't stop making them before I can get one. And I sure hope they don't stop making 35mm film before I die! Long live Leica and any other company that makes a product to last. Companies that make products according to the rules of planned obscelence should be the ones to disappear!\nIf anyone has one of these dinosaurs in their closet and wants to donate it to someone who'll use it, let me know.\nchaitanya das tamayo , February 18, 2008; 05:58 A.M.\namen, bro!\na willing receptacle for donations of \"obsolesence\" right here! ;-)\nLeon F , April 12, 2008; 04:10 A.M.\nMechanical vs. automatic or digtial vs film? Before I owned the Leica MP, I had a Canon EOS 10D. On one of my trips I couldn't take the Canon with me and had to shoot with an old Zenith film SLR from Russia. I had more fun shooting with the Zenith than I had ever had with the Canon. With this film camera, I was actually \"creating\" something, rather than shooting, checking the lcd and re- shooting (a boring uninspiring process). Ofcourse the Zenith was old and not very good quality... . I kept it, sold my EOS 10D with all the accesoires I had collected and used the money to buy the Leica MP. Now, three years later, I'm still using the Leica MP and there has not been one moment that I missed the Canon or any digital camera. With the Leica MP there is no need to upgrade, it is the best built camera on the market and a sheer joy to use.\nMark O. , June 05, 2008; 05:53 A.M.\nI have never seen a Leica neg, let alone owned a rangefinder, but I picked the bottom right immediately. I'm not sure why. Have I been bitten? There was something about the sharpness and the contrast. I can't explain it.\nScott Frindel Cole , September 03, 2008; 11:30 A.M.\nAs a use of both Leica and Canon, I must say I'm suspicious of the difference in the photos posted. The Canon 50 should not be so soft, especially at middle apertures. Something wrong, like a defective lens, or improper focus?\nSteve Mareno\n, December 03, 2008; 10:07 A.M.\nI think that the image from the Canon is as it should be. It's because it's being compared to a Blad and a Leica that it looks so bad. Keep in mind these are crops and surely look much sharper at full frame. I used to shoot Canon FD gear, and when I compare the images that they made to my Leica shots they look pretty soft. On their own they look fine. The Blad is a different sort of camera. Capable of producing huge (by 35mm standards) enlargements w/ crisp detail, but it isn't a camera that you can throw around your neck and go down to the market and seamlessly shoot candids. It's hard to beat 6x6 w/ 35mm. The MP, and for me the M7, are probably the best cameras for candids and informal portraits. Obviously the excellent build quality makes the shooting experience more enjoyable, w/ the added bonus that if you can find better glass than the Leica M or R I would love to know about it.\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

View cameras are the most flexible cameras, usually made from a basic design that has not changed for over 100 years. You know the guy in the old time photo studio who photographs with his head under a cloth? He's using a view camera. Ansel Adams? He took most of his best photos with a huge 8x10\" view camera. All those luscious ads for food in magazines? Taken with view cameras.\nA view camera is fundamentally a light-tight box with a slot at one end for a lens and a slot at the other for the film. You compose and focus your image on a groundglass, then displace the glass with a sheet of film four by five inches in size. That's right, the negative from a view camera is about the same size as a proof print that you get back from a 1-Hour lab.\nI tried several times to teach a very intelligent friend how to use my Nikon 8008. Despite the camera's marvelous user interface and available automation, she simply couldn't remember what all the different controls were for. However, she had no trouble understanding my SINAR monorail view camera, an enormous contraption that intimidates 99% of experienced amateurs. That's because a view camera's controls are simple, direct, and physical.\nAnother advantage of having used a view camera is that it gives you an understanding of perspective. With a view camera, the lens and film aren't fixed parallel to each other. This opens up a huge range of creative opportunities that are unavailable to most users of 35mm and medium format gear. For example, if you want to take a photo of a building with a Nikon, you have to point the camera up towards the sky. You will then be projecting the vertical exterior of the building onto the angled film surface. The lines of the building will converge towards the top of the frame. With a view camera, you shift the lens up and/or the film down. The film is now \"looking up\" at the building through the lens, but the film is still parallel to the building exterior so lines don't converge.\nA used view camera outfit will cost you about $500. I prefer metal cameras such as Calumet, Cambo, Linhof, and Sinar. All view cameras work the same way. What you pay for in a more expensive camera is the assurance that when the controls are zeroed, everything is in fact parallel and you'll get a sharp picture. My friend Elsa has a beautiful Deardorff wooden view camera that we tried to use to copy her 20x24\" Polaroid originals. In theory this should yield high-quality images. In practice, it does not. I measured the camera with the indispensable Zig-Align mirrors (available from zigalign@compuserve.com for about $50) and discovered that the lensboard and film back were not anywhere near parallel. Nor could they be reliably kept parallel so we scrapped the idea and substituted an old metal camera instead.\nIf you're ready to buy a view camera, read \"Choosing a Large Format Camera\" and then\nView Camera Technique\n.\nAt right: the very first image that I made with a view camera, back in 1981. I was a 17-year-old undergraduate at MIT taking an intro photography course (the only one I've ever taken). We had old cheap metal view cameras, loaded Tri-X, and developed the film and prints ourselves.\n35mm SLRs\nThe 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) is most folks' idea of a serious camera. SLR means that the same lens is used for viewing and taking pictures. A mirror in the body directs the light from the lens up into a prism for viewing, then flips up out of the way just before an exposure is made. These are extremely versatile instruments in the right hands and can take beautiful pictures if used with care.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of SLRs are bought with cheap zoom lenses and then used with an on-camera flash as the primary light. There is nothing especially wrong with taking snapshots this way, but don't expect an SLR with a 35-80 zoom and an on-camera flash to take a better picture than a point and shoot camera . Furthermore, the point and shoot will fit into your pocket so you're more likely to have it with you when Fate sends the makings of a great image your way. The camera that is too expensive, too heavy, or too bulky to carry isn't of much use.\nIf you are serious about photographing people, animals, or travel, then an investment in an SLR may be wise. A good budget system would include a cheap body, a 50/1.8 lens, and a tripod . Add a portrait lens, a big telephoto, or a wide angle depending upon your needs. If you have relatively big bucks, consider really wide angle lenses (20mm or wider), high quality telephotos (300/4, around $1000), or professional zooms ($1000 and up). If you are tempted by the consumer zooms (apertures of f/4 or f/5.6 and prices of $300 or less), then you should ask yourself whether a point and shoot wouldn't be better.\n\"Minolta makes the best bodies, Nikon makes the best lenses, Canon makes the best compromise\" -- My rich friend Bob who has all three systems.\nYou're probably not as rich as Bob, so you'll have to decide on a camera system. Canon and Nikon enjoy an overwhelming dominance of the professional 35mm SLR market. There are good reasons for this and the dominance tends to be self-perpetuating because off-brand manufacturers don't have much incentive to invest in R&D. One can rent exotic Canon and Nikon lenses (e.g., a $4000 300mm f/2.8 telephoto) in most major cities but rentals for other brands are virtually non-existent. Finally, Nikon and Canon are probably the lowest cost systems for serious photographers because they have high resale value and economies of scale on the big lenses (e.g., a Nikon 80-200/2.8 costs less than a Pentax 80-200/2.8 because the Nikon is mass-produced for photojournalists whereas only a handful of Pentax's customers are in the market for lenses that cost over $1000).\nOne of the delights of reading Internet newsgroups such as rec.photo.equipment.35mm is the recurring flame war that erupts over whether prestige brands such as Leica are better than plain old brands such as Nikon. What it boils down to is that Leica makes some fairly nice, very expensive lenses. These handily outperform the low quality, cheap lenses that Canon and Nikon were forced to make to compete with Sigma, Tamron, and (shudder) Tokina. The $3150 Leica 180/2.8 does indeed outperform a $120 Nikon 70-210 zoom set to 180. That doesn't mean it outperforms the $700 Nikon 180/2.8, which is what a professional Nikon photographer would be using.\nIn the good old days, introductory photography instructors recommended the Pentax K1000, an all-mechanical metered-manual body. Instructors liked the K1000 because it forced students to make decisions about aperture, shutter speed, and focus. Another good feature of the K1000 was its lack of features. There are only three controls that affect the final image: aperture, shutter speed, and focus. A whiz-bang body with 25 buttons and dials, a few of which might help the professional attacking a specialized problem, is likely to confuse the beginner. Hand-in-glove with the K1000 went the 50mm prime lens. This was fast enough to permit available-light photography and freed the student to think about composition rather than where to set the zoom on a zoom lens.\nPentax discontinued the K1000. The only production camera that is similar is the Nikon FM2. This is a great body and any lenses that you buy to go with it will never be obsolete. However, the FM2 costs $450 plus $90 for a 50/1.8, which is more than some students want to invest.\nIf you're willing to flip a few switches, you can disable the automation on a Pentax ZX-M to function like the old K1000. With a 50/2 lens, this is only about $200. If you're willing to read an owner's manual and flip yet more switches, a modern plastic wonder body will work fine for the learner. And the automated features may prove useful later in the student's photographic career.\nWhatever you do, don't spend too much on the body. It is much better to have a good lens on a cheap body than vice versa. The body is ultimately just a light-tight box; the lens forms the image. Also, remember that if you get more serious, you'll almost surely want a second body.\nObsessing over the Great Canon v. Nikon Dilemma isn't very productive. The 35mm SLR is a 50-year-old technology, the market is quite competitive, and the systems have become rather similar. If you have a tripod and patience, you'll get a great photo with either system. It really isn't worth buying into the Canon EOS system unless you can afford at least an Elan 7 and one good USM lens, e.g., the 50/1.4 . See our review of the Canon Rebel for the most basic Canon stuff is frustrating. Thus if your budget is limited to under $400 what you want is a Nikon N65 + 50/1.8.\nAmateur Photographer\n, an English magazine, tested every 50mm lens on the market in May 1991. All performed very well, since the 50 is the easiest lens to make, but their expert rated the Nikon 50/1.8 AF lens as the best out of the 25 lenses tested, including snob brands such as Zeiss and Leitz and more expensive faster lenses such as the Nikon 50/1.4. Anyway, the Nikon 50/1.8 costs around $90 and has a reasonably nice manual focus ring, unlike its Canon counterpart. Finally, you'll want to budget enough for a tripod.\n[Note: After a year of having this advice on the Web, I've noticed that most people are ignoring it and filling the photo.net Q&A forum with questions like \"which (cheap) Minolta zoom lens should I get for this latest (whizzy) Minolta body?\". So I guess I am going to have to have some kind of bottom line recommendation for men whose penises are too small for the Yashica T4 and whose wallets are too thin for a set of lenses that would take a better picture than the $150 Yashica T4. Here it is... If you must have an electronic wonder body and a cheapish wide/tele zoom lens, get the Canon Elan 7 and 24-85 lens . The Elan 7 offers the best features of the Canon system: dual control wheels and the ability to move AF to the exposure lock button. The 24-85 is reasonably good quality, the wide setting is truly wide, and it has the delicious ring USM AF motor. Do not buy a third-party (and therefore non-USM lens) for a Canon EOS. Do not waste your money on a slow 70-210 zoom.\nIf you want to do something similar in the Nikon world, the N80 plus the 24-120 zoom would not be a bad toy.\nIf after reading this, you are still tempted to buy an expensive Nikon F100 body and cheap Tamron 28-200 zoom lens, keep in mind that you could make exactly the same public statement at a $1200 savings. Just buy a white T-shirt and a black laundry marker. Use the marker to write \"I'm a dickless yuppie\" on the front.]\nShould you decide to go the 35mm SLR system route, you might find my \"Building a 35mm SLR System\" article helpful.\nMedium Format Cameras\nMedium format cameras use 120 and 220 film (\"rollfilm\") and produce a negative approximately four times the size of a 35mm negative. Unfortunately, this makes them four times the size and 4-16 times the price of 35mm equipment. A Hasselblad or Rollei won't fundamentally do anything that a Nikon can't, so I'm afraid that I can't recommend any medium format camera as a good beginner's tool.\nAn exception to this rule is if you are doing your own darkroom work, in which case handling 35mm negatives is a chore. Medium format negatives are much easier to handle and a dust spot on a 6x6 negative is enlarged much less than one on a 35mm negative so that dust control is not such a problem.\nA Yashica twin lens reflex ($100-200 used) or a Fuji rangefinder camera ($700-1000 new) would be a reasonable place to start experimenting. Another approach would be to thoroughly read The Hasselblad Manual by Ernst Wildi. Now you'll know more about how to use the Hasselblad system than many owners. Then rent a 'Blad for a weekend.\n"}, {"score": 1313.3894, "uuid": "068a3c3e-d0c4-564e-8250-969930baf644", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-00-05831", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/equipment/leica/digilux2/", "page_rank": 1.2120466e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "The <em>Leica</em> Digilux 2 - <em>a</em> review - photo.net", "snippet": "<em>I</em> bought it <em>for</em> the straightforward analog controls.

When she was good, she was VERY VERY good - and when she was bad, she was HORRID.\u201d - Nursery rhyme\nThe Leica Digilux 2, and its Panasonic twin, the DMC-LC1, are an interesting exercise in digital camera design and ergonomics - in essence, a throwback to the shape and handling and analog controls of mechanical 35mm cameras from the last half of the 1900s. As an operating tool in the hand, the Digilux 2 is very successful. There are many shooting situations where being able to scale-focus the lens, or set the shutter speed on a dial - even before the camera has been turned on - greatly simplify and speed up operation, compared to the push-here-while-twirling-that-and-watching-the-LCD controls common on most non-SLR digicams. The Leica-designed lens is almost supernatural in its ability to define details and separate tones and colors, and pushes right to the limits of what 5 megapixels can record - a bonus I wasn\u2019t even expecting.\nSo ideally, I\u2019d start this review with the controls and handling and lens, because they are so distinctive.\nBut as a reviewer, I have an obligation to point out the worst features of the Digilux first - the HORRIDS. If you get past these and are still interested, then we can have fun with the camera\u2019s good side - which is occasionally amazing.\nTHE HORRID\nNo RAW buffer\nThe Digilux 2 can save pictures in a RAW format. And it does have built-in memory of about 11 megabytes or so. Enough to handle a burst of three \u201cfinest\u201d Jpegs (3.4 Mb each) in a little over a second before it has to pause and write to the memory card. But a Digilux RAW file is 9.6 megabytes, so it fills that memory with one picture, requiring a pause after every exposure. The \u201chang time\u201d varies according to the capacity and speed of the memory card in use: 5 seconds or so for a fast type II 512Mb SD card, up to as long as 13 seconds on the 64Mb SD card that comes with the camera. Six seconds on my \u201cregular\u201d 256Mb Lexars. So - you can shoot fast, or you can shoot RAW. Not both.\nAs a photojournalist, I\u2019d rather shoot jpegs anyway, as much for the time savings at the computer after the fact as those during shooting. A RAW workflow is like the Zone system - a brilliant tool for some kinds of photography, just not mine. But combined with the next issue, the lack of a fast RAW buffer has been a \u201cdeal-killer\u201d for many photographers who might really like to work with the camera otherwise.\nExcessive noise reduction in ISO 200/400 JPEGS\nWhen shooting JPEGS at ISO 200/400, the Digilux 2 employs a rather heavy-handed noise reduction routine. In Photo.net\u2019s review of the Digilux 1 people spoke of a \u201cSeurat filter\u201d. Well, this is more of a \u201cCezanne filter\u201d - as though a palette knife had been scraped over the light tones in the image. Does a great job at removing noise. Unfortunately, it removes a lot of fine detail as well. And it mostly affects the lighter tones, whereas the strongest noise is in the shadows. Ooops! You end up with smeared highlights, noisy shadows, and a weird transition area between the two.\nI queried Leica about what was going on here: Intentional noise reduction? Accidental JPEG artifacts? If it seems odd to ask for a manufacturer\u2019s comment in a review, I guess it\u2019s just my journalistic background - you ALWAYS try to get both sides. Here are the key points of their response, edited for space:\n\u201cSome noise at ISO 400 is not unusual for digital cameras. We tried to get a perfect colour management, sharpness and contrast but it is impossible to avoid completely noise....Image quality depends from the adjustments (colour, contrast, noise, sharpness). If you change the colour-management than you change automatically other settings or if you reduce the noise it could be that the images will not have the typical Leica sharpness. You can compare the effect with a 400 or 800 ISO film at the 35mm format. At 400 ISO there is a higher sensitivity. It is not a effect of jpeg compression. We are aware that noise is an issue so that we try more than our best to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 improve the technological and optical performance in future.\u201d\nReading between the lines, I get the impression that Leica (or Panasonic, or both) was overly concerned with noise. They sort of ignored the fact that I was asking about the noise REDUCTION, not noise per se. Perhaps they were panicked by the hits the Sony 828 has taken on the subject - and overdid the noise suppression as a result. As a photojournalist, I\u2019d prefer \u201csharp and noisy\u201d to \u201cblurry and noiseless\u201d. Or at least the option to choose for myself. There are workarounds, which I\u2019ll get into later. The most obvious one is to shoot RAW files, which bypass all \u201cin-camera\u201d firmware processing, and thus the noise supression. But get you back to the long delays between exposures.\nAnd if a camera has a bug that requires workarounds - it\u2019s still a bug.\nThe electronic viewfinder\nDespite the Digilux 2\u2019s vague resemblance to a classic rangefinder camera, it is not a rangefinder. The viewfinder is electronic - a TV set behind an eyepiece. It\u2019s jittery and grainy. Not any uglier than other EVF cameras (except the new Konica/Minolta A2 - which is a big leap forward). Better than a videophone broadcast from Baghdad. But if you\u2019re used to the crisp texture of an SLR screen or the brilliant clarity of a good window viewfinder, it\u2019s unlovely.\nIn addition to its general ugliness, the EVF also has three specific operational issues.\nFirst: Even at \u201c90mm\u201d, precise manual focusing is essentially impossible on the unmagnified screen. The camera can be set to magnify the center of the image 4x or 8x for manual focus (the magnification turns on when the focus ring is touched, and turns off a couple of seconds later), but even using this focus-assist, focusing at \u201c28mm\u201d is still troublesome.\nSecond: In really bright light the camera stops down the aperture to help control screen brightness. Usually - it opens back up for focusing (AF or MF). But on rare occasions (twice in 6 weeks) it has \u201cforgotten\u201d to do this. Using ISO 100 and a high shutter speed, this left me shooting at f/2.4 while trying to focus at f/5.6 (the reverse of an SLR, where you focus at f/1.4 and shoot at f/5.6). Even at \u201c90mm\u201d and with the magnification turned on, the DOF was so wide that an \u201cinfinity\u201d subject still looked sharp with the lens set as close as 4 feet - a recipe for fuzzy pictures. Pointing the camera at something dark and trying again cleared the problem each time.\nThird: the viewfinder lags behind reality by about 1/12th second (80 milliseconds +/-). The shutter lag on the Digilux 2 is pretty minimal, but the viewfinder lag has cost me \u2018moments\u2019.\nThat\u2019s the bad news.\nTHE VERY, VERY GOOD (and the merely nice)\nOn the flip side, at ISO 100 the Digilux 2 produces jpeg images at the rate of 1 per second-and-a-half even in single-shot mode that are not just very, very good - they are astonishing. And when the final pictures are this clear and detailed, the fact that the viewfinder image is grainy becomes a minor issue.\nTHE LENS\nThe lens is a non-interchangeable 7mm-22.5mm f/2.0-2.4 Vario-Summicron zoom, equivalent to a 28mm-90mm zoom for 35mm film. The widest apertures at the marked focal lengths: 28mm f/2; 35mm f/2; 50mm f/2.1; 70mm f/2.2; 90mm f/2.4. Focusing and zooming are internal - so the lens never changes shape or size. Since the zooming is mechanical, it does not have to extend or retract during startup/shutdown, saving seconds. Closest focus is about 1 foot (.3 meters) - which covers an area of about 4.5 x 6 inches (11cm x 16cm) at 90mm - hardly macro, but tighter than most non-macro lenses, and much tighter than almost any rangefinder lens.\nThe Vario-Summicron \u201cshoots\u201d wider than its \u201c28-90mm\u201d rating. The focal lengths are accurate if you crop the Digilux\u2019s 4:3 \u201cideal\u201d format to the shape of a 35mm frame. But if you use the entire Digilux image, the results look more like 8x10\u2019s (A4s) cropped from a 24-75mm zoom.\nPersonally, I love wide (my main film lens is a 21mm) - so I found this a pleasant surprise. The downside: at the long end, the V-S is barely a portrait lens - a \u201clong\u201d normal. Of course, many rangefinder photographers don\u2019t shoot longer than 50mm or 75mm anyway - so it fits into the \u201crangefinder\u201d ethos.\nLeica\u2019s film lenses have a slight bias towards cyan-green - or more accurately, away from magenta/red. The Vario-Summicron shares this tendency. It strips away magenta casts from sky and clouds. And water reflecting sky, or sky-lit shadows/shade, are rendered as cyan-blue, not purple-blue. Caucasian skin tones in sunset light tend towards golden, not ruddy. Darker skin tones are rendered in browns instead of purples. Evergreen trees are green, not brown or gray.\nThe lens is very sharp, has crisp edge definition, and does a superb job of separating and defining colors and tones. In most of my comparison images with film it has held its own alongside one of Leica\u2019s \u201csignature\u201d film lenses: the 35 f/1.4 Summilux-ASPH. At its peak apertures (f/4-5.6) it is projecting details so fine that they start interacting with the Bayer pattern on the image sensor, producing moires - witness the clothing textures and ebony tooling in the bagpiper picture - and dropping out fine details against the sky - see the tail-less bird below.\nSeems as though Leica/Panasonic have subdued or left out the \u201clow-pass\u201d filter in order to maximize sharpness, even at the risk of the occasional \u201ceel\u201d. (Moire, moray - hmmmm....never mind). Although the lens has a minimum aperture of f/11, diffraction begins to soften the image visibly below f/8.\nAt 28mm - barrel distortion is obvious, about 3-4% at the corners, and there is a moderate amount of purple/green color fringing (3 pixels-worth at the corners) in many pictures, Light fall-off is about 1.5 f/stops at the corners and is rather abrupt. (A note on barrel distortion - obviously a bad thing in many pictures. It does slightly reduce the stretching of faces and heads into football shapes (American football - rugby-ball elsewhere) near the corners, so it\u2019s a mild plus in \u201cpeople\u201d pictures.)\nAt 90mm - no distortion I could measure, occasional purple fringing in dark objects against the sky, very low vignetting (looks like about 1/2 stop at its worst).\nSince the true focal-length range is 7mm-22.5mm, depth of field is extensive. BUT - it isn\u2019t infinite. It is very easy to get less-than-sharp pictures even at the \u201c28mm\u201d setting if you don\u2019t focus carefully. At 4 feet and f/2 there is clear softening of the image from peak performance within 4 inches either side of correct focus. At \u201c90mm\u201d-f/2.4 the image starts to degrade visibly within 1.5 inches either side of correct focus. There\u2019s a big difference between \u2018apparently sharp\u201d and really sharp. If you want to get the best this lens can produce - you won\u2019t count too much on DOF.\nThe Vario-Summicron will blur backgrounds and foregrounds when used near its minimum focus at maximum aperture. When it does, the \u201cbokeh\u201d is about the prettiest I\u2019ve ever seen - the image just melts away from \u201csharp\u201d with a soft and delicate contrast, and no hint of bright rings or double images. But \u201cbokeh\u201d is obviously a non-factor in most Digilux 2 pictures.\nIn addition to the 3.2x mechanical zoom range, the Digilux 2 offers a 2x/3x \u201cdigital\u201d zoom which transforms the lens into a \u201c56-180mm\u201d or \u201c85-270mm\u201d. As with all digital zooms, it simply magnifies the image from the middle of the sensor, without gathering any more detail. Essentially useless for anything other than 4x6 prints or video, IMHO - and at 3x, don\u2019t expect to use the resulting images to prove you actually saw \u201cBigfoot\u201d or \u201cNessie\u201d.\nTHE BODY\nThe Digilux 2 body is a basic Bauhaus \u201cform-follows-function\u201d box, with a lens on one side and a light-sensitive surface on the other. Even Louis Daguerre would recognize it as a camera. I\u2019ve seen comments that it is \u201cstyled\u201d to look like a Leica rangefinder. But with its squared-off ends and large (69mm diameter) lens - it reminds me more of a Canon 7 wearing the legendary 50mm f/0.95, or perhaps a Nikon SP with a Nikkor 50 f/1.1 mounted, especially if the Nikkor and the Vario-Summicron have their massive lens shades attached.\nAll of the \u201cphotographic\u201d controls (exposure, focus, focal length, metering pattern, etc.) are analog dials, rings and levers. They all have a mechanical feel - though most obviously connect to electronics beneath the surface. The focusing ring is slightly \u201clight\u201d in touch, but allows one-finger focusing. The shutter dial rotation is oriented to match a Leica M6ttl or M7, rather than the \u2018opposite\u2019 design of older Leicas or the MP.\nAfter you have used the on-screen menu lists to set up your major shooting preferences (RAW or Jpeg, image size/compression, saturation/contrast/sharpness, etc.) and minor shooting preferences (color or B&W, ISO speed), it is possible to take pictures for hours, or even days, in all the automatic or manual modes, without ever again looking at a menu or LCD read-out, or touching a push-button - except, of course, the shutter release.\nAnyone who has ever used a Nikon F2 or Canon F1 or Pentax Spotmatic (or - yes, a Leica rangefinder) already knows where everything is and what it does.\nThe ergonomics of the Digilux are superb. With its centered lens, it is easier to hold, and much easier to hold steady, than the \u201cL\u201d shape used for most other top-end digicams, because the left palm has a corner to provide mutual support, instead of thin air.Since people vary, there is no perfect size and weight for a camera. The Digilux is heavier than a Leica rangefinder wearing a tiny 35mm Summicron, and lighter than the same Leica with a 35 Summilux ASPH. My shoulder loves it - my hands might wish for an ounce or two more heft at slow shutter speeds. The bulk is just inside the large end of my comfort zone - about the same as a small motor-incorporated film SLR (Nikon N/F80, Contax Aria).\nBuild quality is average. I wouldn\u2019t swear to any part of the body being metal, although some controls probably are. The lens barrel and rings are aluminum or some other light metal, not brass. And there\u2019s a rather tacky seam down the middle of the bottom plate. But my Digilux took a 3-foot fall out of my camera bag onto carpeted concrete the first night I had it, and survived with no marks or damage.\nAs with most rangefinder cameras, the viewfinder eyepiece is in the top left corner. This has great benefits for right-eyed photographers: you don\u2019t have to balance the camera on the tip of your nose (firmer support), people can see your face while you\u2019re shooting (a good way to establish and maintain trust), and, in the case of the Digilux, you aren\u2019t constantly planting nose-grease on the rear LCD. Left-eyed shooters end up the same place they do with most camera designs - out in the cold. (Has anyone ever built a camera that favors left-eyed photography? - seems unfair).\nThe analog controls, with each control handling one function, are very fast and very transparent. Not only can you set them with the power off, you can set two or three things simultaneously: left hand setting focus or aperture or focal length while the right hand is thumbing on the power and setting the shutter or meter pattern. All of which gets you to the important thing - pushing the shutter release - in the shortest time possible.\nTurn-on lag time\nLet\u2019s turn on the camera and set the lens to 6 feet for a quick \u201cscale-focused\u201d street photography grab shot. We\u2019ll use the Digilux 2, and a couple of other popular digicams, the Canon G5 and the Sony 828, which I tested at the local electronics-appliance store.\nOn the Digilux: Total time to \u201cready to shoot\u201d - turn on the camera and set 6 feet on the lens\u2019s analog scale - 2.7 seconds\nOn the 828: Total time to turn on the camera, turn on \u201cmanual focus\u201d and set 6 feet on the LCD readout - 5 seconds\nOn the G5: Total time to turn on the camera, turn on \u201cmanual focus\u201d and set 6 feet on the LCD\u2019s \u201cthermometer\u201d focus scale - 6-7 seconds\nNot to pick on the Canon and Sony, which do pretty well as digicams go. But a manual-focus \u201cfeature\u201d buried somewhere in the electronics is simply not in the same league as a focus ring on the lens that can be set with a flick of the finger even before the camera is powered up.\nThe viewfinders and focusing\nI\u2019ve already touched on the major flaws of the EVF. Every viewfinder ever conceived has been a Faustian bargain - there is always a trade-off between things it does well and things it does poorly. Rangefinder cameras can\u2019t frame accurately, can\u2019t focus closer than a couple of feet, have trouble aligning near and far parts of the subject precisely (parallax), and won\u2019t work with zoom lenses - but are very quiet and smooth. SLRs solve the problems of the rangefinder - at the cost of noise, shake and bulk. Both can be very fast to focus and provide clear (if different) views of the world.\nThe EVF combines rangefinder quiet and smoothness with SLR-like framing, focus range, and zoom capability - at the cost of an unpleasant view and slow (if eventually accurate) visual focusing. And while rangefinders and even SLR screens can get out of alignment, with the EVF you are focusing using the actual pixels that will make up the final picture - the image sensor can\u2019t ever get out of alignment with itself. It\u2019s still ugly - especially when sitting on the sofa and \u201cfondling\u201d the little beast. But it\u2019s funny - once I start shooting and paying attention to the world and the moments around me - how quickly the ugliness fades into the background. I\u2019m too busy seeing pictures to notice.\nSome people have experimented with using accessory viewfinders, rangefinder-style, to avoid the EVF. I tried it myself - and went back to just using the built-in finder. Didn\u2019t like being limited to one or two focal lengths; didn\u2019t like the parallax error; didn\u2019t like the big lens protuding into the viewfinder corner; didn\u2019t like the extra bulk on top. Very strange - since I use the same finders, with the same limitations, all the time for film photography.\nI use all the camera\u2019s focusing modes, depending on the situation.\nAt focal lengths above \u201c50mm\u201d, autofocus is usually fastest (the AF lock time is about 1 second). But I use manual focus when I don\u2019t want the focus point to shift between shots, or when I\u2019m using \u201ctrap-focus\u201d for action - or simply to avoid the AF lag when the \u201cmoment\u201d finally happens.\nAt 35mm and 28mm, I use scale-focusing for most fast work. For slower, critical manual-focus at f/2, I use the old film-maker\u2019s trick of zooming in to focus and zooming out to frame.\nAgain, the logic of the analog controls comes into play. With two rings side-by-side on the lens, it is simple and fast to change focal lengths and click between manual and autofocus without taking my hand off the lens or the camera away from my eye.\nThe Digilux has a single AF point in the middle of the frame. The size of the focus area has two settings - a \u201cspot\u201d area smaller than 1% of the image, and a larger \u201cbox\u201d about 1/5th the height and width of the screen. When using manual focus, the viewfinder can be set to magnify the center of the image when the focus ring is touched. At 4x, the magnified view appears in a box within the full-frame image, which supposedly allows one to keep track of the overall picture while focusing. At 8x, the magnified area fills the screen. I\u2019ve discovered that: 1) 4x really isn\u2019t enough enlargement for most critical focusing, and 2) holding the shutter button down lightly will turn off the magnification temporarily to allow a quick check of overall framing anyway (a nice \u201cundocumented\u201d feature). So I always use the 8x setting.\nThe internal viewfinder and rear LCD show identical views. Only one or the other is on at any time, and a button on the back toggles between them. The rear finder is almost as large as a 645 film frame, but is not hinged for low/high-angle shots. One very smart feature is that the viewfinder of choice can be set separately for shooting or reviewing pictures. So that flipping the shoot/review lever automatically switches you to your preferred viewfinder with one motion.\nIn shooting mode, four levels of information can be shown in the viewfinder.\nThe most basic shows you nothing but the image and the AF \u2018box\u2019 - until you touch the shutter button, at which point the aperture and shutter speed appear, along with a \u201cmatch-needle\u201d scale if you\u2019re setting exposure manually. There is one bug using manual exposure in this view: the needle and numerical readouts won\u2019t change in real time as you change apertures or shutter speeds. You must lift your finger and touch the shutter again to get an update on the \u201cnew\u201d actual settings and metering.\nA touch of the \u2018display\u2019 button overlays a \u201crule of thirds\u201d grid on the basic image.\nAnother touch, and you get information overload: Exposure info, battery status, focus/flash/ISO/white-balance mode icons, remaining exposures, etc. etc. Las Vegas in a camera. But in this view, touching the shutter does turn on a \u201clive\u201d scale and readouts for manual metering that stay on for 10 seconds, or as long as you keep moving the aperture/shutter controls. Finally, you can add a live histogram (brightness only, not colors) to the \u201cLas Vegas\u201d view.\nIt is possible to see an \"auto review\" of each picture in the viewfinder after every shot, for 1 or 3 seconds. I immediately turned this off, since I am far more interested in the next picture than the one I've already taken. In which case there is simply a viewfinder black-out of 1 second while the camera starts to save the image.\nIn picture review mode, the camera can show your collected images as a 3x3 array of thumbnails, for fast navigation, or one image full-screen, or a zoomed view into that single image up to 16x.\nThree levels of picture information can be displayed in the single picture/1x view: nothing but the image; basic picture info (frame number, date/time of exposure, file size/type); and the basics plus detailed exposure info (histogram, aperture/shutter speed, metering mode, etc.). It\u2019s also possible to resize and crop images, set up DPOF info for requesting prints from a mini-lab, play slide shows and video, and some other stuff - none of which I use.\nNeither viewfinder is especially good for critical evaluation of exposure, color, or sharpness. You can tell if you missed the moment, or if the exposure or focus were really off. Otherwise I save my editing for the computer monitor, where the images are generally sharper, warmer, and darker than the camera displays them.\nI won\u2019t go into all the possible menus that can be brought up on the screens - every possible control from setting the internal clock/calendar to choosing how many prints to order. I\u2019ll just mention two other nice touches. You can select your 4 most often-used controls - perhaps ISO, contrast, white balance and auto-focus area - and assign them to a \u201cquick function\u201d list that can be accessed via the 4-way toggle button, saving a lot of scrolling through menus. And in most cases, simply touching the shutter button will \u201cclear\u201d all menus/functions and take you directly back to shooting. A fast \u201cescape\u201d key.\nShutter lag\nI compared the shutter lag of the Digilux 2 to a Leica M6.\nI found an intersection where a building blocked my view of oncoming cross-traffic, so that I couldn\u2019t anticipate when a car would enter the scene. Then I shot a series of pictures with each camera, pressing the shutter as soon as I saw a car bumper appear from behind the building. Focus was set manually. With the Digilux, I shot two series, one using the internal viewfinder, and one where I watched the scene directly, to see if the EVF had any additional lag. In the resulting snaps, I marked how far the car bumpers had moved by the time the shutter actually exposed the picture. What I was measuring was shutter lag PLUS my reaction time - but it\u2019s still possible to compare relative lag times.\nThe diagram shows the results. Lines mark the actual bumper positions, the arrows mark the average for each group. Within each series, the variation is likely a combination of my reaction time and small changes in traffic speeds. The much larger variation for the M6 is interesting, and could be due to the mechanical linkage-chain in the shutter. The traffic was moving at 20 mph (I drove the street 3 times to check this) - which is 30 feet per second. Each foot of movement thus equals about 33.3 milliseconds.\nWith the M6 (which has a known shutter lag of about 20 milliseconds), the average total distance traveled was 7 feet. Total lag (including my reaction time) was 233 msecs.\nWith the Digilux 2 and direct viewing, the cars had, on average, moved an additional 1.5 feet, or an additonal lag of 50 msecs. Added to the Leica\u2019s 20 msecs., that makes a shutter lag of about 70 msecs.\nWith the Digilux 2 using the EVF, the cars had moved yet another 2.5 feet, on average, for an additional \u201cviewfinder\u201d lag of 83 msec., and an overall lag of 153 msecs.\nDespite the long time needed to save RAW files, when shooting fine jpegs, the lag between exposures is 1 to 1.5 seconds, about the same as thumb-winding a film camera.\nCamera noise\nThe Digilux 2 is essentially silent. When the shutter is pressed, there is a faint internal \u201ctic-tic\u201d (I think it\u2019s the aperture blades shifting to shooting aperture). About on the level of the quietest leaf shutters, at most. No focusing sound - manual or auto. It\u2019s possible to dial up one of three \u201cHollywood\u201d shutter sounds (\u201cclack\u201d, \u201cclick\u201d, or \u201ccluck\u201d) that play when you fire the shutter. But to use them you must also put up with a loud \u201cbeep\u201d that plays when the AF locks, and EVERY TIME you press a button on the back: choosing from menus, setting functions, scrolling through pictures, deleting pictures, confirming deletes, switching viewfinders. BEEP BEEPBEEP BEEPBEEPBEEP. Obnoxious. And the \u201ctic-tic\u201d is enough to tell me the shutter fired. So I leave the noises off.\nFunny how often people eventually asked \u201cWhen are you going to take the picture?\u201d - after I\u2019ve already nailed a dozen candid moments and expressions from 4 feet away. Silence is golden.\nThe glove test\nJust for grins, I put on a heavy set of ragg-wool gloves and tried operating the Digilux. In general, it was easy to handle all the controls (analog and digital) smoothly and without affecting neighboring buttons/rings/dials. Occasionally the focus would shift a bit when turning the aperture ring. The control wheel on the back was very slippery and hard to turn with gloves, but fortunately most of its functions can be handled by the 4-way button inside it, which worked fine. And while it was easy to slide open the door for the memory card and press/release it - it was then impossible to get a grip on the card and remove it the rest of the way. If you\u2019re going to shoot in cold weather - start with an \u2018empty\u2019 memory card so you won\u2019t need to replace it - or bring tweezers.\nFlash\nThe Digilux 2 has a built-in pop-up flash. Press a button on the back once, and the flash head pops up to a 60-degree angle for bounce flash. Press the button again, and the base pops up another 60 degrees, pointing the flash at the subject. The bounce flash is surprisingly powerful. I get nicely exposed bounce shots even at ISO 100 in settings where my \u201cfilm\u201d flash (Vivitar 2800) often poops out on slide film. (Having an f/2 aperture helps, of course). Due to the 60-degree bounce angle, the flash provides a small amount of \u2018kick\u2019 light directly at the subject as well as bounce - but also sets a limit on how close you can shoot. Under an average ceiling, once you get closer than about 5 feet, the \u201cpool\u201d of bounced light is directly above, or even behind, your subject. Using direct flash, the huge lens shade will cast a shadow in the bottom of pictures shot at \u201c28mm\u201d - but the lens alone will not.\nSo far as I can tell, the Digilux has about every possible flash capability generally available - normal sync up to 1/2000th second (yes, 3 zeroes is correct!); slow-speed sync; sync at the beginning or end of the exposure (I refuse to call it \u201csecond-curtain-sync\u201d when the camera has no shutter curtains); flash exposure compensation of +/- 2 stops for fill. The camera also has a standard hot-shoe, with dedicated contacts for use with Leica/Metz flashes. Other flashes with safe trigger voltages can be used, but must depend on their built-in automation rather than TTL. No PC outlet - you\u2019d need some kind of adapter (radio, slave) for work with studio strobes. There is a physical lock/switch in the shoe that will turn off and lock down the pop-up flash if ANYTHING - even an accesory viewfinder - is mounted in the shoe. The switch also changes the flash firmware to \u201cexternal-flash\u201d mode - no pre-flash, but otherwise the same options as using the internal flash.\nThere is a separate \u201cflash\u201d white-balance setting to compensate for the coolish color of the flashtube. I \u201cgelled\u201d my flash for that warm \u201csunset light\u201d look, and to balance with tungsten lights indoors, by the simple expedient of coloring a piece of translucent office tape with an orange marker and sticking it on the front.\nEXPOSURE AND IMAGE CONTROLS\nThe Digilux can expose in the standard 4 modes - manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, or program.\nThese modes are set via the aperture ring and shutter dial. Set the aperture to \u201cA\u201d and the camera will choose the aperture as you choose the shutter speed. Set the shutter dial to \u201cA\u201d, and the camera will choose the shutter speed as you change apertures. Set both to \u201cA\u201d, and you are in program mode. The program mode can be biased towards either fast shutter speeds/large apertures or slow shutter speeds/small apertures by thumbing the serrated silver wheel on the camera back.\nIn manual mode you set both the shutter and aperture yourself, using the internal meter readout\u2019s \u201cneedle\u201d as a guide, or using a hand-held meter, or even just using the old \u201cSunny-16\u201d rule-of-thumb. The meter can be set to center-weighted, spot metering, and \u201cmulti-area\u201d patterns. The spot meter reads about 1% of the image area - roughly 2 degrees at \u201c90mm\u201d and 6 degrees at \u201c28mm\u201d. One advantage of a \u201cshutterless\u201d digicam is that the exposure can be metered directly from the live image sensor voltages instead of through a surrogate metering circuit/sensor.\nThe Digilux 2 uses this ability to \u201cprotect\u201d the highlights when set to multi-area or centerweighted metering patterns. It pins the brightest pixels to about a level of 245-248 on the histogram, preventing burned-out whites.\nOutside of ISO speed, there are 4 main \u201cdigital\u201d image controls for JPEG shooting (they have no effect on RAW files). Contrast, Saturation, and Sharpness can be set to \u201cStd.\u201d, \u201cLow\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d. And apparently this is the sole difference (except cosmetics) between the Leica and Panasonic cameras - the Panasonic\u2019s settings are all a bit \u2018higher\u2019 than the Leica\u2019s.\nI generally work with sharpness set to \u201clow\u201d and the other two set to \u201cstd.\u201d Setting contrast and saturation to \u201clow\u201d results in very softly toned images, with histograms that end well short of black and white, and the appearance of a freshly-born TIFF from a RAW file. An excellent starting place for some kinds of landscape work, with a long tonal range (but obviously not sharpness) that approaches large-format images.\nDue to the meter\u2019s habit of protecting the highlights, changing the contrast when using autoexposure has the effect of lightening or darkening the shadows - moving only the left end of the histogram.\nThere are also seven White-Balance settings: Auto, sunny, cloudy, tungsten, electronic flash, manual - and black-and-white.\nGenerally, I find the AUTO setting to be most reliable for daylight use. \u201cSunny\u201d is generally too blue (especially here in Denver, where there is a lot of extra UV light at a mile high). Cloudy and flash go a bit overboard in adding yellow/red. Tungsten does OK, but undercorrects a bit, leaving some residual yellow under house lights.\nThe Manual setting also tends to run a bit on the yellow side. Looks great on the bluish LCD when reviewing pictures, but too yellow once the pictures are loaded into Photoshop. It\u2019s the best choice under non-daylight light sources, but needs to have a lot of blue compensation dialed in if the light is short on blue wavelengths (see blue-channel issues below).\nThe B&W mode is interesting, and I like to use it if I am looking for B&W pictures. But it eliminates the option of playing with Photoshop\u2019s \u201cchannel-mixer\u201d after the fact to darken skies and such. Comparing a \u201cB&W\u201d shot of a Gretag ColorChecker to a color image converted via the channel-mixer, the camera\u2019s internal channel-mix is roughly Red 35%/Green 55%/Blue 10%. JPEG files are actually monochrome RGBs, not grayscale. And the B&W setting doesn\u2019t affect RAW files, which by their nature still contain the full color data from the original Bayer pattern of the pixels.\nThe blue channel has some issues, at least in JPEGS.\n1) Testing color rendition with the ColorChecker, most colors are rendered quite well, but blues - especially dark \u201cnylon sportswear\u201d blues - and to a lesser extent, yellows, tend to hypersaturate.\n2) Under lighting short in blue wavelengths - tungsten, fluorescent, sodium vapor - even when \u201cwhite-balanced\u201d, the blue channel develops large blobby noise, which shows up as an \u201cunderpainting\u201d of yellow patches at all ISOs, but especially 400. The actual blue channel looks like a Kodalith image of out-of-focus oatmeal - no fine details, no tonality. Shooting at EI 100, manually white balancing, adjusting the white balance as far to the blue side as possible, and being generous with exposure (+1 EV) will boost the blue exposure to a reasonable level - pictures still need some Photoshop work to fix color balance and saturation, but at least the blue channel contains detail. The camera is still much happier with full-spectrum light (daylight, flash or blue photofloods).\n3) Blue lights bloom excessively in night exposures (see section below on night/time exposures)\nOVERALL IMAGE QUALITY\nLet\u2019s make it simple. I wanted a digital camera that could do better than the 2700-ppi scans I was getting from ISO 100/160 color negative films. I hoped wistfully for a camera that could come close to scans from ISO 100 slide films. That is what the Digilux 2 delivers. As I mentioned in discussing the lens, the sharpness and occasional moire patterns in fine details lead me to believe that Leica/Panasonic have chosen to limit the amount of low-pass filtration over the Bayer pattern - a route that Kodak, in the 14n/ProN/ProC, and Nikon, in the new D70, also seem to have followed.\n(BTW, in the film/digital comparisons here, the Digilux 2 images were upsampled about 40% to match image size with the film scans. In the D2-only examples, the pixels are 100% as they came from the camera unless noted otherwise.)\nAt ISO 100 the images are very smooth and clean - not quite as sharp as Velvia, but a good match for the average 35mm 100 slide film. An overall look a lot like Ektachrome 100VS with some Kodachrome and Velvia touches thrown in - and with adjustable saturation and contrast. Clearly less \u201cgrainy\u201d noise than scans from color negs. But there is occasionally a cyan-red patchiness (Chrominance noise?) in dark grays or blue-green areas like architectural glass.\nThe most startling thing about digital color is that, properly white balanced, it is remarkably clean and free from color casts compared to chemical imaging/scanning. There is something to be said for working directly from the subject\u2019s original color wavelengths, rather than an image \u2018filtered\u2019 through various stages of chemical dyes and scanner/enlarger optics. It\u2019s scary when you open a color image and all the grays have identical amounts of RGB - 160/161/160 or 120/119/120 or the like.\nOn the other hand, the Digilux 2\u2019s jpeg images are somewhat \u201cbrittle\u201d. If you don\u2019t nail exposure, white balance, saturation and contrast in the camera, and have to start making major corrections in post-processing, they can fall apart rather quickly.\nB&W pictures follow the same pattern. At 100 the Digilux is a bit ahead of \u201ctraditional\u201d ISO 100/125 silver films in terms of grain/noise, but not TMax/Delta or ISO 50 film. Sharpness is a tiny bit lower, and the overall feel of grainless highlights and a touch of grain/noise in the shadows comes closest to chromogenic B&W films such as Ilford XP2.\nWorkarounds for using ISO 400\nShoot RAW and accept the lag between shots\nAdd some \u201cgrain\u201d in Photoshop to fill in the \u2018smoothed\u2019 areas, and the results are still nearly as sharp as some \u201cold technology\u201d 400 B&W films.\nSet the camera contrast to \u201chigh\u201d - which increases local contrasts enough to \u201cburn through\u201d a lot of the noise smoothing, but drops out a lot of shadow detail.\nOr my preferred technique when I need ISO 400 jpegs: set the camera to ISO 100, contrast and saturation settings to \u201clow\u201d, and underexpose 2 stops (EI 400 instead of ISO 400).\n(Pause while the \u201cexpose to the right\u201d fans stop choking and get their hearts started again).\nThen I lighten the resulting dark images in Photoshop (after converting to 16/48-bits and upsampling to avoid posterizing/combing the histogram as much as possible) using curves and levels.\nOutcome: almost no smoothing, at least a 4x increase in resolution over the \u201csmoothed\u201d parts of a straight ISO 400 picture, an increase in noise (probably to about where it would have been at 400 if Leicasonic weren\u2019t smoothing it), and a slight increase in saturation. Nice crisp clear \u201cISO 400\u201d pictures. Less grain than most 400 color negs I\u2019ve scanned, a bit worse than Provia 400f, especially in the shadows.\nIn the image above, the bottom row shows straight exposures at ISO 100/200/400. The upper images were shot with the camera set to ISO 100 but underexposed 1 and 2 stops and lightened in Photoshop. Note especially the faint rays in the top of the label - erased in the 200/400 exposures, retained in the \u201cpushed\u201d ISO 100 shots.\n\u201cPushing\u201d Digilux images beyond 400\nThe Digilux 2 is limited to ISO settings of 100/200/400. For many photographers, that\u2019s not enough. Since my \u201cpush-processed\u201d images from ISO 100 to 400 worked pretty well, I also experimented with underexposing and \u201cpushing\u201d ISO 400 images to higher EIs.\nPut simply - the JPEG noise reduction at ISO 400 has already fouled the image so badly that it can\u2019t hold up to any further strain on the pixels. Even at EI 800 the results are as ugly as the average ISO 3200 film. In a \u201cnews emergency\u201d I could get a publishable newspaper picture at 800 or 1600, but not something I\u2019d want to hang on the wall.\nIf Leica sees fit to change the firmware and make the JPEG noise-reduction \u201cuser-adjustable\u201d - or if one works from RAW originals - better results may be possible. Otherwise, once the light drops below what f/2 and ISO 400 can handle, it\u2019s time for an f/1.4 lens - on an SLR with a bigger chip and less noise reduction, or a film rangefinder. Or flash. Or (uggh!) a tripod.\nNight shots\nSpeaking of tripods (which I normally use about once a year) - I did try a few long exposures. The Digilux 2 is limited to an 8-second maximum exposure time, and uses a \u2018dark-frame\u2019 second exposure to map and subdue \u2018hot\u2019 pixels. I don\u2019t see much noise beyond the normal amounts for ISO 100 or 400 in an 8-second exposure - perhaps 50 specks out of 5 million pixels that might be under- or over-corrected hot pixels. The dark-frame exposure is not user-adjustable, and kicks in at 1/2 second - which snuck up on me a couple of times when I was making hand-held 1/2-sec. pictures.\nThe wonky blue channel shows its stuff. Blue lights \u2018bloom\u2019 like a 7-pixel gaussian blur, and over the rest of the picture the blue channel is essentially black. Red and yellow lights bloom a bit, green lights the least. White lights show purple fringes - red and blue blooming combined.\nThe attached image is a crop, but not a 100% view of the pixels.\nIN SUMMARY\nAs an operating tool in the hand, the Digilux 2 is almost exactly what I wanted in a digital camera. I love the silence and stillness. I like the compact, grippable ergonomics. The manual controls, quick start-up, and short shutter lag simply outperform anything less than an SLR (and even a few of those) when it comes to fast work on the street, or wherever the action is. The ISO 100 image quality is extremely good - challenging the results from film scans with twice as many pixels due to the lens\u2019s outstanding resolution.\nI could wish for an alternative to the video viewfinder, so long as it retained the manual focusing, silence, and accurate framing. Don\u2019t see any way to do it without giving up something else, though.\nI could wish very strongly for an upgrade to the camera\u2019s software that would make it possible to turn off the noise-suppression at ISO 200/400 via a menu selection similar to the color and saturation settings. Shouldn\u2019t take more than 100 lines of code. Leica - are you listening?\nI could wish for an 8Mp sensor to capture more of the lens\u2019s abilities. And I\u2019ll acknowledge the usefulness of a bigger buffer for RAW shooters - though I personally wouldn\u2019t use it much.\nNo kidding around, though. If I weren\u2019t primarily an ISO 100 photographer, and willing to use creative workarounds on the few occasions I need 400, I would not be nearly so happy.\nThis is probably as good a place as any to say that I did not buy the Digilux 2 for the Leica nameplate. I bought it for the straightforward analog controls. If Nikon or Canon or Minolta had produced a camera as \u2018manual\u2019 as the Digilux 2, I would have bought Nikon/equipment/canon/Minolta - whichever came first.\nI chose the Leica over its Panasonic twin because it was available. As of this writing (late April 2004) I have yet to see a DMC/LC-1 in the flesh, whereas I\u2019ve already shot 2200 exposures with the Digilux. That\u2019s 60 rolls of film - or $660 in film/processing costs. So I\u2019ve already recovered more than the Leica/Panasonic price difference.\nAnother 2-3 months of shooting, and I\u2019ll be able to slap a \u201cDon\u2019t laugh - It\u2019s paid for\u201d sticker on the Leica. At which point the Digilux will be the same price as any other well-used digital camera - free.

This is a good example of the Leica\u2019s color and rendering performance in open shade. In this instance, the AWB was pretty accurate. This also demonstrates the qualities of the 50mm Summarit-M\u2019s nice bokeh. Capturing at f/4, which is near the close focusing limits on this lens, puts the background out of focus. Note the graceful transition from sharp to blur.\nKirk Tuck\nLeica 75mm f/2.5 Summarit-M ( review ). This image demonstrates the very high sharpness achieved by the 75mm. The lighting is open shade. Note the sharpness of her hair and eyes, in addition to the pleasant bokeh of the background.\nKirk Tuck\nLeica 75mm f/2.5 Summarit-M ( review ). Noellia\u2019s eye close up. This is a 100% crop of her eye from the previous photo. The 75mm is able to deliver high sharpness without artifacting.\nKirk Tuck\nLeica 75mm f/2.5 Summarit-M ( review ).

Matt from Sydney\nWesley Swan , October 21, 2008; 07:35 P.M.\nThe parts of the article I read were great. I don't have a clue what other photographers will think, but me personally I'd read any article with such a pretty model :)\nJohn Lambert , October 22, 2008; 12:15 A.M.\nHad difficulty reading the article about the Leica with such a luscious little hottie in sight.\nChristopher Moss\n, October 22, 2008; 08:40 A.M.\nOn turning the M8 on the red light flashes for a second, but you can take photographs before it finishes flashing.

Thanks!\nGadge A , October 22, 2008; 09:28 A.M.\n10/10 - First article I have read that fully explains the positioning and design philosophy of this camera. Now I finally understand its benefits and associated issues.\nI still can't afford one though :-)\nKirk Tuck , October 22, 2008; 11:39 A.M.\nGadge, if you want more information about what makes all M cameras a more compelling choice you might want to take a moment and read my review on the Leica M6 that is also located somewhere on Photo.net.\nThe differences between traditional SLR's and the Leica M cameras is fleshed out in a little more detail.\nThanks to all for the positive feedback I've received on the article so far.\nKirk\nJorge Diaz , October 22, 2008; 12:39 P.M.\nExcellent review.I sometimes use a Summar (circa 1932) on my M8 for definitely different photographic qualities. One thing about Leica M lenses is the relaxed life they have relative to SLR's opening and closing diaphragms on each shot.A lot of wear and tear is avoided.No springs to fatigue.Leica lenses are usually more expensive but they have superior longevity built in too. Cool model.Considering all that java. I got a jolt just by looking.\n, October 22, 2008; 01:55 P.M.\nKirk,\nI like the review, but you say nothing about the dreaded IR issue. Was this because it is a non-issue for you? Did you use the IR filters?\nKirk Tuck , October 22, 2008; 02:40 P.M.\nRobin, I did not use UV filters and I never encounter the dreaded IR effect. I shot in all kinds of light and with different kinds of fabrics but nothing happened. I would guess that the newest lenses have coatings with stronger UV resistance than previous ones which might serve to obviate the use of the filters. Absolutely no magenta or fringing. Problem resolved?\nTorben Daltoft , October 23, 2008; 12:39 A.M.\nThis \"review\" is neglecting that the competitors have image stabilisation, plus a handful of other essential features (think of sensor cleaning)....and thus shows its value\nKirk Tuck , October 23, 2008; 11:35 A.M.\nWrong. I covered the benefits of no moving mirror mass and how it relates, shutter speed setting-wise, to the more conventional cameras. It is a camera meant to fill a niche, not to compete with DSLR's already in the market. The lack of mirror movement somewhat makes up for the lack of VR in the body. Not all cameras need to have every feature available. In fact, famous Leica enthusiast sees the \"no frills\" M cameras as a simplification back to basics and makes the case that the streamlined approach benefits seeing.\nJohn Fleshin , October 23, 2008; 01:34 P.M.\nGood review, glad I caught it, just had mine serviced and upgraded. Are you shooting the auto spot on or adjusting a mite? Was your sample with the new firmware and/or frame lines? Do you see any reason to shoot raw + jpeg? Am afraid I have quite a mixture of vintage glass, so your conclusions about the blue shift might well be a problem solved with new lenses?\nWere you able to use the Dual Range 50mm with it?\nRegards, John\nKirk Tuck , October 23, 2008; 01:42 P.M.\nJohn. The camera had the latest firmware and frame lines. I used my Dual Range Summicron on it without any issues. I've never been a fan of shooting Raw+jpeg as I end up just using the raws in most cases.\nKirk Author: Minimalist Lighting\nArne H. Heeringa , October 25, 2008; 07:51 P.M.\nGreat article, though I might prefer the R-D1s because of its price. I've tried a Sigma SD10 which is kind of a no-nonsense camera with some good features like seeing more in the viewfinder than the actual frame only, like Leica. I gave it up in favour to my Nikon F2 and Nikkormat FTN because of it's bad AF, terrible battery life, bad AWB and bad lens. Great sensor though. Fact that the camera was changed for a new one by Sigma didn't change a thing. My Konica Revio KD420Z P&S digital was way better before it was wrecked, but I want to do some creative photograhy myself too and don't leave everything to the camera. So I turned back to film with my Nikons, Olympus 35LC rangefinder, Rolleiflex, Agfa Isolette L and so on. I would like to stay with manual because AF don't seem to work for me and then Leica & Epson are the only options. I've tried the manual Nikon lenses on a D200, but the sharpness couldn't be optimally focussed. About the point of the hand held photography I think though that 1/45 isn't that much of a big deal as 1/30 is no problem with the Nikons at all (it helps that they are very, very heavy) and you can do 1/15 most of the time. For the FTN I can use the Abrahamson softrelease for Leicas too, and then 1/8 works well too if you're carefull.\nCPeter J\u00f8rgensen\n, October 26, 2008; 12:54 A.M.\nFirst, the model certainly captured my attention and got me into reading the review. Nice model and nice treatment, especially using low ISO to force wider apertures and bring out the lens qualities.\nSecond, I've been shooting with an M8 since a month or so after they first came out, and plan to upgrade to an M8-2 when they are available. (I've owned every M-model over the last 45 years, so I guess I just have to keep up my record. And I still have an M-7 and, of course, all the modern versions of standard Leica lenses from 21 through 135 (except the Summarits which attracted me to this article.)\nThat said, I've never encountered the color shift problems that upset so many people. I am using the filters Leica sent on two lenses, but I don't notice any differences. Most of my lenses are not 6-bit encoded but again, I can't detect any perceptible deficiencies in the wide angle lenses under common shooting conditions. Leica makes the finest lenses for 35 mm and you pay a hefty premium for them. I also have an 18 mm Zeiss Distagon F4 that produces superb results without encoding or filters.\nThe M8, like all the Ms except the horrible M-5, immediately find \"home\" in your hand and are a joy to use.\nJon Butterwick , October 28, 2008; 06:05 P.M.\ni can't second the comments about the d700 3200 and the m8 1250. i own both and the m8 at 1250 is nowhere near the d700 at 3200. the only way the m8 can shoot 1250 clean like the d700 (at 3200) is during daylight or failing light.\nthe achilles heel of the m8 (in my humble opinion) is the high iso performance. beyond that it is an excellent camera capable of stunning prints with loads of detail.\nImage Attachment: fileghz9u5.jpg\nKirk Tuck , October 29, 2008; 11:36 A.M.\nJohn, I'm always a bit divided when I talk about noise and cameras. I see the differences between the two when I look at the files on my monitor but the disconnection for me is how close many cameras with disparate noise signatures look when I print them. For me, on a 13x19 inch print the noise from the cameras seems to be how I described it. Like most Kodak sensors the M8 sensor has different levels of performance based on how much of the scene is shadow and how much is mid tone and highlight. Some of what I see as noise in the M8 is a result of a less deep black than that produced by the Nikon D700 and D3. When I use curves to equalize the black levels between the cameras the apparent noise drops in the M8 and makes the files look much closer to the D700. People have written about this before in regards to the Kodak SLR/n camera.\nThere are trade offs everywhere. I will say that it's great to get discussion from a photographer like yourself who actually shoots both.\nL DaSousa , October 29, 2008; 05:33 P.M.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard all kinds of opinions about the Leica M8 digital camera but most of them were likely based on conjecture, and on the widely circulated stories about the tendency of the camera\u2019s sensor to turn certain polyester products purple when photographed in bright light.\nThe opinions that I have heard have come from people who own(ed) the camera, not based on conjecture. The IR magenta was a small point of their disappointment. Mostly it was different failures of the camera, especially the shutter, which caused a trip to service, and a long (2 or more monthes) stay. This is what has kept me away from purchasing it.\nWell, five years ago we would have pronounced this camera and it\u2019s sensors performance as \u201cstate of the art\u201d. But now we have cameras like the Nikon D3 and D700 and the Canon 5D to compare it to.\nBut the M8 was revealed just two years ago. At which time the 5D had already been around for quite a while.\nKirk Tuck , October 29, 2008; 06:00 P.M.\nwriter with perplexing thoughts of camera design issues.....\nI can understand that lots of early failures took the shine off owning the M8. My point, and really the only point a reviewer can offer, is that the above review is based on the camera in my hand. I think that over the span of two years the team at Leica have been hellbent on fixing as many of the design flaws as possible in each successive run of cameras. If I had a product this important I would certainly not sit on my hands when it came to improvements. Is it too much to believe that a product can be \"fixed\" during its production cycle? If you find that hard to believe how could we ever rely on products such as Microsoft Vista.\nI understand that the Canon 5D is three years old. My statement was that the implementation of the sensor would have been state of the art five years ago. Really.\nI wish there were a site we could all go to and find the real failure rate for cameras. It would make the process of buying cameras so much easier. Bottom line? I used the camera for six weeks and it did not fail or need life support.\nJon Butterwick , October 29, 2008; 09:40 P.M.\nmight i also add that in a year of professional, daily use my m8 never failed.\nJordan G. , October 30, 2008; 02:36 A.M.\nVersion 2 firmware for the leica M8 greatly improves the white balance. Compared to my Nikon D700, I would say the auto white balance of the M8 is better, particularly in incandescent lighting. Also, I have to say that the shutter sound of the D700 and the M8 are different in tone and quality, but hardly different in volume to warrant using one over the other. (I just took 10 pictures with each comparing them in my deserted kitchen and they're hardly different).\nJeff Hughes , November 01, 2008; 09:00 A.M.\nHello Kirk. A very nice review. You might like to know that it was your very compelling review of the M6 back in 2001 which prompted me to buy my first Leica. I picked up the M6ttl that year, the M7 a couple years after that, and the M8 two years ago. And a handful of their sterling lenses along the way, of course. For a non-pro and a not-rich-guy, it's been an expensive journey, but ultimately a transforming one. The Leica M remains far and away my favorite camera system. My M8 goes with me everywhere.\nI also own a Nikon D3 and so can appreciate the comparisons you draw. IMHO, notwithstanding the Nikon's much newer sensor, the two cameras produce comparable image quality. Very large quality prints are routine with both.\nAs you mention, the one area the Nikon is head and shoulders above the Leica is high iso performance. I generally try to limit my M8 to iso 640 - an upper boundary in which it produces very clean images. The D3, conversely, I feel comfortable taking all the way up to 6400. The Nikon sensor is remarkable in its low light performance.\nLooking at the images you included in your review, it appears your demo unit is the original, classic M8. The just-released M8.2 reportedly has a much quieter shutter, albeit one with a top speed of 1/4000. The newer model also has revised frame lines which supposedly address the minor framing accuracy issue you describe. Leica does have an upgrade program where one can send in their original M8 and have those items replaced with the newer components.\nThanks again for the very nice review. I've wondered a few times the last couple years if you made the switch to the M8. It's the best camera I've ever owned.\nAnd, yes, a very lovely model!\nKirk Tuck , November 01, 2008; 12:56 P.M.\nOne of the features I like best about the M8.2 is that the shutter charge can be delayed (and is less noisy) than the original M8.\nNuno Borges , November 19, 2008; 03:53 P.M.\nVery well and honestly written. This is exactly why I find a full frame SLR and prime lenses a sounder proposition. A 5D even takes and values Leica glass for whoever feels the urge.\nLaurent Vuillard , November 25, 2008; 03:14 P.M.\nA subjective but out of experience comment/ I bought a summarit 75 nt willing to pay2400euros for the summicron. As a long time user of Leica lenses I am really positive that with an M6 this 75 is NOT of the same league as the 35, 50, summicrons or 28 90 Elmarits that I used a lot, sharpness was not as good, full stop!\nPaul Wolossow , November 28, 2008; 03:45 P.M.\nKirk, A first rate hands-on review. I will be buying an M8 over the next week or so to take advantage of the new $1500 rebate from Leica. If you get your hands on a M8.2 or M8 with the upgrade, please write a short review of them as well. My only dilemma now is which summarit-M lens to get first, the 35mm (46mm) or the 50mm (66mm). The pictures you took with the 50mm look to me to have a more creamy bokeh.\nThanks, Paul\nKirk Tuck , November 28, 2008; 11:56 P.M.\nI played with an 8.2 and fell in love with it. If you read my M6 review you'd know the first lens I would recommend to anyone would be the 50mm. I have used most of the 50's for Nikon and Leica. That focal length just resonates with me.\nnate johnson , December 16, 2008; 09:52 P.M.\nCold War talks\nHello Kirk: good review,straight forward. Nice to read an article from a shooters point of view. I prefer or (understand) film, but must use the Digital World to keep a living. I use Nikons for some client work and editorial work but prefer the ease of the M system. I might have missed this in your article, but can one use the older M lenses that are not CPU or 6 bit coded? Will these pre 6 bit lenses work on the M8? I am mostly going to be shooting ASA 400 and in RAW if I get a M8. I shoot now with M6's, film Tri X not pushed and lenses are 35,50,21,(1990's lenses) you can see some of the work here on photonet or on flicker@ photo league thanks please let me know about the older lenses (1990's). Image is from Velvet Revolution Prague 1989 \u00a9 N Johnson\nRobert Gordon , December 17, 2008; 05:11 A.M.\nThe older Leica lenses (including screw mounts) work fine on the M8 and M8.2. They just don't embed EXIF data in the image files.\n, January 07, 2009; 04:58 P.M.\nKirk:\nThanks for the useful comparison of focal lengths on the M8.\nIn a recent trip to Chaco Canyon and Santa Fe using the M8, I found myself shooting ruins and urban scenes with 50mm f/1.4 (non-ASPH) and 35mm f/2 ASPH much more than 21mm ASPH. Part of that was lack of IR-cut filter for the 21mm, but the rest was the need for the shoe-mount Leica 28-24-21 finder. The finder is optically superb, but it's tough to frame tightly with it.\n=> You do need a 28mm finder to see what you're getting with any 21mm lens on the M8. The M8 lacks a frame showing the 21mm's field of view, and it's more than the M8's entire viewfinder shows.\nIn fact, with an unmodified M8 you get more than the frame-lines show with any focal length.\nThe M8 makes pictures from my fiancee's Canon G10 look like cheap snapshots (no surprise, really). I'm also starting to prefer M8 and Leica primes to the 24-70mm f/2.8L on my EOS 1D mk II. Still need the 1D mk II and 20D for 400mm and 500mm shots of wildlife.\nI shot personal pics of the Christmas Revels stage production with the M8 and 35 f/2 ASPH, 50mm f/1.4, and 90mm f/2.8 Tele-Elmarit. The 90mm was tough to frame and use wide-open for stage shots in Oakland, California's Scottish Rite Temple. Also, auto WB is pretty bad, as you point out. But the pictures have that Leica look, and the M8 and lenses are much easier on my back.\nMark Bohrer\n"}, {"score": 1554.1096, "uuid": "68c18adb-8e7d-5360-8178-eef9d493938c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1011wb-33-24536", "target_hostname": "www.photoassistant.net", "target_uri": "http://www.photoassistant.net/blog/post/2010/09/21/The-new-LEICA-D-LUX-5-e28093-The-compact-digital-Leica-camera-with-system-character.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1774633e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "1ProPhoto.Com | The new <em>LEICA</em> D-LUX 5 \u2013 The compact digital <em>Leica</em> <em>camera</em>", "snippet": ". * 5 Things You <em>Should</em> Know About the Canon C300Comments: 0Not rated yet &quot;All <em>photographs</em> are accurate.

Heredia\nThe Nikon 1 Series represents the long-awaited entry of a popular DSLR manufacturer into the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (ILC) market. The Nikon J1 model is the more consumer oriented version, and shares many common components and operating features with its enthusiast sibling, the Nikon V1 .\nThe 1 Series stands out from the rapidly growing crowd of ILCs by a new sensor and hybrid AF system. Instead of iterating an APS-C body, Nikon chose to create a new sensor size and corresponding lens mount, an unexpected move to be sure. Nikon\u2019s CX sensor is a little over half the size of the dominant m4/3 system, and imposes a 2.7x FOV crop when compared to full-frame sensors. The design choice to produce only a 10MP resolving sensor is daring. Only four native lenses currently exist for the camera \u2013 a 10mm f2.8 pancake prime (equivalent 27mm), and two consumer-grade zooms, a 10-30mm f3.5-5.6 (equivalent 27-81mm), a 30-110mm f3.8-5.6 ED (equivalent 81-297mm) telephoto and a 10-110 mm f4.5-5.6 ED (equivalent 27-297mm) superzoom with a new silent Power Drive. The latter three lenses are equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR).\nThe feature that received the most hype at pre-launch is the hybrid AF system \u2013 Nikon was able to integrate faster-focusing Phase Detect (PD) sensors directly upon the CX imaging chip. In theory, the 1 Series could now focus just as fast as any entry-level digital SLR since they both shared PD sensor capability. In lower light, the 1 Series would fall back to more traditional Contrast Detect (CD) sensors which are slower but more reliable in determining subject distance.\nThe Nikon J1 also has some consumer-oriented and value-add features such as Motion Snapshot, which combines brief video and a still of the \u201cdecisive moment;\u201d 1080P movie capture and slow-motion video (thanks to a high frame rate continuous mode).\nThis review evaluated the camera\u2019s still-photography features and has scoped out video functions accordingly.\nInitial Impressions\nThe size of the Nikon J1 is deceiving \u2013 at first glance, it\u2019s no bigger than most of the lower-tier Coolpix P&S models that it displaces in the Nikon product family.\nThe J1 body is no larger in size than a typical compact P&S such as the Coolpix L22\nAs befitting the consumer tier, the Nikon J1 comes in a variety of colors \u2013 our evaluation model came in metallic silver with matching two-tone 10-30mm and 30-100 mm zooms. Oddly, the telephoto had a lens hood, but the short zoom did not. There are dedicated hoods for all the native lenses except for the 10mm prime. The hoods can be reverse mounted for storage and both lenses have the latest Nikon \u201cpinch-cap\u201d versions for easy removal.\nOverall, the footprint occupied by the 1 Series and the two kit lenses is relatively small. It\u2019s not the smallest ILC in the market, but it\u2019s quite portable even in the two-kit form.\nThe J1 with built-in flash deployed and the 30-110\u2019s hood mounted.\nThe 1 Series can best be described as \u201cpocketable,\u201d though you\u2019d need a large coat pocket or a modest purse or bag. Nonetheless, when compared to the smallest Nikon DSLR currently in the market \u2013 a D3100 \u2013 you immediately get a sense of the J1\u2019s possibilities as a \u201ccarry everywhere\u201d unit. Note the DSLR is sporting one of the smallest lenses possible \u2013 a 50mm f1.8 prime. The J1 still retains the general advantage of a larger, albeit slower zoom.\nThe Nikon J1 next to its larger cousin the Nikon D3100 \u2013 the smaller camera is positively svelte.\nThe front is mostly utilitarian \u2013 a large lens release button, a mostly bare gripping area on the right side (which has handling implications) , a pair of microphone inputs above the lens mount, a white-light AF assist and an IR input window round out the left the side. While the lenses mount and dismount in the same direction as the F-mount, veteran Nikon users will be slightly put out by the need to align the lens using the large dash mounted at 12:00 rather than the more traditional 2:00 position.\nThe rear is dominated by the large 3\u201d display rated at 460K dots resolution, so the output can be a bit course at times. A small switch on the upper left activates the pop-up flash, which is deployed on a rather long and spindly support arm. On the right rear, you\u2019ll find all the controls clustered together \u2013 a dedicated Function button, a vertical toggle that doubles as a command dial and zoom, and four buttons \u2013 Display, Play, Delete and Menu surrounding a combination control circular dial and a centered OK button. Inside of the circle is the traditional four-way controller, which is marked for specific shortcuts such AE-L/AF-L, self-timer, flash mode and Exposure Compensation. To the right of the bottom plate is the combination hatch leading to the battery and SD/SDHC/SDXC compartment. The tripod mount is wisely aligned with the lens axis.\nThe rear view of the J1.\nOverall, the feel of the camera is hefty, thanks to the mostly aluminum build, but a lot of the rear fascia is plastic. Nonetheless, there are no creaks and groans \u2013 everything is quite solid and well-assembled.\nHandling\nAfter a few minutes use, one of the gotchas of the 1 Series becomes apparent \u2013 it\u2019s smooth yet striking industrial design exterior lacks any gripping areas for positive handholding. The more expensive V1 features a minimal vertical \u201cbar\u201d on the right front that acts a friction point for your forefingers, but the J1 is completely bare in this regard. Nikon sells a dedicated GR-N2000 add-on handle, but it\u2019s hard to take seriously at almost USD70 street. Several third party grips have become available at half the cost, and seem to do a much better job. The rear is a bit tight on grip space as well, as there is a small padded area available for your thumb right next to the mode dial, but should have been placed just a little bit higher for more optimal fit. Your other hand will likely be occupied supporting under the bottom plate and the mounted manual zoom lens. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t do the \u201cone-hand\u201d shooting style with this camera; it\u2019s just that you won\u2019t be doing it that often.\nThe kit lenses accompanying the camera are very light but well-built. Each lens is dominated by a wide rubberized manual zoom ring. There are marked detent positions for specific focal lengths, but there is no manual focus \u2013 that\u2019s done in-camera. Nikon created a new Stepping Drive Motor for the CX mount, and it\u2019s quite silent \u2013 very comparable to the full-ring motor Silent Wave on the F-mount. While the lenses have Vibration Reduction, there are no external controls \u2013 it\u2019s all controlled in the camera by accessing a specific menu. Interestingly, there are no options to turn off VR, it\u2019s on by default. Finally, each lens has a large button on the zoom ring \u2013 the zooms must be released from their most compact carry position in order to work correctly. By doing so, the camera also automatically powers up. The reverse is not true \u2013 collapsing the lenses back to carry position is simply that. You\u2019ll have to power down manually using the ON/OFF switch.\nDespite not having a dedicated EVF, the J1\u2019s rear display was more than adequate to the task when composing, viewing and manipulating the camera. The display did not wash out easily, exhibited sharp and vibrant images, and had a very generous viewing angle. However the display is a drain on your battery life. With a CIPA rating of about 230 shots, the enthusiast user is going to need, not want, a second battery for maximum shoot time in the field.\nThe lenses zoom rather smoothly, and there are no hitches or rough spots encountered. The hood on the telezoom is effective, and serves as secondary protection. Both lenses were easy to mount and dis-mount; the small size and weight complemented the Nikon J1 quite nicely; it was difficult to tell at times which lens was on from a visual inspection \u2013 they\u2019re that small and unobtrusive.\nThe camera\u2019s dearth of external controls has been the subject of much discussion since the 1 Series debuted. In particular, the lack of a true Function button, which could be reassigned to an often manipulated control such as ISO or White Balance, as well as an equivalent \u201cRecent Settings\u201d menu, would go a long way to addressing some of the concerns. In addition, the inability to disable Auto-Review of the last taken image does hamper the \u201cflow\u201d of shooting photos in the field. It remains to be seen if Nikon will address those changes in a future firmware revision.\nPerformance\nIn a single word \u2013 excellent. With some caveats covered below.\nLet\u2019s talk about the focus capability first. There is no menu or external control to invoke Phase-Detect versus Contrast-Detect. The camera evaluates the ambient light values in the frame and decides accordingly. That \u201cthreshold\u201d is difficult to quantify in a field-review, but you can easily tell when you\u2019re in PD \u2013 especially if you chose Auto-Area AF \u2013 the rectangles light up and subjects immediately jump into focus \u2013 no hesitation. In fact, it felt very much like the Nikon D3100\u2019s AutoArea AF performance. That\u2019s not to say you\u2019ll be replacing your D3 with this camera anytime soon \u2013 but the claim of DSLR-like focus performance is true. As light levels drop, the camera will switch to more traditional CD, which has the familiar one-step \u201cstutter\u201d at the end of the focusing operation to confirm the subject lock. Nikon\u2019s implementation of PD directly on-sensor is a promising innovation, and hopefully will be seen in future offerings from other makers as well.\nThe PD is nicely complemented by a 73-point AF system \u2013 providing effective and wide coverage of the viewfinder area. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a section not covered by an AF point. The CD gives you even more, with a 135-point coverage pattern. The subject really needs to have contrast under the AF point to optimize the lock-on, but overall the experience is like no other \u2013 I had the opportunity to let several other enthusiast and commercial shooters try out the camera briefly during a day-long road trip \u2013 they were all quite impressed and noted how the AF system made the camera feel very responsive for casual shooting.\nOn the image quality side, the Nikon J1 does not disappoint. Shots of the Provincetown harbor and other Cape Cod landmarks, in both rain and blue sky all reflect the color, contrast and sharpness typical of Nikon products and image processing. The Providence skyline exhibited good detail and excellent metering response, with no blowouts and good shadow detail.\nColorful boats in P-Town harbor following a brief rainstorm.\nNauset Light shrouded in a fast-moving storm front.\nElevated perspective of the East Side, Providence R.I.\nTelephoto shot at 110mm max zoom (300mm equiv.)\nAs a compact camera, the Nikon J1 shines in terms of portability and convenience. With two zooms covering the most common focal lengths of 27-300mm and exhibiting a very low-profile, it was easy to pull the camera in and out of a jacket pocket for grab shots or to quickly swap lenses. From the forest pines of Rayce Point to the narrow alleys and beachfronts of Provincetown, it was easy to carry and yet the camera delivered some amazing wide-angles, zoom shots and close-ups. (Some samples thanks to Thomas P. Sisto)\nOn the trail with fellow shutterbugs!\nFungus close-ups from the forest floor.\nMonuments in the mist\u2026\nSome \u201cfound\u201d artwork patterns in a back alley\u2026\nThe beach at low tide\u2026\nOne of the advantages of ILCs is the lack of a mirror box assembly. The slap of the mirror system degrades the stability of certain exposures close to the hand-held shutter speed \u201cdanger zone.\u201d Without that mirror challenge, your ability to hand-hold inside the zone goes up accordingly. While some of these shots lack any artistic or inspirational value, the first two frames below were at 1/4th and 1/5th respectively. Without VR, these types of photos would be impossible to obtain. Again, it was easy to keep the Nikon J1 close at hand and keep an eye out for near-dusk and after-dark compositions.\nLow light Example 1\nThe \u201cSuperman Building\u201d near Kennedy Plaza\nThe Providence Statehouse at dusk\nIndoors, the camera\u2019s limiting factor is based upon the CX lenses available now. The 10mm f2.8 pancake prime is a good start, but really isn\u2019t that fast when talking about ambient light photography. In addition, the relatively low 1/60th flash synch ceiling imposes further challenges to action-freezing. The optional FT-1 adapter opens up options by allowing access to a bigger range of F-mount lenses, but the 2.7x crop factor effectively turns even a normal 50mm f1.8 into a mid-tele 135mm. That\u2019s great for portrait and stand-off shooters, not so good for those who prefer to get in close and wide. Despite those factors, the J1 didn\u2019t do too badly in a typically fluorescent-lit karate studio or a restaurant interior with the slow zooms. The noise is noticeable but not objectionable, and with some NR post-process, the images can be cleaned up for reasonable size reproductions, web use or conversion to B&W.\nKarate studio work using the 30-110\nWaiting for my breakfast!\nCaveats\nSo what are the downsides?\nAs a first-generation product, the Nikon 1 Series does deliver on innovations such as PD on-sensor, as well as living up to the image quality one expects from the brand. However, it\u2019s not that simple a proposition. Based on the design and features, the target audience is clearly the average compact P&S owner wanting to move up-tier, gaining more capability and access to interchangeable lenses. In that regard, the camera is a clear success. The tougher proposition is for the enthusiast - such as readers of SeriousCompacts.com. That market segment is not going to be fully satisfied by the current iteration of the 1 Series. The Nikon V1 would appeal more to the enthusiast crowd because of the integral EVF, but both models are constrained by a dearth of manual controls and limited lens system choices.\nThat being said, this author and other photographers who had the opportunity to use the camera over the course of the evaluation all agree that if your type of photography lets you select a particular shooting mode and metering choice; the camera doesn\u2019t get in the way. In fact, it was a liberating experience to just pay attention to the more artistic aspects of taking photos \u2013 the timing, the framing, the composition, etc. \u2013 the J1 took care of everything else. The PD AF system facilitated making the camera feel very responsive from shot-to-shot. But if you are a \u201cfiddler\u201d or enjoy complete and convenient access to all your camera\u2019s controls, well, it\u2019s going to be a tough sell.\nThe relative lack of choices in lenses is simply a matter of time. Nikon will continue to iterate new CX mount optics, but the historic track record of times between releases doesn\u2019t point to a quick rollout. Despite Nikon\u2019s fine reputation for TTL flash, the onboard unit of the J1 doesn\u2019t tie back into the larger CLS wireless system used by the DSLR product family. It\u2019s a simple flash, period.\nFinally, there\u2019s the price. At the USD599 starting point, the Nikon J1 starts to bump up against the established lines at Olympus, Panasonic and Sony. The other manufacturers, by virtue of a head-start, enjoy advantages in price tiering, completeness of systems (i.e., lenses and accessory choices) and market penetration. At USD499, this could be a better seller.\nConclusion\nAs part of Nikon\u2019s opening shot to the ILC market, the Nikon J1 delivers on capability and performance. The Hybrid AF system really works, and the camera itself continues to live up to the manufacturer\u2019s well-earned reputation as a leading provider of imaging technology.\nFor compact users who are interested in moving up to a faster, higher performing camera and the potential of a larger imaging system (lenses and accessories); the J1 will satisfy. For enthusiast users, well, the only thing this author can recommend is to get down to a retail store and handle it for yourself. You may or may not find the dearth of controls to be inhibiting.\nFrom a cost perspective, this is where the rubber hits the road. The J1 is a first-generation model, and as such, early technology adopters have always paid a price \u2013 whether it was limited functionality, higher acquisition cost or both \u2013 to be first in line. With that philosophy, The Nikon 1 Series is priced accordingly \u2013 certainly not sky-high outrageous, but definitely not aiming to take market share based on competitive pricing. As such, buyers in general need to take a good hard look at the state of the market. The upside is that you\u2019ll own one of the fastest and certainly one of the most innovative cameras today. The challenges will be to wait out the inevitable delay as more lenses and accessories become available, and seeing if changes in handling will occur through a firmware update. Overall, it\u2019s a mixed recommendation \u2013 the Nikon J1 is great camera, but you\u2019ll be paying a premium to have one.\nA full gallery of Nikon J1 Sample Photos is available here: Nikon 1 J1 Samples - SeriousCompacts.com Gallery\n___________________________\nArmando J.

", "explanation": null, "document": "By Craig (CR Guy)\nIntroduction\nThe Leica M9 sparks a lot of conversation. I\u2019m starting to get questions about why I shoot with one. This review is more of a user experience review than about the camera itself. There\u2019s lots of great tech reviews of this camera out there.\nNever fear, I still use my Canon gear a lot for specific things. I just wanted a camera that was smaller, less intrusive and still delivered high end image quality.\nThis camera has just changed the way I make photographs in a positive way.\u00a0There are lots of cliche opinions about the M9 and Leica in general, I\u2019ll try to respond to the usual ones I hear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a snob camera\u201d\nThere is a community of Leica owners that care more about collecting, discussing and caressing a Leica M Body than shooting with it. This article is not for them.\nThere is also a whole host of amazing photographers that choose the Leica M9, Not because it\u2019s a Leica, but because it is the best photographic tool for them on the market. If you\u2019ve met photographers, I wouldn\u2019t say the majority of us are financially free. For most Leica photographers, dropping $7000 on a camera body requires sacrificing in other areas of their life.\n\u201cIt gets outspecced by cameras that cost 1/5 as much\u201d\nIt does, but this camera isn\u2019t about specs This camera is about a preference in how an image is captured. It is a unique tool for the moment in digital photography.\n\u201cIt costs too much\u201d\nI don\u2019t have access to Leica\u2019s books, but I\u2019ll make some assumptions as to why it costs what it does.\nWhen you\u2019re the only one that makes something, the cost of making it is higher. I will admit you also have the luxury of charging almost whatever you want when you\u2019re alone in a specific segment. It still has to be reasonable, the market will ultimately decide if the product is priced properly.\nThe sensor for this camera is specialized and costs a lot to produce.\nThe camera is assembled and tested by decently paid (some might debate that) people in Solms, Germany.\nSupply and demand, Rangefinders are going to be outsold by DSLR\u2019s. Leica has to make the necessary margin to be profitable, which they\u2019ve finally returned to.\nGo take a look at what Epson charged for the RD-1 ($3000) which used an available APS-C sensor from Nikon/Sony.\nAre you qualified to talk about a Leica M?\nI hope so! I have owned the M9 for 6 weeks and I think it\u2019s the best photographic tool I have ever owned. I flirted with a Canadian made M4-P and an M7. I loved the size of these cameras. However, as much as I enjoy film sometimes, I do not enjoy it all the time. I wanted a digital camera that was small, had no bells and whistles and just made top quality image files.\nI am a new rangefinder user, my grandfather didn\u2019t use an M2 while I was growing up. My father didn\u2019t force me to use a single stroke M3. I have no Leica lineage. If Canon made a digital version of their Canon 7, I\u2019d own it. There is no bias for this camera in me.\nI wanted a small camera to make photographs with. That\u2019s all.\nShould the review be on a Canon enthusiast site?\nIt\u2019s inevitable some will say \u201cno\u201d. I cannot do much about that.\nI will say, with all the bells and whistles being added to DSLR\u2019s. I think it\u2019s important to keep the concept of a still photograph only camera alive. Canon continues to evolve the DSLR which is great. It\u2019s very exciting to see new markets open up.\nEven if it\u2019s a niche market, there\u2019s always going to be people that just don\u2019t care about ISO 104,800 performance and video.\nThe Leica M9 User Experience Review\nThe Handling & Feel\nThe camera is small compared to any Canon DSLR, which is very welcomed in my life. I became tired of lugging around a 1D sized body and big fast primes, I felt it restricted mobility when shooting most of what I shot. It was also a contant headache when getting on planes with strict carry-on regulations (I\u2019m talking to you Ryanair). A camera with a large sensor and great image quality seemed like an easy thing to get into.\nHolding the camera was initially a little bit uncomfortable for me. I am 6\u20194 and have large hands. I do not like neckstraps, I use a wrist strap and always have the camera in my hand. I had a difficult time holding it for long periods of time. Rather quickly, I purchased the addon grip for it. This added a huge level of comfort to my shooting experience. The odd time I don\u2019t control my fingers properly and I cover up the rangefinder window. If you find the camera uncomfortable, give the grip a try.\nYou look at the camera and it has a welcoming appearance. There isn\u2019t 20 dials, switches, and buttons everywhere. On the top of the camera there is a shutter speed dial, the shooting mode switch and a shutter button. I never accidentally hit anything. Nothing on the back of the camera is required for making images. I\u2019m RARELY ever pressing anything back there.\nI\u2019ve even stopped the act of \u201cchimping\u201d. Someone said to me once, \u201cwhy do you look at the LCD? you just saw the image in the viewfinder\u201d. I know the immediate response is \u201cexposure\u201d, but not checking exposure really helps you become better at exposing properly. For a lot of shots, they\u2019re not there again to retake a photograph anyway.\nIf anyone can call the layout of this camera confusing or daunting, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much out there for you.\nAnother area some people may have to get used to is the viewfinder. The viewfinder is big and bright which is a bonus, but there are some issues that arose for me. I had to really get used to seeing the lens in the viewfinder. The 35 Summilux really protrudes into the viewfinder, even though the lens hood is cut away so you can see through it. Never fear, this negative issue became a non issue after about a week. I\u2019d leave my left eye open and that would help me compose the shot.\nPaying attention to the framelines didn\u2019t take long to get used to. I borrowed a 50mm lens and was shooting it like it was the 35mm, so I had all sorts of stuff cut out of the image. I might be the only dummy to do that.\nFocusing\nYes, it takes lots of practice to do it quickly.\nNo, I\u2019m not focusing as well as I want to be.\nIt adds a skill a lot of people will have to learn for the first time. The older generation will mock the digital generation and our fancy autofocus cameras, they were shooting wars and sports manually! You got us, but I completely agree now that autofocus really isn\u2019t required for a lot of photography. You never have to worry about AF working in lowlight for one. There\u2019s no cumbersome moving autofocus points around, there\u2019s no blaming the camera because it \u201cmissed\u201d, nope\u2026 you missed.\nThere is an art of \u201cshooting from the hip\u201d that rangefinders are perfect for. You judge the distance to your subject, set the focus distance and start shooting. I\u2019ve been able to successfully do this with one hand because of the focus tab on the 35mm lenses I use. You know by the position of the tab as to the distance you\u2019re focused. It\u2019s really quite cool the first few times you do it successfully. I will admit I mostly shoot this way at f/4 and f/5.6. I haven\u2019t yet mastered it at f/2.8 and faster.\nI\u2019ve gotten some shots I really like shooting from the hip.\nDo I prefer it to autofocus?\nNo, I don\u2019t prefer it, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a detriment. I\u2019m completely happy with focusing manually. I\u2019ve missed some shots because I wasn\u2019t fast enough, I know that will come with practicing. I may prefer it in time.\nWhat lenses to use?\nPart of the reason I went Leica is for simplicity. That means not having a camera bag with 4 or 5 lenses. I had trimmed down a lot in my DSLR kit, usually just a 24mm & 85mm on a 1.3 crop. I also spent a lot of time shooting just a 50 f/1.2L on a 5D Mark II. Moving to Leica wasn\u2019t going to change that philosophy.\nMy current kit contains 3 focal lengths.\nVoigtlander Heliar 15mm (Screw Mount)\nLeica Summicron 35 f/2 (I rented a 35 Summilux f/1.4 as well)\nLeica Summicron 90 f/2\nMost of the street and everyday stuff I shoot at 35mm, I love the compactness of the lenses and I can use the focal length comfortably for everything. You also get most of the viewfinder to compose with. I do shoot landscape and enjoy it, so an ultra wide was needed. Leica\u2019s offerings are A LOT of money, so I went to Voigtlander and found a screw mount Heliar 15mm with an external viewfinder for $400. The lens is very good and weighs next to nothing.\nThe other lens I\u2019ve been using is a Summicron 90 f/2, I don\u2019t see myself using it all that often and it may leave my kit. It\u2019s too long for street I find and too long physically to be comfortable all day. It is a marvelous lens for portrait work, I just don\u2019t do enough of it.\nI have ordered a rental Voigtlander 50 f/1.1 to replace the Summicron 90. It\u2019s an inexpensive ultra fast 50mm that is well built and feels nice on the camera and costs about $1000. We\u2019ll see how the rental goes, I may move to the Summilux 50 one day because of its smaller size.\nSo even if you buy a Leica body, don\u2019t feel like you have to buy Leica lenses. While the Leica version of your desired focal length will probably be the best of the bunch, Voigtlander and Zeiss both make outstanding optics for the M mount.\nIf you shoot primes currently with your Canon setup, a switch to Leica will be pretty easy. I think it\u2019s important that you do before making the decision to purchase a rangefinder. Even if it\u2019s getting yourself a Canon 50 f/1.8 and using it until you\u2019re making shots you like with it. I evolved from zooms to primes over the years. I find zooms to be cumbersome and inconvenient, which is the opposite opinion of what\u00a0most people I meet think.\nI have set a 3 lens limit on myself. The camera is about simplicity and that\u2019s what I need to maintain.\nWhat can you shoot with it?\nThis is probably a valid question for a lot of people. You can shoot anything with it, but it\u2019s not going to be the ideal solution for some shoots. The longest Leica lens is 135mm, so there won\u2019t be shooting birds with it, outside of your budgie in a cage. I can\u2019t see shooting too many indoor sports with it. Leica has some lovely fast lenses, but focusing would probably be difficult most of the time.\nPortrait? Yes.\n"}, {"score": 1076.8948, "uuid": "11560186-b940-5fff-bd8b-ab3d12ae33ab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1905wb-38-16188", "target_hostname": "www.photographytalk.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photographytalk.com/photography-articles/2317-choosing-a-digital-srl-camera-for-bird-photography", "page_rank": 1.244961e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Choosing <em>a</em> digital SLR <em>camera</em> <em>for</em> bird photography", "snippet": "The 4&#x2F;500 is one of the best choices <em>for</em> the serious bird photographer and <em>I</em> use <em>a</em> 4&#x2F;500 myself <em>for</em> <em>over</em> 90% of my bird pictures..

It was an equipment locker camera, and I don't remember precisely which model of the III it was, but it did have a collapsable lens. Strangely enough, I don't remember then having all that much trouble loading it. Since I do remember a Kodak Signet from the previous season as one of the most awkward cameras I've ever used, it may just be that I was basking in that \"Leica\" glow.\nJust recently, I got a extremely \"rare\" Swedish military Leica from the ex-Soviet Union, that is of an undetermined model designation (n\u00e9e Zorkii). Loading it, despite its dubious heritage, is exactly the thrilling experience that Josh describes. Somewhere on a web site, someone claims to be able to load a LTM Leica in 30 seconds, but even by the most generous interpretation, that cannot include trimming the film leader.\nMuch as I like the Leicas, I'm still more of a Contax person, although my copie of that--aside from my Contax S or D-- are of equally dubious origins.\nRonald Moravec , February 19, 2009; 12:24 A.M.\nJack sure is a cutie.\nAn ABLON is not necessary for triming the leader as you suggest. But the real advantage is the arrowhead end which is used to form the point on the end that fastens the film into the spool slot for the Leica film cassettes. The point has to be centered mid line on the film , the correct angle needs to be made so the cuts meet the sprocket holes in the correct place, and you have to do this in the dark with 100 feet of unprotected film hanging off the end of your bench. I can`t do it with the lights on reliably, let alone in the dark. When you make a few bad cuts and have trouble clearing the point from the spool after developing the film, you will realize it is best to do it right. I paid for the ABLON.\nThe pointed or arrowhead end is not on the generic templates so that is not an option either.\nThe camera is indeed a joy to use if you want something retro. Small, quiet, light, and goes into a large pocket. It also attracts some attention and a few questions from passerby.\nnigel jones , February 19, 2009; 04:15 A.M.\nI unfortunately have not had the pleasure of using a Leica before, but I am now just getting used to a rangefinder through my Yashica GSN.\nProvia 100F is such an amazing film though, as a relatively poor 18-year student, I recently came across a plethora of expired Provia 100f in 35mm & 120/220. This is honestly my favorite slide film and perhaps my favorite film ever next to Tri-x 400. During the daytime the limits are endless, skateboarding, portraits, landscape, this film rules at all of these.\nWhile I realize my meager two year involvement in photography has not been much, my recent discovery of Provia 100F dramatically altered my view of photography and pulled me into film instead of digital.\nNigel\nTom Fowler , February 19, 2009; 07:46 A.M.\nAfter being digital for five years I went back to film in a big way. I loaded up a Mamiyaflex with some Fuji Provia 100F and started snapping away. On that first roll I had some good photographs (for me), and it has me hooked. I enjoy the \"look\" of film and will continue to use it in conjunction with the digital ease. Thanks for keeping up with this series on film, I enjoy it.\ncharles wick , February 19, 2009; 08:51 A.M.\nThe great thing about the 111f is the way it feels in the hand and its handling in general; as has been said it is a little treasure, the perfect size and weight. The M series can't compare in this regard. Since picking up a nice 111f, in 2006, I use it almost all the time. I have a 1.5 Summarit, which contrary to legend is a very useful lens, and a collapsible summicron, as well as a 3.5 summaron and two hektors. I have taken some of my best images with this magical little friend. Of course I also use a Kodak Tourist and Signet 40, and a bunch of screw mount Pentax.\nJohn Shriver\n, February 19, 2009; 09:08 A.M.\nThe other non-metal material in the IIIf would be the insulation materials in the flash sync circuit. But that's it. I've done my own CLA's on my IIIa, which is an even simpler camera than the IIIf. It's simple but clever.\nThe beam-splitter in the rangefinder is a half-silvered mirror. It literally is silvered, and as the silver tarnishes from sulfur compounds in today's smoggy air, it gets less and less reflective. As that happens, the secondary image vanishes. It's very easy to replace, I got a genuine new-old-stock Leica replacement, and it's aluminized rather than silvered, and should last for the rest of my life.\nThe reason that film loading didn't seem hard in 1963 was that film leader tails were longer then. It was some time around 1980 that Kodak switched to the runt leader that's now standard. Saved 2 inches of film per roll, somebody must have gotten a big bonus for that idea.\nAll the screwmount Leicas are wonderful \"bring everywhere\" cameras. I wore a IIIa with Canon 35/1.8 lens on a recent vacation to New York city, and it was just not a burden at all.\nDon E , February 19, 2009; 10:34 A.M.\nIf you are a '50mm photographer', shoot silver b&w, and have adopted the Elder Esthetic (aka classic look, olde skoole), then, look no further, this is your system camera. The rest of your system will include many other 50mm lenses, including another Elmar 50, at least. Tired of the same old same old with the Elmar or cron, why just mount the Summar and suddenly, the world is new.\nI may be the only person who likes the knob rewind rather than the fussy little plasticked pop-up levers on most other cameras and the little flush or deepset button on base plates (which never gets mentioned in such comparisons of rewinding). If you have problems with your fingers (as I do), the knob rewind is a blessing.\nCutting leader can be tedious. I use curved cuticle scissors and will cut as many rolls as I can bear at a sitting. Get it over with. Loading the right way isn't bad, unless you are in the field and clutching the baseplate in your teeth. Secure the leader under the slot in the takeup spool (this slot actually is a slot, unlike some flipback cameras little slit cutouts, and yes, I'm looking at you, Pentax), check to see if it is in straight, drop the casettes in, push down on them to seat them, and you're good to go.\nIt's a great carry everywhere camera -- but heavy for some girlie pockets -- with a collapsed 50.\nI use my IIIf lots and as God and HCB intended, hyperfocus and sunny 16.\nIt is the un-black finish camera. Polish up that chrome! It is also God's own crumpet catcher, the cute puppy, the Jag XKE of cameras.\nChristopher Chen , February 19, 2009; 10:38 A.M.\nRe: the ABLON, while they may be overpriced for what they are, you can find them in slightly-beat, but perfectly functional, condition for around $20 U.S. You can also purchase modern knock-offs in the same price range.\nFrank Doering , February 19, 2009; 01:24 P.M.\nAfter a lot of DSLR work, I am rediscovering the joy of sauntering with a comparatively small M6 and one or two lenses. Dealing with films' quirks and possibilities is a refreshing exercise, and I continue to be surprised at finding large prints (say 20x30\") from 35mm more pleasing than from my Nikon D3, warts and all. This from a guy who considers everything smaller than 2 1/4\" a toy format. The following was shot in Rome last month on Fuji Provia 100F (RDP III) with a 35/2 asph. Summicron.\nMark Smith , February 19, 2009; 01:43 P.M.\nI had a IIIc with 50mm F3,5 Elmar from 1947. I loved it and used it for about 20 years, but recently passed it on (I have an M4P) for someone else to love. Here is a shot taken with it on Neopan 400: http://www.pbase.com/mark_antony/image/62439570.jpg\nRichard Baznik , February 19, 2009; 02:17 P.M.\nIn 1956, at the age of 13, I went off to school with a Leica IID that my father loaned me. He was a serious amateur, as I am now. As I recall, he said something like, \"Here, you'll need a camera.\" He'd taught me to expose, process, and print images since I was ten, and I assumed that all fathers had dark rooms in the basement and cabinets full of Leicas and Rolleis.\nSo I left for school with the IID and a collapsible 50mm Elmar 3.5, worrying that I would be out-gunned by the gear carried by all the other students. Not to worry! There was a decent dark room at the school and I became one of its primary users, and my photographs were used in a wide variety of school publications.\nAfter a couple years of using the IID, my father decided I should branch out a bit within his collection of gear, so I left the Leica at home for a semester and used his Rolleiflex 3.5. Within a few weeks I was begging for the Leica again.\nYears later he gave me the IID to keep, along with a 50mm Summarit 1.5 and a 90mm Elmar. I bought a Canon copy of a Leica IIIF, complete with a couple of Canon Serenar LTM lenses, and I used those bodies as my \"system\" for decades. Now I shoot with an M6 and and M3, plus MF and LF -- but several times a year I go shooting with the LTMs.\nWhile I do have the Leica template for trimming film leaders, I have never used it. Eyeballing the slice has always been sufficient. The trick is to be certain that the leading corner of the cut portion of the film is rounded off so it doesn't catch on the film gate.\nEmiko Davies , February 19, 2009; 04:50 P.M.\npines, Cecina, Tuscany\nI wanted to post a picture taken with Provia 400, just to compare... I am a fan of 400 speed films - yes I do like grain, but I also like the versatility of a 400 speed film, especially as I use medium format that has a max aperture of f.3.5. The colours, I agree, are lovely and crisp, even if a little on the cold side, which in the case of this image I prefer. Anyway, this is a straight scan of the Provia 400. I haven't yet tried it or the 100 with my new (well, old) leica (it's a 1937 IIIg), but that'll be my next experiment.\nBrian Sweeney , February 19, 2009; 07:34 P.M.\nMarine, Korean War Display at Quantico, VA\nWhat can I say? Just more fun to use.\nLeica Mount 1941 CZJ 5cm F1.5 Sonnar on the Canon P, handheld at 1/15th. Kodacolor 400\nBrian Grossman\n, February 19, 2009; 11:31 P.M.\nfor a much less frustrating vintage LTM experience, i suggest the lever-advance V and VI series canon rangefinders. in addition to having swing-open backs with conventional film loading and proper rewind cranks, these cameras are small, quiet and functional works of art designed in the bauhaus style. they are all metal and built every bit as solid as contemporary leicas; some say more so. they have an integrated viewfinder/rangefinder with adjustable magnification. prices and availability are comparable to the IIIf.\nRay DiCecca , February 20, 2009; 05:05 A.M.\nIIIf w/Summitar (yellow filter) & Tri-X\nI love the color rendering of the Summitar lens - my favorite and only lens on my IIIf RD. Here's one in B&W:\n, February 21, 2009; 10:35 P.M.\nFeeding The Chickadees\nAfter trying a brick of Provia 100 I decided I would stick with that film, almost exclusively, and learn it inside-out. While I never really disliked Velvia, the colours (as others have mentioned) seem a bit too much for my taste.\nFunny thing is, since I started using a DSLR, about 2 years ago, and got up to speed with computer editing software, I seem to punch-up the colours until I get velvia-like results. I think I have been doing this just because I can...and I am now getting over it (or so I would like to think) ;~))\nI still shoot 35mm kit with Provia 100 but I also enjoy the excitement that comes along with trying a new film...haven't found the \"digital equivalent\" for that feeling yet. So, lately I have been shooting Provia 400 and Astia as well as the Kodak and Ilford chromogenic B&W films.\nI enjoyed your article Josh. It prompted me to drag-out my binders and look over all my E6 stuff. Keep them coming!\nThe photo was shot on Provia 100 - pushed one stop.\nCheers! Jay\nGreg King , February 22, 2009; 01:22 A.M.\nHello Josh.\nI would be very interested in a Filmtown on the Agfa Clack and what contemporary film(s) would be a good match.\nFriends of my family came out to Australia, after the war, and I have ended up with their Clack. Its simplicity baffles me sometimes!\nRob F.\n, February 23, 2009; 05:36 A.M.\nJosh: the first Leica I ever used was my Dad's model II, with f/3.5 Elmar. I was around age 12 or 13 when I started using it. Later I used his IIIf for several years. I no longer have either, but I have another II, with nickel Elmar; and a pair of IIIcs. I do use the IIIcs, along with the Leica M cameras I mostly use today. In fact the IIIcs will go with me to France next month. They are small and light, and make good walkaround cameras with my tiny Cosina-Voigtlander lenses. I use the 25mm, the 28mm black \"pancake\" Color-Skopar; and the 35mm f/2.5; all with Cosina accessory finders. I also use the 50mm collapsible Summicron.\nI find it is only necessary to trim away seven or eight sprocket holes when preparing film for a thread-mount Leica. That's been enough to prevent a misload. Eight sprocket holes equals the length of one frame, and that seems to be enough.\nI use both Velvia and Provia 100F. I do like strong, punchy color. After all, a photo is an interpretation of reality; an abstraction. So why worry about colors being \"natural,\" unless we are taking portraits? But I've also experimented with using Astia for contrasty outdoor shots. I think it may have a bit more latitude in that situation. And in direct sunlight, the color still seems vibrant enough. What do you think?\nArthur Plumpton\n, February 25, 2009; 01:01 P.M.\nI think my reason for buying a used IIIf (actually a IIIb transformed into a IIIf) was part romantic (Leica history; HCB and others used them; also it was a classic camera of its time) and part practical (desire for a virtually indestructable camera body, one that could take modern LTM type lenses).\nMost of my photographic equipment is manual exposure or simply manual with external lightmetering. Using a manual M6 camera, I could focus more rapidly than a friend using an autofocus camera (at the time, c1995), although no doubt this would not be possible today. In any case, much of my photography is slower and methodical, trying to create compositions as much as responding to them. The IIIf, for all its inconveniences (poor VF, double window for RF adjustment, slightly difficult to manipulate shutter speeds, film loading, virtually impossible to calibrate shutter speed with a Calumet shutter tester, etc.) is a decent camera.\nMost of my rapid shooting is done with a more modern silent camera, like the Mamiya 6, with Tri-X or HP5, but I often will put a slower film in the IIIf (Pan-F, Acros 100, T-Max 100) and shoot more slowly with it. Accessory viewfinders and Cosina Voigtlander lenses are an excellent match and allow fine results. I don't have much faith in the older Leica lenses. Have tried an uncoated Elmar 50 and the rendition is at best fair, but maybe I have a particularly poor lens.\nThe use of the Leica film cutting template is I think unnecessary - you can simply eyeball the form and cut the film leader quickly, with a pair of scissors.\nBijesh Keyes , February 26, 2009; 09:24 P.M.\njuly 4 parade in Roundrock, TX\nProvia is a great film. It's almost as saturated as Velvia. Great colors and sharpness.\nAndrew Clark , February 27, 2009; 02:24 P.M.\nI still have no idea why people cut the film before loading. I never had a problem. Is there some advantage or does it make people feel special?\nDavid Haguenauer , March 06, 2009; 04:32 A.M.\nI see excellent scans on this page. Where did you have them made, or what scanner did you use? I have had bad (dark, lifeless) results getting slide film scanned: is it because the places I went to used a minilab scanner that is optimized for negatives? Would it help to expose more than the box sensitivity suggests?\nAnthony Darling , March 16, 2009; 05:58 A.M.\nAhh - what a delightful collection of memories.\nMy first Leica was a III with 3.5 Elmar I bought in 1983 for GBP 80. I still have that camera and take it out to shoot when I feel the need for a nostalgia top-up. Normally it is loaded with monochrome 400 ASA films, but last week I began my first colour reversal film - Kodachrome 64. I suspect in its early life (mid 1930's) most Leica photos were taken without the benefit of an electronic exposure measuring aid. For exposure measurement when I decide not to guess, or use the F/16 - ASA speed rule, I use a German exposure meter - the Gossen Profisix system unit - as big as many cameras these days.\nI am not expecting the Kodachrome results to match those from my M6 (itself a 24 year old), but I am expecting them to show some character.\nPersonally the abiding memory of this camera is its compact size with the collapsible lens, making it easily coat pocketable. Oh yes and the viewfinder the size of a keyhole. Personally I have never found the Model III particularly hard to load; I have also found there is no need to replicate the film tongue shape accurately, as long as the first inch of so is of a width to fit the take-up spool.\nAs evidence that I am not a Luddite digital hater, I am using digital for most pictures, with an EOS 5D and the Leica inspired Canon G9 (see the Canon website). I really miss the instant confirmation of image that digital gives when I shoot film.\n, March 30, 2009; 04:38 P.M.\nJamie's blue eyes\nUsing Leica with Fuji Provia 100 F is great idea. I tried Leica M6 with Kodak Ektar 100 and Elitechrome slide film. Now looking at photos made with the Provia 100F I found the similarities to Ektar 100. They both give the blue cast and bluish - purple skin tonalities. Personally, I like a lot these casts. So I will have to try Provia 100 F for the portraits.\nJanne Moren , March 31, 2009; 09:17 A.M.\nNow you got me to try Provia 100F - and slide film in general - for the very first time. I've only shot BW and a bit of negative color up until now; we'll see how this goes. As I understand, the exposure latitude is just about nil with slide film so if nothing else it'll be a good test of my metering skills.\n, April 02, 2009; 05:07 P.M.\nThe intrepid men in their flying machine - Leica IIIa with Kodak E100 GX film\nI have had my father's Leica IIIa which he bought in 1935/36, since my 16th birthday, more than 45 years ago. I use it regularly if infrequently, now, as well as his 1958 M3, and my own R4. But most of my photography is through a DSLR Canon 50D, with and without leica lenses. In February I ran a couple of rolls of Kodak E100 GX slide film through the IIIa, using an equally antiquated light meter - here's one of those images: http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=8883357 It is such a joy to hold and use such a compact piece of beautiful miniature engineering...\nJustin Serpico\n, April 06, 2009; 08:35 P.M.\nProvia is by far the best slide film on the market. Scans extremely well, is bold enough to make K64 look monotone, but versatile enough to take people photos. It pushes well, and is just a joy to use.\nEvery now and then I try Velvia or 100VS or something a bit more punchy and I always regret it. I always had problems with Velvia, and it simply cannot be used in high contrast situations while Provia does reasonably well when the need arises. The other thing with Provia, is it seems to have less processing issues. I very rarely get back a roll that I think was bad processing, while Velvia and 100VS seem to make me wonder if it was the processing.\nI'm glad this stuff is still readily available, I cannot really imagine a film being much better than Provia 100F for many situations.\nJohn Lovelace\n, April 16, 2009; 09:52 P.M.\nAttachment shot with Provia by Leica M6. I like both Provia and Velvia but have settled on Astia as my general go-to transparency film.

Coupled with Jupiter 8 and 12 (50mm f/2 and 35mm f/2.8).\nI do use them regularly when playing tourist - the process does shape the outcome as the photos always seem different than the DSLR ones shot at the same time.\n, May 29, 2009; 11:27 P.M.\nCanon A-1, 50mm f/1.4\nProvia in 2004 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

All this on 35mm, but I just bought a Mamiya rb67 and am looking around at 120 film. I still will shoot that with mostly T-Max, I think, but for colour I was thinking of Velvia, just cause I've seen so many others writing that they use it. Does anyone know of any photo shoot-outs using slowish colour films? Btw, that picture of Jack, Beth, and the horse is really nice, it looks like Jack is uncertain about the big animal and is checking to see if Beth is concerned about it.

But it's still a jewel of a camera and capable of first class results. But I like the M2 much better to shoot with.\nMy first camera WAS a rangefinder though, a Konica I from my Dad and it too was a little jewel which had a collapsable non interchangeable lens and Leica like build. It's probably why I have an enduring love of rangefinders and the Konica wouldn't have existed without the Leica. These days my main camera is an M8 (can't afford the M9 and the M8 is a great IR camera).\npaul bonnichsen , August 07, 2010; 01:32 A.M.\nJosh,\nEnjoyed your article on the Leica lllF and Fuji Provia 100F. I will most likely go to digital this year for my commercial photography due to no processing of E-6 in Kansas City as I need faster turnaround times to clients. I remain very loyal to Provia 100F and my Mamiya RB67 for my fine art... I've been shooting with Provia now for approximately sixteen years and find the results outstanding with this film.\nSince I'm new on photo.net and have never posted an image, I'll give it a try with one of my images I shot in lower Antelope Canyon using Provia 100F.\nRegards!\ncedric muscat , October 07, 2010; 06:00 A.M.\nNice article!\nHere are 2 images digitised (with a digital camera, so some degradation) from an M6 and a 28 mm on the French coast.\u00a0 The colours from a Fuji RM Sensia although grainy are quite pleasant.\nThe M6 loading is an improvement on the III but is still quite quirky.\ncedric muscat , October 07, 2010; 06:04 A.M.\nHere is the second image, details as in previous image.\nJeff Livacich , November 17, 2010; 01:04 A.M.\nFuji has announced that Provia is no longer available in 220 rolls.\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

Anderson , March 22, 1998; 07:36 P.M.\nI sometimes use a Yashica-Mat 124G with the normal 80mm lens. Properly used, it can give superb results. The challenge for portraits is that the lens perspective is too close. And you're on your own for filters if you want a warm or soft effect. So, get creative, back up and crop the big square negative later. And speaking of film, because of the higher cost, you'll be enticed to slow down and shoot more efficiently.\nScott Gant , June 28, 1998; 01:49 A.M.\nGreat article.\nI have a couple of points though. You mentioned in the article about film selection: \"If you're doing color, you'll want subtle tones, low color saturation, and low-ish contrast. My favorite films are Fuji Astia, Kodak 100SW\".\nThose choices of films kind of contradicts your statement though. Astia is considered by many to be almost \"Velvia Light\". Great color saturation but acurate skin tones. And of course, Kodak 100SW has high saturation too. That's what the \"S\" in SW means...the W means toward the warm tones.\nFuji NPS is a great one though for low contrast/ saturation...which is why it's such a great wedding film.\nPhilip Greenspun\n, June 28, 1998; 01:38 P.M.\nScott's right of course about the ISO 100 slide films being pretty saturated. Still, that's sort of all that you can get these days in slide film.\nBill Briggs , February 24, 1999; 03:41 P.M.\nOn the subject of using fast primes for portraiture, I'd like to offer a lens that is: Inexpensive,Sharp, and handy to use. That is the Nikon 100mm/2.8 E (AIS) lens that has been around for years. This lens is available (used) in the neighborhood of about $100 or so. Several lens raters have noted that this is a good lens for optical quality, but seem to downcheck it somewhat for mechanical quality because of the plastic build. That's not a problem for studio work though, and for the field -- just don't use it to pound nails. Any comments by others?\nshiv s , February 26, 1999; 03:12 A.M.\nAs a professional photographer specialising on location fashion and potrait shoots, I can vouch for the countless times an 80-200 f2.8 has saved me from many a tight corner. Shiv Saran\nPaul Koster , March 23, 1999; 01:50 P.M.\nI can only agree with Shiv S. Though a 2.8/80-200 zoom is indeed huge and heavy, it gives the freedom of getting closer to and getting further away from your subject without moving from the spot you're standing. Apart from the thus gained advantage of speed when trying to catch spontanious moment in just the right frame, I find it a huge advantage that, e.g. when working with a inexperienced model, you don't have to run around the place to get a close up or a medium or three-quarter shot, and thus avoid unsettling the model with the unrest otherwise created.\nMark Tuccillo , March 29, 1999; 11:53 A.M.\nI agree with Paul Koster. I recently purchased the Nikon 80-200 f2.8 D ( non S ), and it as sharp as my 135 f2. This is an amazing lens and it provides for great flexability. Although heavy, it's well worth it. Portraits have a great look. Give it a try, you will be amazed.\nTan Chung , April 08, 1999; 07:05 A.M.\nHi,\nBefore I got my Canon, I was using a Nikkormat with a 50mm lens.\nAll my recent shots are done on a Canon EOS 28-105mm at the longer end. Tell me whether you can see the difference in quality.

After all, the point of a portrait is to reveal something about the subject. That's why I find most plain background studio shots sterile. It's always a struggle deciding how much of the background to include. Usually the old rule applies: less is more. The face usually says it all.\ngreg b. , May 30, 1999; 01:57 A.M.\nPretty informative user friendly site. You know, one of the things that has always both fascinated me and irritated me is what I call the \"expensive camera mystique\" or ECM. I swore that ONLY a Nikon 90s or Canon EOSn1 could take the great pictures. An impressive photo exhibit held by a woman armed with only a measly Canon AE-1 changed all that. The way I figure, some of my most favorite photos were shot on cameras many times inferior to the so called pro gear. I still however would like to own the 90s for its high ratings, lens availability and versatilty. It's a great camera to hold and prices on the model have dropped in recent years. I must add that portrait photography is my favorite category next to still life and I prefer b/w to color about 75% of the time. Nikon prime lenses are expensive but the only ones I want are the 20mm, 24mm, 85mm and 105mm macro. Hopeully I can find some used ones!

This lens was very sharp, and great in the studio due to the constant maximum aperture. When I got my F4s, I decided to get an 85 1.8 af, and have sworn by this lens ever since. The wide aperture REALLY makes the subject pop! I like this lens so much, that I sold the 75-150!\nFajar Reksoprodjo , October 22, 1999; 06:38 A.M.\nHi Philip,\nJust visited your portrait photo page. Thanks for the infos, really helpful. However, you seem to concentrate in using expensive equips. For a lowly cheap (and poor) student like me, it's kinda hard to get them. Personally, I found out that using Canon 50mm/1.8 Mk. II is enough for my need. As I like to get up close and personal to my subjects. For candid portrait (capturing expression), it seems to me that people notice you less when you're close to them. They thought you were focusing on something else. I'm just an amateur, however, so my opinion might not be correct. Thanks again for the website, really helpful.\nRegards, fajar\njoon um , October 24, 1999; 01:14 A.M.\nHere is what I did for buying portrait lens. First I bought cheap so called universal zoom lens. I think those lens really give some idea of charateristic focal length and give a chance novice like me to explore the different focal length. Eventhough quality of those lens was not great, To me It was acceptable. and later I can use as a preview lens for medium format camera that doesn't have camera meter. After analyze the picture I took, I can break down portrait into couple of the situation.\n1)Standard portrait: 2)Telephoto portrait:candid, natural unposed, long enough to be subjects aren't aware of them being photographed 3)Environmental portrait:The subject and surroundings are equally important 4)Detailed Body part:Macro works on portrait 5)Exaggerated body portion portrait:So called wide angle close up portrait, for thsoe fun special effect, Using a distortion a minimizing hadicaped body portion for example making short leg looks longer. 6)Group portrait:Family photo, wedding photo something like that kind of gathering. Then think each case what kind of the lens will be useful. For the case 1), Something like 85mm/1.8 or 100mm/2 will be useful. For2), 300mm focal length is minimum. For3), lens like 24mm 28mm 35mm will be ideal For4), Dedicated macro lens, or medium telephoto lens with extension tube For5), 24mm or at least 28mm will be ideal. this one should be single focal prime For6),35mm or 50mm will be ideal.\nnext set the budjet.and study the which brand is ideal for me\nMy choice for portrait lens was -->\n24mm/2.8 Eos USM(35mm format) 34mm/2.8 Sekkor manual(medium format)(this is 35mm equivalent focal length) 50mm/1.4EOS USM(35mm format) 93mm/3.5 Sekkor manual(medium format)(this is 35mm equivalent focal length) 135/2 EOS USM(35mm format)+Et-25 300/4IS EOS USM(35mm format)+1.4X\nI think this is minimum for the portrait. My point is this is almost every kind of the lens. I can shoot with this lens almost any kind of situation not just portrait nature, concert, indoor or outdoor event,sport, action etc.\nPaula Swaim , April 27, 2000; 08:51 P.M.\nI think it's a good idea to use a medium format camera for people pictures. I use a Pentax 645 with a 150 lens often. I do 100% black and white because I do it myself. I like having proof sheets that are viewable and 15 shots is economical but still greatly superior to 35 mm for portraits. I have a square \"clunker\" camera which is a Bronica S2A and a 75 mm Nikkor-Q lens, both 30 years old. That's nice for group shots or full-body shots. Like I said, the quality is superior to 35 mm and the proof sheets are easy to view. I like to use a medium-speed film like Plus-X or my all-time favorite is Agfa APX 100 which is sharper and gives a lovelier image than Plus-X, and it's generally cheaper.\nAnother thing about people shots, I like to do the old-fashioned type of portrait that is mainly window light. One-hundred years ago, portraits were made with a soft north light from a window and I love that look in black and white. I generally make my pictures sharp too, or I'll use a very minor diffusion filter that barely alters the image.\nPaula Swaim , April 27, 2000; 08:59 P.M.\nColin Hastings\nActually, I started doing portraits with Tri-X and a Nikon FM2N and a Vivitar Series-1 28-105 lens. This portrait is an example. It's good quality, but it would be better in 645 format. The proof sheets were hard to view. This image is on Ilford MG RC warmtone paper, toned in selenium 1:8 for a chocolate look. The subject loved it.\nMarcelo Salup , December 22, 2000; 08:29 A.M.\nThere seems to be too much concentration on equipment and too little on the core subject which is people. I have noticed that the older I get, the less likely I am to approach people and take portraits in the street. I used to enjoy it so much, but now don't do it as much. How do most street photographers do it? Do you just click away? Do you try to engage the person in some conversation? Any pointers? Thanks.\nMark McCombs , January 09, 2001; 05:43 P.M.\nGood article, but a lot of the comments confirm the belief that most photographers are just equipment buffs. When I used to shoot professionally, I was appalled that when you get a group of photographers together in a room, invariably they are talking about equipment, not how to get the shot, marketing, composition, rapport, etc. Can someone please tell me what difference it makes whether an Nikon FM, FE, F2, or F5 are used to make an image? A camera body should be viewed as something to hold the film and lens and be good at that. I love it when I see great images being made on what some would call \"inferior\" equipment.\nsteve wall , January 28, 2001; 02:26 P.M.\ni liked the portrait article. but i also understand the other comments. it seems to me that about 80% of creative portraits is the photographer. Knowing how to use your equipment and its limits. I've seen some great portraits with equipment most people would have given to the kids. When in doubt shoot the picture. then analyze the results and learn from them. when you reach the limits of your equipment then move up.\nAns Beaulieu , March 13, 2001; 08:45 P.M.\nI have two lenses that I prefer to use for portrait: my Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 and my Sigma AF 70-200 f/2.8 HSM APO. Both of these lense are fast and allow shallow dept of field.\nI love the 50mm for getting \"up close and personnal\" with my subjects, where I can have that special interaction wich make for great candid portrait. It will ofthen gives a very intimate look to your portrait that is difficult to get with telephoto lenses. It is also quite fun to play around and improvise the shots with such a small tool (I use a Rebell 2000). Better yet, the 50mm cost 1/10 of the 70-200!!!.\nI usually use the 70-200mm with kids or when getting too close would intimidate the subject. It is also great for environmental portrait for its ability to compress perspective at the same time.\nFor some examples take a look at:\nhttp://www.photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=107614\nhttp://www.photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=49319\nJohn Kahmann , May 26, 2001; 03:23 P.M.\nI shoot with a Nikon N90 and a Yashica D. The Nikon is more for the action/fast moving pictures, and the Yashica is for my portraits and still lifes. I would like to scrap them both and purchase a Mamiya but the price is a little to high. I will say that despite the ugly appearance and technical limitations(by today's standards), my Yashica is a workhorse and for quality the 6X6 destroys 35mm. I shoot portraits of friends and coworkers using Ektachrome 100S and have never been happier. You'll never see them on the cover of Cosmo and Cindy Crawford isn't beatng down my door to have her picture taken, but I still get excited every time I see a roll of my pictures. At the end of the day I'm happy(for the most part) with the pictures I took, enjoyed the time working with the models, and look forward to critiquing(?) my own work. To me that's what the art of photography is about. However I wouldn't mind being in the business of photography either!\nBruce MacNeil , June 01, 2001; 12:17 P.M.\nThe 8x10 camera is one of the most luxurious portrait tools available. I use this format for portraits taken in my home. If you can afford it - by all means...... Nothing beats the flattering presence of camera offered by an 8x10. Except maybe the 20x24 Polaroid.\nmargaret martin , June 02, 2001; 05:24 P.M.\nVery good artical.Do agree that you bring up alot of highly priced equipment not everyone can afford.i've found that all of my pentax cameras are comfortably priced and do a wonderful job no matter what i'm shooting.On the comment made about street photography,its all about human contact.talk to people,make them feel comfortable with you and the sometimes scary to some people piece of equipment your carrying.I have been in the lower side of east philly and got wonderful shots of the people who live there and had great conversation too.Its a nice way to spend your sunday afternoon and it reacquaints you with you \"people skills\".\nWilliam Cordray , June 22, 2001; 01:39 A.M.\nFor portraits, technically, I have to say for the majority of the time I use my Nikon bodies (F100 and FM2n) and an 80-200mm 2.8 nikkor zoom and the cheap 50mm 1.8 made in china nikkor that costs around $100. Occasionally I might shoot with a 24mm 2.8 nikkor that is quite sharp and gives me distortions that for some reason I find pleasing and humorous. All three lenses give me what I want in doing portraits for people either posed or candid. I have a 105mm 2.8 micro nikkor lens but I never use it. People always stressed how this is a great portrait lens but I've found it to be a little limiting due to its picky focusing and awkward focal length for me personally. I much like the results with my 50mm or my 80-200mm lenses. Anyone want to take this macro lens off my hands for a price??\nWhen I shoot portraits I always try to have conversations with my subjects about things like what they like, what I like, the news, weather, etc. I don't shoot and say \"oh thats great,\" or \"beautiful\", I'd rather ask them \"so where are we going for lunch?\" or \"did you see that guy on the news that attacked his dog?\" I want let my subject relax and just be themselves. Thats why I like shooting people who are actors or just have a knack for it. But of course it isn't as easy as that. I think the main thing is, is just getting people to become comfortable even if it takes a few tries to get it right. But one thing I always like to do when I meet a subject for the first time, leave the camera at home.\nEmmanouil Skoufos , June 29, 2001; 05:30 P.M.\nZeiss Sonnar 180 f2.8, shot\nI do a lot of \"available light\" environmental portrairture work, both indoors and outdoors using highly saturated (albeit \"slow\" 50 -100 ASA) films. My absolutely favorite lens is the Zeiss Sonnar 180 f2.8 multicoated lens (adapted to fit my trusty manual Minolta system) that allows me to take both indoor and outdoor shots when the subjects are comforable in a natural form and setting. Also with the big glass wide open, it allows me to take pictures in fairly ugly backgrounds without disturbing the composition Here is an example (also see the picture submitted). I dislike the tension of \"posed\" portraits, especially with younger people and children. When the subject is willing to go through some film and spend some time, I usually use the Minolta Rokkor 85/f2.8 Varisoft lens, probably one of the best lenses made that would allow you to create photoshop-like (but much more natural) effects on your slide or negative.\n, June 30, 2001; 10:04 A.M.\nYashica T5, Kodak 400CN\n\"The worst possible camera is a zoom point and shoot.\"\nI've to disagree with this statement. P&S camera can take good portrait too! The T5 has a f3.5 aperture. If u are close enough and light level is low, you too can have a nice background blur.\nWilliam Baguhn , July 09, 2001; 01:50 P.M.\nTo address Wee Keng Hor's comment:\nThe Yashica T5 is not a zoom point and shoot. Heck, I have an XA, and I love it. Not all point and shoots are bad, just the zoom point and shoots where the F-stop at the long end falls below about f5.6. Even those are GOOD cameras, they just aren't ideally suited to portraiture.\nGeorge D. Gianni , August 11, 2001; 11:02 A.M.\nA portrait is a broadly defined term. Though my favourite head and shoulders portraits were and are taken with an old 1.4/85mm lens, a skilled photographer does definitely not need one to take good portraits. I do use 35 and 50mm primes for people and my 28-70mm zoom is also used frequently, while my 135mm prime sits on the shelf.\n\"Portrait\" may even be considered the subject which requires the least specialised equipment in photography.\nR Murray , September 22, 2001; 08:40 P.M.\nAh, the vexed issue of street photography (see above). I'm generally pretty shy and have a hard time approaching interesting subjects. I have the best success when I wear a big grin and a have a neat appearance (this depends, if you're in, say the East Village of Manhattan, you can dress arty and you'll probably have better luck). Always, always ask before snapping away, unless you see a decisive moment, in which case have a chat with your subject afterwards. Be sensitive, too: during the recent nightmare here in NYC, I saw thousands of shutterbugs shooting away with what seemed to be little regard for the people around them. Personally, I feel this is intrusive and slightly unethical. But then, it's up to you to decide whether the art you create in these situations will transcend the exploitative quality inherent in photographing people at the limits of despair. On a happier note, many of the photos I've seen of the rescuers and survivors of the terrorist attack have been exceedingly moving. I salute everyone for their bravery.\nElaine Roberts , October 15, 2001; 10:20 A.M.\nRegarding p&s zooms - I have a Samsung Maxima Zoom (38-145), and although it has gotten some great shots for me, I must say that in general - for portraits as well as general photog - the f/11 maximum aperature at 145 can be EXTREMELY frustrating. It'll take great pics on a bright sunny day, but even on overcast days it'll sometimes \"get ya\". I'm poor, and a beginner, so I just have a Rebel 2000 w/the kit 28-80, (f/3.5-5.6), and even this is far better for portraiture than the p&s. It would be very cool to have a f/2.8 lens for portraits but frankly I just can't afford them. So that basically just means I have to control my background more. A bit more of a hassle, but it works.\n2 of my favorite portraits taken w/the cheapo 28-80:\n<http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=298364> <http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=251884>\nPatryk Soika , November 14, 2001; 01:52 P.M.\nI'm not certain that a fast lens is required for portraits. Particularly not if we are shooting for a crisp image and softening it in Photoshop. It is just another step to blur the background, not too much trouble.\nTony Samples , November 23, 2001; 01:52 A.M.\nOne comment I think others may find useful: If you're taking a portrait of a difficult subject, like a child who doesn't want to hold still or anyone who isn't comfortable in front of the camera, I've found that handing my camera over and letting them burn a couple of frames on me or anything else they'd like to photograph has fixed this problem 100% of the time. My son used to run from me when I said I wanted to take his picture. I had my tripod and the subject stool all set up and suggested he snap a couple of pictures of his stuffed animals with it. After he did that, I got a whole roll of portraits that he would never have allowed me to take of him before.\nkeki unwalla , March 01, 2002; 03:55 A.M.\nYou ask for a different perspective. This one may sound self indulgent but its factual. I know nothing about techtalk or f stops or even how to read light meter. But I take beautiful portraits so much so that I am asked by friends to take a couple of master frameable ones at weddings even when pros are there for the general photoshoots. I am an interior designer. Having taken some pics of my own work clients have asked me to do photo work for them. Portraits. I look through the lens moving it and the subject till I find that expression which in 2D is the same as I would see it in 3D. When I get the subject in his most natural element, specially laughing, which essentially means the showing of teeth, that makes a good pic. This is because frozen laughter is better than a frozen smile which starts out frozen and unnatural.Teeth are natural elements that add ivory or white color to a colored photos thus showing a kind of hot spot with the eyes. I use little background as I crop close. Always black. I shoot fast in a series with a Nikon F5 and Tamron zoom 28 to 210 on full auto. I pick the best out of postcard prints, design the cropping with a white bracket as I give the large 10 by 12s a thick 1\" border of the white photopaper. I am lucky enough to be friends with the owner of the city's best studio where I frame the image on the enlarging plate. THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT. I could never tell the actual correct scale of the faces on paper until I saw this on the paper. I Ok this then the technician does his job. Sometimes a tilt to the face breathes unbelievable life to the portrait. But really, go for the laughter. It comes alive. Also I would never take a pic without studying the subject as others ordinarily see him. Ordinarily, with his gestures or expressions or tilt or agression and t shirt or tux . Ordinarily. Now I have just bought an F5 and must learn the sophisticated language of cameras. All my pics are easy daylight but with a handheld background. Amateurish. But they like the protype results.\nGerry Siegel (Honolulu)\n, March 17, 2002; 12:53 A.M.\nPortraits are a subject where one can get away with pretty little in the way of equipment. Autofocus is a convenience but not a necessity. Lighting outdoors is as nice as lighting indoors, if you try for the same combination of lighting effect on the subject(the ratio business and the big light source business meaning naturally soft without soft focus lenses courtesy old \"Sol\". Late in the day or early in the morning I like. Even after sunset. I started this comment because I keep on thinking about the eyes,seen by some as the center of the soul thing and the place to focus critically. Because I dont want the eyes to be deadish looking I try to use a small flash to put a sparkle in them. Its formulaic true, but the formula is one that most subjects come to expect. Some people have really dark eyes that need it more than others. But the psychology of getting someone to relax is tough. You might need to waste some film doing that. Anybody that can do it with one or two frames, (as in big Polaroids)whoah my deepest admiration. Thats a portrait photographer. I like to use an 85mm which is not as sharp as the the sharpest lenses out there. Wide open it gives some softness to the edges and an out of focus background. Environmental work is the kind that is the supreme example of the art. These are the portraits that never get forgotten. Show some of the subjects life, and they relax more. And love the result more. A pretty face is a pretty face, but a person in their home or on their tractor. That is ageless.\nTom Morris , May 14, 2002; 08:14 A.M.\nAs always, an item on photo.net talking too much about cameras, lenses and films, and not enough about photography.\nI don't care whether you used an SLR, TLR, P&S, rangefinder, 35mm, 6x6 or even flippin' APS. I care what pictures you take.\nYou don't meet up with other writers and talk about typewriters and pens. You don't meet up with other artists and talk about paintbrushes. So why do photographers always seem to spend hours talking about flipping cameras!\nKalpesh Sheth , June 13, 2002; 02:16 P.M.\nCheck out this Portrait of my 5 months old son\nMalcolm Kantzler , July 14, 2002; 01:27 A.M.\nAlex Lee's picture of Camille (two above at this writing) is a perfect example of the need for short-telephoto portrait lenses. If I were shooting her in a tightly cropped frame as he did, I would have used a 135mm, because beautiful as she is, I'll bet she goes on and on about her ski-jump nose. That's what a girl friend of mine called hers, but I loved it, too. Mr. Lee's objectivity has been clouded by his appreciation of her beauty, and the use of a short-tele would have made her nose less prominent, instead of exaggerating it, even beyond how she appears to the corporeal eye-brain connection that cancels out the phenomenon of optical physics, perspective.\nIf Mr. Lee's intent was to lend emphasis to the subject's nose because he likes it, then his choice of a 50mm lens in a tight shot is appropriate. A subject with a broad, flat nose would be better served by use of a 50mm, the closer perspective narrowing the nose and bringing it out. The perspective shaping power of lenses is the first and most effective tool a photographer has to emphasize or de-emphasize a subject's features, for good or bad, or different.\nAnd to Gerry Siegel, I envy you your 20/20 vision, but when it begins to fail you so that you can't clearly see the image in the viewfinder as quickly as you used to, you'll think that AF is a Godsend and realize that it IS a necessity, because without it you'll lose shots. In portraiture or candid people photography, time taken to frame and focus, if more than an instant, is the killer of the first, honest expression, the natural smile and the subject's patience. After you've learned to see your AF's focus-lock indicators (depending on mode and lens) as quickly as you see a flash-ready light come on, then you can trust the camera and go with the shot you know you want, even if your eyes haven't caught up with the camera's yet.\nPaul Andre , July 22, 2002; 02:54 A.M.\nA 50mm lens is good lens to have especially with the new dSLRs.

Here's a portrait experimenting with colored gels:\nJeff Bishop , December 08, 2002; 12:14 P.M.\nChestnut Hill Street Fair Mime\nI am in agreement with Alex Lee. Too many people view photos and one of the first things they check is the photo equipment. Professional equipment does not make for a professional photographer. Whatever equipment a pro is using, instead, becomes pro equipment. Any decent camera and lens will give great results, when used properly.\nStephen Lutz , January 20, 2003; 08:18 P.M.\nThe father of a friend of mine, standing in his kitchen\nThe D-30/D-60 class of digital SLRs can certainly take fine portraits. I have been using my D-30 for that purpose for some time, and even an off the cuff \"snapshot\" can turn out quite well with this camera, an 85 1.8 lens and a bounced 550EX flash. Here's an example of one I shot around Christmas. ISO 100.\nJon Revere , January 24, 2003; 07:34 P.M.\nAs a new member of photo.net, it has been a real pleasure reading this article and the responses from so many members. Having been involved with photography since 1970, I would like to put in my two cents. My first camera was a Canon Ftb and I took some of my most flattering, sharp, and valued portraits with that camera and the 55mm lens that came with it. Today, I own my second camera, an Elan bought in 1992, before they started numbering them. I purchased it because of my failing eyesight; I could no longer see well enough to focus manually. I still take flattering portraits but with all the focusing assist of the Elan, I feel like I've lost some control of my portraits. Even still, I love my Elan because it allows me to still be involved in photography. So I've owned two cameras in 32 years. I've heard people argue about equipment for decades, and now that digital is on the scene, I'm listening to the digital/chemical debate. It all comes down to one thing though. Its the way we see. It doesn't matter whether its using a point-and-shoot or a Hasselblad, an S-100 or a D-1, its the final result that matters and in the case of portraits for pay, its what the client sees that matters too. When I listen to others talk about equipment, I really hear them talk about how they love to see, what a beautiful world they see through their own eyes, how their equipment helps them see, and how they want to share what they see with others.\nMark Whitaker , January 31, 2003; 05:48 P.M.\nI found the Portait article to be very informative, the only comment is that I personally like zooms they allow me a student on a budget to get the photos I want without having to dish out for extra lenses, I currently use a Minolta x-700 for studio work, and a canon eos 1n with a 70-200mm 2.8 sigma for outdoor,location work. I am not a portrait photographer, I shoot rock bands but have been hired to photograph bands for promotional work and I like the lens I have just fine. I think tele zooms do have a place, the optics are really good, and the allow more creative freedom. -Mark\nBruce Thee\n, February 12, 2003; 10:10 P.M.\nThe portrait page is good, but I agree with a couple of the comments that there is too much talk about equipment. I have a Blad with the 180mm, and the M6 with the 90mm, and the F5 with the 80-200 2.8. What I've discovered is that all that is not nearly as important as the lighting and the connection with the subject. You should expand you those areas, as those seem to be where a photog can distinguish him or her self.\nAnamitra Chakladar , February 24, 2003; 11:58 A.M.\nHi, I am a Photo-journalist based in India and occasionally dabble in location fashion shoots...a Nikon 80-200/2.8ED is great, but, this new 135/2 DC and a simple 50/1.4 can do wonders.

I am also dying to see Nikon's 70-200/2.8 VR...guys feedback please !\nben michalski , September 20, 2003; 01:39 A.M.\nI guess \"pro\" photographers really have some egotistical need to fill when they talk about all their equipment and techniques you know the Rollies and the Hassies and the Nikon F's LONG FAST AND MOST OF ALL Absurdly Expensive, I mean you can buy a car for the price of an outfit.But I hate to bust your bubble folks most of the above lesson is nonsense.

This page reminds me of a Jackson Pollak review of fine art.\nVic Chui , September 27, 2003; 11:17 A.M.\nReading this article, I wonder if it is meant for amateurs or pro. For amateur, the equipment must be pretty humble, by your standards. It would be good to encourage amateurs to take pictures with simple and humble equipment. Otherwise, some beginners might go away with the impression that we need expensive equipment to take great pix, including portraits. I have taken quite a few rolls of portraits, both in a studio environment and outdoors, using an F80 and a Tamron 28-200XR and a 50D F1.8. They are sharp enough for me, at 8x12 enlargement. Upon scanning the negatives, viewing them on the screen at full size, I am pretty satisfied with it. I find that I am naturally shooting at around 100-110 of the zoom. I would like to get a SIMPLE 105 prime lens for this purpose, but what is available are those with macro or soft-focus. These are not so suitable and expensive. We should all concentrate more on composition, lighting, colour, contrast, film, rapport with the subject.... and less on the equipment, as someone has said that most modern equipment are better than most photographers.\nImage Attachment: 00330002.JPG\nKeiran Earl , October 31, 2003; 08:50 A.M.\nI appreciate that someone wrote this article, but like a lot of people, i find it too much focusing on the 'what' of equipment rather than the 'how-to' use equipment... if i want to read about 'what' equipment, i will read in the equipment sections... However, the 2 best peices of advice I have had about photographs came from the lens section of this learning forum on Photo.net, and a photographer friend who said that pictures taken from above are thinning to the face... both of these might be said to be obvious, but that is why i'm reading a learning section right? I do plenty of experimenting with my camera, so finding my own perspective is a task i reserve for myself, but what about tips on the basics, like placing of external flashes, and camera angles... these are things that are useful for the sort of people reading a learning section... Some of my best pictures that i am saving were taken before i learned how to do anything other than put camera in auto and click... and they can certainly could have been better (and i choose not to post-shoot-alter my pictures with what i feel to be artistic merit, so i have to do my learning)...\nanother comment is on the oddity of one person who commented that artists don't get together and discuss brushes, they just paint, but wouldn't it make sense that a person with an artistic eye who lacks the how-to knowledge ends up putting together a mediocre result? I have taken many pictures that are great scenes, but lame 2D reproductions of that moment... the art is in the heart, but the expression of it is in the method... for an example, look at the comment by keki unwalla... an excellent example of someone who has a great eye, but admittedly knows little about the working of the equipment... now, when more powerful equipment must be used, keki has to start to learn how to use the equipment a little more to correct for the failing of the physical eye... in the end, it is true that the eye makes the picture, but there is still a place for the technical discussion... if you don't believe that, try painting a ceiling mural with a stick and mud... at some point, you have to move forward... and when you do, you will need to learn how to do that in an informed and educated way.\nOrlin Stoilov , February 04, 2004; 08:31 A.M.\ndefinetly visible blurring with big zoom lenses 420mm/2.8\nA Monty\n, March 07, 2004; 07:03 A.M.\nI photograph children predominantly and find a prime 50mm 1.7 lens a godsend. Some children are quite intimidated by the long lens - even when you sit back and I have snapped some of my best shots with the tiny 50mm wide open - usually in the kids own home. The small size of the prime seems less intimidating and wide open with no flash - they often don't even realise you are taking their picture.\nPradeep Raghunathan , May 08, 2004; 02:11 P.M.\nLook into my eyes...\nThis is a lovely article, its nice to keep coming back and seeing newer posts. As there was a mention of photographing children, i am not sure if kids are very intimidated by the cameras, yes they do get attracted to it and inquisitive about it, but all it needs a colorful distraction and they forget you or the camera exist. I find kids to be the best subjects to shoot, and i think i would love to do more of child photography, done a few so far with a Canon G2 and the results are good, atleast for me :). But i do agree, i would love to shoot with a SLR and a 50mm 1.8 lens to get more candid shots. cheers! and happy shooting!

Here is an example of my friend and his girlfriend portrait.\nPS: I am new in this, please comment.\nRegards,\nMiguel Torres\nMichael Hansen , July 05, 2004; 05:30 P.M.\nI agree with the other postings that there is too much discussion about camera bodies and lenses. Most any 35mm SLR will generate the same portrait results, with only marginal differences in metering performance. The author DOES provide a service by touching on the use of alternate lighting sources and backgrounds. I suggest that inexperienced photographers look at their shots with an eye towards what they don't like. Is the perspective wrong? Was the lighting or exposure unflattering? Does the background interfere too much? Is the focus good? Was the subjects expression and body position appealing? The things that bug you most are the things you need to resolve...Example...My biggest problem used to be (and often still is)uneven/harsh/contrasty lighting when outdoors. The fix for this was not to buy a Canon 1Ds. I picked up a compact 5-in-1 reflector and a flash unit. Bang...problem improved and learning has taken place. Take this approach and pick off YOUR issues and you'll be taking better portraits.\nShawn Sauerwine , October 18, 2004; 01:16 P.M.\nFirst Smile- EOS Elan in P&Shoot mode\nI'd like to offer a balance here. What seems so obvious to me is the level of comfort of the portrait photographer- doing what feels most natural to them. Among all the diverse tastes and techniques of us as photographers- there are inevitably going to be techno-driven, budget-driven, and prestige-driven photographers. Each of the best are complimented with a good eye and a level of comfort in what they do. If the fact that you have the sharpest glass, most perfect combination zoom, or incredibly high-priced equipment makes you confident- perhaps this shows in your work! If, like me, you lack the budget (and fear damaging,) expensive equipment- using lower-priced equipment may be a necessity. You may be more likely to take your \"crappy\" equipment somewhere that another shooter, safeguarding a prized Hassy, will not. This will give you an edge in some circumstances.\nI've moved from camera and system to system, as life's budget required it, and I can say unequivocally, that I have the same tendency to fail or exceed that I have always had. Few things have changed, except where I?ve used the knowledge of my shortcomings in constant trial-and-error. In no particular order, I?ve shot with high-end Canon, entry-level Minolta, Olympus XA, 4x5, twin-lens, and now digital.\nI find my latest woes being that of learning the capacity in shooting, editing, and printing in digital. This, for the first time ever, has been a technical dilemma for me. At all other times, it has been an issue of what is comfortable for me to use. I can totally understand the need and want for expensive equipment- I understand that you can get to a level where this is the only thing holding you back from -consistently- getting the images you really want. I think technocrats and elitist-types both understand that a community college student with a ?crappy system? has every potential in the world to create an image that ?beats? that of the pro with the high-end equipment.\nBe comfortable in what you choose- and learn to use the tools you can afford. If you?re fidgeting around with a system?s features at the moment which is supposed to be immortalized in film- you?ve completely defeated your own purpose. Don?t let that moment slip away?forever.\nThanks everyone for creating this article, keeping this net going with such great opinion and experience! -Shawn\nps- Sorry about the question marks. I have no idea why they appear, but can't change them, either.\nDEBBIE MORTON , November 13, 2004; 09:17 A.M.\nWhen I finally took the plunge and went digital the salesman who sold the camera to me summed it up best. He said people come in the store and ask \"Does this camera take good pictures?\" He wants to tell them \"That depends on who is standing behind it.\" I don't know a lot about the technical parts of photography, being self taught there is a lot of it that I just don't get. I find for portraits a long lens gets the best results. It is intimidating to the subject to be right in their face.\nJuanCarlos Torres , December 04, 2004; 08:10 A.M.\nIt is nice to come back after a couple of years and see people still excited about this article.\nJuan\nArlin Geyer , December 09, 2004; 06:38 A.M.\nI love Debbie Morton's comment about good pictures. It's not the camera that makes a good picture, but the photographer. And, as Philip commented in the article, the photographers who most consistently make good portraits are people who are genuinely interested in their subjects.\nWhatever equipment you have, learn how to use it. Learn it so well that you don't have to think about it. Every camera and lens has its strengths and limitations. Utilize the strengths of your equipment.\nMy father was a very challenging photographic subject. He put on his \"camera face\" whenever a camera was aimed at him. I finally made a good portrait of him with a $2.50 plastic camera, because he didn't take it seriously.\nI am sympathetic to Rich Jacobs' plight. (The first comment in this thread.) Indeed, there are many fine twin-lens reflex cameras in the used market. I began photographing with a 1940s-vintage Kodak Twin Lens Reflex that had been my mother's. It was a fine camera, albeit with its unique set of limitations.\nOne challenge I've had making portraits with a twin-lens reflex has to do with the fact that you look down onto a ground-glass viewer rather than through an eye-level viewfinder. I've found that often my subject is looking at me rather than at the camera, so that in the photograph he is looking above the viewer. Generally this is not a good thing. (Recently I've used a digital camera with a tilting LCD display. Working with children I often hold the camera down at the child's eye level and look down at the tilted display. This produces the same challenge as the twin-lens reflex.)\nRegarding the disadvantage of a point-and-shoot camera of always having much depth of field, the same is true of many digital cameras, particularly those without removable lenses. Most digital cameras on the market have very small sensors and therefore very short focal-length lenses. Short focal-length lenses produce great depth of field, even at a relatively wide aperture. With such cameras, to get the least depth of field (for a blurred background), zoom all the way out and use a wide-open aperture (small f/stop number).\nThere are as many ways to make portraits as there are people making them. Be creative!\nHeather Thivierge , December 18, 2004; 10:38 P.M.\nI own a Canon EOS 50mm/1.8, and a Sigma 70-200mm/2.8. The first lense I bought new for ~$75.00.

This is just my personal opinion on the content and execution of the photograph...not on you as a photographer.\nPatrick MacDonald , January 06, 2005; 10:52 A.M.\nIn his wonderful book \"Once\" photographer/author Wim Wenders provides a brillient and gritty perspective on capturing images. Of importance to this thread on portrait photography, Wenders notes, \"Taking pictures is always an act of presumption and rebellion.\"\nI have observed through the years that the formula for a good portrait requires that the \"permission\" of the subject be in equal or greater measure to the \"presumption\" of the photographer. So too, the photographer's rebellios drive to capture an image must be accompanied, again, in equal or greater measure, with respect for the soul within the subject.\nA good portrait, of course, will exhibit good light and composition, but if it is to capture the imagination of anyone not related to the subject, it will exhibit passion and respect.\nImage Attachment: So warm PN.jpg\nOleg Volk , February 09, 2005; 10:43 P.M.\nA good portrait can tell a lot about the subject, not just show the forms.

All good portraits in my opinion need a quality of light that makes them stand out from the page or screen. Often they reveal as much about the photographer as about the subject. I now oscillate between \"lit\" portraits, with flash, reflectors etc. with everything under my control and ones taken more spontaeously using available light, as per the example shown below, which was taken during a pilgrimage to Lourdes several years ago of one of the helpers. There is no \"right\" way to take a portrait as right is different for every viewer, but some people still manage to please a lot of people nearly every time and thats what makes photography so much fun.\nMaxim Rapoport , October 27, 2006; 11:42 A.M.\nAGFA 160\nAGFA PORTRAIT 160 is nowhere mentioned here in the comments and the article.

Now this tutorial and the comments following simply reinforces my belief that photography is just like life...eveyone is entitled to their own opinions. I cant often come here, read some directions and go out and produce magnificent portraits. I think a lot of my successful photos have been driven from feeling and instinct. And the more I practice the better I get. I just last week bought a Nikon D80, and am happy with it. But I took just as good pictures with an ancient Pentax K1000 and then a Minolta Maxxum 5. There are many digitally enhanced photos that take my breath away on photo.net. Sometimes I wish I knew how to acheive certain effects with my photographs. But there is nothing I like better than a portrait, virtually unaltered, that captures a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" in the eyes. You can practically see the subject's spirit dancing in the frame, like the one picture tells their whole life story. Perhaps I am naive, inexperienced, and old-fashioned. But I like to play with my subjects and camera. Once it becomes all simply about technicalities...all the fun disappears.

I make this comment without any reference to camera equipment. I firmly believe that the photographer and his/her subject together create art or the moment. Whether using a point and shoot camera or top of the line professional equipment, capturing someone's essense or personality is a true art. The challenge for me beyond composition and light is my own struggle with guilt for capturing that person's spirit. I am able to overcome this guilt by sharing my pictures with my subjects, and watching them see themselves through someone elses eyes. The picture below is one that I shot by sneaking into my neice's room the day of her baptism. I had to use natural light because I didn't want a flash to disturb her and that required me to shoot at 1/60 shutter speed. I did not have a tripod handy so I hand held my Yashica D TLR directly over her crib, and took the shot. Simple, correct? :-)\nMark Monteverdi , February 21, 2007; 07:57 A.M.\nLife and love\nTook this of my brother a few seconds after his first born was handed to him.

I think Photographers like to talk about their equipment, because our cameras and such are our toys! As for other artists, I have had a lot of conversations with painters about paint and brushes and canvas and such. I also think having good equipment can be very useful. However, I have seen amazing photos taken with very simple cameras (I took a couple of great sunrise photos on a Canon Powershot P&S) and I have seen some terrible photos taken on high end pro equip. It really does all come down to the talent and eye of the photographer, but good equipment + a talented photographer = amazing photos! So dont be angry when we want to talk about our toys... we are all just kids at heart! again, very good article and comments!!\nClaire Dominic , March 03, 2007; 05:39 A.M.\nAs usual I come back to learn via Photo.net. I always find the experience rewarding, & to read other peoples views on what is right for them ,is facinating. I studied photography years ago & left it alone for years. On revisiting I find I owe alot to instinct. I agree with Debbie. You can know all the facts & specs but still take a terrible shot. But if you have the eye & use your instinct to tune into your sitter , you can get a fantastic shot, & capture the moment with the simplest equipment.

I took lot of potraits, but my concentration was not in the techniques or lights or equipment, I always see the composition, balance and frame of the subject and expression of the Model/Person. Although I heard that Nikkor 80-200mm f2.8 is a good lens, so I'm planning to buy it. I like the blurred background and sharp features of the Model. In this portrait, the girl was working in frontbend position with some stuff. I was standing behind her. I already decided how to take the potrait of her.

Before reading the caption, I thought that what I now know was the reflector edge was a stair bannister or something.\nIn my opinion, this so-called \"flaw\" actually balances the composition in that parallels and offsets the woman's left arm. Without this corner element, the picture becomes unsettlingly unbalanced.

It's a lot more of capturing a particular mood (something the article alluded to.) You can have a wonderfully boring technically correct portrait beat out by a moody technically incorrect picture.\nIt's really about three things, lighting, shallow DOF, and most importantly, expression and pose. Sadly, the last one is very hit and miss unless you are working with a professional model. It is also the most important one.\nPush the extremes, don't do smily portraits in the sun.

Like I tell my son (very type \"A\" personality), photography is not \"black and white\" (I know - sounds like a bad pun; which works; but it got my point across. Photography is more abstract and there are all kinds of methods, not just one. I like to experiment and break some rules for fun). He is an aspiring photographer at 8 years old, but thinks there is one way to take a photo.\nI have alot to learn on portraits - I shied away from it for a long time because I really don't like a posed portrait rather a candid one for a more natural expression. I am starting to take some now. I haven't got to a point of photographing strangers asking for their permission though I would like to as different people can be very expressive with their faces and life experience effect on their faces. I am just too chicken to ask (and a bit introverted for it - I can make a joke to a person that is a vendor/serviceperson and talk to them, but that is because there is something in common).\nDennis\nLes Jones , October 10, 2007; 08:33 P.M.\nThe info on equipment is valuable and I appreciate the thoughts, tests, photos and options available.

The quality of image, I believe, depends upon the bit depth of the image that comes from a camera in-put that supports more than 8 bits (1 byte) in single channel and more than 24 bits (3 bytes) in three channels of RGB. \u00a0 Even if we calculate 256 shade of different colours in three channels, it equals (256x256x256=16 777216 ) or say 16.77 million colours as normally we hear. \u00a0Things are not staying here and are ascending beyond. \u00a0This is only practicable in digital photography alone. \u00a0 Now it is the prime time that we should understand and learn the mechanism and technicalities of digital world of photography that leads this art in future. \u00a0 I believe that the forum may focus on the new ways and step forward.\nI added two images of film taken with a very famous Rollie and common digital Canon just to show the contrast/difference in between the most high class film camera of the time and a common digital camera. \u00a0 Hope it may make a sense. \u00a0Any one who may like to discuss the topic can write to me\nStefano Crivellari , November 23, 2007; 06:50 A.M.\nLobo & Marina (Brazil)\nHere my portrait example\nMichelle Maor , November 27, 2007; 05:58 P.M.\nI think that the most important aspect of portrait photography is how well the photo can represent the person. whether it is a candid or a posed shot, I think that if the photo can make you feel something when you look at it, then the photographer has done his or her job right. I think that is what differentiates a good photographer from a non-photographer. This is especially important in portraits. For me it starts with understanding my equipment, then using the right equipment and then following up in Photoshop and using what ever it takes to really capture the person. I hope that I have been able to evoke emotions when people see my photos.

Dennis\nSteven Easton\n, December 30, 2007; 09:52 P.M.\nThe interesting thing that I find about portrait photography is that there are two types of subjects - those that are comfortable posing (meaning you get a pretty good shot most of the time) and those that are inhibited by a camera pointing at them (meaning you have to work for a good shot). I find the best way to take great shots is to spend a lot of time with the person just hanging out and snaping shots when they aren't expecting it. Sometime's it's good if they bring a friend to make them comfortable.\nAs for what makes a good shot - I'm a \"natural setting\" freak. I ask my subjects what they enjoy doing, and tag along capturing them involved in their favourite activities. This takes some of the feeling that they are being stalked by the paparazzi out of the equation. I become secondary which is perfect.\nHow I capture a shot - I check the lighting, adjust the shutter and aperture and get to work. I like close-ps because that makes the shot more personal. I also like action, so I might eliminate them altogether just to capture a moment of action they are involved in. I find this helpful at sporting venues.\nIn the end, I crop, adjust, and revise colour in Photshop. I know there will be purists out there that think this is not how it should be done, but I can tell you, the darkroom has adjustment secrets. Also, I consider this an artform. An artist is entitled to take liberties with his/her work. The end result is always, \"is the client happy.\" Some of my work I do for me and some for them, always depending on who's footing the tab.\nNice comments, keep up the good feedback.\nSteve\nLuca Sichel Turco , January 05, 2008; 10:38 A.M.\nHi, I am an interested reader, at this time I am not taking picture (yet), but I like to look at them a lot and portraits are my favourite.\nI would like to make a general comment here. I like to distinguish between portraits where the camera 'engages' the subject and portraits where that does not happen. Not a good/bad dicothomy, to be clear.. but just a very different feel.\nI would like to point the attention to a couple of examples of the two approaches all taken from this thread.\nThe camera engages the subject:\nhttp://photo.net/learn/portraits/alan-ginsberg-by-elsa-dorfman.jpg http://philip.greenspun.com/images/200606-california-helicopter-trip/picnic-at-ankas-19.tcl http://photo.net/photo/pcd2898/harry-and-katerina-wedding-81\nThe camera does not engage the subject\nhttp://img-2003-09.photosight.ru/21/304336.jpg http://photo.net/general-comments/image-attachment?comment_id=5547288 http://photo.net/general-comments/image-attachment?comment_id=5678900\nI did not pick those pictures because I like them. For one the picture by Elsa Dorfman in the original article does not appeal to me.\nI would like to point at the differences between those portraits. The distinction is not between having the subject looking into the camera or not (although I think the second picture shows how powerful can a confident and relaxed stare straight at the photographer be).\nThe distintion has more to do with the question if the subjects 'respond' to the camera (photo 3, the groom does not look into the camera but he's definetely responding to it!).\nThe other three pictures are example of 'non engagement' (although the last one is not clearly so..)\nNow my own personal view: I think that a good portrait that engages the subject has more power, more intensity, more interest then one that does away with that relationship between potographer and subgject.\nThis is not always true (I think the last picture, by Stefano Crivellari, was an outstanding example, while I mentioned my lack of enthusiasm at Elsa Dorfman's portrait).\nBut when I think of portraits I usually tend to think at engaging, powerful pictures.\nOne for all: the very famous portrait of the Afghan refugee girl with the green eyes that was the cover of National Geographic (the subject was Sharbat Gula, pictured by Steve McCurry).\nIt is true that quite a few subjects in front of a camera get tense and 'posy' as a friend of mine like to say. So all the tricks that can be used to make them relaxed and look more natural are in need.\nBut I love the description in the article of the way Elsa Dorfman works. She spends time with the people she is going to portrait, and then she takes 2 pcitures, two!\nI like to think that she engages the 'models' personally, from a human point of view, so that the camera is not an obstacle any more. And that magic is very much needed in order to make powerful portraits.\nIf I am off topic I am sorry and please ignore this message; but I would very much like to see more discussion on the way we feel about photoraphs, or better on what we would like good pictures to tell us and how.\nLuca Sichel Turco , January 05, 2008; 10:58 A.M.\nAdding the links to the pictures mentioned above for ease of use:\nThe camera engages the subject:\n"}, {"score": 1031.8816, "uuid": "1b96c42b-c6a7-59ce-b0ed-d23ff08ab54a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0909wb-00-28431", "target_hostname": "www.cameras.net.au", "target_uri": "http://www.cameras.net.au/", "page_rank": 4.5017132e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "European <em>Camera</em> Specialists Sydney best price <em>Nikon</em> D800 D4 D3x D3s D7000", "snippet": "Designed <em>for</em> AF-S and AF-<em>I</em> Nikkor Lenses.", "explanation": null, "document": "Nikon AF lenses for digital and film SLRs\n14-24mm f/2.8G\nAF-S ED Nikkor\nNEW AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED - Ideal lens for both photojournalism and general photographic needs.

This article is not a review of the GR Digital camera but rather it\u2019s a discussion about a camera design philosophy and how that philosophy helps photographers (myself included) separate the technology from the actual process of making photographs (admittedly a technological process unto itself). For this article, I\u2019ll reference the GR Digital III, which I own and will refer to as the GRD, and I\u2019ll discuss specifically how I\u2019ve set-up the camera (basically I will share my GRD soup recipe) and how I actually use it in various photographic contexts in the field. NOTE: All photos that appear in this article (with the exception of product photos) were made with a Ricoh GRD III and edited using Adobe Lightroom. Black and white conversion was accomplished using Nik Silver Efex Pro v1.x. The photos are from various documentary projects that I have worked on over the past three years. For more information (and photos) visit my web site at http://www.paulgiguere.com\nThe GRD camera has an almost cult following among many photographers around the world but sales in the U.S. and Europe have never been strong, Ricoh has never aggressively marketed the camera outside of Japan nor has Ricoh ever tried to go head-to-head with compact cameras from the likes of Panasonic, Canon, Nikon, Sony, or Olympus. The GRD is prized for it\u2019s compact size, ergonomics, lens quality, customizability, and a photo quality that sometimes is reminiscent of film (particularly with black and white photos). By ignoring the big camera-makers, Ricoh is able to set it\u2019s own agenda rather than be ruled by the agenda of others. This approach will never move Ricoh into the top echelons of camera manufacturers but from what I\u2019ve seen, Ricoh is quite content targeting photographic enthusiasts who understand and appreciate Ricoh design philosophy.\nThe cult-like status of the camera has also been fueled by the adoption of the GR (film), and later the GRD cameras, by photographers like Daido Moriyama (the modern-day patron saint of street photographers who appreciate the rough, blurred, high contrast look that Moriyama is so well known for). Ironically, and just for the record, Moriyama probably couldn\u2019t care less what camera he is using as long as it meets his needs (in other words it is simple and quick to operate) and is compact enough for street photography (easily carried and doesn\u2019t draw attention to the photographer). There is a lot of wisdom in that \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d philosophy. In order to get a better handle on the GRD though, it helps to look at the history of the successful and popular GR line going back to the mid-1990\u2019s when Ricoh released a compact film camera called the GR1.\nHistory\nA basic 35mm film camera, the GR1 featured aperture priority control, exposure compensation and a fixed f2.8 28mm focal-length lens. It also had a self-timer, built-in flash, and a basic viewfinder. Subsequent versions of the camera added a date function (GR1 Date), an illuminated display (GR1s), and the ability to change ISO and exposure bracketing (GR1v), among other miscellaneous features from model to model. A final version of the film-based camera was made with a 21mm focal length lens (GR21). The GR camera line from the beginning was well made and solid (featuring a magnesium alloy body), comfortable to hold and use, was simple to operate, and took great photos. It was embraced by photographers in Japan and by anyone outside of Japan who was able to obtain the camera. Today the GR film cameras sells for upwards of $500 for cameras in excellent condition with the box and related accessories. What really set the GR apart though was a feature that would come to define the GR line as a camera for street photographers, Snap Focus.\nThe Snap Focus setting on the GR film cameras is actually quite simple. Set the focus to \u201csnap\u201d and the camera is pre-focused to two meters. What this meant was that you no longer had to wait for the camera to achieve focus when you pushed half-way down on the shutter release. You just pressed all the way down and, as long as you were within two meters of your subject, the subject would be in focus. This simple, elegant method was how many street photographers already focused their cameras, that is, they zone focused the lens to a particular distance using the distance setting on the lens so that all subjects at a certain distance would be in focus. This is a bit different, and less complex, than hyperfocal focusing where you can obtain a maximum DOF based on the f-stop you have your camera set to to achieve a range of focus. The Ricoh GR camera took the complexity out of all of this by allowing you to simply set the camera to snap mode and make the photo without waiting for the auto-focus system to catch up. I\u2019m sure this capability was probably not unique to Ricoh cameras but Ricoh seized on this functionality and promoted it and buyers responded.\nIn 2005 Ricoh released a digital version of the GR film camera called simply the GR Digital (also known today as the GRD I). The camera was virtually identical physically to it\u2019s film-based counterparts with the exception that the lens housing was a bit larger, the camera had a maximum aperture of f2.4 (versus f2.8 on the film-based cameras) and an LCD screen (no built-in viewfinder but one could be attached to the hot shoe) and additional controls on the back for managing other functions specific to a digital camera. The original GRD also used an 8 megapixel sensor. The GRD I was followed in 2007 by the GRD II (sporting an upgraded 10 megapixel sensor along with various updates and upgrades), and then by the GRD III in 2009 (with, among several additional improvements, an f1.9 lens). Ricoh is also well known as a company that is continuously working to improve and add to the features of their cameras after product launch. It is typical that Ricoh will release several firmware upgrades between product updates. Sometimes these updates will fix issues or problems but usually it is to add new features (something that more camera makers should consider). True to it\u2019s two-year cycle established in 2005, Ricoh\u2019s announcement of the GRD IV in 2011 follows in the same tradition and footsteps as the cameras that came before it.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the Ricoh GXR camera system, while it shares several traits with the GRD line of cameras (namely a similarly designed but larger body and a similar user interface), is really a different camera in that it utilizes interchangeable lens/sensor modules that range from small sensor zoom modules to fixed focal length, medium sensor modules (28mm and 50mm equivalent currently) as well as a medium sensor module that accepts M-type lens such as those used on Leica M film and digital cameras as well as Zeiss Ikon and Voigtlander Bessa film cameras (to name a few). The bottom-line is that the GXR is a different system and not really a part of the philosophy that Ricoh is pushing for the GRD line.\nImpressions\nThe first thing you notice when holding a GRD camera is that it is small (small enough to fit into a shirt pocket or jacket pocket) but not the smallest in it\u2019s class. It is also surprisingly heavy (you might want to re-think putting it in your shirt pocket). The camera fits well in small to medium-sized hands. Those with larger hands might find the camera a bit smallish but these folks would have the same problem with just about any other compact camera of a similar size. The rubberized grip gives you something to hold on to. When handling the camera, I find my right thumb fits comfortably on the back of the camera with my other fingers wrapped around the front where there is a hump/perch. The camera simply feels good to hold and it is easy to use the camera one-handed when necessary.\nButton and dial layout is well thought out with essential buttons located exactly where they should be. The top dial on the camera allows you to easily set the camera mode from fully automatic, manual, program mode, aperture or shutter priority or to one of three saved camera set-ups (aka My Settings). A particularly nice feature of the top dial is a locking function where you have to hold down a small button next to the dial before you can rotate it. Some people hate this feature because they feel it slows them down a bit when changing aperture (for example) however I love this feature. I always know that if I had the aperture set to aperture priority when I put the camera in my bag, it will be set to aperture priority when I take it out (the dial can\u2019t be accidently rotated when putting the camera into and out of a bag, pants pocket, purse, etc.).\nThere are four additional dials, one on the front of the camera just in front of the shutter release button, and two adjustment rocker dials on the back along with a toggle wheel. For the most part, the buttons and dials can be customized so that their functions and behavior closely match how you like to work. The two Fn buttons on the back in particular can be customized to directly access almost any function that the camera is capable of. Also, the behavior of the adjustment dials can be changed as well (more on my custom settings later).\nThe three-inch LCD display is crisp and clear (920,000 pixels) however the finish has been known to wear over time (particularly if you don\u2019t baby the camera which I don\u2019t). This can happen due to the wiping off of finger prints, slipping the camera into pants pockets, etc. I\u2019m not saying it is a real problem for most people but something to be aware of. When I first bought the GRD3 I knew this would be an issue for me so I bought an LCD protector cover and attached it immediately upon removing the plastic film from the LCD that is a part of the protective packaging from the manufacturer. I highly recommend the AC-MAXX LCD protector ( ACMAXX LCD Protector - Ricoh GR Digital III ). AC-MAXX also makes a protector for the front lens housing (which will protect the lens from fingerprints and scratches) which doesn\u2019t interfere with the lens retracting into the body when powered off however I prefer not to have anything on the lens. Both of these protectors can easily be removed and reapplied as needed.\nAnother possible issue with the LCD is that it can be difficult to see in bright light (particularly in bright sunlight). This may have been mitigated with the new GRD IV (which sports a new LCD screen) but with the GRD III some people prefer to use an optical viewfinder on the hot shoe (Ricoh makes two of them but any viewfinder suitable for 28mm focal length lens should work just fine). A nice feature when using an optical viewfinder is a small green light that you can just see when peering through the viewfinder that alerts you that you have achieved focus (when using AF). As with many functions, this can be turned off and you can also activate a setting that lets the camera know you are using a viewfinder (thus shutting off various LCD display functions as appropriate). You can even set the green power light that is recessed into the power button to \u201coff\u201d so that it doesn\u2019t become a distraction when making photos in dim light. The thinking that went into these little details collectively make the camera a joy to use.\nThe camera comes with a wrist strap, which I prefer to use (an optional neck strap is available but pricey), and a battery and charger (in addition to a printed manual, which isn\u2019t bad, and other paraphernalia which I typically ignore). In addition to a memory card or two, a spare battery is also useful to have. Regarding the charger, it simply plugs directly into an outlet (no intermediary cord needed). I really like this as it is less to pack when traveling and one less thing to lose.\nI don\u2019t think there is any one perfect carry bag/case for the GRD. It really is a matter of taste and personal preference. For the record, I like a small camera bag with a shoulder strap for carrying the camera (and spare battery and cards) around but when I\u2019m actually making photos or just walking around prepared to make photos, I keep the camera out and use the wrist strap. My favorite bag for the GRD is the LowePro Apex 60 AW ( Lowepro - Apex 60 AW ) but your mileage will vary in this regard.\nThe Soup Recipe\nI think it might be useful to discuss the kind of photographs I tend to make as it will help explain the various settings that I use on the GRD (my soup recipe so to speak). First, I\u2019m primarily a black and white photographer. I can appreciate color photography just fine however I have trouble deciding how to produce color photographs (much less print them). Yes, I know there are ways to automate a lot of this but I just can\u2019t decide what looks good and it\u2019s complicated by the fact that there are so many ways to treat color. Also, I find that color sometimes competes with the intended subject of the image (the color becomes the subject). Sometimes this is intentional but most times it is not. Black and white just works best for helping me communicate my vision photographically.\nMuch of the work I do is of a social documentary nature. I will also just make photos of things I find interesting just because I can but I\u2019m talking here about how I usually use the camera in the field. This means I typically make photos of people (both indoors and out) and sometimes of social landscapes (landscapes that are products of human intervention). The deep depth of field inherent in a camera with a small sensor like the GRD is perfect for this kind of photography as I\u2019m usually trying to capture detail from the foreground to the background. Out-of-focus details, or blur, or bokeh, are not that important to me for this kind of photography. This is not to say you can\u2019t achieve out-of-focus details (backgrounds for example with the foreground subject in focus) it just requires careful placement of the camera and careful focusing.\nRegarding camera settings, I\u2019ve put together a table below that outlines the major settings (at least the ones that really matter to me) that I have set across the three menus (remember this is for the GRD3 with version 2.30 of the firmware and the menus may be different with subsequent firmware versions and/or the GRD IV ):\nShooting Menu\n"}, {"score": 834.782, "uuid": "03dd62eb-309b-54c3-ab62-5557dfb946ad", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0911wb-49-20620", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/the-nikon-dx-fx-formats-pro-et-contra", "page_rank": 1.1953006e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "The <em>Nikon</em> DX &amp; FX formats: Pro et contra | Pixiq", "snippet": "It is <em>for</em> this reason that many wildlife photographers <em>prefer</em> the DX-format <em>cameras</em>, particularly <em>for</em> certain subjects, such as small birds, especially if they expect to have to crop their images at <em>a</em> later stage.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nThere is more to choosing between the DX and FX formats of Nikon D-SLR cameras than you may have considered at first. Simon Stafford offers a few thoughts on the matter.\nI am often asked questions about the relative merits of the Nikon DX (16 x 24 mm approx.) and FX (24 x 36 mm approx.) formats and how to choose between them. Although those questions may differ in form most distill down to a common denominator that amounts to which format is the best; in my book it is not a simple case of \u201cbest\u201d, as each has its own particular merits, and as with any tool is it a matter of choosing the right one for the job.\nAssuming use of top quality lenses and proper camera technique I would suggest that for most practical purposes spotting any difference between the D700 and D300s, when used at their base ISO levels up to ISO800, or even ISO1600 in some circumstances, when printing to sizes up to Super A3 (13 x 19-inches), becomes a matter of splitting the proverbial hair. In fact I believe the same applies to all the 12Mp Nikon D-SLR cameras (FX and DX formats); essentially what you gain as you ascend the product line-up from the D5000 to the D3s is feature set, build quality, speed of operation and high ISO performance.\nHowever, potential print quality is far from the only consideration you should give to choosing between the two formats, as there are many other aspects that should influence such a decision.\nThe resolution of detail will depend to some extent on the density of pixels on the sensor. When you compare the D3s/D700 with the D300s all three models share approximately the same number of pixels; however, in the case of the D300s DX-format sensor they are packed in to an area that is less than half of the D700 FX-format sensor. Now, assuming all other factors are equal the D300s has, potentially, the upper hand when it comes to recording very fine detail, although this will be dependent on faultless camera technique and pin point focusing accuracy, if any advantage is to be realised. How does this come about? Well, consider what happens when a picture is taken at the same camera-to-subject (focus) distance, using the same focal length on a DX-format (D300/D300s) camera and an FX-format (D700, or D3/D3s) camera; the image of the subject will occupy a greater area of the DX-format sensor compared with the FX-format sensor, due to the different linear dimensions of the two sensor formats, which has a direct effect on the field-of-view characteristics of the lens.\nIn this case the pixel density (call it the input resolution if you prefer) is higher on the DX-format sensor of the D300/D300s than the sensor of the FX-format D700, or D3/D3s: therefore the D300/D300s sensor provides more detail, as it has a greater number of pixels in any area of the subject\u2019s image you care to define, despite all four of these camera models having the same 12MP resolution.\nOf course if all other things are not equal and the subject-to-camera distance is altered (i.e. the same focal length is used but the FX-format camera is positioned closer to the subject), so that the area of the image formed by the subject is the same on each of the two sensor formats then the pixel dimensions of any area within the subject will be the same.\nIn a situation where it is not possible to approach a subject as close as you would wish, the higher pixel density of the DX-format D300/D300s could, potentially, and assuming all other variables are the same, enable these camera models to resolve more detail in the subject compared with the FX-format D3/D3s. It is for this reason that many wildlife photographers prefer the DX-format cameras, particularly for certain subjects, such as small birds, especially if they expect to have to crop their images at a later stage.\nThe depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics of the two formats is less easy to quantify, since DoF is a quality derived from our perception of what is sharp and what is not sharp. In an effort to enumerate DoF, the geometry of image projection by a lens and the viewing conditions under which the 2D image it forms, and will be observed, are considered; however, no DoF model is perfect and thus there is always a highly subjective aspect involved when it comes to the assessment of this image attribute.\nCommon convention holds that on the DX format a lens with the equivalent effective focal length to the FX format, used at an aperture 1-stop larger, will achieve approximately the same DoF coverage as on the FX format. For example, a 200mm lens set at f/2 on a D300s will achieve a similar DoF as a 300mm lens set at f/2.8 on a D700, provided the camera to subject distance is the same in both instances. Of course in this case the angle-of-view produced by the two lenses will also be similar. As to whether this is an advantage, or disadvantage will depend on individual requirements. The FX user will claim better subject isolation when using equivalent aperture values, while the DX user can equally claim the wider aperture required to achieve a similar DoF will mean they can shoot at a proportionally faster shutter speed, since the lens is not stopped down as far. Of course the effect of the pixel density (as discussed above) can, and often does sway opinion as to whether an area within an image falls in to the sharp, or not sharp camp.\nAssociated with the DoF argument is the issue of angle of view and image magnification. Using a 200mm lens on a DX camera and a 300mm lens on an FX camera, with both at the same distance from a subject, will produce pictures with approximately the same angle of view but the degree of subject magnification is greater with the 300mm lens than it is with the 200mm lens. If the 300mm lens is put on the DX camera the degree of subject magnification will then be equal to that on the FX camera; however, the angle of view will be reduced (all that using the smaller DX format does in this instance is crop in closer to the subject). The FX user could achieve the same image by shooting on the 300mm lens and then cropping it to the DX-format dimensions. The penalty of this approach is only the central section of the FX-sensor is used, so the pixel density and image file size will be reduced, which in turn will limit the degree of enlargement that can be applied.\nOne potential advantage of the DX format that is often overlooked comes with lenses designed to cover the FX format; by only using the central portion of the larger image circle projected by such lenses it is rare for the DX-format camera image to exhibit any significant adverse effects due to lens aberrations, such as vignetting (the fall off in the level of illumination at the periphery of the image), linear distortion, or lateral chromatic aberration.\nA benefit of working with the FX format cameras is the far greater choice of short focal length lenses (prime, or zoom). The smaller DX-format sensor requires a proportionally shorter focal length to achieve an equivalent wide angle of view, which pushes at the current limits of optical design and engineering if the lens is to achieve a comparable performance to its FX-format counterpart. Another positive aspect of the FX-format cameras is that they have restored the expansive viewfinder view of professional grade film cameras such as the Nikon F5 and F6, making the use of ultra-wide angle lenses, viewfinder accessories and close-up equipment that much easier, while the smaller viewfinders of the DX-format cameras produce a rather tunnel like effect that are less conducive when focusing manually, or examining detail in a composition.\nBeyond the optical considerations of the FX/DX formats there is the matter of noise and dynamic range, particularly at elevated ISO levels. Larger pixels gather more light, more efficiently \u2013 it\u2019s a fact \u2013 and the current FX cameras have a double micro lens layer makes sure that every last photon of light is recorded by the sensor. This is the reason the normal ISO range of the D700 and D3s extend to ISO6400 and ISO12,800 respectively, while by comparison the DX sensor of the D300s has an upper limit of ISO3200 in its normal ISO range. In general I find above around ISO800 the noise performance of the D700 is about 1EV ahead of the D300s, while that of the D3s is at least 2EV higher. Linked to noise performance when pushing the ISO level ever higher are the side effects on colour saturation, contrast and dynamic range, all of which become progressively reduced; however, the larger pixels on the FX format sensor means the impact of these unwanted side effects are less than they are with the DX format cameras at equivalent ISO levels.\nFinally, there is the matter of AF point coverage. The D3-series, D700, D300 and D300s offer essentially the same 51-point pattern AF system but the area of the frame covered by these AF points is highly centralised in the FX models, while it is much broader on the DX format D300/D300s. To place the subject away from the centre of the frame when using the FX format cameras you will probably find that focusing and recomposing becomes common practice; by comparison auto focusing on a highly off-centre subject is that much easier on the DX format cameras, providing greater flexibility in composition.\nThe list of pros and cons for the DX and FX formats is lengthy, for example, when photographing wildlife, sport, or any subject where it is not always possible to approach it as closely as you would wish, the higher pixel density, broader frame coverage of the AF points, and reduced angle of view can all be considered advantages of the DX format cameras, over and above those of smaller size, reduced weight, and lower cost, when compared to the FX models. Conversely, if high-ISO performance coupled with very rapid firing rates are a specific requirement the FX-format D3s cannot be beaten.\nSo what lies ahead? Well, for the Nikon Corporation to maintain their stated market share aspirations of 35 to 40%, they must continue to develop DX-format products, as they are key to volume sales, which generate the revenue to support their R&D operations and manufacture of the more specialist FX format products. Of course this strategy is nothing new, for example, the diminutive Nikon EM, FG and FG-20 models were the engines that drove general film camera development and allowed production of the professional F3 and F4 cameras during the 1980\u2019s.\nNo doubt arguments will run and run in the FX versus DX debate \u2013 but at the end of the day it comes down to picking the right tool for the job! The two Nikon digital formats are now well established and I am confident there will be plenty of new products in both, for example, the recently announced D3100 and D7000 that have 14MP and 16MP sensors respectively. The continued development of both formats by the Nikon Corporation is a prudent move, since it provides photographers with plenty of solutions, whatever their requirements might be.\nTagged with:\n"}], [{"score": 796.53, "uuid": "868f77e4-755a-5815-a6db-1e7d80937851", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-48-01319", "target_hostname": "www.dpreview.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dpreview.com/previews/nikond800/page3.asp", "page_rank": 1.2977378e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Nikon</em> D800 Hands-on Preview: Digital Photography Review", "snippet": "<em>Nikon</em> has <em>for</em> <em>a</em> long time offered <em>a</em> degree of control <em>over</em> its Auto ISO settings, allowing the user to specify <em>a</em> minimum shutter speed that the <em>camera</em> <em>should</em> aim to maintain by raising the ISO.", "explanation": null, "document": "Photos\nKey Technology\nMuch of the D800's core technology is lifted straight out of the $6000 D4, released earlier this year. Apart from their sensors and continuous capture rates in fact, the two cameras are more alike than they are different. Here's a breakdown of the D800's key technology, adapted in part from our previously published overview of the Nikon D4.\nSensor\nAt the heart of the D800 is a brand new Nikon-developed sensor that boasts 36.8 million pixels in total, with a maximum effective output of 36.3MP. Its ISO span is 100-6400 natively, expandable to a range of 50 ('Lo1') to 25,600 ('Hi2') equivalent. Nikon's highest resolution DSLR to date, the D800 offers a 50% higher pixel count than the flagship D3X. As well as being potentially very attractive to studio and landscape professionals, the D800 should pique the interest of a great many enthusiast Nikon users too - many of whom might have been 'stuck' at 12MP for years, with a D300, D300s or D700.\nThe D800's 36.3MP CMOS sensor has by far the greatest pixel count of any non medium-format DSLR currently on the market. The ISO span is slightly wider than that of its predecessor the D700, at 100-6400, expandable down to ISO 50 and up to ISO 25,600 (equivalent).\nEasily overlooked is the D800's DX format capture mode. This isn't new (all of Nikon's FX format DSLRs have offered an APS-C format crop option) but at an output resolution of 15.4MP in this crop mode the D800 is a considerably more useful camera in DX format than the D700, D3 or D3S. It is also worth noting that the D800's sensor has a similar pixel pitch to the well-regarded 16MP D7000, which has very encouraging implications for image quality in both FX and DX capture modes.\nD800E - 'cancellation' of anti-aliasing filter\nNikon uses slightly curious wording about the D800E - that the anti-aliasing effect of the optical filter stack in front of the sensor is 'cancelled' - and the diagram below shows what this means (courtesy of Nikon). Anti-aliasing filters work by using a birefringent material to split light rays into two based upon the polarization of the light; a first layer splits it horizontally, the second vertically. The practical result is a slight blurring of the image, to avoid moir\u00e9 and aliasing artefacts. In the case of the D800E, the first filter is instead directly counteracted by the second, resulting in no overall blurring.\nWith the D800, light passing through the lens that is transmitted to the image sensor is separated into four segments using a low-pass filter to prevent moir\u00e9 and false colour.\nWith the D800E, the effect of the low-pass filter is removed, and the light is transmitted to the image sensor with no blurring, achieving higher-resolution images.\nThis seems like an odd way of doing things; why not just remove the filter altogether? Our best guess is that it simply makes manufacturing the two models side-by-side easier: instead of having to make an entirely different filter stack for the D800E, Nikon just needs to change the first low-pass filter in the overall assembly. Crucially, this keeps the same infrared blocking and anti-reflective properties across the two cameras.\nAutofocus\nThe D800 has the same new autofocus sensor as the D4 and, while its headline improvement is that it can now focus in lower light (down to -2EV) , this isn't the only step forward. The sensor module has also been redesigned to enable it to operate with slower lenses (and lens/teleconverter combinations that give slower effective apertures). The D800 features six AF Area modes - single point, 9-point, 21-point, 51-point, 51-point '3D' tracking, and Auto Area mode (shown below).\nIn single-point AF mode, the D800 simply focusses where you tell it to - you can set your desired AF point using the rear 4-way controller.\nIn 9-point 'Dynamic Area AF' mode the camera will use the eight AF points surrounding the one you select as 'backup' in case your subject moves.\nIn 21-point Dynamic Area AF mode the surrounding 20 AF points are used...\n...and in 51-point Dynamic Area AF mode, the other 50 will also help out.\nIn 'Auto Area' AF mode, all of the D800's 51 AF points are active, and the camera uses color information from its 91k-dot metering sensor to detect faces.\nWith AF mode set to 'C' for 'continuous', Auto Area AF becomes '3D tracking AF'. In this mode, the D800 uses its 91k-dot metering sensor to identify your subject automatically, and the focussing system tracks it across the AF array (but sadly it doesn't spell out '3D' in the viewfinder in real life...)\nAs before, with lenses of f/5.6 or faster, 15 of its 51 AF points act as cross-type: sensitive to both horizontal and vertical detail. The 9 central focus points will continue as cross type when used with lenses with a maximum aperture of between f/5.6 and f/8. The D800's central AF point will still operate as a cross-type point with lens or lens/converter combinations with a maximum aperture of f/8. In addition, 10 AF points retain horizontal sensitivity at this aperture. In the diagram above, cross-type sensors are indicated in orange.\nF5.6 or brighter\nF8\nAuto ISO Improvements\nNikon has for a long time offered a degree of control over its Auto ISO settings, allowing the user to specify a minimum shutter speed that the camera should aim to maintain by raising the ISO. However shooters using zoom lenses, or worried about camera shake rather than freezing the action, may prefer a minimum shutter speed that relates to the focal length in use, rather than specifying an absolute figure. This has been resolved on the D800 and the D4 with an Auto ISO system that detects the lens' focal length.\nWhen this is activated, the user can then also bias the program towards using slower shutter speeds and lower ISOs, or faster shutter speeds and higher ISOs, in five steps. Something we really like about the new Auto ISO system is that it doesn't have to be set via the D800's main menu system. 'Auto' is one of the main ISO value options accessed via the ISO button on the D800's top plate.\nVideo Mode\nThe parallel advances made in sensor technology and Internet video distribution have helped create the ability to capture and broadcast video footage. In turn this has put pressure on many professional photographers to capture clips alongside their stills. In addition, the broadcast and movie industries have adopted the EOS 5D Mark II to a degree that appears to have surprised even Canon. As a result, it's not surprising that the D800 features a very advanced, and well-integrated video mode, offering almost exactly the same functionality introduced in the D4 including a headphone outlet for monitoring audio and the option to record uncompressed video to an external drive via HDMI.\nLike the D4, the D800 features a headphone port for audio monitoring of video capture during filming. There are 20 adjustment levels for audio recording (plus auto) and monitoring volume can be adjusted in 30 levels.\nUncompressed HD video footage can be sent out of the camera, straight to an external drive via the built-in HDMI port.\nThe D800 can shoot 1080p movies at 30, 25 or 24 frames per second and at up to 24Mbps. Video footage is compressed using the B-frame compression section of the H.264 standard, which tries to optimize the capture of motion without hugely inflating the file sizes. It also has manually configurable volume control, including a line-level audio option. However, what may prove to be the camera's biggest feature from the videographer's point of view is the ability to export its uncompressed video footage via its HDMI port. We suspect that this feature, beyond all others, may help endear the camera to the broadcast and movie crowd. Whether using this for recording the camera's best quality footage or to use an external monitor as viewfinder, it's a feature we expect to become increasingly common.\nMovies can also be shot at two different crops from the sensor, FX and DX. This makes it easy to vary the field-of-view for grabbing footage, even if you\u2019ve got a prime lens mounted. However, the \u2018FX\u2019 size is a significantly cropped version of the full sensor (it\u2019s 91% of the sensor\u2019s width), so the field-of-view will be a little narrower than you\u2019d expect for any given focal length.\nThe D800 also inherits the D4's improved aperture control in movie mode, with the addition of 'Power aperture'. This simply means that the user can adjust the aperture while recording video in the A and M exposure modes. It's also possible to set the aperture much more precisely, in 1/8 stop increments using the Pv and Fn buttons on the front of the camera. With a card in the camera you can only do this prior to commencing video capture, but with uncompressed video sent through the D800's HDMI port you can control aperture during recording, too. In principle this level of control should allow more exact matching of recording brightness across multiple camera / lens combinations.\nUpgraded LCD Monitor\nThe D800's LCD monitor is the same as that used in the D4 and is upgraded compared to the D700's - it's a slightly larger 3.2\" 921000 dot unit, but according to Nikon has a substantially expanded colour gamut that's close to sRGB. It also has a light sensor to detect ambient light levels, and adjust not only the screen brightness, but also the saturation, contrast and gamma as well, in an attempt to give optimized output. The monitor also has a gel resin layer between the LCD and the cover glass to minimise\u00a0any risk of fogging when the camera is exposed to rapid changes of temperature.\nUSB 3.0\nIn a first for digital cameras, the D800 features a USB 3.0 port. USB 3.0 is the second major revision of the USB standard, and offers two-way communication (like FireWire) and a maximum data transmission speed of 5 Gbits per second with lower power consumption than USB 2.0. Although not yet widely adopted, 'Superspeed' USB 3.0 is being included in an increasing number of 'new generation' computers. Until then, the standard is backwards compatible with USB 2.0 (so you could plug the D800 into a USB 2.0 port using the supplied USB cable, and transfer files at the standard USB 2.0 speed).\nShare:\n"}, {"score": 787.07947, "uuid": "69856213-d129-59d6-b10f-fa5afe8468f8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-19-05206", "target_hostname": "reviews.photographyreview.com", "target_uri": "http://reviews.photographyreview.com/fujifilm-x-pro1-first-impressions-video", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Fujifilm X-Pro1 First Impressions &amp; Video | <em>Camera</em> News &amp; Reviews", "snippet": "As <em>for</em> <em>a</em> comparison to <em>a</em> <em>Leica</em>, there is only one <em>camera</em> that \u201cis like\u201d <em>a</em> <em>Leica</em>, and that is of course, another <em>Leica</em>!

The X-Pro1 is one of the most interesting cameras to come out this year ( Fujifilm X-Pro1 intro article ) and this was the first time I\u2019d seen one in person. So I made arrangements to return in the afternoon and make a hands-on first impressions video. You\u2019ll find that video below, along with my own thoughts on the camera after playing with it a bit. I was also able to shoot a few informal sample photos in the store, including a full set on a tripod at all ISO settings. I\u2019ve included those photos in the article, along with my initial impressions of the X-Pro1\u2019s image quality (it\u2019s very good).\nThe first thing we all noticed about the Fujifilm X-Pro1 is how light it is \u2013 especially if you\u2019re used to a digital SLR or you\u2019ve ever handled a Leica rangefinder. We were surprised since it isn\u2019t really a small camera and the body is all metal (magnesium). This is one of those areas where the spec sheet just doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. However, in spite of the light body, the X-Pro1 fights in a heavier weight class. It\u2019s got pretty much all the functionality of a digital SLR along with some Star Wars features that not even digital SLRs have. One of the standout high-tech features is the hybrid viewfinder, which toggles between pure optical with a cool electronic overlay; and pure electronic (EVF), with all the information you\u2019d normally see on the LCD display. The X-Pro1 also features a brand new exclusive 16-megapixel X-Trans sensor that I think is the most important part of the camera. Instead of the traditional red / green / blue pixel array that other digital cameras use, Fujifilm has arranged the sensor in 6\u00d76 pixel grids with the red, green and blue pixel positions randomized. That is supposed to eliminate moir\u00e9 patterns and allows Fujifilm to not use an anti-aliasing filter over the sensor, increasing the amount of light that reaches the sensor and improving image sharpness.\nAnother thing we all liked about the X-Pro1 was the simple, intuitive controls. Just like a traditional manual focus film camera, aperture control is via the aperture ring on the lens and shutter speed is controlled by a dial on top of the camera. There\u2019s also a nicely placed exposure compensation dial on the top plate, right next to the shutter speed dial. Manual shooters should love the X-Pro1 exposure controls \u2013 especially those who started taking pictures back in the olden days, before auto everything.\nPictureline only had two lenses for the X-Pro1, the 18mm f/2.0 and the 60mm f/2.4. The 1.5x crop factor from the APS-C sensor effectively converts the focal length of those lenses to 27mm and 90mm, respectively. I would have preferred the 35mm f/1.4, which shoots like a 50mm lens, for testing. But beggars can\u2019t be choosers. After a bit of fumbling with the aperture ring and shutter speed dials (it\u2019s been a long time since I used a camera with an aperture ring), I took a few test shots in the store. I found I actually preferred the EVF to the optical viewfinder, which surprised me. Electronic viewfinders have come a long way in the past few years and the X-Pro1\u2019s EVF is bright and clear and has all the data I\u2019d normally have to check the LCD for.\nI shot a couple pictures of the Pictureline storefront at ISO 200 and a set of tests shot on a tripod at all ISO settings. Then I cranked the sensitivity up to ISO 800 and 1600 and walked around the store taking pictures. I was really impressed with the results at what I thought were high ISO settings. The photos look totally clean at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 looks great, too. Looking at the informal test photos I shot of the Pictureline filter display (full set of Fujfilm X-Pro1 informal test photos on next page ) , I think the camera is excellent even at ISO 6400 and useable at ISO 12,800. Of course, \u201cuseable,\u201d is subjective. But I\u2019d be really happy to use the X-Pro1 at ISO 12,800 for tradeshow, street, sports or low light event photos. And I think you could do landscape and travel photography without a tripod at ISO 800 and get super clean, detailed images with the X-Pro1. However, it\u2019s still an APS-C sensor and the image quality doesn\u2019t compare to the new Nikon D800 or Canon EOS 5D Mark III. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen so far from an APS-C sensor camera, though.\nBecause it has auto focus, using the X-Pro1 is very different from using a traditional rangefinder camera like the Leica M-series cameras. I really enjoy the Leica M9 but found the X-Pro1 much more intuitive and comfortable to pick up and start shooting with. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) also offers the possibility of zoom lenses, something else that I rely on and that isn\u2019t possible with a traditional rangefinder camera. Between the auto focus, the EVF, the light weight, the potential for zoom lenses and the price (compared to the Leica M9 and mid-range DSLRs), I could see owning an X-Pro1 \u2013 especially as a travel and event camera. And for anyone who\u2019s been lusting after a Leica M9 but just can\u2019t swallow the price (about $8500 for an M9 and lens vs. about $2300 for an X-Pro1 and lens), the X-Pro1 is an excellent alternative. In fact, for most photographers I\u2019d say it\u2019s the better camera. As much as I love the feel, optics and tradition of the M9, it\u2019s just not a practical camera choice for me or most other photographers. The X-Pro1, on the other hand, offers a really nice balance of traditional rangefinder shooting and contemporary digital SLR features and performance.

I took the it with me on several outings in San Francisco, including a concert in Golden Gate Park and a bike ride along the Embarcadero, the city\u2019s waterfront. Bright skies and sunshine reflecting off San Francisco Bay put the M547\u2032s metering and sensor to the test.\nFeatures\nHP Photosmart M547 Back Controls and Lens\nWith 6.2 megapixels, the Photosmart M547 offers enough resolution for good-quality prints and enlargements. Its 2.5-inch color LCD display is suitable for indoor and outdoor viewing.\nThe 3x optical zoom has a range equivalent to a 34-102mm (35mm film camera equivalent) lens \u2013 providing moderate wide-angle to telephoto capabilities. A 6x digital zoom adds extra oomph for those times when getting close is really important, although image quality will suffer.\nThe M547 offers two focus modes: normal, and a macro mode for close-ups like flowers. HP\u2019s Steady Photo electronic image stabilization helps take sharp photos in lower-light situations.\nThe M547 has nine fully automatic exposure modes: Auto, Action, Close Up, Landscape, Night Portrait, Portrait, Steady Photo, Sunset, and Theatre. The lack of manual exposure modes will be a deterrent to more sophisticated camera users, but those who just want to take good pictures in a variety of situations without getting technical will be satisfied here.\nThe camera also has a burst mode for taking multiple photos at a time. This is useful for action shots.\nThe built-in, auto-adjusting flash can be set to auto, on, off or red-eye reduction. The in-camera editing mode also offers red-eye removal, as well as the HP Design Gallery of optional colors and borders for creative fun.\nSharing live action with friends and family is made possible by the 320 x 240, 24 frames-per-second video record mode.\nThe M547 includes 16MB of internal memory and also has an SD card memory slot, ensuring plenty of storage space for all those vacation photos. (Note, however, that the SD card must be purchased separately.)\nThe M547 is powered by two, readily available, AA batteries.\nCamera Menus\nHP Photosmart M547 during capture\nHP Photosmart M547 playback\nHP Photosmart M547 Picture Capture menu with Shooting Mode selected\nHP Photosmart M547 Shooting Mode menu with Close-up selected\nDesign\nMy first impression of the Photosmart M547 was of a small but well-built digital camera. Measuring 3.78 by 1.45 by 2.48 inches, this sleek metal-bodied camera easily fits in a pocket or purse. It won\u2019t weigh you down, either, at only about 5 ounces. In spite of its minimal weight, the overall construction of the M547 feels solid.\nWhen the M547 is turned off, its lens is retracted flush to the body, protected by a built-in lens cap. The lens extends when the camera is turned on. The camera\u2019s few controls are positioned well.\nThe 2.5-inch color LCD on the back of the camera serves as viewfinder and display for image review. The back of the camera also has a delete button; the mode switch for changing between still, movie and playback; and the zoom control, which in playback mode allows magnification of image thumbnails. A four-way selector navigates menus and selects photos during playback, while a \u201cback\u201d button makes it easy to go back a page in menus.\nCamera Experience\nThe HP Photosmart M547 performed well while taking pictures in both bright and low-light situations. It turns on quickly and shutter lag is minimal for a point-and-shoot digital camera. The camera\u2019s Burst mode worked well. I was able to capture approximately two pictures per second for about 10 frames before maxing out the buffer memory. It\u2019s also an efficient camera \u2014 I never exhausted the two AA batteries during my camera review sessions.\nMy biggest gripe is that the 2.5-inch LCD display did not perform very well in bright sunlight. It is a bit reflective, prone to fingerprints and not bright enough for viewing in direct sunlight. However, in lower light situations, the LCD performed fine.\nI would prefer to have some manual control \u2013 at least the ability to select ISO*. I also thought the M547\u2032s in-camera editing features were kind of silly, except perhaps for the red-eye removal. HP\u2019s Steady Photo electronic image stabilization uses faster shutter speeds to help eliminate camera shake and freeze action. In low light it will increase ISO settings and can make images look more noisy or grainy. In testing, the M547\u2032s Steady Photo image stabilization worked very well and helped catch sharp pictures even while intentionally shaking the camera.\nImage Quality\nThe HP Photosmart M547\u2032s image quality is decent for an entry-level digital camera. My outdoor images came out sharp with good overall exposure. Photographs lean toward over saturation, but they look good.\nPhotos I shot in lower-light situations were well exposed and sharp, aided by the M547\u2032s electronic image stabilization. Using the Night Portrait mode and Sunset mode, which are intended for low light conditions, produced the most noise. I also noticed that setting the camera resolution to Medium (4 megapixels) produced images with less noise.\nClick on thumbnails to view sample photos.\nConclusion\nThe HP Photosmart M547 is a small, user-friendly, fully automatic camera that fits in a pocket and feels solid in the hand. HP covered the basics well. It takes good pictures in a variety of lighting situations. Its 6.2 megapixels make it a good choice for those who want to make prints. It delivers on its promise of being a compact, easy-to-use, digital camera. The fully automatic camera lacks manual control, but its nine exposure modes will please people who value a little creative control with their simplicity. Besides \u2013 for $100, who\u2019s complaining?\nWho Should Buy It\nThe HP Photosmart M547 is a good entry-level camera for anyone who wants a small, simple point-and-shoot. This is the perfect camera for kids, teenagers and technophobes who don\u2019t want to think or spend too much.\nHowever, people with poor eyesight may want to look for a camera with a better LCD display. Those seeking manual-exposure options will also want to look elsewhere.\n- end -\n*Editor\u2019s Note: the inability to manually select the ISO also made it difficult to do controlled studio testing. In order to change the ISO settings I had to change the amount of light I used on my test setup. For the highest ISO setting I ended up just turning off the studio lights, which resulted in unpleasant white balance.

Very innovative indeed but is it any good, and more importantly who is going to buy it?\nPosted: 3rd February 2010\nWhen the 50mm lens is attached, the camera looks like a GRD with a large lens on the front.\nePHOTOzine tester, Matt Grayson tests the innovative GXR system from Ricoh.\nThe Ricoh GXR compact boasts a radical design using an interchangeable lens system with the sensor is built-in to the lens instead of the body. Priced at \u00a3750 with the 24-72mm f/2.5-4.4, the GXR is not cheap and you could buy a quality DSLR for the same money so you have to ask, what's the point?\nRicoh GXR: Features\nOnce the lens has been fitted to the body, the GXR resembles the other models in the 'G' range such as the GRD III which we reviewed in August 2009. The obvious benefit of the GXR is if you want a zoom lens, you can have one and like-wise if you want a prime lens. At the moment, any two lenses are offered.\nThe interesting part is that Ricoh have decided to put the sensor on the lens section of the kit instead of in the body. This should mean that the sensor is optimised for the lens it's married to. The 50mm f/2.5 has a 12Mp APS-C CMOS sensor and is aimed at macro photographers, while the general purpose 24-72mm f/2.5-4.4 has a 10Mp 1/1.7in CCD and image stabilisation.\nTop left: The camera is small enough for discreet candid and street photography.\nTop right: The camera accepts SD &\u00a0SDHC\u00a0memory cards.\nLeft: Fitting the lens is easy enough as long as the camera unit is flat against the body.\nAbove: The camera is designed on the GR series of compacts. Under the unassuming exterior is a tough magnesium alloy body, built to last.\nThe idea behind the GXR is that you get the adaptability of a DSLR in a small camera. You could argue that the camera is aimed at candid and street photographers who need high image quality along with discretion. In this context, it is a much, much cheaper option compared with the five grand Leica M9.\nThe mode dial on top of the camera is the same as the GR series of compacts.\nThe large screen can be used or an optional electronic viewfinder.\nMany features from the 'G' series have been brought over to the GXR so current users will be familiar with the work-flow. A command dial on the top plate has the usual auto and PASM modes as well as a scene mode and three, count them, three custom options for setting up a certain type of photography without having to flick through the menus every time the camera is switched on.\nDespite the similarity to a DSLR with the interchangeable lens, the rest of the system has been geared towards compact users which is why you have to use the screen on the back to take pictures. An optional electronic viewfinder is available if you prefer to use one and has an amazing resolution of 920,000dot (307,000px). It's priced a little high at \u00a3220 and doesn't come in a kit at the moment.\nRicoh GXR: Handling\nWith a magnesium alloy skeleton, the GXR is exceptionally well made. It feels really solid in the hands and a lot of work has been put into the two main unique areas of this camera. When slotting the lens onto the body, the lens unit must be perfectly flat and there are a number of grooves and runners to ensure that it can't be put on the body at an angle.\nBecause of the sealed elements, dust is less of a problem as the sensor isn't exposed while changing lenses. The low-pass filter has been redesigned for each sensor for full optimisation.\nAbove: The 50mm camera unit houses an APS-C sensor.\nRight: With the 50mm and EVF fitted, the compact resembles a DSLR.\nAs well as the viewfinder, the screen has a resolution of 920,000dot (307,000px) which is the same resolution as the top DSLRs such as the Nikon D300 and Canon EOS 50D. The GRD III also featured a screen at this resolution. It still seems to over sharpen the images when reviewing them straight after taking them which is pretty misleading.\nRicoh GXR: Performance\nThe camera was put through its paces in a variety of conditions and tests. All pictures were taken in Raw. Raw images were used for the test and were converted in Adobe CameraRaw.\nBecause each lens has a different sensor, each one has been tested, although this isn't a comparison test, so images may not be side by side comparable.\nExposure\nRicoh cameras are an awkward bunch. During a preview of an image you've just taken, it shows an ultra sharp image with lots of contrast in all the right places, but I sometimes think that Ricoh have programmed the camera to show you what you could have won. Even images I took where the focusing was off showed as sharp on the preview only to be disappointed in playback.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm lens\nDirect light is subdued but was still bright and the camera has coped well.\nPlenty of detail in dark areas from the 24-72mm camera unit.\nLit from the side, the shading and contrast is still subtle.\nHarder contrast from the 24-72mm lens but still has a good dynamic range.\nDealing with contrasty side-lighting isn't a problem for the GXR, it handles sunsets and sunrises with ease although in bright daylight I got some burn out on leaves that are glossy, such as Ivy and it's a problem that both the 50mm and 24-72mm lens suffer from.\nIn direct sunlight, both lenses stop down the aperture appropriately, but allow the sky to burn out to a degree in order to keep some detail in the ground and shadow areas. I got faint spots of lens flare but nothing anywhere near what the screen was telling me I was going to get. On the screen, big bands of purple streaked from side to side, but this doesn't record on the picture.\nWith pale or white subjects, the 24-72mm lens burned out highlights even on gloomy days which was unfortunate. Luckily, the 50mm manages to save the day and retains detail even on pure white areas.\nFocusing\nAs I walked along the canal for part of the test, two swans came gliding along the water towards me. I got the camera ready for them to get near enough. One initial problem is the lack of a long zoom lens in this new system, but I expect it'll come in time.\nFocusing is slow and lumbering. A lot of the time, I couldn't catch focus unless I put the camera into macro mode even with the subjects some distance away. With the Swans, they were moving and the camera had to hunt through the entire range before settling on the birds which had passed me by this stage, forcing me to walk after them.\nOn stationary subjects, focusing is sharp enough from both lenses so I have no complaints about that bit but it appears that there are some compact camera traits in the GXR.\nColour reproduction\nIn controlled lighting, the 50mm lens records lovely colours in Raw format and primary blue especially is saturated. Reds come out a little diluted, but not enough to grumble about it. Yellow comes out especially bright too and while I'm ok with how the APS-C sensor in the 50mm unit records browns, they're not perfect.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm\nRicoh GXR & 50mm colour test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm colour test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm blue sky.\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm blue sky\nFlesh tones are great on both cameras although the 24-72mm does seem to warm more than the other. I got a mixture of shots, some sharp, some not.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm\nSkin tones are great with the camera handling contrast gently.\nA slightly darker image than the 50mm camera unit but still exposed well.\nThe 24-72mm lens has a sensor geared more towards the everyday user, which is unusual given the combination of the body and lens costs \u00a3750. Raw files from this unit come out a lot more saturated than the JPEG equivalent which appears pale in comparison. I think this is down to automatic dynamic range compensation because the camera doesn't have a DR option. Reds are deeper in Raw, as are blues and purples.\nNoise\nLooking at the noise results from the 50mm lens and I'm absolutely blown away. Thanks go, in part, to the APS-C sized sensor but the amount of noise that comes in even at ISO3200 outperforms most DSLRs. Out in the real world and there's a distinct amount of image breakdown in low-key areas, but the performance is still exceptional.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm lens\nNo ISO100 on the 50mm unit.\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO100 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO200 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO200 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO400 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO400 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO800 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO800 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO1600 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO1600 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO3200 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO3200 test\nSwitching to the CCD sensor and there's a definite difference in quality. Low settings such as ISO100 are lovely and smooth. Noise starts creeping in even at ISO200 and it looks as though Ricoh have used the same sensor that they use on all the compacts. Mild blotches of coloured noise appear in low-key areas from ISO400 onwards but it's not until ISO1600 that bright blue dots speckle the image all over. However, this only happens in controlled lighting. Out in the open, the blue dots disappear and they're replaced by purple blotches which can only be seen in shadow.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm\nNo ISO100 on the 50mm unit.\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO100 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO200 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO200 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO400 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO400 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO800 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO800 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO1600 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO1600 test\nRicoh GXR & 50mm ISO3200 test\nRicoh GXR & 24-72mm ISO3200 test\nIt just goes to show that a large sensor is the way forward and if these results are anything to go by, Ricoh need to get rid of the tiny CCD and fit the APS-C sensor to the rest of their cameras. It's a nice thought at least, even if it's not a viable one.\nWhite-balance\nWhite-balance isn't the strong point of the Ricoh GX system. On both lenses, the camera can't handle strong light casts such as tungsten and fluorescent although it does quite well with the lighter casts such as daylight, cloud or shade. Interestingly, there's no flash setting which is annoying because that's the most difficult one to set. The way that the GXR sets white-balance is by pressing the Display button on the back of the camera while pointing it at something white.\nRicoh GXR & 50mm\n"}, {"score": 763.1208, "uuid": "28be832f-78de-55ce-84b2-ce2f7d64960c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1907wb-12-05133", "target_hostname": "www.photographytalk.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photographytalk.com/photography-articles/1654-how-to-photograph-flowers-part-one", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "How to <em>Photograph</em> Flowers-Part One", "snippet": "<em>Camera</em> angle \u2014 that is, height \u2014 is usually less important in this type of long shot.

Your artworks are mostly related to wildlife photography, macro and specially birds. Now what scope do you use? Do you use different scopes for different scenarios? If true then what models and brands works for you? How about eyepieces? How often do you change eyepieces for different cases?\nMany scopes are available and work well for digiscoping my personal choice is a Swarovski ST 80HD the high definition glass in this and other scopes is likely to produce the best result with digiscoping. Other scopes from Swarovski, Leica, Zeiss and other manufactures will give good results. Mine is on older Swarovski model but still highly regarded amongst digiscopers. The new Swarovski eyepieces can be used with this older scope, I own and use the new 30x WD (wide angle) Swarovski eyepiece, but often stay faithful to the 20-60x eyepiece which is very good.\nIt also gives flexibility for framing as you can zoom in and out using the eyepiece as well as the camera, though I rarely use it above 20x as the more magnification you use the more light you need or to put it another way the lower you shutter speed will need to be for the correct exposure. You need more light with the 30x so staying at 20x will give you better shutter speeds for freezing movement.\n2- Do you use digital camera for digiscoping or 35mm or both? What models? Are you planning for an upgrade? Please give us your reasons why you've chosen this equipment and not other brands that come close to yours.\nThere is a large range now of digital point and shoot style cameras that are suitable for digiscoping I have used several models mostly Canon and the Nikon Coolpix range, currently I have a Canon Powershott A95 which for me is the benchmark for all other digiscoping cameras. Vignetting (dark corners to the image caused by the eyepiece, a sort of keyhole effect) disappears with the 20-60x eyepiece after just a few clicks on the camera zoom. Its easier to use than many others and has a very useful flip out screen and a built in magnifier. Above all the images are sharp when focused correctly and at ISO50 (another feature not available on many other cameras) there is very little noise. Its also available used for around \u00a3100 now.\nI also own a Nikon Coolpix P5000, which has some nice features over the A95 such as 10 million pixels, a nice big clear screen and vibration reduction (VR) built in. There is something I don't like about the representation of colour in this camera and other Nikon P&S (point and shot) cameras. I always seem to prefer images out of a Canon camera. Having said that this camera has everything most people would want from a digiscoping camera.\nI always have my eyes open for the next suitable camera available but at the moment there is nothing that has tempted me to change either of the two mentioned.\nST80HD scope using tube style adapter\nCanon A95 connected to swarovski\n3- What adapters do you use with your digiscope set? If you are using multiple scopes and digital cameras can you give us the purpose of each and which one works best in what condition for you? Are you planning for an upgrade? If you use multiple scopes/cameras on the field can you explain why you chose one over another in different cases?\nI use a tube style adapter that is made for the eyepiece and has three plastic screws to lock it in place. I only use one screw since then it can be easily removed to use the scope for viewing. Many variations on the theme are available now from companies that specialize in this sort of equipment. I have a couple of step rings that change the thread size from 28mm to 37mm or 52mm this way I can fit it to most digital cameras that have a filter thread.\n4- What is your favorite tripod? Do you use a monopod as well? If yes then let us know in what condition you prefer monopod over tripod? Do you use alternative heads for your pods? If true please let us know why and your brand of choice?\nAll of my supports are made by Manfrotto, i use the fairly basic and freely available 128rc head on a standard tripod similar to the Manfrotto 190v for digiscoping. I also use a sliding plate made by Swarovski to fit on Manfrotto heads.\nThis sites the scope further forward on the head counterbalancing the wait of a camera on the back end and helps to stop the whole setup being off balance, it also has a shallow grove that the scope sits in and stops it twisting around on the tripod, which suits my style of carrying the whole setup around on my shoulder. A monopod but be no good for digiscoping as the magnification involved is to high for this style of support the setup always needs to be kept rock steady, this is essentially when digiscoping. I use a monopod for DSLR telephoto photography and find it invaluable. I have also used a Manfrotto car clamp for digiscoping from my car with some success. In this way it's possible to use the car as I hide and get even closer to your subject.\nthis picture shoes a complete setup mounted on a 128rc Manfrotto head using a Swarovski sliding plate to move the center of gravity of the setup and keep it balenced.\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\nFrom left to right is a Canon Powershott A95 with a standard cable release mounted over the shutter button using a bracket.

Please name the whole equipment and brands.\nLuckily I have come to I point where I have exactly what I want from a digiscoping setup. I have no plans to change my scope, but am always on the lookout for cameras that may have something else to offer. Unfortunately the perfect digiscoping camera doesn't exist as there aren't any specifically designed for the purpose. I honestly think the Canon Powershott A95 is the best digiscoping camera I have use. I produces sharp images to the point that if used correctly you can see detail in the feather barbs of the birds you are photographing.\nStonechat - Digiscoped with canon A95 on Swarovski ST80HD\nGood detail is visible in the feathers here.\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\n6- What is the most difficult situation in digiscoping of birds and wildlife? And how do you over come it? Is there any book you might want to suggest to beginners and pros alike in this field?\nAs with any photography the main factors we battle against are weather conditions. White birds like Egrets and Gulls are very difficult to expose for correctly on a sunny day in harsh sunlight, getting detail rather than blown out white areas of reflection with no detail is difficult. A dull windy day makes it very difficult to get enough light for a fast shutter speed and if the setup is moving around in the wind digiscoping is next to impossible. Its always best to keep everything low down to avoid shake especially in the wind, crouch down and use the tripod without the legs extended, or use the old trick of hanging you kit bag (or anything with a bit of weight to it) from the tripod to keep it rooted to the ground.\nTo my knowledge there is yet to be a book published on digiscoping, but there are plenty of websites with useful information and forums with friendly likeminded members www.birdforum.net is probably the best.\n7- What metering you use most of the time for digiscoping small birds? What about other wildlife scenes? Do you change your metering often or you stay loyal to one metering mode?\nFor digiscoping i generally use the aperture priority mode, and keep the F-number as low as possible typically below F5.6. Depth of field (DOF) is minimal with digiscoping, which makes focusing crucial, and the high magnifications involved mean that freezing the movement of both of the bird and setup in very important. I keep the F-number low and leave the camera to give the highest shutter speed available. There are rarely situations where I feel I need to use any other method.\nHoopoe\nDigiscoped using a Canon A95\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\n8- What is your best offer for a beginner if he wants to gather his/her first set of digiscoping equipment for birds? Please name the whole set. What if he is on a tight budget? And what if he is not on a tight budget? Please advice for both conditions.\nOn a low budget, the Canon A95 is available at around \u00a3100 used; an adapter and mechanical cable release could be another \u00a3100. Look at he Kowa and Opticron range of scopes, there are second hand models around very cheap perhaps just a few hundred pounds, and they produce good results. A basic Manfrotto tripod and head will coast about \u00a3200 but can be picked up second hand and other cheaper makes will do the job, a sturdy tripod is very important though, there is not point spending large sums on equipment if you are going to put it on a cheap wobbly tripod.\nIf money is no object I would still go for Canon A95 but you could look at other well respected and more expensive digiscoping cameras like the Nikon Coolpix 8400 and the nwere P5000 which I have already mentioned. The top end Swarovski, Leica and Zeiss scopes with high definition glass, are around the \u00a31000 mark and will all do a good job, which you use is probably a matter of personal preference. Look at and try before you buy, if you can, ask other digiscopers/birders you see what they are using, and if you can have a look through there scopes, most are happy to help. For a tripod look for something sturdy but also bear in mind that these setups can be heavy especially if carried around for long periods, some new tripods are light and made of carbon fiber, which may just save you some back pain.\n9- What type of accessories are a must to have on the field when you are out for digiscoping? What are those items that one should bring with her in order to take quality photos and not to miss a scene?\nThe essentials are Scope, Camera, Adapter and cable release, if you are serious about digiscoping there is really no point in using a camera hand held to the eyepiece.\nElectronic cable releases are available for some models, I have always got on fine with an old mechanical cable release that simple depresses the button and is mounted on a bracket. There is also less to go wrong. Various other accessories are available for digiscopers, such as monitor shades and magnifiers, and locating sights. Shades and magnifier held you to see the screen and are useful on sunny days and help accurately focus. Personally I have never felt the need for a locating site as I prefer to rely on my hand eye coordination. However sometime birds are very difficult to find in bunches or on the sea where there are no markers.\nNuthatch\nTaken using a Canon 350D DSLR and a Canon 100-400mm from a hide at a feeding station.\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\n10- How often do you use post processing? What software you use and how they help you to improve your artwork?\nPhotoshop is brilliant and may well come with your camera, the elements version has most of what you need. It is often necessary to tweak digiscoped images a little, brightening them up and using a little sharpening is normal.\n11- There are many digital cameras that are suitable for digiscoping but don't have raw output. JPGs don't let you to adjust your photos like it was in capture time, how do you deal with that?\nI have only used one camera for digiscoping that would capture raw files, the Nikon Coolpix 8400 and it was painfully slow at writing them to the card. This feature would be nice in a digiscoping camera and is available on only a few cameras that are digiscoping friendly. Its often useful to take quick burst of JPG images however, rather than one every 2-3 seconds if you are lucky, which was the experience I had with the Nikon 8400. I was missing to many shots and reverted to JPG. Other P&S cameras may now be faster at writing Raw files, I certainly hope so. Of course digiscoping is possible with a DSLR and these cameras certainly will capture and write RAW files very quickly.\n12- Can you give us the major techniques that one should use with the digiscope's digital camera set on the field to able to produce robust images like yours? Those that if one lacks, it'll be hardly possible to produce quality photos.\nTo reduce camera shake three things are a must, in many cases the cause of blurred images when digiscoping is the result of camera shake rather than poor focusing. You must use an adapter to firmly connect the camera to the scope, you must use a cable release to reduce movement and you must use a sturdy tripod.\nHave look at different tripod heads too if you can, because you will often find that you need three hands. One to focus the scope one to hold the handle of the tripod head and follow the bird of compose the shot and another to press the button. I often found that I could hold the shutter release like a trigger under my thumb and move the scope around with the same hand, while focusing the scope with the other, only possible because of the arrangement of the setup. The chances are you will get used to yours and find a way to do something similar. Practice is the key, get out there and take pictures loads of picture. At first you may find only one in hundred are any good. Pretty soon it will be one in ten and so on.\nThe best chance to digiscope warblers is when they are singing, this is about the only time they stay still enough.\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\n13- What do you think has made your photos superb, your proficiency, your talent, or your equipment? Or a combination of all? We believe you are a professional in what you do, let us know more about you. How long you've been in to this, what are your favorite books and photographers and what camera you started with at the very beginning.\nPractice, its as simple as that, I have spent many, many hours in the field looking for subjects, playing with setting and photographing anything that gives you the chance to get close enough to it. I am not a professional but do sell images quite regularly for various uses and publication. I have been interested in nature all my life and photography for much of it. I have plenty of pictures of trees and water with specs you can just about make out as birds from my film SLR days. I got into Digiscoping 7 years ago and DSLR photography quickly afterwards. Certain good equipment helps but excellent pictures can come from the cheapest of cameras, photography is much more about technique and patience both with yourself and your subjects. You won't just wake up one morning with the skills you require it takes time. If you're anything like me you will enjoy the challenge.\nDIGISCOPED WITH CANON A95\nDigiscoping can by used for general wildlife photography as well as birds. I have used a digiscoping setup to photograph many animals from mammals like Deer and Hare to insects like dragonflies\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\nMy first digital camera was a Nikon Coolpix 4500 for digiscoping, though I had played around with a borrowed digital camera (I honestly can't remember what it was) for some time before that. |For digiscoping the first time a saw images from Andy Bright these were the ones that inspired me to explore this area of bird photography, I don't think he does a lot of digiscoping now, these days he is an excellent DSLR photographer. One of the best bird photographers of today to my mind is Nigel Blake his owl photography is just stunning and involves time, skill and a knowledge of your subject that he has perfected. For general wildlife photographers how could you not think of Andy Rouse, just do and Internet search or buy any of his books I have found his case studies particularly useful.\n14. Do you use both DSLR and digiscoping on the field? How about using a DSLR camera with a digiscoping?\nI do use both DSLR and digiscoping for bird and wildlife photography though rarely together, there is only so much kit I can carry around at one time.\nDigiscoping with a DSLR is possible though my experience is that you need far more light than with the usual P&S style cameras, this can be overcome to an extent by using higher ISO settings and noise levels at higher ISO's are getting lower with every new camera. Results can be good but for me it took a lot more effort than with the usual methods and cameras. For now at least I will be sticking with my P&S style cameras for digiscoping. There are some interesting developments happening in this area though with high magnification digiscoped flight shots becoming achievable.\nStarling\nDigiscoped using a Nikon Coolpix P5000\nCopyright \u00a9 Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk\n15. In Which situations you would use which set-up for wildlife and bird photography; digiscoping or DSLR?\nDigiscoping is a high power form of photography, which I think is best used in a casual manner.\nI would take out the digiscoping setup and walk around a nature reserve taking advantage of whatever subjects are available, you don't need to get as close so you don't need to worry so much about field craft and being conspicuous to your subjects. You can often get close enough for a good image and still be at a distance where they are comfortable to continue feeding singing or whatever. I think DSLR photography takes more planning. I may set up a hide or attempt to go for a specific picture or subject.\nI have taken a lot of Macro images over the last couple of years, some thing that many of the digiscoping cameras can manage quite well, the Coolpix 4500 if a well-respected camera in this respect. But a DSLR and a good macro lens can transport you into a new world you'll discover on your hands and knees.\n16. They say digiscoping is a weak practice when flight photography and avian subjects comes into account, how do you overcome this issue and what are your suggestions?\nDigiscoping birds in flight with the digiscoping gear I have is near impossible, there are a few chances of course like a hovering kestrel which may stay still long enough for a shot, and those that are experimenting with DSLR digiscoping are managing flight shot as well. Really however this is the domain of the DSLR and a telephoto lens. Flight photography is not something I have done a lot of, but is a challenge I am looking forward to getting my teeth into. That's what I love about this hobby, there is always a new avenue to explore, and always something to photograph, be it in your garden at a local nature reserve or abroad.\nUser reviews\nThere are no user reviews for this listing.\nAdd new review\n"}, {"score": 754.69653, "uuid": "f9ee69a3-4a5e-5aeb-8136-f7e6ae41ae48", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0911wb-14-05757", "target_hostname": "www.43rumors.com", "target_uri": "http://www.43rumors.com/ft5-panasonic-will-release-an-advanced-gf-camera-and-a-new-gh-successor/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "And <em>a</em>", "snippet": "Then the Panasonic&#x2F;<em>Leica</em> Macro 4&#x2F;3 medium format <em>for</em> spring 2012.

I got myself pretty excited about reviewing this offering from the Monacelli Press that showcases several of his series of work: cityscapes, family portraits, images of science and technology, museum photos, and nature pictures. There are also some essays examining Struth\u2019s work. This is one hefty book. Does it live up to its weight?\nI have a soft-spot for cityscapes and architectural photography. Why? I don\u2019t know why. Why do I prefer lemon ice cream to vanilla and why don\u2019t I like chocolate at all? But Struth\u2019s cityscapes left me cold. What was I looking at? What was he trying to convey with his perfectly centred images of tower blocks? I\u2019m really not sure. Nothing in these pictures, to me, conveyed the sense of place, the interaction of the people who live and work there, any feeling of vibrancy. They were just images of tower blocks. (Albeit one of them is in Pyongyang, which I thought was impressive.)\nThese empty and cold cityscapes did form an interesting juxtaposition with his images of museums and places of worship. These photos are full, busy. They depict school groups looking bored in the Louvre and people eating their lunch on the steps outside the Duomo in Milan. It\u2019s not how you expect to see these places photographed, and that in itself is thought-provoking.\nThe images of science and technology are interesting, but they are not exactly anything that I\u2019d be rushing to hang on my wall. In some instances they make good documentations of places or things, but that isn\u2019t what I expect from fine art photography. It just a bit too, well, mundane, for me.\nStruth\u2019s famed for his family portraits and I was hoping that they would elevate my enjoyment of the book. Supposedly, he uses them to explore underlying social dynamics. Maybe I was missing something, but they looked pretty much like family portraits to my eye. I couldn\u2019t detect whatever statement it was that Struth was trying to make.\nSo did the essays clarify anything for me? I thought that I was going to drown in the gushing hyperbole that one of them was spewing forth like an over-active geyser. They somehow managed to leave me feeling somehow inferior for not appreciating Struth\u2019s work. That probably wasn\u2019t the aim, but it was the outcome.\nAs a book, it\u2019s a beautiful presentation of Struth\u2019s work. If you like his photography, you\u2019ll relish it. But what if Struth\u2019s photography doesn\u2019t set your heart racing and you struggle to connect with it? It\u2019s one of those books that you\u2019ll feel that you ought to like, but just can\u2019t bring yourself to.

It\u2019s almost impossible to get away from cameras nowadays, yet most of us use them with the bare minimum of knowledge required to snap the nearest tweet-worthy scene. That\u2019s not because we don\u2019t care about truly pretty pictures \u2014 even casual observers know the difference between good and bad photography \u2014 but have you tried to make an educated choice between cameras lately?\nSpec sheets are laden with alien terminology like ISO and F numbers, and once you manage to get a grasp of what those mean, you\u2019re still confronted with a spectacular variety of options. To help you navigate your way through this quagmire of excess information, we've put together this guide. It'll enlighten you about which specs are important when, and what cameras are suitable for whom. Sound good? Then read on!\nA guide to this guide\nAs with our smartphone buyer\u2019s guide , you should be careful not to treat this as a definitive dictum on what to buy. What we\u2019re seeking to do here is help you make an informed decision by separating the meaningful data from the meaningless. This is a guide to discerning the things that will make a recognizable difference in your photographic experience and results. We\u2019ve selected a few of our favorite cameras in the categories below, but those will change over time, whereas the rest of this advice will (hopefully) remain relevant for a long time to come.\nBasics of photography\nEvery camera, from the tiny webcam embedded in your laptop\u2019s display to the full-frame pro cameras built by Nikon and Canon, operates along the same set of basic principles. You can discern those from the very name of photography, whose roots are the Greek photos, meaning light, and graph, meaning to draw or record \u2014 ergo, a photograph is in its essence a map of light. When you take a picture of your favorite cityscape, you're not actually documenting the streets, or the skyscrapers, or the milling crowds \u2014 you're drawing up a recording of the light reflected off them.\nThe most common technique for achieving this recording is by channelling light through a lens onto a photosensitive material that soaks it up and turns it into an image. That light-absorbing canvas was once film, which has since given way to electronic sensors in modern digital shooters. In either case, initiating the light capture is done by opening a shutter in front of the photosensitive surface. By adjusting how long that shutter stays open (shutter speed), the sensitivity of the digital sensor (ISO), and how much light passes through the lens (aperture), you get the majority of your control over an image.\nLight is your ally, darkness your foe\nSince light is the only information your photograph collects, it should come as no surprise that well-lit scenes typically come out looking sharper and nicer than dark and moody shots illuminated only by a streetlight. The former just gives you more information to work with. When shooting in the dark, the camera must work either harder (with higher ISO that can lead to unsightly graininess) or longer (with a slower shutter speed that can cause motion blur) to properly recreate the image in front of it. That's where the invention of the flash comes in, providing a strobe of white light synchronized with the opening of your shutter, though it comes with tradeoffs of its own. The strength of the flash can oftentimes wash out fine detail in nearby subjects or lead to the infamous red-eye effect. Tripods are also invaluable in counteracting blurring caused by the photographer's hand, but they can do nothing about motion within your composition and are not exactly portable.\nUltimately, the number one lesson in photography is that there are always tradeoffs. If you want the best possible image quality, you'll need specialized and bulky equipment. Should portability be your highest priority, you'll simply have to accept that some photos and creative ideas will be beyond your reach.\nThere are a number of other considerations to take into account when composing an image \u2014 and, consequently, choosing the best camera for the job \u2014 which we\u2019ve detailed below. Once you\u2019ve wrapped your head around what they will mean for your intended photography adventure, you should have a good idea of the kind of camera that will best suit your needs.\nAs Bruce Dickinson might say, I've gotta have more light!\nFor some help calculating the depth of field for your chosen camera, aperture setting, and focusing distance, you can use Simple DoF on iOS or DoF Calculator for Android.\nThe key settings\nIf you\u2019re new to digital photography, the three things you should acquaint yourself with first are the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. The three work in concert, and if you can manipulate and control them all, you\u2019ll take fabulous photos without even touching the rest of your camera. Together, they\u2019re known as the Exposure Triangle, because they control how much light you\u2019re exposing the camera to (aperture), how sensitive the camera is to that light (ISO), and how long your exposure lasts (shutter speed).\nISO\nComing from the International Organization for Standardization, ISO (it\u2019s not an acronym) describes the light sensitivity of your camera's sensor set against a common standard. It was originally known as \"film speed,\" as it was a static measure of the amount of light a given type of film could absorb, but in modern digital cameras ISO can be adjusted up and down. Higher ISO means a brighter image, which is achieved by digitally amplifying the information collected during exposure. It's an imperfect process that generates errors, which become apparent in your pictures as discoloration and noise \u2014 the unattractive speckling effect you usually see in low-light photos.\nThe quality of your camera's sensor and noise-reduction processing will affect the maximum ISO at which you can produce images that are still worth using. From among the cameras we've tested ourselves, Nikon's impressively large and expensive D3s is far and away the best in that respect. It can shoot at ISO 12,800 the way most cameras perform at ISO 1000, allowing you to keep shooting under significantly lower light.\nAperture\nMeasured using the horribly confusing F number scale, the aperture is another of these dead simple settings that tend to upset young children with their obtuse nomenclature. Basically, most lenses have the ability to constrict the light that passes through them using an internal element (called a diaphragm), which can be extended and retracted using controls on the camera. If you want more light in your image, you pull that diaphragm back as far as it would go, or if you need less, you extend it and limit the incoming rays to a narrower, more focused hole. Aperture, therefore, is just a relative measure for the diameter of your lens opening. All you need to know with respect to f-numbers is that lower ones indicate a wider aperture, with f/2.8 and below being the extremes, while higher ones signify more light is being blocked.\nJust think of the Aperture Science logo\nIf light is of paramount importance, you might ask, why would you ever want to constrain its entry into the camera? Well, a side effect of a wide open lens is that it lets in a lot of unfocused light rays. The result is that you get a shallow depth of field, which is to say that anything in front of or behind the area on which you're focusing will appear blurry. That's generally a desirable trait in photography, as it isolates your subject from its surroundings and lets you guide the viewer's eyes, however it can be a problem when you want to have everything in your scene in focus.\nAs the photo above shows, wide aperture settings tend to constrict the in-focus area to a razor-thin sliver, particularly on nearby subjects. The obvious countermeasure is to tighten up the aperture to f/8 or narrower \u2014 that bundles up the incoming light into a more focused beam, which will result in greater depth to your focus area. Do bear in mind that the most extreme depth of field effects are the exclusive preserve of large-sensor cameras; you simply can\u2019t achieve the same defocusing effect with smaller sensors, which retain a generous in-focus depth even at f/1.4.\nShutter speed\nShutter speed is as key an element to getting good photos as any. It controls how long the camera spends collecting light, as opposed to ISO and aperture, which control how much light is absorbed at once. It\u2019s measured in fractions of a second, so a shutter speed of \"1/125\" means the shutter is open for one 125th of a second. Higher shutter speeds mean the camera captures a shorter period of time, which is key for getting blur-free action shots, while lower speeds allow you to soak up more light, albeit at the risk of blurry results if your camera and subject aren't still.\nOf course, you don't always have to fear motion blur. Strap your camera to a tripod and you can exploit the blur to your advantage \u2014 that's how the pros create those pictures of highways decorated by streaks of light or the waterfalls that look like they're composed of cascading wisps of smoke instead of water. Most of the time, you'll want to match your settings to your circumstances, but it's also good fun to sometimes start with a given set of attributes and rearrange your scene to match them.\nOther features that matter\nThe trifecta above are the most important controls on your camera, but there are other attributes you need to be mindful of in the pursuit of the best image quality.\nLens sharpness\nMost professional photographers will tell you that the paramount determinant of image quality is the lens. You can tweak your settings as much as you like, but without a truly sharp piece of glass to filter light through, your pictures will never look their best. The distinction between sharpness and softness in imaging is one of detail: sharp photos retains a clear separation between edges and colors right down to the pixel level.\nUnfortunately, nobody has yet invented an easy metric for quantifying lens quality, so you won't be able to simply walk into a store and order up the Superlative Edition of your favored lens. Part of the problem is that lens performance varies both with aperture and zoom level. The sharpest lenses at f/4 are typically f/1.8 or f/1.4 lenses that have been pulled back from their highest setting. Similarly, lenses start to exhibit distortion at the extreme wide (16mm and lower) and telephoto (135mm and above) ends of their zoom range, which some cameras are able to automatically correct for with software.\nLenses are like sunscreen: all-important\nThere are a couple of easy guiding principles that can steer you in the right direction. Firstly, construction materials matter. Canon's L series of lenses and the higher end of Nikon's Nikkor line are both built out of real glass on the inside and extremely robust materials on the outside. The kit lenses bundled with DSLRs and the non-removable ones on cheaper cameras are made from plastic both on the inside and out, which makes them less reliable in the long term and less awesome when you come to review your results. That's not a universal rule, there are some exceptionally good lenses with plastic optics, but generally, you'll be able to tell a good lens by its considerable weight and durable feel.\nThe second point to remember is that prime lenses \u2014 those without a zoom function, whose focal length is fixed \u2014 tend to perform better than zoom lenses, owing to their simpler construction. For the absolute best results, you'll want a camera capable of exchanging lenses, together with wide-aperture lenses at each of the most common focal lengths: e.g. 24mm, 50mm, 80mm, 100mm, and 200mm. That's more than a backpack's worth of gear to heave around with you (and quality glass weighs quite a bit anyway), so do it only if you're unwilling to compromise on sharpness and flexibility.\nAutofocus\nA common misconception people have is that shutter lag actually has anything to do with the shutter. Oh sure, there's a minuscule delay between the instruction to open and the shutter actually opening, but the lion's share of lag actually comes from the automated focusing and metering systems. Metering is what the camera does to judge how long it needs to expose the image for, while autofocus is a little more self-explanatory. Cameraphone makers have gotten wise to the fact people want to see the picture taken the moment they press the button, so we now have phones like the Amaze 4G that continuously refocus and re-meter the scene so as to be ready at a moment's notice. Nikon has gone one step further with the introduction of Smart Photo Selector in its new 1 Series: it shoots up to 20 photos while you have the shutter button half-pressed and automatically selects the best five after you take your picture.\nNeither Nikon nor HTC's solution is ideal. They're trying to dodge the problem of focusing speed, but the only true solution is more focusing points on your camera combined with a faster focusing motor for the lens. The reliability and quickness of autofocus, particularly in low light, is one of the ways in which professional cameras still stand head and shoulders above the rest. Canon's recently announced EOS 1D-X packs in a whopping 61 AF points, with 41 of them being of the more precise cross-type variety. Stick a fast-focusing lens on that camera and you can bid adieu to shutter lag.\nStraying beyond 8 megapixels is overkill for all but the pros\nSensor size\nIf there\u2019s one rule to follow in photography, it\u2019s that cameras with larger sensors take better photos. That\u2019s a generalization, of course, but it\u2019s based on a very basic empirical truth: the bigger the photosensitive surface area, the more light is taken in at a time. Practical evidence for this is abundant, from the Nikon 1 series that disappointed everyone with its undersized CX sensor, to the Nokia N8, which remains the smartphone camera champion today thanks to its class-leading 1/1.83-inch sensor.\nFull-frame cameras derive their name from the size of their sensors, which match the \"full frame\" of 35mm film, and are predictably the professionals' favorite choice. With a full-frame camera, a 24mm lens gives you exactly that focal length, whereas with smaller sensors, you're subject to a crop factor that tends to turn everything into a slightly more zoomed-in version of itself (i.e. if the sensor is 1.5 times smaller than full-frame, as with Nikon's popular DX format, you get 1.5 times the focal length; with a 24mm lens, that'd mean an effective focal length of 36mm).\nBigger really is better when it comes to camera sensors\nAlas, pricing and sensor sizes scale rather proportionally, so medium format and full-frame cameras are usually outside the reach of most enthusiasts, which is why the most popular digital SLRs today feature the APS-C format. It's a happy compromise.\nMegapixels\nStrictly speaking, a megapixel is one million pixels, but it's somewhat meaningless to know that your camera shoots 10 million pixels at a time. What you want to know, and what the megapixel count truly tells you, is how big you can make your image without having to enlarge it digitally (and suffering the resultant degradation in image quality). A 3-megapixel photo is more than dense enough to be printed out at the US standard 6- x 4-inch size at 300ppi, while 9 megapixels get you closer to a regular sheet of paper at the same density. Compromise a little on the pixel density, say down to 200ppi, and you'll get massive printouts from a humble old 12-megapixel shooter. Now, there are no guarantees that the actual photo would look good \u2014 megapixel numbers only measure the number of data points recorded by the camera \u2014 but at least you'll be able to do it.\nPractically speaking, however, you're not likely to need such huge images. Most digital imaging ends up being consumed on computer screens, and if all you're needing are 900px-wide pics for Facebook, well, even a solitary megapixel will suffice. If you're shooting for billboards, murals, or other enormous photo sizes, you should get all the megapixels you can, but for the average photographer, other specs matter more.\nViewfinder / LCD\nOptical viewfinders are a funny thing. Until you use one, you wonder why everyone bothers with the effort, then you get your first DSLR and you can't live without one. Mirrors in SLR cameras reflect the exact image that will be imprinted onto the sensor to a sort of porthole atop the camera, that's your viewfinder. Once again, the more expensive models offer a more luxurious experience, with the Canon 7D and Nikon D700 featuring bigger, more comfortable viewfinders than entry-level DSLRs. Electronic viewfinders (EVF) are getting much better and starting to compete, particularly in Sony's line of single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras like the A77, but it'll take some doing to convince traditionalists to let go of the more natural way.\nIf your camera doesn't have an optical viewfinder, then you'd better make damn sure it's equipped with a good LCD. You\u2019ll be using it to both frame and review photos, so any shortcomings in terms of color fidelity or resolution can force you into a guessing game you don't want to play. LCD resolution is measured in dots, with 230,000, 460,000, and 920,000 being the typical values. The more dots the better, obviously, but do take a moment to check out the quality of the screen as well. Sony and Samsung are using OLED displays in some of their latest cameras, which look fantastic. As for touchscreen functionality, we've yet to see anyone pair it with a reasonable control scheme on a camera, so we'd advise skipping it.\nZoom\nZoom is a simple concept \u2014 it\u2019s how close you can get to whatever you\u2019re shooting, without having to physically move closer \u2014 but it\u2019s not always obvious what you\u2019re really getting. The actual x-multiple of your zoom is much less important than the angle measurements at the widest and closest settings, which measure how much you can fit into your photo. A camera that starts at 28mm and has 10x zoom will ultimately get closer (280mm) than one that begins at 24mm (240mm when zoomed in), though the tradeoff is a smaller field of view when you\u2019re zoomed out. If you want to be as close as possible to your subject, the most important number is the telephoto angle, more so than the x-multiple. But be warned: cameras with huge zoom tend to be hard to hold steady when zoomed in, so getting sharp photos might be tough even with the best image stabilization. Additionally, as discussed above, the more flexibility you gain with zoom, the less likely you are to get the highest image quality \u2014 lens makers have to compromise on something, so if you're going after a massive zoom range, bear in mind that it won't deliver sublime images the way a fixed focal length might.\nWhen it comes to zoom operation, fixed lens cameras have the upper hand. They usually have powered zoom mechanisms, allowing you smooth control at the press of a button. Interchangeable lenses are more fiddly for the newcomer, as their zoom is usually (but not always ) controlled mechanically with a ring around the body of the lens. That gives more granular control to those want it, but can be offputting to the casual user. Finally, do yourself a favor and ignore the very idea of a \"digital zoom.\" It's done either by enlarging the picture (and reducing its quality) or cropping down to a smaller area of the sensor, both of which you can do much better with dedicated post-processing software on your computer.\nWhether optical or electronic, a good viewfinder is well worth having\nFigments of marketing imagination: digital zoom and digital image stabilization\nImage stabilization\nAs with digital zoom, digital image stabilization (IS) is more marketing ploy than a useful feature. The optical stuff, however, is a whole other story. Lenses with optical IS are equipped with internal elements that move in the opposite direction to any small movements you make, steadying the image that arrives onto the sensor. Nikon's Vibration Reduction, demonstrated above, is particularly effective, allowing you to shoot at two or three steps slower shutter speed than you usually would be able to without motion blur. For example, if 1/40 shutter speed is your floor before you start seeing blurring on a regular lens, its VR version will move that down to 1/25. Canon's version of this is called Optical Image Stabilizer, Panasonic's is MegaOIS, and virtually every other camera and lens maker has a variety too.\nSony and Olympus have made a habit of building image stabilization right into the body of their DSLRs, simplifying lens design and reassuring users that all of their lenses will be stabilized. Ultimately, whichever system you choose, they all serve the purpose of reducing the deleterious effects of unintended motion and should be considered highly desirable in a camera purchase. If you're going after a shooter with a long telephoto zoom, optical IS should be the first thing you look for.\nVideo capabilities\nIt was only a few years ago that video recording was considered a novelty in still cameras, but today HD video is a standard, and expected, feature. Still, there are pitfalls to beware, such as a selection of cameras that will lock the focus and zoom when video recording starts (e.g. the otherwise excellent Canon S95 ), significantly limiting your options. Reliable autofocus, in the cameras that are capable of it, remains a mirage. You'll do well to learn to love manual focus if you want your videos to be free of the irritating focus jumps that cameras do when they get confused as to what you're trying to film.\n1080p HD video is fast becoming a standard feature in still cameras\nCameras with larger sensors make capturing video a harder process than with simple point-and-shoots, owing to their greater sensitivity, bulkier bodies, and typically mechanical zoom and focus mechanisms. They give you more to worry about, as lens operation noises are often picked up by the integrated microphone, however they also provide access to a range of cinematic effects that smaller cams cannot touch. Want to start your movie masterpiece with a gorgeously circular bokeh that gradually comes into focus on your leading man? You'll need something in the class of a Canon 60D with a wide-aperture lens to match.\nMinimum focusing distance\nAll lenses have a point after which, if you get any closer to your subject, it won\u2019t be in focus no matter how hard you try. Termed the minimum focusing distance (MFD), this is a specification that's usually printed on the lens itself. It's measured from the image sensor \u2014 not the front of the lens \u2014 to the subject, so it's usually a less severe limitation than you might first think. MFD is actually one of the few advantages of smaller-sensor cameras: cameraphones and point-and-shooters can get really close to the subject, whereas interchangeable-lens cameras usually need a minimum clearance of at least 25cm / 10 inches. Macro lenses are designed specifically with the goal of cutting that distance, some dropping it as low as 16cm (essentially allowing you to press the lens up against the thing you're shooting). The important thing to be wary of is that telephoto and long zoom lenses typically demand a long MFD, somewhere in the region of 45cm, meaning they're not as flexible as they might initially appear to be.\nWhite balance\nLike a big name actor that's too important to sit in the middle of the cast list but not so crucial as to headline the show, we're dedicating our last slot to the camera's white balance (WB). This is the function that everyone leaves on auto, which is why the majority of indoor pics on Facebook look yellow. In simple terms, cameras are a bit dumb. If you don't tell them that you're under incandescent lights (which cast a yellow hue), they won't account for it and will try to balance the colors before them based on their presets. All modern cameras have a WB preset for artificial lighting, but only the more professionally inclined ones give you granular control over white balance and easy access to tweaking it on the fly.\nThe best solution we've found for overcoming unnatural color tinging is to feed your camera a sample image. The majority of DSLRs now have the option to set WB by taking an image of something that you know is white under the particular lighting conditions you intend to shoot in. Thus, when the camera snaps a nice white sheet of paper under the lurid orange and violet lights of a trade show floor, it'll calibrate itself to know that white looks a little different at that spot.\nCamera types\nSix major categories, each catering to a particular need\nCameraphone\nAmong phones, the Nokia N8 has unmatched image quality. Unluckily for the N8, however, the central allure of cellphone photography isn't quality, it's convenience. The N8 is bulky thanks to its enlarged sensor and unwieldy to operate due to its Symbian OS, essentially reducing it to a point-and-shoot camera with a built-in 3G radio. What you really want from your phone is a camera with quick operation, reasonable image quality, and an effortless interface for uploading pictures to the web. That's the purpose of a cameraphone, after all: sharing pictures as quickly and as easily as possible.\nFlickr's most popular camera, of any type, has been the iPhone 4 for a number of months now (though it looks likely to be succeeded by the iPhone 4S and its upgraded 8-megapixel sensor and five-element lens). Thanks to dedicated apps for image uploading and things like Twitter being plugged right into the gallery view, sending photos out to the web has never been easier. Android offers no fewer sharing options than iOS, and Microsoft's Windows Phone OS is similarly adept at serving the need for quick picture taking and sharing.\nThe limitations of cameraphones are numerous and generally well known. Firstly, you get no optical zoom option. Most phone cameras are set at wide focal lengths like 28mm or 35mm in order to capture large group shots and landscapes. There's also no optical image stabilization, which is a bigger issue when shooting video than stills. Additionally, although constantly improving, the miniature sensors in cameraphones continue to lag dedicated shooters in low-light performance and dynamic range.\nPoint-and-shoot\nPoint-and-shoot (P&S) cameras are small, cheap, and easy to use. As the name implies, you\u2019re meant to take it out of the box, point it at your subject, and shoot. These cameras\u2019 manufacturers typically assume you\u2019ll be shooting in Auto mode and won\u2019t be worrying about things like aperture and shutter speed. That makes the camera easy to operate, but the flip side is that if you want more refined control, you'll have to dig around inside a stratified labyrinth of unhelpful menus. If you\u2019re just learning how to use a camera, or don\u2019t want to have to think about your photos, a point-and-shoot is a great option \u2014 their pocketability is just a bonus.\nPicking a point-and-shoot presents you with a very wide range of features to choose from: some emphasize zoom, others promote manual controls, and still others offer extras like GPS or touchscreen functionality. Software sophistication is also growing, with litanies of automatic and creative modes, though we find the great majority of them to be mere gimmicks. Given the choice, you should always aim for the best sensor and lens, as nothing will give you quite as much satisfaction as sheer image quality, with added features being of secondary concern.\nCameraphone\n"}, {"score": 676.7584, "uuid": "8a43f03c-b2e8-5836-b32a-8bb5bbc71d02", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0909wb-39-02960", "target_hostname": "www.clubsnap.com", "target_uri": "http://www.clubsnap.com/forums/panasonic/1039295-i-am-getting-gx1.html", "page_rank": 1.1887902e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>I</em> AM GETTING THE GX1", "snippet": "Whats the story <em>for</em> OM-D? <em>I</em> choose gx1 as mentioned they have good history with the best <em>camera</em> maker. <em>For</em> olympus, <em>I</em> never ever used it... guess that <em>I</em> had to go all-<em>over</em> again to search <em>for</em> it&#x27;s performance.", "explanation": null, "document": "I AM GETTING THE GX1\nDear all Panny user.Can anyone assist?\nAfter thinking for 1mth.

It\u2019s got all the makings of a great pocket-sized, outdoor and travel camera. The weatherproof body, Dual iS image stabilization, new TruePic III processor, a 5x zoom lens, and sensitivity up to ISO 1600 make for a powerful and flexible compact digital camera camera. Plus, I\u2019ve enjoyed my experience with other Olympus Stylus digital cameras. So I told them to put me at the top of the list to review the Stylus 780.\nI got the camera a few weeks ago and have used it almost every day, mostly for outdoor photos on hikes, mountain bike rides, and trips to the park with the dog. I\u2019ve also taken a lot of flower pictures since my yard and the mountains are in full bloom.\nFeatures\nThe Olympus Stylus 780 digital camera has a great set of features. Pocket-sized, weatherproof point-and-shoot performance is the name of the game with the Olympus Stylus line, which began back in 1991 with the Olympus Stylus/mju 35mm point-and-shoot camera . With a 5x optical zoom lens, 2.5-inch LCD, mechanical and electronic image stabilization, and a weatherproof body, the Stylus 780 has a pedigree and all the parts to make a great take-everywhere digital camera.\nFor me, the most important feature on the Olympus Stylus 780 is the image stabilization. ( Learn more about image stabilization ) The 780 uses what Olympus calls \u201cDual iS\u201d image stabilization. It\u2019s \u201cdual\u201d because the camera has both mechanical image stabilization (MIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS). Olympus\u2019 Sensor Shift image stabilization \u2013 the mechanical part of the system, helps compensate for camera shake when you\u2019re taking pictures in low light. Electronic image stabilization uses high ISO settings to help freeze action. EIS is activated either by choosing the \u201cHigh Auto\u201d ISO setting in the Function menu or one of the three scene modes that use electronic image stabilization for action or low light photography.\nThe Olympus Stylus 780 doesn\u2019t have advanced exposure modes like aperture priority or metered manual. It has a program mode that offers exposure adjustment via exposure compensation, an pure point-and-shoot Auto mode, and 22 scene modes ranging from standards like Landscape and Portrait, to more specialized modes like Underwater Wide and Auction. Each scene mode includes a description of what the mode is for and how it helps capture that type of subject. There\u2019s also a Shooting Guide menu, which lists different types of subjects and photo problems with detailed instructions for how to best capture them with the Stylus 780.\nOlympus Stylus 780 \u2013 SCN Mode Menu\nOlympus Stylus 780 \u2013 GUIDE Menu\nThere are two macro modes with a dedicated button on the back of the camera. One lets you focus at 7.9-inches/20 cm at wide zoom and 23.6-inches/60 cm at the telephoto end of the zoom. The other, Super macro mode, fixes the zoom and allows you to focus as close as 1.2-inches/3 cm \u2013 that\u2019s close!\nIn the Hi drive mode, the Olympus Stylus 780 can capture 3.5 images per second for up to 11 frames. Flash and ISO settings are limited in the Hi drive mode, and the resolution is restricted to 2048 x 1536 pixels (3.1 megapixels). But the flash will strobe in the Hi drive mode and that\u2019s very impressive.\nThe 5x f/3.5-5.0 optical zoom lens is equivalent to a 36-180mm lens on a 35mm film camera. That\u2019s a pretty good range for a camera that fits in the pocket of your jeans. It\u2019s capable of getting in pretty close to most subjects and works great for zooming in for landscape photos. However, the 36mm wide end isn\u2019t really what I consider wide.\nThere are a couple of other features that should be mentioned: Shadow Adjustment Technology and the Panorama scene mode. Essentially, the Panorama scene mode is a built-in stitching system that helps the photographer create a panoramic image in the camera. You have to use an Olympus xD memory card and the included Olympus Master software in order to use the Panorama scene mode. Shadow Adjust has a dedicated button on the back of the camera that simply and automatically compensates for contrasty lighting or backlit subjects.\nCamera Menus\nOlympus Stylus 780 shooting mode display w. info and histogram\nOlympus Stylus 780 Function menu\nOlympus Stylus 780 menu navigation\nOlympus Stylus 780 main menu\nOlympus Stylus 780 playback mode display w. info\nOlympus Stylus 780 playback mode display w. info and histogram\nDesign\nThe Olympus Stylus 780\u2032s most important design element isn\u2019t readily visible. In order to protect delicate mechanical parts and sensitive electronics, rubber gaskets protect all openings on the camera.\nTwo-thirds of the camera back are dedicated to the 2.5-inch HyperCrystal LCD. Like most compact digital cameras now, the Olympus Stylus 780 has no optical viewfinder. Camera controls are placed well, with everything in reach of your right index finger and thumb. I like the Function button, which gives quick access to often used controls like ISO and white balance. Dedicated buttons give even easier access to the most important controls \u2013 exposure, flash, macro and self-timer. There\u2019s also a Mode Dial for choosing the shooting mode, viewing photos, using the Guide mode.\nI like point-and-shoot cameras that actually fit in my pocket. And in spite of having some big camera features, the Olympus Stylus 780 will fit in a shirt or jeans pocket. That means you can have it with you all the time, ready to get the shot \u2013 no matter what the place or occasion.\nCamera Experience\nI\u2019m always on the lookout for digital point-and-shoot cameras that can do serious trail duty with minimal compromise. The Olympus Stylus 780 is tiny and packs a lot of power along with excellent features. I was excited about it having actual mechanical image stabilization. In my experience, mechanical image stabilization is invaluable because it means I can shoot in lower light and use lower ISO settings for less noise, hence better image quality. I\u2019m also a long-time fan of the weatherproof Stylus line. I am in the outdoors in all kinds of weather and a camera that can handle some moisture gives me a lot more confidence.\nI didn\u2019t have a real opportunity to test the Stylus 780\u2032s weatherproofing because it never really rained while I had it. However, I gave it a couple of good blasts with the hose, just for a photo. It performed just fine after that. And based on my experience with other Olympus Stylus digital cameras, I am not at all concerned about using the 780 in the rain. Olympus has the weatherproof thing down.\nFor the most part, camera performance was very good. The new TruePic III processor is very good, making the camera quick, and delivering very usable images at high ISO settings. I was actually unprepared and happily surprised by the high ISO performance of the Olympus Stylus 780. I\u2019ve come to expect mediocre to terrible quality from compact digital cameras at sensitivity settings over ISO 400. But Olympus has done a great job in this area. I\u2019m a little uncomfortable about what I\u2019m going to say next, because it goes against what we\u2019ve all come to expect from compact digital cameras. But I\u2019ve checked and re-checked and I believe that the 780 has absolutely usable ISO 1600. If you doubt, I suggest you download the full resolution version of the image above and print it to see for yourself. Normally I try to use the lowest ISO possible to minimize noise and optimize image quality. After using the 780 for a couple of weeks, I think I would actually try to shoot at ISO 200 or even 400 most of the time so that the camera can use a smaller aperture and faster shutter speeds. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, rest assured that the Olympus Stylus 780\u2032s auto and scene modes will serve you well and you\u2019ll get better photos in low light than you have with previous digital cameras. Olympus has done an amazingly good job with their TruePic III camera processor. Every type of photographer will benefit from the improved image quality and low light performance.\nThere were a couple of problems with the camera. One is that it doesn\u2019t display exposure settings. It does have a histogram display to help judge exposure. But I like to be able to see the shutter speed the camera is using so that I know if I\u2019m going to get a sharp photo. In my opinion, this is a major omission and it makes it hard for me to really get the most out of the camera. The average photographer might not care. But anyone who has a little camera experience is likely to want to know what shutter speed the camera is selecting. Knowing your shutter speed allows you to decide whether a photo is possible and the best technique to use.\nSince the majority of my serious photography is of mountain bikers, I always take test cameras out on the trail. I had high hopes for the 780 as a mountain bike camera. However, like yours truly on the dirt jumps, it falls short. It\u2019s really hard to take panning photos with only an LCD display. An optical viewfinder is more accurate and you pan better with the camera braced against your eye. And although it\u2019s comparable to most cameras in its class, the 36mm wide angle zoom isn\u2019t wide enough for tight trail photos. Finally, the flash is very weak. When shooting in the woods, the standard technique is to use the flash and follow the rider (pan). The lack of an optical viewfinder and a weak flash made it next to impossible for me to get a clean panning shot. Panning shots in the woods resulted in spookily dark photos of decapitated riders. Also, unless you\u2019re using the Hi drive mode with its lower resolution, the shot-to-shot time makes it easy to miss a shot. It takes the camera a while to process and save an image. However, if you\u2019re willing to use the Hi drive mode and shoot 3-megapixel photos, then the 780 is pretty quick.\nThe Olympus Stylus 780 excels at close-up photography. There are two macro modes that allow you to get pretty close. But the Super macro mode allows you to get within 1.2-inches/3 cm of your subject. There\u2019s some distortion around the edges, but since depth-of-field with macro is so limited, it\u2019s not that noticeable. And since the mountains and my yard are full of flowers, I found myself taking lots of close-up flower photos. In fact, I think these flower closeups \u2013 especially the ones I took after some rain \u2013 are the best photos I took with the 780. The mechanical image stabilization makes a big difference for a lazy photographer like me, too. Normally, a tripod would be necessary for these photos. But I did all right shooting handheld. If you like to take close-up pictures then this camera works very, very well. The mechanical image stabilization also makes it possible to take slow exposures of moving water, for that silky look. Normally, without a tripod, the image below would be all blurry because of my shaky hands. But the Stylus 780\u2032s mechanical image stabilization, a few tries, and some careful bracing and breathing, made this come out very nicely, in spite of the super slow 1/13th of a second shutter speed.\nNow the bad news. As wonderful as the design and features of the Olympus Stylus 780 are, the camera is spoiled for me by some hard to avoid lens problems. I took a lot of pictures with this camera. And I started to notice that many of them had soft spots that couldn\u2019t be attributed to anything but a lens problem. Since I shot a lot of outdoor photos, I kept thinking the soft spots might be wind on leaves. But I did some very controlled tests to confirm the problem and discovered that the spots were there, in the same place, no matter what the subject. I then asked Olympus for another camera, in case I just got a bad one. The second camera had the same problem. Photos taken in low light, with the aperture wide open have soft spots around the middle of the frame. Click on the image below to view the high-res file and scroll around to see the soft spots. This would have been a very nice photo if it weren\u2019t for the mushy areas.\nThere is a possible solution to the lens problem. Actually it\u2019s more of a workaround, but it will help. Since the soft spot only occurs when the lens is wide open, using a higher sensitivity setting should avoid it. And since the Stylus 780 has such impressive high ISO performance, this is a realistic strategy for minimizing the problem. However, it\u2019s a problem that shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place. I like to always use the lowest sensitivity setting a camera offers, so I can get the best possible image quality. With the 780, I have to compromise ultimate image quality in order to avoid the soft spots. That\u2019s a bummer.\nImage Quality\nGenerally, I find that Olympus digital camera image quality isn\u2019t quite as good as I\u2019d like. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad. I have tons of photos I\u2019ve taken with Olympus digital cameras that I\u2019m very pleased with. It\u2019s just that Canon, Sony, Panasonic, and Nikon are usually a little better. The Olympus Stylus 780 is consistent with that experience. However, I was very pleased with the noise levels at high ISO settings. Olympus\u2019 new TruePic III processor does a really excellent job at reducing noise and I have no problem using this camera at ISO 400, 800, and even 1600! The Stylus 780\u2032s high ISO performance was a big surprise for me and I think it\u2019s the most impressive part of the camera.\nThere\u2019s a noticeable absence of purple fringing in Stylus 780 images. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t any. But it\u2019s much improved since the last Olympus Stylus digital camera I tested (Olympus Stylus 720 SW) and it\u2019s not obvious enough to matter.\nI almost always use auto white balance with point-and-shoot digital cameras. Olympus Stylus 780 color is pretty good, although there is occasional white balance wackiness, with darker images having a somewhat warm, reddish hue. Shadow and highlight details are preserved fairly well, although highlights have more of a tendency to blow out than with some other cameras I\u2019ve used. Careful exposure, using the histogram will take care of this. Most point-and-shoot photographers likely won\u2019t notice or care. But the camera does tend to lose some sky and cloud detail. And that\u2019s always disappointing if you\u2019re taking landscape or other outdoor pictures. Auto exposure metering is very good and aside from the highlight problem, I rarely had an exposure that really disappointed me. Most of the photos you see accompanying this review have had at least some adjustment in Photoshop. That being the case, they should be viewed as representing the ultimate potential of the camera and not what it delivers at the most basic point-and-shoot level. For pure, untouched image quality, it\u2019s best to look at the studio sample photos.\nDetail is very good. However, I often lost critical details in low light due to the soft spots I mentioned in the Camera Experience section. I checked and rechecked and neither focus nor noise was the problem. But there are distinct soft spots in many images, where important textural details like leaves, branches, and rocks are too soft. And what might have great photos are throwaways. Basically, a very nice camera has been seriously compromised by a lens problem.\nClick on thumbnails to view sample photos.\nConclusion\nThere are so many good things about the Olympus Stylus 780. It fits in your pocket, it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s weatherproof, the image stabilization works great, and the high ISO performance is amazing for a compact digital camera. But no matter how much I want to like it, I can\u2019t ignore the 780\u2032s lens problems. The Olympus Stylus 780 might have been a great camera. But not with this lens. Aside from the weatherproof body, there are other cameras that offer a lot of the same features and functionality. Unless you\u2019re a photographer that shoots in bright, perfect light, where the lens won\u2019t reveal its flaws, you don\u2019t care about small details, or you need the weatherproof design, the 780 is likely to disappoint you, as it did me. Hopefully, the camera designers at Olympus will read this and go the extra mile on the next Stylus digital camera. I want it all. And I know they can do it.\nWho Should Buy It\nPardon me, but I\u2019m going to backtrack a little here. No one makes an outdoor point-and-shoot camera like Olympus. If you spend a lot of time hiking, boating, fishing, biking, skiing, or doing anything where a pocket-sized, weatherproof digital camera will come in handy, the Olympus Stylus 780 may serve you well. The only caveat is you must be aware of the camera\u2019s limitations. If you aren\u2019t super picky about image quality and don\u2019t plan on shooting masterpieces or printing larger than 8\u00d710, then the 780 is a smart, worthy camera. There are so many good things about it that everyone will like. But if you\u2019re an experienced, demanding photographer, used to looking closely at your images, then I would advise you to steer clear of the Olympus Stylus 780. Unless I happened to get two bad samples, I predict the lens will let you down.\n- end -\nContents of the Olympus Stylus 770 Box\nOlympus Stylus 780 Digital Camera\nLI-42B Li-Ion rechargeable battery and charger\nUSB cable, Audio/Video cable\n"}, {"score": 652.99945, "uuid": "541788b7-d9af-5c04-811b-785729663110", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-00-05837", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/learn/optics/digitaloptics/", "page_rank": 1.1744243e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Digital SLR <em>Cameras</em>, Lenses and Film - photo.net", "snippet": "<em>I</em> like slide shows but <em>for</em> digital <em>photographs</em> you need <em>a</em> beamer or <em>a</em> really big TV.

Thanks\nAdam Ma , April 23, 2003; 03:32 A.M.\nGood job Bob. This article has given a sound comparison on \"normal\" scanned image and digital image. I definitely agree that the \"quality\" of digital image has also met my need.\nBut I wonder, how do people evaluate the \"quality\" of an image?\nI would like to say it is quite subjective to determine the \"quality\" of an image. To me, although the \"jaggies\" on diagonal lines is hard to be seen, I dont like the grainny, and rough feeling appeared in the scanned image, I will say that the general \"quality\" of this image is not as high as that from EOS 10D. I can accept jaggies when the image is magnified or viewed at a resolution higher than 3000x2000 pixels, and I like the smooth and noise-free feeling that I get from the digital image. In other words, I will say the digital image is of higher quality than the (untouched) scanned image. Again, this is very subjective. Just my 2 cents.\nBy the way, if I were to judge whether I will use film or digital to take pictures, will be to consider the usage of the final image. If I will post them into the 'Net or I wanted to make special effect on them and become the desktop wallpaper in my PC, I will use digital camera. And if I will print them and send them to my grandma who have no idea of what a computer is, or if I find a nice little Micky-Mouse blank photo album, then I will use film camera!\nOskar Ojala , April 23, 2003; 05:49 A.M.\nVery good article. It doesn't try to be exhaustive, but takes some common questions and answers them well. The comparison between the digital and film images of the \"real-world\" target was particularly nice, although I'd like to stress that one image doesn't tell everything. Bob obviously has experience shooting with film and with the Eos10D, which matters more when making the comparison than a few images on the net.\nP.J. Mc Kenna , April 23, 2003; 07:15 A.M.\nBob,\nFrom looking at some of the 10D images it looks like in-camera sharpening has left a halo around the high-contrast parts of the image - for example the middle picture of the three when comparing film and digital.\nHow much does this artificially boost the 10D images compared to the film-derived images?\n-P.J.\nBruce MacNeil , April 23, 2003; 11:46 A.M.\nYes, if you are all willy-nilly over sharpness. Shoot with 4x5 or 8x10 film...\nBob Atkins\n, April 23, 2003; 11:49 A.M.\nI'm not sure what an \"artificial\" boost in sharpness is. If it looks sharper, it is sharper, even though resolution isn't affected. Most of us sharpen both digital images and scanned images fot the maximum sharpness that doesn't show artifacts. You can see the artifacts in the images here because you are looking at the individual pixel level. You wouldn't see the artifacts in a print. If you can't see them are they really there? It's a bit like the old \"if a tree falls the the forest....\" question!\nActually film also shows \"artificial\" sharpening to some extent too, via adjacency effects, where edges show higher acutance than they really have in the image produced by the lens, due to uneven action of the developer at edges in the image. In fact in B&W work developers may be chosen especially for their adjacency effects in order to increase sharpness. So boosting of sharpness isn't only a digital thing.\nIlkka Nissila\n, April 23, 2003; 12:42 P.M.\nNote also that digital cameras have built-in enhancement algorithms that reduce the appearance of noise in smooth areas. This can be done using software such as NeatImage for scanned film shots, which should in my opinion be done to the film images before a comparison is made.\nBob Atkins\n, April 23, 2003; 12:55 P.M.\nNeatimage is great on some shots, not so great on others. However it takes about 2 hrs to process a single 4000dpi scan on my machine (550 MHz) - after I've setup the noise parameters which may take 5-10 minutes. That doesn't exactly speed up my workflow! Even with a state of the art 3GHz machine it's still going to take 20 minutes or so, or 12 hours for a 36 exp roll of film...\nThere's no argument that you CAN get better results from film, if you pick the right film, scan it optimally, process the scan to reduce noise etc., etc. It's just the amount of time and effort (and expense)that takes is generally not worth the possible marginal quality improvement for the majority of my applications.\nAs I said, if I wanted images I could blow up to 20x30 or more, I'd shoot slow speed film in a 6x9 or large format camera, where the extra effort would really payoff.\nWilliam Nicholls , April 23, 2003; 03:01 P.M.\nScanned 35mm film of the right emulsion may indeed provide more detail, but the examples here show wider color gamut that direct image capture provides. The color of a film scan is limited by the dyes used in the emulsion, not the color gamut of the scanner. Color detail, even with bayer sensors, is far better on a direct capture from a competent camera than from a film scan. I find a direct capture allows much more excavation of shadow detail than a high dmax scan from a transparency.\nAlthough the detail isn't there, the smoothness of tones that you get on a large print from a 6 Mpix capture has a feel akin to a print made from large format film. At 4000 ppi or higher, even a fine grain film is having grain resolved by the scanner. On a big print, the absolute detail is slightly better on my scans from Velvia or Provia, but grain is also obvious. In many cases, I get better 13x19 prints from the 6 Mpix digital camera image.\nYaron Kidron , April 23, 2003; 04:15 P.M.\nIt's hard to compare absolute resolution between film and CCD emulsion, simply because you're doing it on a computer screen, which is CCD-favorable. I've had quite a lot of experience with my S2 Pro in the past year or so, and although digital images contain much detail (i'd say a 6mpixel image would print nicely upto 16x20), most are still easily distinguishable from their film counterparts.\nCCDs resolve more shadow detail, but do miserably with highlights. There's not even one DSLR out there, regardless of chip size or manufacturer, that can handle highlights well. This is not because of limited latitude- it's because CCDs have yet to incorporate a design that would know how to digest highlights.\nAs for grain, lack of grain is somethimes favorable, sometimes not. I often intentionally added noise to my DSLR snaps just because the photo seemed unrealistic to me. Sometimes, lack of grain draws unwanted attention to even-toned surfaces. All in all, IMHO DSLRs work better for portaits than landscape photography.\nB/W photography is possible with a DSLR, but film would bring out better textures. It's also hard to rely on one channel only, since current Bayer CCD designs leave you with 1/3rd or 1/4th of actual resolving power of the CCD.\nDigital is another medium to master- quite different than film, and with great potential. I'd like to see more articles as this, Bob. Good work!\nBob Atkins\n, April 23, 2003; 04:58 P.M.\n<em>since current Bayer CCD designs leave you with 1/3rd or 1/4th of actual resolving power of the CCD</em> <p> I'm not so sure that's realy true. For example the 10D has a 7.5 micron pitch pixel array. That's 133 pixels per mm. If we assume the usual Nyquist limit (which may not be valid, but at least should give an upper bound), that would suggest maximum resolution of 67 lp/mm. <p> 1/3 of that would be 22 lp/mm and 1/4 would be 17 lp/mm. The resolution of the 10D sensor is demonstrably better than that. I'd estimate the native resolution of the Bayer interpolated image to be somewhere around maybe 55 lp/mm, depending exactly how you define \"resolved\" and the orientation of the test pattern. <p> I don't know the details of the Bayer interpolation algorithm. It's possible that for pure red and pure blue bars of the right orientation resolution could be less than for black and white bars, but in practice, on real world subjects, Bayer interpolation really doesn't degrade resolution too much. <p> If you want to use the \"F\" word (Foveon), it doesn't show 3 or 4x the resolution of a same size Bayer sensor. It does show a bit more, just how much more depending on which test you pick.\ngabriele lopez , April 23, 2003; 05:09 P.M.\nVery nice article!\nI agree expecially on the part where you explain that for the most part of uses, digital quality reached the necessary quality we need..\nShoot on something different from a 35mm frame if you need absolute quality..\nI think that 35mm film has his strenghts in other hands instead that in those of quality, nowadays...\nCiao!\nIlkka Nissila\n, April 23, 2003; 05:17 P.M.\nTwo hours to process an image is a lot. On my one-processor 2.0 GHz Pentium IV, a 4000 dpi scan takes about 7 minutes to process with Neatimage. With a dual-processor setup it would be only a few minutes.\nI think the use of a medium or large format camera to get high quality is not that great an option today. Neither of my favourite colour films (Royal Supra 200, E100GX) is available in large format, and only one of the two is available in 120. I will rather stay with 35 mm until the dust has settled and it becomes clear what exactly is possible with digital sensors.\nOne thing that I'm worried about is the people candid - the exposure latitude of negative film and top-quality analog printing is a quite efficient combination for the people photography that I do. I don't have to stare at histograms, play with laptops and memory cards while shooting 7 rolls of 135-36 during an event. It obviously depends on the lab, but I've struck gold in that department. And you can always scan the results and do what you like with the images. I haven't seen any digital printing method that would hold a candle to the 4x6's that I get from C-41 with traditional means. It's kind of frustrating that there is no way that I can reproduce the quality small print without sending out the negs. Why would I want high quality small prints? When a presentation consists of several pictures together, putting them in an album is difficult if they're 11x14's...\nYaron Kidron , April 23, 2003; 05:56 P.M.\nBob,\nIt's not the apparent lp/m ratio that I'm concerned about... B/W digital photography is sometimes handicapped because we normally can view and print the images in 8 bits per pixel. When you got 3/4 channels, it gives you sufficient gamut, but when you got only 256 levels of gray, you'll probably be experiencing strange rendering effects in similar-tone subjects.\nMoreoever, as you've mentioned, the Bayer algorithm normally performs well (when the image does lend itself to it) with retaining the original resolution... But when the original image does exhibit Moire patterns after been 'Bayer'ed, the b/w transposition (especially for b/w images based on a single-channel) is catastrophic.\nFoveon: I'd wish one of the big names would've supported F-technology. Just a wish...\nBob Atkins\n, April 23, 2003; 07:08 P.M.\nIlkka - 7m is pretty fast! I've just been using the \"free\" version of Neatimage to play around with. I didn't think the \"pro\" version was supposed to be any faster but maybe it is. Are you using the pro version?\nOtherwise it's hard to reconcile 7m vs 120m with only a 4x increase in CPU speed unless your machine is somehow a lot more efficient than mine (cache?). I have 512MB RAM, lots of free disk space and nothing else running on the machine. Win 2Kpro OS.\nMaybe some PC expert could shed light on this. Or maybe there's a new version of Neatimage I should try.\nDavid Littleboy (Tokyo, Japan)\n, April 23, 2003; 07:24 P.M.\nI was struck by how much better the resolution chart taken with the same lens looks in digital than in scanned Kodachrome. Most of the film partizans argue that scanning at 4000 dpi doesn't get all the information. So the question arises: if you look at the Kodachrome slide with a microscope, is it actually resolving more than the digital sensor???\n, April 23, 2003; 07:44 P.M.\nThe article is well executed and I enjoyed reading it. Applause to Bob!\nArthur Yeo\n, April 23, 2003; 07:48 P.M.\nI'm a little taken aback by the large bubbly grains of the Kodachrome25. Anyone know what's the specs of this discontinued product in terms of RMS grain size? Is the grain the same size as Velvia (or Provia?) ?\nFabian Gonzales , April 24, 2003; 12:58 A.M.\nVery interesting and informative article. I also found the included Photomicrograph very interesting. I have long had the impression that film contains more detail than a 4000 DPI scanner can reproduce. I also suspect that film scanners exaggerate grain, and that as a result a large print will look better if printed on a traditional enlarger (although I have not tested this).\nBut digital is clearly the way of the future, and some day even medium and large-format photography will be obsolete. Today however, one of the major drawbacks of consumer DSLR's is the small sensor size and the resulting focus multiplier. I do quite a bit of work at wide angles, and find the 1.6x multiplier to be really inconvenient.\n, April 24, 2003; 01:20 A.M.\nPhotomicrograph of K25 test slide\nThis isn't meant to be a test of Kodachrome 25 or how well it scans on an FS4000us, so any data on those subjects shouldn't be used in that context.\nThe FS4000US scan at 4000dpi does not, and should not be expected to, reveal all the detail that you can see in the slide. Under a microscope you can see finer detail than a 4000dpi scan can reveal. The very BEST a 4000dpi scan could do is 78 lp/mm and in practice it won't quite resolve detail at that level. A good lens will put close to 100 lp/mm on Kodachrome under optimum conditions (tripod, perfect focus, mirror locked up etc.).\nHere is a photomicrograph of the same section of the K25 slide. It reveals a little more detail than the 4000dpi scan. Not a whole lot more, but certainly a little more. It's possible a better lens would yield even more resolution and it's likely that the test pattern if shot on Technical Pan B&W film would yield significantly more resolution.\nThe real question is, however, what happens in the real world, where you're not using mirror lock up, you don't have a prime lens set to f8, your subject is moving, you may or may not have a tripod and you are shooting ISO 100 or faster film. Under those conditions it's quite possible that a 4000dpi scan will extract all the useful information out of a slide or negative.\nMichael McCarthy , April 24, 2003; 06:39 A.M.\nBob, thanks for the concise and accurate article. Your comment that the digital versus film decision depends on the workflow of the particular photographer is a key to understanding the issue and to coming to a conclusion that works for that photographer.\nI am a hobbyist and use film because the images appear more pleasing to me compared to digital, especially color range. Also, digital can't touch black & white film in my opinion. Furthermore, I don't take the film/slide/print image digital because I too can't afford drum scans and, if I could, digital output is not as pleasing to me. Unfortunately we can't compare a film based slide to a digital image online which makes my workflow defective in the online sharing of images category.\nThus, in my opinion, if one wants a slide or print, then film is better. If one wants a digital file, then digital may be better depending on the tastes and workflow of the photographer. I say \"may be better\" because, for photos presented on photo.net, the photos taken with a digital camera are usually distinguishable and less desirable than photos recorded on film, to my eye. However, this may result more from average years of experience in the two crowds than the camera.\nBas Scheffers , April 24, 2003; 11:38 A.M.\nGreat article. I often think of comparing digital and film to comparing CDs and LPs. CD wins on numbers but some people prefer the sound of LPs. The same is true with digital compared to 35mm where I find the \"feel\" of films like Velvia and Provia very pleasing.\nThat is not to say that digital isn't very good, I would switch to a 10D in a second if it made financial sense. But the camera + cards + very wide angle lens + other accesoiries will cost me 300+ films to earn back and shooting only 50 rolls or so a year, this would take me 6 years to earn back. Darn.\nMatt Carter , April 24, 2003; 01:22 P.M.\nGreat article, but I would like to point out that while comparing the sharpness of digital vs film isn't exactly apples vs oranges, it's at least tangerines vs oranges. So in some ways these comparisons aren't important. Too many people are too obsessive about the digital vs film debate (and shapness in general).\nDigital will probably take the market for non-art applications. Eventually it will be sharper/easier/quicker/cheaper than film for just about everything. But it will probably never have the \"chi\" for artistic work that traditional processes have. Even if it's in the form of \"negatives\" made from digital images, the printmaking process will always be around, if only as an art form. People are still making tintypes and using wet plates.\nFor example,the \"sharpness\" of an email I type is way better than my horrible cursive, but if I'm writing a love note, it's going to be in my sloppy writing. And even when digital has a much higher resolution than film, I'm still going to be taking pictures of art-decco buildings with my vintage TLR on Tri-X and printing on fibre, because that's the look/feel I want.\nToo many photographers get caught up in the technology and forget about the art.\nIlkka Nissila\n, April 24, 2003; 02:46 P.M.\nBob, I'm using the pro version, with 512 MB RAM. My best guess is that Neatimage uses Wiener filtering and that's a linear operation, which Pentium IV with RIMMs does very fast indeed with the appropriate programming.\nI didn't notice any significant difference in the processing time by the demo vs. the pro version.\nIt's interesting to see the photomicrograph. The difference is quite clear. I'm also scanning at 4000 dpi and I'm happy with the results when the slide is properly focused (especially since I don't want to deal with larger than 120 MB files in photoshop!). Still, 4000 dpi is enough to see significant differences in image quality between lenses.\nJoel Benford , April 25, 2003; 06:57 A.M.\nBob, I recently went from the free version of NeatImage to the pro version. The pro version takes about half the time to process an image. This is consistent over colour digicam images at a range of ISOs and also B&W film scans (XP2 and N1600). Several other folks have made the same observation.\nGood article, well thought out. Thanks,\nBorek Lupomesky , April 25, 2003; 09:38 A.M.\nI noticed the white halos around contrasty edges on 10D test images. Where they come from?\nRaivo Vanags , April 25, 2003; 10:05 A.M.\nHas anybody tested Canon 17-40 f/4L on 10D here? I'm confused as I was thinking about buying one but have seen some not so good comments about it and people saying that in fact Sigma 15-30 is better? 16-35 is out of my reach for now but used 17-35 could be an option (but t's focusing distance is twice of 17-40...).\nBest,\nIlkka Nissila\n, April 25, 2003; 02:04 P.M.\nThe white surroundings to black lines are the result of edge contrast enhancement, ie. a sharpening filter operation. Due to the low noise in digital captures, you can apply it quite freely without the increase in grain that film images show (I assume the camera does it automatically to some extent). Of course, if you first run Neatimage, then you can use wild sharpening on film scans as well. Still I often prefer the original version with grain and no sharpening at A4 size, larger is another matter.\nOn my machine, processing the same file with demo 2.2 vs. pro 2.3 takes exactly the same time.\nMishkin Mishkin , April 25, 2003; 06:30 P.M.\nAnother positive aspect of having better lenses: pixels will inevitably get smaller, and you won't need to buy new lenses to match the increased sensor resolution. Buy quality optics once and use it all your life.\nJose Roberto Wagner , April 25, 2003; 10:08 P.M.\nI think two hours is too much. Something must be wrong with the computer. In my PC, Neatimage Home Edition v 2.3 takes 8 minutes to process a 3976 x 2651 pixels image. 1.4MHZ Athlon - 512 MB RAM - 120 Gb HD in RAID.\nRegards,\nBob Atkins\n, April 26, 2003; 12:34 A.M.\nThe \"problem\" appears to be that Neatimage is optimized for the Pentium instruction set and my machine has an AMD K6 CPU. The FPU in the K6 is known to be slower than the Pentium FPU when the code is optimized for the Pentium. I actually get FASTER processing using a SLOWER Pentium II. With a 330 MHz Pentium II it takes about 40 minutes to process a 4000dpi scan of a 35mm slide. On a small test, the 330 MHz Pentium II was 30% faster than my 550MHz K6. Perhaps my 2 hour processing was on a particularly difficult scan. I'll run the test again.\nWhatever the cause, a PC upgrade wouldn't hurt!\n, April 26, 2003; 12:58 A.M.\nGreat article, Bob! And thanks for all your recent effort to make Photo.net interesting again!\nWell, I will agree with Bob totally if the monitor is the ultimate output medium. But bear in mind that monitors and prints will give u variation in colour.\nWith slides, u are seeing the 'true' or 'master' colour for other output medium to follow. And your image will appear more vibrant on a light box compared to a monitor screen.\nBob Atkins\n, April 26, 2003; 01:08 P.M.\nTrue, but then viewing slides on a light box isn't the normal final use of slides. If it is, then there's no contest. A slide under a high quality 6x loupe on a light box blows away any monitor screen image.\nAs for color, well, that's another issue. While a slide may give you a \"master\" image, it's not an absolute color reference. Shoot the exact same scene on Kodachrome 64, Velvia, Astia and 100VS, then tell me which slide is the \"master\" slide when it comes to color reference!\nWee Keng_Hor\n, April 26, 2003; 07:36 P.M.\nJust a side note on image projection because slide shooters enjoy giving slide show: I know that there are some high end projectors for computers / laptops.Do these projected image provides better resoluton than the computer screen? And how do they compare to the images from a slide projector?\nOskar Ojala , April 28, 2003; 02:25 A.M.\nMore on NeatImage...\nA quick test between an 1.5 GHz Athlon with DDR333 memory and an older, 450 MHz Celeron with SDR100 memory gave running times of 10 min. for the Athlon, 40 min. for the Celeron (the image used was a crop from a scanned 6x6 neg, the amount of pixels processed was higher than a 4000 dpi scan gets from a 24x36 mm frame). This was using NeatImage demo. Memory size doesn't seem to matter as long as the program fits in memory (for winNT4 256 MB was enough, while winXP wanted over 400 MB for this image).\nSo I think that a fast CPU (Athlon or Pentium 4) with fast memory are the keys to good NeatImage performance (incidentally, these two help photoshop performance too.)\nBill O'Neill , April 28, 2003; 09:03 A.M.\nBob and Ilkka,\nOn the performance of NeatImage on PCs. There are many factors contributing the performance of a particular piece of software on a particular machine, not just CPU speed. A few of these have been mentioned, such as type and speed of memory and the way a particular processor configures its pipeline for certain instruction groups. However, there are many other contributing factors as well. Such things as the chipset used on the motherboard, the operating system, the disk drives and the disk controller, other interfaces and their drivers and, in fact, how all these operate together in various combinations. Much like with photography the best way to decide on the right computer is to try it out. Just like with photography though, this is difficult to do. There are not a lot of computer shops that will allow you to install Photoshop on their systems and do some benchmarking. There are a few though. In the new digital age it seems that building the right relationships is still as important as ever.\nVsevolod Krishchenko , April 28, 2003; 01:43 P.M.\n.. and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 are all good lenses\nI don't own this lens but have 24-85 and it is not good - very soft at 85 mm, distortion at 24mm, average sharpness between them. Yes, it is light and inexpensive, but no good in terms of optical quality.\nAcccording to photozone 28-105 is not better than 24-85 and all tests I saw online said that 28-105 is just an average consumer soom like 24-85 or 28-135 are. Still from time to time I hear the myth that 28-105, 28-135 and 24-85 are good (not cheap nor light but *good*!). Quite strange.\nBrian Sledz , April 29, 2003; 07:17 A.M.\nBob, Great article and thanks for pointing out the Canon 10D actually has more density than many hgher MP cameras. In one of the sections you showed the 70-200 at 187mm to show a similar FOV for the 10D and film, since there really is no magnification factor, only really a cropping due to the smaller sensor of the ccd, aren't the left and rightmost images comparing the slide and 10D the most valid? thank you again for this and other articles Brian\nIlkka Nissila\n, April 30, 2003; 07:57 P.M.\nPeter, it's quite clear from Bob's images that the 10D cannot match the resolution of film if the reduced field is compensated by increased magnification to yield a print of the same size. (Compare the middle and right images.) It also indicates that if the pixel density of the 10D is retained, a full-frame digital body would show significantly better results than K25.\nAnantha Narayan , May 02, 2003; 12:15 A.M.\nThere is no comparison. Rather there shouldn\u0092t be. Just because you can print Digital pictures or just because you can scan film doesn\u0092t mean you compare them both. The reasons are, that their purposes are different. The evolution of technology has given us the flexibility to use different mediums in realization and storage of pictures. First choose this medium of presentation, and then choose the technology to capture it. We sometimes get lost in the obvious and go in search of the oblivious. If you print a digital picture and compare it with a film print - of course film print is better. If you scan film and compare it with a Digital shot - of course Digital is better. When what you want is the best, why compromise to compare which is better than what?\nWhat is important is to understand the \"cost\" of convergence. The problem with that is \u0093we need to have the cake and eat it too\u0094! So how do you solve the problem? Get 2 cakes! Eat one and keep one. Get 2 cameras - one film and one digital (when you can carry some 10 lenses - can't you carry one extra tiny camera?). Yes, no kidding - its cheaper and better. Before we play the pixel game - Lets ask ourselves a question - What is the final size of your digital picture? And at what resolution? And what is the size of the monitor and its pitch that you or your friend might use, to see it? Then ask the question, \"So how much resolution is that?\" - You will end up with an answer that that will lead you to conclude that a tiny digital camera less than $400 is worth its while. Do all else later - thanks to Photoshop. And, don\u0092t throw that 'ol 35 mm away - its still got some shows left when you want to print.\nWake up world!! Photography is art. It\u0092s all about capturing the moment, the mood, and the very essence of time, that lets us reflect and document the past. Remember technology is just an enabler - it\u0092s just the means to get there. Not the end in itself. So don\u0092t go talking to your friends about your new 5MP - 20MP camera. Talk to them about the mood you captured - that lovely girl with a curl, that awesome shot at the ball game etc. Spend time, capturing time - so you can share a thought, or re-live a moment. That is what photography is all about.\nbrian jackson , May 03, 2003; 04:10 P.M.\nFirst off, nice article.\nJust to let everyone know, but I had a client order a 20x30 print from a recent event. I shoot with the EOS 1D(4.13MP, but larger sensor :-). A little color correction, dust spotting and very minor unsharp mask, set it to my lab(whcc.com) and WOW, this print looks amazing. BTW, this was a full frame in-camera large JPEG shot taken with a very nice f/2.8 L lens and 1.4X TC.\nThis was the largest print I've ever made. Largest digital prints before were a few 18x24's and 16x20 from some Fuji 200 color neg scanned with a SprintScan 4000, same lab as above. Largest print from neg (Fuji Reala 100) was a 16x20 from a local pro lab. I'm going to have to say that the 20x30 was the nicest large print. Don't get me wrong, the others were great as well, two are hanging on my living room wall and the others were sold to clients. Ironically all of these shots were full frame, so that helps.\nBob- Do they still make Tech Pan 32? I haven't seen it in years :)\nJawed Ashraf , May 04, 2003; 09:10 A.M.\nhttp://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos1ds/page20.asp\nOn this page are presented two photos:\n1. Canon EOS 1DS 11MP\n2. Canon EOS D60 6MP\ntaken of the same scene, minutes apart, with controlled: exposure; focus; framing; BUT shot at different focal lengths (due to the 35mm-format crop factor in the D60) and using JPEG Large/Fine file format.\nDownload both pictures (due to copyright restrictions I will not present crops from these two pictures here).\nResize the 11MP 1DS picture to 3078x2048 (the D60 image is 3072x2048).\nCompare the two pictures.\nUnfortunately the picture is made up mostly of large areas of no detail. But there's some fine detail on the bottle labels, the apple and the watch face.\nA good area to compare is the \"yellow\" side of the apple and where it meets the Baileys bottle, specifically the text \"(Bail)ey & Co., Nangor Road\", and the rural scene on the label. Another good area is the Martini bottle's main label (which is arguably in critical focus with both cameras).\nIn my opinion there are three reasons for differences in detail:\n1. different focus plane/depth of field, and the fact that the camera was in slightly different positions when the two pictures were taken (parallax differences can be observed)\n2. bayer sensors lose approximately 45% of the nominal pixel count of the picture, through the bayer process, i.e. a 6.3MP bayer picture is approximately equivalent to a 3.4MP full-colour-pixel picture.\n3. noise reduction by the D60 smears low-contrast and low luminosity detail.\nYou can test 2. by resizing the 1DS image in Photoshop:\na. size to 2278x1516\nb. size to 3077x2048 (1 pixel of width lost in rounding)\n(Both resize operations using bicubic resampling.)\nAnyone prepared to post a more tightly controlled comparison?\nThere is a real side effect of the \"lost\" resolution that bayer sensors incur. The approximately 45% pixel-count resolution-loss in a bayer sensor is approximately a 25% loss in linear resolution. In stating this, I'm ignoring the results that a comparison of resolution test charts produces (about a 23% loss, approximately a 4.8MP picture), since digital cameras' interpolation algorithms are usually optimised for these charts. Real world detail is not normally black and white...\nSimply put, this means that you need a lens with an excess 33% linear resolution to achieve the desired resolution of your digital camera's sensor.\nOr, in other words, to achieve the 67lp/mm that the 10D's pixel-pitch implies, requires a lens capable of 90lp/mm.\nIf you're shooting a resolution test target with a Canon DSLR then I estimate an extra 14% linear resolution is required, i.e. a lens capable of 76lp/mm on the D60.\nOf course, if you're using a camera with a Foveon-type sensor, there is no appreciable resolution loss caused by the sensor's colour-interpolation (since there is no colour-interpolation). So, a 67lp/mm lens on this camera is approximately equivalent in resolution to a 90lp/mm lens on a 6.3MP bayer sensor camera.\nAccording to (let's hope I've got the right lens...):\nhttp://www.photodo.com/prod/lens/detail/CaEF28-70_28LUSM-64.shtml\nthe lens used to make these two pictures has a weighted MTF of approximately 81 for the 1DS picture's focal length of 70mm, and approximately 83 for the D60 picture's focal length of 43mm.\nThis would imply that the lens is limiting the D60 in this test.\nFor comparison, the 1DS pixel pitch implies a native 57lp/mm, which requires the lens to be capable of 76lp/mm, which it just achieves.\nOf course, all of this is ultimately theory - more tests needed!\nLandrum Kelly\n, May 05, 2003; 01:00 A.M.\nBob, do this again in two years. (Anybody want to place any bets on the outcome?) There are a lot of new people coming along who are asking not only \"What should I buy?\" but also \"What should I be learning?\" The time invested in digital processing is going to give increasing returns. That invested in film processing is likely to give diminishing returns, at least at the 35mm level. All bets are still off at MF and LF for now, but look down the road--and not necessarily too far down the road. Film will perhaps always be around, but it is going to be increasingly inconvenient, and probably increasingly expensive, and pretty soon that increasing expense will be very difficult to justify on any grounds, artistic or otherwise.\nIlkka Nissila\n, May 05, 2003; 03:45 P.M.\nTime spent on learning photography should be spent on learning your subject matter and to use the visual language, not on \"film processing\" or some such silly thing. That's done by the lab you know. Even when shooting film, you use photoshop to do what you'd do with digital captures so the difference is just the image capture medium. To me, it's absurd to move to a new technology before it's mature & stable enough. The time for some people has come, but many things that I'm used to shooting would require a prohibitative investment in equipment to do in digital at this point. Yet in three years things will have changed. That doesn't mean that I won't shoot film. I probably will. I'm in no hurry - I have a working technique for doing what I like and need to do.\n, May 06, 2003; 10:40 P.M.\nJawed\nJust about any lens not made of plastic will easiliy resolve 100 lp/mm at f8. In fact most lenses will resolve closer to the theoretical limit of 200 lp/mm in the center of the frame. The reason they don't put that on film is that film isn't very good!\nSo resolution is very much sensor limited rather than lens limited.\nActually it's the MTF near the resolution limit of the sensor that counts when it comes to image quality near the resolution limit, but that gets us into a whole other area.\nTheoretical analysis is fine (if you get it right), but it's no substitute for doing the actual tests!\nIlkka Nissila\n, May 07, 2003; 10:44 A.M.\nBut as you decrease the pixel dimensions, the signal-to-noise ratio goes down quickly. If we want to retain high-ISO operation (many people do, including wildlife photographers!), the current pixel density is likely to stay. Of course, they may make higher resolution sensors for landscape and studio applications, but those will likely have a low volume & remain very expensive.\n, May 13, 2003; 12:57 A.M.\nReally well prepared article. It has high value for instructional purposes.\nThere's seems to be one area which I was hoping this article would talk about: can DSLRs capture enough dMax for B+W images to rival scans from B+W negatives.\n, May 18, 2003; 05:52 A.M.\nBlah blah...\nMagnus Back , May 24, 2003; 02:52 A.M.\nThe scanned Kodachrome is nowhere near the result I get with my \"standard\" slide film Provia scanned with a Nikon LS-4000.\nI think that by choosing a slightly better film than the Kodachrome and a better scanner than the Canon the difference will be much bigger than suggested in this article.\nThe DSLR still lags in the areas colour correctness, contrast and resolution. (But the gap is closing fast).\nMy Canon Digital IXY S-400 is amazing!\n///Magnus\nRobert Monaghan , May 26, 2003; 10:43 P.M.\nGosh, Bob, where to start? You equate 67 pixels/mm to 67 lpmm. But it takes two sensors or pixels to image a line, one for the black dots, one for the white space. So 67 pixels/mm is at best 34 lpmm resolution on the DSLR. Similarly, if the FS4000 scanner is 78 pixels/mm, it is equivalent to ~39 lpmm (not 78 lpmm). So your calculations and comparisons and conclusions are based on wrong and inflated digital resolution numbers, right? Here are the simple facts: Kodak has estimated that 35mm mid-speed films are equivalent to roughly a 24 Megapixel sensor. Pop. Photo's lab tests suggested real world values of 40 megapixels for 35mm films in their tests. Fine grain films like Kodachrome 25 have much higher resolution, and should score above 100 MP equivalent. An AFIP researcher's peer reviewed paper determined one fine grain 35mm film as being 124.76 MP equivalent.\nSo any consumer or amateur \"tests\" that conclude that a 6 MP DSLR equals 35mm film are simply wrong, based on these facts from film makers and lab tests. Kodak etc. are right, and you-all are wrong ;-)\nThe only thing you are \"testing\" is your scanner and your technique. Your scanner is acting as a ~40 lpmm low pass filter, blocking all high frequency image data from film. You concluded that K25 roughly equaled a 6 MP DSLR image. But Kodachrome 25 is more like a 100+ MP equivalent sensor, per above sources.\nSo you have lost 94%+ of the image quality of film in your scanning process (from 100+ MP to 6 MP), right? This is equivalent to taking a 6 MP DSLR image and downsizing it to 640x480 pixel webcam image size (also ~94% loss). That's a pretty big error! It is also the same 16X factor by which kodachrome 25 is superior in resolution etc. to a 6 MP DSLR ;-)\nLet's move on to why digital cameras can't use the full high resolution and fine contrast response of even so-so 35mm lenses. Due to anti-aliasing needs, DSLRs have a low pass filter between the lens and the sensor. This low pass filter limits the high frequency data seen by the sensor to ~50-55 lpmm equivalent.\nSo right away, any claims of DSLRs imaging above 55 lpmm (i.e., 67 lpmm here) are problematic, right? On the other hand, lenses using velvia and other fine grain films and good technique can do much better than 50 lpmm. Velvia is rated at 160 lpmm (1000:1 contrast) and 80 lpmm (1.6:1 contrast). So fine grained film has hugely more megapixels at 100+MP equivalence than any prosumer 6 MP DSLR sensor.\nMost 35mm lenses can easily deliver 200 to 450+ lpmm aerial resolution (at least centrally to your 1.6X sensor). The low pass filter is going to reduce that to circa 55 lpmm and below before it gets to the DSLR digital sensor.\nThis is like two racing cars, one able to do 200 mph and the other 450 mph, but both are stuck behind a police car in a 55 mph zone. As long as the police car (low pass filter) is there, you aren't going to exceed 55 mph (55 lpmm), regardless of how fast either car is ;-)\nSimilarly, the sensor never sees the high frequency data from the lens, due to the low pass filter. So the sensor doesn't care if the lens is a really high resolution zeiss or leica optic delivering 450+ lpmm, or a so-so third party lens barely capable of delivering 200 lpmm aerial resolution. Both are delivering waaay more than the 50-55 lpmm limit imposed by the low pass filter. Everything above the low pass filter limit is chopped off and never seen by the sensor. So the high resolution and high contrast benefits of the pricey lenses are lost on the digital sensor, due to its 50-55 lpmm low pass filter limits, right?\nThe anti-aliasing low pass filter is the physical basis for the statement that high frequency response lenses (i.e., high resolution, high contrast) are NOT needed with digital sensors. Designers of digital lenses such as Schneider have noted this fact too. They have \"dumbed down\" their digital lens design resolution and contrast response to better match the digital sensor requirements, while improving other digital lens parameters that can make a visible difference. These factors include color fringing, as you noted, plus cost and distortion and flat image planes and so on.\nI was hoping that this would be a tutorial on those digital optics topics, and how they differ from film oriented lens designs. Instead, it was another erroneous effort to prove by amateur \"tests\" that a 6 MP DSLR is as good as fine grained Kodachrome 25 film. Kodak says that's wrong, and Kodak is right ;-)\nSimilarly, the low pass filter in DSLRs blocks high frequency data from the lens. So selecting a lens for its high resolution and fine contrast is wasted effort on current DSLRs with a 50-55 lpmm low pass filter limit. The lens resolution isn't the limiting factor here, it is the low pass filter.\nNote that I am not saying you won't see any differences between lenses. You may be able to see some DSLR image improvements from higher cost lenses which are better corrected for color fringing, distortion, flatness of field, and other parameters. But the major $$ spent on higher resolution and fine contrast response for film lenses is going to be blocked by the low pass filter.\nThat's why Schneider and others are designed a new generation of digital lenses, trading off high frequency response for improvements such as flatter field curvature and lowering lens aberrations which can and will make a visible improvement in DSLR image performance.\nThe flip side is that today's high dollar lenses, which have been optimized for high frequency response (i.e., high resolution and fine contrast) on film are a less than optimal match for current DSLR sensors. So don't expect that your lenses designed for film camera use will work as well as future digital lenses designed specifically for digital systems taking into account digital sensor limitations.\nA final point derives from the observation that even mid-speed 35mm film is at least 24 Megapixels equivalent or better, per Kodak. I have to assume that scanners will get even better, given that they have a long way to go as I've shown above ;-) So today's film images may become tomorrow's 24 MP or 40 MP or even 100 MP images as scanner technology improves. Unfortunately, today's 6 MP image will always be a 6 MP image at best. So film offers higher quality today, and more benefits for future digital images as scanner quality improves.\nFor those who want to challenge my analysis, you have to start by explaining why Kodak, Pop Photo, AFIPs, and other sources have all derived megapixel equivalents for film much higher than 6 MP etc. You also have to explain why higher resolution or finer contrast lenses can make a noticeable difference despite that low pass filter in there. Amateur \"tests\", especially any using scanners with film, have a large burden of showing how you did not lose 75-95%+ of the film resolution data, as here, to reach any conclusions about today's DSLRs being as good as film ;-) grins bobm\nClaudio Coltro Coltro , May 29, 2003; 10:12 A.M.\nBob:\nYour article is very good, specially if you are determined to prove that for your case digital is better than film.\nAt least for me, the photographer's issue is the lens, their cost, their weigh, and the fact that the older one gets the worse it gets to hand hold them and lug them around. The logic of compromising on the camera body, which has the least impact on the photographic result whilst keeping your huge and expensive lenses, sound a bit strange to me. If you are happy with 11\"x8\" prints, I guess you could also use cheaper lenses than the beauties you own (300/4 L and the 400/4.5). Other combinations, film + 75-300mm vs digital + 300/4, could give similar results in the smaller prints you are happy with. The difference is that probably the second combination of equipment would be much easier to handle, carry around, and much cheaper.\nThanks for your article.\nJoseph Albert\n, June 13, 2003; 03:34 P.M.\nI think it is important to keep in mind that what matters is not whether a digital sensor can capture all the information on a low speed, high resolution transparency or negative, but whether an image captured by a digital sensor can produce a print that matches the quality of a print made from a transparency or negative.\nOnce you scan the film or enlarge it with an enlarging lens and print on some sort of paper, much lower resolutions are observed. The question then becomes, \"what resolution digital sensor is needed to make digital prints that rival a print made from a given piece of film whether the film is scanned and printed digitally or printed directly as an Ilfochrome, silver, or C print?\nI don't know the answer to this, but I'd be amazed if it were anything close to 100 megapixels. I'm guessing that around 20-25 megapixels will pretty much obsolete a 35mm SLR, and 40-50 megapixels will do in medium and large format cameras/backs. But it's just a guess.\nRyan Joseph , June 15, 2003; 12:48 P.M.\nHi everyone,\nThis article is ultimately very practical. People have brought up some very valid technical points about how Bob's test was \"unfair\". However, living in Jamaica, it is VERY expensive to get film drum scanned, anywhere for that matter. I look at this article from the point of a home viewer. I believe that film scanners do give film justice, however image quality is very subjective. In my opinion film still has some kick left in it, as I can vouch by the very high quality of the slides my FM2 produces. Borrow a good film camera, then a good digital. Shoot to your hearts content with both and then compare the results, choose the one you like. All this tecnical stuff I have read gives me a serious heaadache. We must remember however, digital IS advancing, but so is film. Kodak's new Ektachrome E100G film is an example of this with almost nonexistent grain and amazing resolution. It blows away anything I have seen digital produce, but I am sure in X amount of time after I have written this digital will up the ante again. Then again a new wonder film will come out. BTW, if you want ultimate print quality, nothing beats a cibrachrome print made from a slide.\nRobert SIlvers , June 17, 2003; 02:30 A.M.\nRobert Monaghan,\nBob does not need to explain why better lenses give better results on DSLRs even though there is an optical low-pass filter. He already explained that convolutions multiply MTFs and a better lens will always improve the result. In fact this is so obvious that I feel that Bob did not even need to mention it and give it so much space in his article. I feel that 35mm film is at best a 6000x4000 equiv. You could call that 24MP, but most cameras seem to count color matrix photosites, so perhaps it would take a 72mp camera to match film in resolution although the film would be really gritty at that point. But the EOS 1Ds does seem to produce great results without the problems of scanning, with the exception of highlight detail. But hey, slides also have bad highlights. Can I produce an image with slide film better than an EOS-1Ds? Of course, but it is mostly not worth it. I no longer have any interest in images that are not digital in the end. So with that being the case, scanning many images is too much trouble. I just shot 14 rolls of film and am scanning them at 4000dpi. It will take me over a week to scan them, even though I did not cut the negatives. I put in a roll, and wait 3 hours. Put in another, and then go to work, and put in another before bed. I am done with 35mm film. I still except to use 4x5 and maybe 6x9.\nPierre-Yves de Brito , June 26, 2003; 01:34 P.M.\nHi every one !\nabout the comparison between digital & film : why do every one compare them on the computer, after having the film scanned? If the final material is the print, why not take a good picture of a landscape with beautiful colors (a real pic, not a chart test pic...) with a DSLR, and a Film SLR (vith velvia for instance) at the same time (same light) with different focal lengths to have the same field of view on both supports, and then print your DSLR file onto a big print, print your velvia slide onto a reversible paper of the same size (cibachrome, fuji supergloss, etc..._am I right about the names?_) and compare them. For that matter, you can scan both prints with a good flatbed scanner. I would be very interested to see the results with this protocol (I don't have a DSLR, so I can't do it myself). What do you think about that?\nNorman Koren , July 04, 2003; 09:44 A.M.\nI'm addressing this response to Robert Monaghan, who maintains an excellent website on image sharpness, because it contains too many misconceptions to go unchallenged. Most readers who've compared EOS-10D images to the sharpest 35mm film images already realize that Bob M's comments don't add up.\nTo start out, the pixel spacing of the EOS-10D is 7.4 microns, or 135 pixels per mm. The Nyquist frequency -- the highest spatial frequency for meaningful data-- is therefore 67 line pairs per mm (lp/mm), not 34. The lowpass filter (lpf) in the sensor is designed to block most energy above this frequency, which could result in artifacts like Moire. Similarly, a 4000 dpi scanner operates at 157 pixels pixels per mm, for a Nyquist frequency of 78 lp/mm. Since a 35mm image is 1.6x larger than the 10D image, it has a simple pixel advantage of approximately 1.86. Digital cameras do as well as they do because film loses a lot of detail.\nNow as for the estimates by Kodak, Pop Photo and others that it takes between 24 and 100 megapixels for a DSLR to equal film, I want to see the exact references to I can analyze them-- examine their assumptions and reject them. Hearsay won't do! The 11 megapixel EOS-1Ds is a good reality check. I'd challenge anybody to produce better 35mm color images than the 1Ds. There are reasons why photographers use medium and large formats, and they have to do with the limitations of film.\nKodachrome 25 (discontinued) performance is in Kodak Technical Bulletin E-55 . The true indication of its sharpness is MTF -- Modulation Transfer Function-- contrast at a given spatial frequency relative to low frequencies. It is 50% at 43 lp/mm and 10% at 77 lp/mm. These numbers are good, but not extraordinary. Fujichrome Provia 100F has a 50% MTF frequency of 40 lp/mm. Other well-known slide films (Velvia, Ektachrome, etc.) are similar. Negative films, especially B&W, tend to be better. MTF curves are available at manufacturer's websites. They tell the story about real film resolution.\nThe ratings Bob M cites of 160 lpmm (1000:1 contrast) and 80 lpmm (1.6:1 contrast) have limited meaning, especially for 1000:1 contrast. They refer to \"resolution\" defined as just noticeable contrast difference-- at most 1.05:1 contrast on the film, maybe as low as 1.02:1. So Velvia at 80 lp/mm would have MTF of 0.05/0.6 = 8% MTF at 80 lp/mm. Velvia specs aren't on Fuji's website, but this is about right for Provia. The 1000:1 contrast may be of some interest to astronomers, but is of no value for terrestrial images. It corresponds to MTF of about 0.05/1000 = 0.005 percent. Any texture would be absolutely flattened at this spatial frequency!\nThe 200-450+ lp/mm aerial resolution of lenses is similarly impractical-- it's like rating a maximum car's speed in RPM. Sorry, but the rubber has to meet the road, and most lens manufacturers publish MTF charts. These charts typically display MTF percentage for for 40, 20, and 10 lp/mm. MTF at 40 lp/mm is considered to be an indication of lens sharpness. I admit I'd like to see MTF at higher resolutions. It's extremely low at 200+ lp/mm.\nBut the biggest issue is 4,000 dpi scanner performance. Bob M estimates that 4000 dpi scanners lose 75-95%+ of the film resolution data. I won't bore you with the details here-- it's on a web page -- but my analysis shows that 4000 dpi scanners can capture about 80% of the detail on film (linearly). That would be 64% area information. Not too bad. I welcome the new 5400 dpi Minolta 5400 scanner-- it will be a modest improvement. More importantly, I found that a print from a properly sharpened 4,000 dpi scan is slightly sharper than the best traditional darkroom print, which has to pass through an enlarging lens, and can't benefit from sharpening. I have a portfolio full of prints to prove this. I can easily fool people into thinking they're medium format.\nThe bottom line is what your eyes tell you, and my eyes tell me that the 10D is a damned fine camera. I can make 13x19 inch prints almost as sharp as my best 4,000 dpi scans (but grainless), and every bit as sharp as the best prints I made from 35mm in the traditional darkroom. I wish I could afford the 1Ds, but then I'd need a 24 inch Epson 7600 printer to take full advantage of it. One day... My thanks to Bob A for putting up this excellent page.\nPierre-Yves de Brito , July 04, 2003; 01:43 P.M.\nHi Norman! there is an issue when everyone tackles this matter : partiality. when someone has invested money in DSLR, he tends to prove to himself and the others that this medium is far better than film. And your word only adds to this certitude. you say at the end\n>>I can make 13x19 inch prints ALMOST as sharp as my best 4,000 dpi >>scans (but grainless),\n4000 dpi doesn't deliver the detail of film, this is obvious (the scan/photoscope comparison and your link describe it well)\nThe thing is that you all raise figures of MTF and lines/mm where we just want to see real comparisons of real scenes, under fair circumstances (that is the best way to print the 2 medium if the print is your final material)\nif the best way to print them for you is through a 4000 dpi scan, then you would do well better with a 5400 scan, etc...\nif you shoot film, you are not limited by the current scanner technology, you'll be able to scan it with a better scanner later on if you wish. If you shoot digital, you're limited by the current ccd/cmos technology, and your images are frozen.\nand remember that the best way to see a slide is with a projector, which is a completely other world (you won't contradict me on that point) and digital stays on screens and paper.\nbut I'm falling the other way, defending film against digital.\nI'd simply want to see real examples of texture (hair foliage far away, road textures, etc) taken on film and on DSLR (with different focal lengths to have the same field of view) to see the different rendition. An objective test would require to try honnestly to get the best result from both mediums.\nI don't want to be polemic on the subject, I'd like to know the pros and cons of each medium from objective minds, that's all.\nto conclude, let's take pictures with what we have, and enjoy it, there is no need to battle in line to convince everyone that the other medium is INFERIOR to the one we use. the 2 mediums are different, comparisons are interesting to know which one we prefer, if we want to change/when, but don't take this battlefield position, please.\npeace & love my friends ;-)) , and happy shooting above all !!\ncheers !\nPierre-Yves de Brito , July 04, 2003; 01:55 P.M.\nrequest to bob : could you put a sample of bark from the 2 sample pictures you have? it would be interesting to see their texture. Thanks!\nD.J. Wilkins , July 04, 2003; 08:22 P.M.\nThere are a number of sites that show \"real\" photo comparisons between film and digital --http://www.sphoto.com/techinfo/dslrvsfilm.htm is Steve Hoffmann's site with Canon 10D, 1Ds, and film comparisons. 1Ds blows away a Nikon Super Coolscan 4000 ED of Provia 100 ASA, and even the Canon 10D appears to match or exceed the film scans.\nI'm a Nikon user (since 1956, as well as a Linhof & Bronica user) and have a newly acquired D100 that is providing image quality I wouldn't have believed from 6 MP. I've been scanning film for years, at up to 4000 dpi, and the D100 is providing image quality pretty near the best scans I've done, and better than many scans. As Steve mentions on his site, with digital, there is one lens system to contribute distortion and aberrations, with scanning, there are two, not to mention possible film flatness problems both in-camera and in-scanner.\nNorman Koren's comments above are accurate as always (and his images, especially his large prints viewed in person, are testimony to his mastery of the medium). The comments by Bob Monaghan puzzle one for their lack of accuracy. One should check facts before attacking someone else's presentation. And finally, Bob Atkins is to be commended for his excellent presentation in this forum.\nPierre-Yves de Brito , July 07, 2003; 09:38 A.M.\nthanks for the link, very interesting. but it is a comparison between DSLRs and scanned film, not really between DSLR and film... ;-)\nD.J. Wilkins , July 10, 2003; 12:21 P.M.\nthanks for the link, very interesting. but it is a comparison between DSLRs and scanned film, not really between DSLR and film... ;-)\nSince I shut down my chemical darkroom several years ago, I won't be doing any comparisons between optical prints from film and DSLR prints in my own lab. I have some 11x14 and 16x20 optical prints that I made with my Durst L1000, CLS 450 colorhead, Schneider/and/Nikkor enlarging lenses from negatives made with my Linhof Kardan 4x5. They are very sharp. And I have made prints of the same negatives scanned last year, and printed at the same size using one of my inkjets. Note, the scanner is an Epson 2450, so the amount of image information I've scanned is less than possible with a really top-end scanner. And yet the scanned-film prints look better overall than the optical prints.\nUnless you use a magnifying glass to see the ink droplets, the inkjet prints look pretty much identical even on close inspection (actually, the color is better on the inkjet prints). From those tests I was convinced that a good inkjet print looks like a good optical print. And I was comparing a scan made using the Epson 2450 to a print made using a top enlarger with excellent optics.\nThis still doesn't address optical print versus DSLR. I've also made prints from my D100 enlarged to 12x18, and they look excellent. In fact, the lack of grain, and the purity of color, produce prints that look better than many of my enlargements from 35mm shot on Reala 100 and Supra 100. And those look really good.\nI have access to a couple of Noritsu printers (digital and optical), and plan to make some tests where I'll run prints on the same printer from film and compact flash (same image taken using the same lens) -- but this comparison still will use scanned film (which is what the digital Noritsu uses). I can also use the optical Noritsu to print the film-based images. Unfortunately, this wouldn't really show what a good optical print can look like since these automated printers use very diffuse light to limit effect of scratches (the digital Noritsu uses Digital ICE).\nMy advice would be to get a good Nikon or Canon 6 MP DSLR, shoot pictures, print them, share them, and enjoy them. After 40+ years of photography, including running a commercial business (photography and custom color printing), I'll never go back to a chem lab. I will continue to use film, especially in large format, but scan it. And I'll be shooting the vast majority of my work digitally.\nFrank Suchodolski , September 18, 2003; 12:36 P.M.\nI just wanted to add a comment about the 10 D, and digital in general. Right now I'm unsing a Canon EOS 33 wich is a fantastic camera. With Kodak Supra 100 and my EF 50 1,4 and EF 85 1,8 I got razor sharp and ultra fine grain prints made at my local Fuji Frontier lab. The 10 D seems to be a digital version of the EOS 33. The thing about digital that I like is that I can see the result right after I get home, no lab anymore, no cost for rolls, no waiting. I did read this whole thing about digital not beeing as good as film. So I wanted to know if the 10 D is good enough and downloaded some some original, unedited full size images from the web and gave them to my frontier lab to make prints. I just got them back. I am completete blown away! It's even better than in my wildest dreams!!! It's true, unedited shots look a bit soft on your screen, but that's because you can do all the sharpening later. I you take these \"soft\" pictures to the lab, the come out RAZOR SHARP! Belive me, the quality, is 10 times better than film! This is even more amazing if you know that the sensor of the 10 D is a lot smaller, so the pictures have to be enlarged more to get a print of the same size. And they look even better! The colors... everything. But the most important thing: The grain! There is NO GRAIN! Kodak Supra 100 had a little bit of grain, alsmost perfect. But it's such a low quality compared to the 10 D. You can stick your nose right on the print and you'll see no grain!!! Amazing. Now, I'll sell my EOS 33 and get the 10 D. I can't wait... what a quality...\nScott Robertson , October 29, 2004; 04:58 P.M.\nGreat article, Bob. I too have discovered that, since I began shooting with a 6 MPix DSLR, I have barely touched my film cameras. For my style of photography and printing and considering my workflow, the finished quality I get with digital is at least as good as what I used to get scanning slides.\nI occasionally do want ultra-high resolution for very large format prints, but lugging around a large format camera isn't very practical for me, and I can't really afford to have 4x5 transparencies drum scanned. So, I do what a number of other photographers are doing these days - I stitch a number of 6 Mpix frames together to make a huge final image. This really only works for static subjects, like landscapes, but these are what I used to use my 4x5 camera for anyway. A brief article on creating ultra high-resolution images via image stitching can be found on my web site.\nMark Phillips , November 05, 2004; 08:04 A.M.\nVery interesting Bob. From a repoduction point of view I would agree with you. Having spent the last 25 years of my life in prepress I can tell you that 2 years ago I wrote digital images off. I knew I could get a seriously better result from scanning a tranny than a digital image. Not so now!\nHow times have changed. If I want output an image say at A2 size, a good digital shot (maybe colour corrected in CMYK) will give just as good a result as a sharp 5x4 tranny......... if not better!\nOur company now only drum scans images that are a)supplied as tranny/print or b)needs to be output AO+. Most of our clients now supply digital images placed in their jobs. Not so good for us as we don't do as many scans as we used to but we can get through our workload much faster. As long as the photographer and designer know what they are doing, the printed job will be just as good as if we drum scanned the images. Let's face it, I can output an image on our epson 9500 plotter at A2 size that I shot on my pocket size Canon S50 and get just as good a result as a drum scan from a 2 1/4\" tranny. Why bother with film?\nI now swear by digital. I am indeed a convert, and things will only improve. If you are still a believer in film for hi-res reproductions it's time to open your eyes and smell the coffee. Digital imaging is here and film WILL BE GONE sooner than you think.\nDaniel Erwin , January 02, 2005; 11:39 P.M.\nI agree with the commenters who say the most meaningful comparison is to use actual prints (I have no desire to get a PhD in digital imaging...I'd rather put my energy into creating beautiful images that people want to display TYVM!). Bill Brandt once wrote the following about photography, \"It is the result which counts, no matter how it is achieved.\" Therefore, I think a more meaningful comparision is between scanned film and digital capture, because most magazines and calendar companies these days work with scanned transparencies, and a lot of larger display prints (e.g., corporate and govenment art from medium and large format film) is made this way too now rather than with the traditional enlarger.\nI'm coming from the perspective of a 35mm transparency shooter (Velvia 50 mostly) that I submit to magazines who turn the trannies over to their prepress houses for quality scanning (not always a drum scan unless necessary) for 300 dpi reproduction using CMYK offset printing (not a home inkjet printer). Currently I'm considering retaining my Canon 24-70 f/2.8L and 70-200 f/2.8L lenses and trading in my EOS 1V (that I initially bought to shoot sports action for magazines) for an 11MP 1Ds (since the 16.7 MP 1Ds MK II is financially out of my reach). However, of late I've really gotten into scenic images, and my goal is now to make prints up to 16x20 (and possibly 20x24 on occassion) as well as increase my calendar work. I know one top pro who routinely makes up to 30x40 gallery prints of sports action shots from his 1Ds and 300mm f/2.8 IS L prime (one of Canon's sharpest lenses), and they sell like hotcakes. However, Arizona Highways magazine doesn't accept digital capture at all, saying that output from an 11MP DSLR isn't sufficient for landscapes, which they opine is still the principal domain of 4x5 (although they will accept \"exceptional\" medium format and even 35mm trannies, though mostly of wildlife in the latter case).\nContrary to one reviewer above, I am one of those photogs who shoots all my static images with a tripod, cable release, f/8 or f/11 (to minimize image degradation from diffraction), a lens hood and MLU when appropriate, since it is necessary to wring every drop of resolution out of 35mm as possible since I'm competing with pros shooting 645 MF or 4x5 LF. In the alternative, I'm giving serious consideration to trading my Canon setup in for a 645MF system that would allow me to shoot scenics with 120 roll film now (again mostly Velvia 50 using every image acquisition optimizing technique above), and switch to a digital back later once the technology matures and prices come down from the stratosphere (6x7 SLRs are too heavy to drag into the field). I'm even thinking about getting a lightweight 4x5 view camera as a third alternative (and keeping the Canon system and upgrading it to digital later when prices come down to more reasonable levels).\nI think it is important to say that film and digital will probably always look \"different\", but this isn't necessarily a bad thing - who says that how the world looks as interpreted by the medium of Velvia 50 (around since 1989) is the end-all? What is of more concern to me is that while digital capture has definitely \"left the ground\", it is hardly a mature technology like film, so that in 5 years 11MP capture from a 1Ds may be what \"entry level\" DSLRs will be using (we can only hope :) Any thoughts on how to further approach making this decision would be most appreciated.\nJoe Ciccone , September 19, 2005; 03:14 P.M.\nwow..what a lot of noise. First off you have to judge using actual shots of the kind you usually take to see if you think film is better than digital.\nNow I had a brand new Nikon N75 and 3 inexpensive Nikon lenses. 50mm 1.8 28-80mm 3.3-5.6 G 70-300 4-5.6 G all brand new.\nI recently bought a D50 Body.\nI can't explain why BUT the stuff I am getting from the D50 is much much better that the film shots I was getting.\nCould it be the drugstore processing & scanning?\nI use the same CVS to make prints from my digital files?\nAnyway you just can't beat digital for so many reasons..BUT the main\n2 reasons are 1- you can see what you have imedicately and reshoot if necessary. and # 2- you can just keep shooting without fear of spending to much money on wasted shots....\nThere may be a place for 35mm film cameras, but I think that place might be along side a stack of 45rpm & 78rpm records and some 8 track tapes.\nEver hear the 'bo-zo's' that claim that the sound from the old records and amplifiers using vacuum tubes is better than solid state equiptment.....sure..sure...if you like scratches I guess?\nFelix M\u00fcller\n, January 24, 2006; 08:56 P.M.\nI have to say the 10D shoots are very sharp and detailled, wouldn't have thought. But there are three reasons why I still use a film camera.\nFirst: I hate that crop factor. I wish there were more lenses which are adapted to the smaller sensor sizes of digital cameras.\nSeccond: I don't want to view all my pictures on the computer. I like slide shows but for digital photographs you need a beamer or a really big TV. Both cost a lot of money.\nThird: For reprints I still need a lab. I could print out my favorit pictures at home but that costs more and the quality is not quite as good as the reprints from a lab.\nMichael Wang , February 28, 2006; 06:56 P.M.\nWow, this thread has lasted more than three years, and the debate of digital vs film is still raging on. For the folks who were converted to digital back in 2003, are you still using the same camera you had back then? Don't you think the best picture you took back in 2003 would look even better if you use today's DSLR? You won't have that problem with film, will you?\nGary Lee Grigsby\n, March 11, 2007; 12:45 A.M.\nI was 35mm in the sixties and only a fool would argue between DSLR and 35mmSLR. Each has its place and each has very good points for their use. However with CS2 a darkroom has become outdated and quality control is easier then it has ever been. Being able to dodge and burn in are things of the past with all of the adjustments that you can do with CS2 and now CS3 is coming. Printers are catching up in quality and having to put your picture where others can see them even 35mm has to do digital.\nJohn Sin , August 18, 2007; 12:06 P.M.\nDo anyone had experienced that to photo the color \"dark purple\" the digital cameras never take it right when seen on printed or on lcd screen, it appears washed out... no matter how you adjust the iso, white balance or shutter/aperture settings.... why?\nRene GM , February 22, 2009; 09:19 A.M.\nI don't understand your conclusion.

A page on u/w photography! It is interesting to see a 99 and 44/100 percent land photographer's view on this subject.\nThe fact of the matter remains that the lens is the most important part of u/w photography. The Nikonos V is a good camera, but with the standard 35mm lens it is useless. A good lens (at around $1600) is the 15mm wide angle.\nIf you are serious about getting good photos u/w, you will need a housed system. Yes, a Nikon F90s/N90x with an Ikelite/Subal/Nexus/or one of the many other housing manufacturers. This is a clear cut situation where yes, Nikon wins over Canon, although in Japan there are many housings for the Rebel G (New Kiss) body.\nWhereas all the serious land photographers are arguing about ballheads for their tripods, u/w photographers are debating the merits of synch cords for their strobes and dome ports for the housings. Come over to the uw-photo mailing list to see for yourself.\nFor the casual photographer, the best solution seems to be the Ikelite Aquashot 3e housing which accepts the Fuji Endeavor APS camera. Dave Read has an excellent resource page at http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~read/aquashot/aquashot.html and Ike of Ikelite frequently posts on uw-photo. His customer service is equalled by none.\nMost of us have enough problems with land photos as it is. My advice to would-be u/w photographers is this: Before you start trying to take photos underwater, make sure your buoyancy skills are near perfect. I have seen many divers crashing into the reef, destroying corals and trying to take photos while flailing around. Please become a good diver first before you start to compound the difficulty of your dives with carrying a camera around and trying to take pictures while hovering motionless over a reef.\nA good place to start would be by taking an introductory course such as the U/W photographer specialty or even a full week course on a liveaboard with a pro like Jim Church.\nSee you all underwater.\nQuang-Tuan Luong\n, September 07, 1998; 03:10 A.M.\nAs a novice diver I didn't find that staying alive (or even close to neutrally buoyant) was a big problem. However, I found that getting more than a few acceptable pictures per roll was one. In my case, I think it is because I was mostly trying to do wide-angle pics with a 15 lens on the Nikonos, and this is basically manual (the ttl didn't seem to expose properly a non-centered background) fill-in with part of the backlit (pictures taken looking down are usually less sucessful) subject at close-up distance. I am not sure this would be that easy even on the surface. Besides you have to estimate distances modified by water, orient the flash, and you can't pop out a flashmeter ! I am wondering if with a modern housed camera, af, and auto fill-in it is not much easier.\nDouglas Cummings , November 09, 1998; 01:08 A.M.\nLet me suggest that UW Photography requires such anal attention to equipment that a good idea is to buy from someone who actually knows the equipment: ABSea Photo ocean@primenet.com Next to LAX. This is not like getting an N90 w/ a 180mm and SB24.B&H will not help you here. I'm not an owner nor related to him.\nAlon Coppens , November 20, 1998; 07:49 P.M.\nI recently purchased a Minolta Vectis Zoom for kayaking. Sure it's a lot heavier than the disposables I've been using - it doesn't float so I can't just toss it to a friend - but I took it for granted that some genuine optics and a true zoom would improve my snapshots and maybe turn some into true photos. So far, I think the disposables actually have a slight edge in picture quality!\nTom Skiba , February 26, 1999; 01:29 P.M.\nA quick hint for setting up a Nikonos....mount the lens upside down....then rather than having to flip the camera completely over to read the scale and set the distance you can just look down onto the top of the lens and set it.....saves a couple of seconds and is alot less distracting to the u/w life than waving you system around in front of them...tom\nElaine Jobin , June 05, 1999; 04:35 P.M.\nUnderwater photography is completely different from land photography. There are no tripods (at least not usually), objects underwater are not where they appear to be or the size they appear to be, you work within limits of a tank of air and one roll of film per dive. To become proficient at underwater photography requires hundreds of underwater hours, good scuba skills, and usually a large investment in scuba trips, scuba gear, and photo gear. Avid underwater photographers usually start with a disposable camera or an inexpensive point and shoot of almost any variety - then they move up to either a Sea & Sea Motormarine or Nikonos V. The Nikonos V has for many years been the standard of the industry. Housed cameras are popular amoung serious photographers primarily because their close up and macro capabilities surpass the Nikonos V. I can't believe you could pooh pooh the Nikonos V simply because it has 'inconvenient controls'. With practice you learn to use them by feel, not by `flipping the camera over'. That camera is probably the standard of the indurstry and can do amazing things in the underwater environment. I am sure with time something higher tech will come along, but in the mean time, give the note to this camera that it deserves. I have seen many talented land photographers become talented underwater photographers in just a short period of time - once they master some basic scuba skills. The first choice of these individuals when they stop renting and start buying is almost always the Nikonos V.\nMichael Donis , June 30, 1999; 05:13 A.M.\nI've been a SCUBA instructor for just over 5 years now, diving for 9 years, while having an interest in photography all my life and I can tell you something about underwater photography -- it's not as easy as it looks. There are so many factors from natural light absorption, diffraction from particulate, lack of stability from current and not being able to rest on something without harming it (and possibly you!), restricted constraints from air to film on a given dive, and many more that a successful underwater photographer must overcome for just a few successful shots.\nOne thing that I feel is crucial is the photographer's diving skills. He/she/they must be comfortable in the water under a variety of conditions and positions before they can distract themselves by taking pictures. It still amazes me how my air consumption skyrockets as I try to line up shots. The most important skill for any diver is buoyancy control -- the ability to comfortably hold his depth in the water at a given depth (while rising and sinking a few inches as breathing occurs).\nI've done most of my southern diving in areas of current, including Cozumel, where you very often you don't get a second shot of something as you drift. One trick I found useful while coasting across the bottom at about 3 or more knots is to preset your focusing distance before hand. As you drift, you may be lucky to come around a coral head to find a barracuda or something else worth taking a snap in the range you just set. Very often, one shot is all you ever get. If you do get the chance to stop or slow down for a few shots, by all means, take three but if the current is pulling you along so stopping will tire you or harm the coral, try pre-setting your camera.\nAs for housing an AF for underwater photos, I don't believe that is possible due to light absorption properties of water. As reds and soon the yellows are absorbed in the first 5 to 10 feet of water, the camera's autofocus system will have difficulty focusing on anything. Even in macro ranges, there may not be enough light getting to the sensors to properly activate the AF system. Then, if the water is turbid, the AF gets even worse. Maybe someday\u0005\nPlease remember -- don't touch the coral, they are macroscopic organisms -- even \"lightly\" with your finger is like you being \"lightly touched\" with by with the weight of a small house.\nCharles Mackay , September 11, 1999; 11:24 A.M.\nI started serious photography under water, then moved topside. It's no easier dry.\nThe Nikonos V ended up as my main tool, with a 20mm UW Nikkor as I couldn't afford the 15mm, together with Ikelite 150 on TTL. I also used an OM2 in Ikelite housing, though less successfully and it was bulkier. The Ikelite housings are less costly than the fancy ones and work well.\nAquatica seems to make nice housings for Nikon / Canon -- if I were doing it over again, this plus a Nikon F3 with the big screen sportsfinder and 20mm lens would be a top choice. Forget AF as it is all wide angle or macro anyway, plus there are complex lighting problems as noted above.\nAll this stuff will leak if you are not super careful about O-rings, maintenance, washing in fresh H20, etc. It is expensive or impossible to fix once flooded. Count on losing stuff to occasional disaster.\nBeing a good diver with bouyancy control is very helpful. (Consider wearing wetsuit pants so your legs don't sink.) Gently lowering the whole camera rig off the side tethered to a line and picking it up after you enter the water is also handy, reverse the same procedure exiting the water. Just remember to haul it in after the dive ;-).\nDan Carey , September 14, 1999; 07:20 P.M.\nUnderwater photography isn't for everyone. However, lots of people really enjoy it as a hobby, artform or profession. Other's couldn't be bothered with all the equipment hassles and would rather spend their time looking at cool stuff. Nothing wrong with that, but eventually somebody asks, after a dive trip, \"what did you see?\" and then there is no substitute for photography. A Nik5 and 35mm lens? Many outstanding images have been created with less than that. Of course, a wide lens has lots of advantages underwater. The depth of field is really useful with a manual focus camera and getting close to the subject often results in better color rendition since water absorbs red light so much more quickly than the rest of the spectrum. How about a disposable camera in a housing? Nothing wrong with that. The Fuji Endeavor in an Ikelite housing is a great tool for U/W, without taking a second mortgage out on the ol' homested. A housed SLR? Nice, flexible system. Autofocus. A parallax-free viewfinder. All kinds of lenses at a fraction of what the few available Nikonos lenses cost. Complex and bulky, but attractive nonetheless.\nHowie Wong , September 30, 1999; 03:41 A.M.\nThere are basically only two types of underwater phtography worth investing time and money for. Firstly the amphibious camera of which only the Nikonos V and the sea and sea motor marine II approach giving acceptable results. The advantage or disadvantage is that both cameras are basically what you would call manual. You have to set the focus distance yourself, the aperture and onthe MMII the exposure. This is fine for those land based photographers who learned from the basics but not for those who jumped into the F5 arena and used P mode all the time (sad yuppies). Having said that the Nikonos V is the industry standard amphibious camera and NOTHING can beat its 15mm wide angle lens.(not even housed 15mm)However, macro shots with the Nik V are a bit of a pain as you can not tell if the subject is in focus or not. The next step is to use a housed SLR. Nikon dominates this arena 100 to 1 at least! There are a number of manufacturers who do do housings for canon (INON, Sea and Sea) but these generally are for the cheap machines such as the Kiss (rebel i believe in the US) which doesn;t even have auto-focus tracking. Try photographing a darting clown fish without this feature! The best housings on the market are Nexus, Subal, Aquatica, Inon and Sea and Sea. Don't even think about using an Ikelite housing. Yes, they are very cheap but they are rubbish. I don't know anyone who is happy with them. Most people end up with rubber bands strategically placed because the shutter is so hard to control! My solution to the myriad of housings is to have a F90X with 105mm macro or 60mmmacro housed in a Sea and Sea housing with a Nik V screwed on top with a 15mm lens. Thus i can take macro and wide angle on the same dive. It works a treat! Hope this is of interest.\nHerman Hiel , October 14, 1999; 07:58 A.M.\nBefore considering what equipment to use, I would suggest getting an u/w photography course. My girlfriend finally followed my suggestion and took the Padi u/w course; the quality of her pictures has improved dramatically; she now understand better the limitations of her gear and might refrain from taking a pic if she knows it won't turn out OK. The 100$ cost of the course is a small investment, considering the cost of all the pics one has to throw out ... For myself, although being an avid topside wildlife amateur, I prefer to enjoy the dives without having to worry about handling the gear. Maybe one day ...\nHan Liu , April 16, 2000; 01:54 A.M.\nThe Kodak one time use waterproof camera worked great on my scuba trip. We took the camera all the way down to 100 feet and it did not leak. However, it will not work below about 13 feet of water. It did not work when we were diving deep, but once after we went up about 13 feet it worked again. The camera is under twenty dollars. It's a very worthy investment on diving trips.\nKendall Gelner , April 26, 2000; 03:30 P.M.\nI just recently went on my first ocean dive (my forth open water dive ever) with an underwater camera, and I must first of all agree with the other comments that if you are new to diving you should wait until your buoyancy skills are under control before you take out a camera. I didn't do too badly, but the worst problem was a huge increase in air consumption that meant I was surfacing ten minutes before everyone else had to. The next few trips I take I'll stick to topside photos.\nHowever, I took an option that I have not seen mentioned here - I rented an underwater camera (in my case the Nikonos V). That's a wonderful choice if you just want to try underwater photography to see if you like it before you spend a LOT of money on equipment. In my case I didn't have many good pictures but I had a handful (out of seven rolls of film) that convinced me I will make the attempt again someday.\nYou can rent cameras from just about any SCUBA shop, in my case it was about $100 for a ten day rental.\nI have to agree with Philip in disliking the Nikonos V for having to adjust the aperture on the front of the camera so the shot would be properly focused. I think that slight errors in this department ended up making a few shots that would have been really wonderful turn out slightly fuzzy and thus disappointing. If you do rent a camera, try and rent one with some sort of autofocusing!\nAlso, be very attentive to the seals on the camera. I had no trouble with camera flooding over the course of four days diving, as I made sure to very carefully inspect and relubricate the o-rings on the camera every time I opened it up. It takes a lot of care to keep a camera healthy in deep water, so that might be something to think about before you buy or rent a camera - are you willing to put the kind of time you need to for proper equipment maintenance?\nwilliam Reese , October 04, 2000; 11:33 A.M.\nHELLO UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHERS,\nI am quite sure that there are many ways to approach U/W photography and mine is but one. I have about 25 years experience with this and have recently made it my No. 1 professional pursuit. My work has been feted by Dr. Sylvia Earle and I have recently been awarded one of the Juror's awards in the prestigious Ellipse Gallery Photo Show in Arlington, VA. I believe that my success is based on several factors as listed below:\n1) Take lots of photos. Dive all day. dive into the night. Fight off that urge to quaff a beer when the sun sets and wait for the most spectacular creatures to emerge from their dens. Lighting is also easier after pesky surface light is gone.\n2) Dont give up. It takes a while to figure out what your doing.\n3) Always take a spare everything. U/W stuff breaks, leaks and corrodes. You will always need a backup especially if you are a long way from civilization.\n4) Go to the really great dive locations. Although this is an aspect of how much money you have, it really is worth it. Nothing is more boring than a picture of a rock.\nHappy hunting\nImage Attachment: IMG0015.gif\nKarsten Moran , November 05, 2000; 06:10 P.M.\nI read this page about two years ago for the first time, having forver been excited by the possibility of taking photographs underwater. If there is anything I could offer to supplement this, I'd say that everyone has their preferences and their pocketbooks. I settled for an Ikelite underwater camera housing w/100a substrobe. I took it underwater for the first time in Tulamben, Bali, Indonesia. The visibility was poor, and there was a rough surge on the black stone beach. I loaded two rolls of E100VS, one roll of Ektapress, one roll of Ilford Delta 400, and one roll of EBX100 on our four dives and one snorkelling excursion. I maxed out at around 100 feet off of the wall, did the wreck in the day and at night, and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. The manual control I had and versitality of the lenses and filters of a full-range SLR system, made the N70 and ikelite housing the perfect choice. I used a sigma zoom 28-80mm with +4 filter and sigma 80mm 1:2 macro with +7 filter. After I got the hang of the system, positioning of the strobe, and boyouncy control (the housing is already nearly neutral so not much problem there), I let loose. The only real problems I encountered were with exiting the water on the night dive onto the beach over the stone beach, in the surge. The housing and strobe are large enough that they throw you off balance out of water. I managed to thoroughly slice up my legs and arms, and get a nasty gash accorss my stobe. Luckily the thing is built like a tank and it still works perfectly. I got my slides and prints developed the next week. I was very happy with the results. Follow URL to photo from first dive. I got some more successful ones later, and am ever improving with time, but I figure this is a pretty good score for a first camera/dive.\nURL:http://www.photo.net/photodb/photo.tcl?photo_id=82739\nIt's a bad scan, the actual image is sharper than it appears here.\nAnyway, thanks Phil, and always take size and weight out of water into consideration. The nikonos sure wins over there, though I'd still stick with a housing aby day.\nKen Byrne , November 22, 2000; 12:20 P.M.\nI've been into photography for 22 years, diving for around 18 years and into underwater photography for the last 4 years. I was happy with F stops and shutter speeds and totally at ease underwater. Underwater photography was going to be a breeze. Image my surprise when my bouyancy control went to pieces and my air consumption doubled. After a couple of dives I started to relax and now I feel uncomfortable diving without a camera.\nI started with a Nik V and it is a great camera but it does require extension tubes , a close up kit or a wide angle lens to get the best out of it. With macro kit focus is fixed and set before you get in the water, you can pre aim the strobe as well. This is definitely the best way to get some good shots in the bag when you are first starting out. The disadvantage is that you use a framer, a set of goal posts that your subject has to sit in. Most fish are just not happy with this set up. With a wide angle lens lighting is much more difficult but the depth of field is huge so again accurate focussing isn't a huge problem.\nI've now moved on to a Nikon F60 in an Ikelite housing. I've seen it suggested in this forum that AF will not work underwater. Sorry but it works a treat on most subjects. It does struggle with low contrast subjects in murky waters but even here in the UK it's rare that I can't get it to focus. I've also read a post that states that the Ike housing is no good. I have to disagree. I'm sure it's not the slickest housing to use but it does the job. The shutter release is spot on and the ports are as good as any others I've seen. I'm quite pleased to have saved money on the housing to spend on extra ports and lenses.\nHow does the housed camera compare to the trusty Nik V. For macro work it's superb. I am not stuck with one magnification, selected before getting in the water and I've no framer to scare the fish. For wide angle it's closer to call but through the lens viewing wins the day in my book. You also have the capability to use zoom lenses with the housed camera.\nKen Aaron , January 14, 2001; 02:02 A.M.\nI just wanted to give my 2 cents worth about a previous equipment comment (you all have covered the bigger issues very well!). A previous comment about autofocus systems within a housing just isn't true. Autofocus works extremely well underwater. Color absorption has nothing to do with the autofocus system, it focuses based on contrast. I've been doing u/w photography for about 8 years and have had a housing for my N90s for 3+years. The only time I've had problems with the autofocus was when it was just too dark (can and does happen on dry land) AND I did not have my spotting light mounted on my housing. The spotting light is a flashlight which allows you to see your subject in less than ideal lighting conditions and also provides enough light for autofocus to work. At night I use it as my dive light. During daylight hours I estimate that I've had to use the spotting light maybe 5% of the time.\nJust wanted to clear this up.\nBob Benzinger , May 25, 2001; 09:41 P.M.\nA few points that haven't yet been covered, or could use some clarification:\nHoused Cameras: Focusing a housed camera is completely different depending on whether you are using a dome port or a flat port. A flat port reduces the included angle of the lens, but focuses just like a regular lens. A 35mm lens is more or less equivalent to a 50, etc. Most u/w photographers use a flat port ONLY for macro work. A dome port, on the other hand, does not affect the included angle of the lens, i.e. a 20mm lens under a dome port covers the same 94 degrees or whatever that it does on land. HOWEVER, the lens focuses not on the subject, but on a \"virtual image\" projected on the dome port. The virtual image is much closer than the real image, so you are using the close focusing capabilities of the lens even if the subject is a hundred feet away (not that you are likely to get a picture at that distance anyway). So, to use a dome port you need a lens with excellent close focusing capabilities, or a screw-in closeup lens, or an extension tube. Many underwater photographers like the 24mm Nikkor because of its excellent sharpness at extremely close focus. BTW, depth of field is very high with a dome port, you hardly ever have to refocus the virtual image. I used to use a 24mm on a Nikon FE inside an old compact Tussey housing and was quite pleased with the handling and the results.\nStrobes and backscatter: Perhaps the biggest problem in using a strobe underwater is backscatter, the reflection of light off tiny particles suspended in the water. This problem is at its worst if the axis of the strobe is close to the lens, just like redeye above water. The solution is to move the strobe at least two feet from the axis of the lens and at a fairly sharp angle, e.g. aiming down and from the side at the subject. This is why advanced u/w photographers are seen with rigs that look like a spider crab. Some photographers don't even bother attaching the strobe to the camera (except for the synch cable). They just handhold the strobe on a long arm.\nThis is getting long, I think I will cover a couple of other issues in another post.\nBob Benzinger , May 25, 2001; 10:31 P.M.\nA few points on the Nikonos:\nYou don't need a housing to get professional results. Lots of pros use the Nikonos for most of their underwater shooting. The 20mm lens will get you lots of good wideangle shots. The 15 is better, but if you can't afford it, don't sweat it. The 28 is useful for longer shots of medium-sized fish. Forget the 35mm lens except with the closeup kit or macro tubes. It is, however, handy for rafting, kayaking, skiing, etc. There is also an above-water-only 28mm that is no longer made. The Nikonos shines for macro and closeup work where you can set up a fixed focus, aperture, and strobe power.\nModels of the Nikonos:\nNikonos V: This is the current model. Having been around since the 1980's, it is the only Nikonos many newer divers and photographers have ever seen. It is not, however, the only option.\nAdvantages: Auto exposure. TTL flash. Bigger viewfinder than older models. Better sealing than the Nikonos IV (but not as good as the Nikonos III). Slightly faster flash synch speed than Nikonos III. Conventional loading and handling, i.e. you don't have to take it apart to load it.\nDisadvantages: If it leaks, you have a very expensive paperweight - and every underwater photographer floods a camera sooner or later. Most flooded Nikonos V's blow out the electronics beyond repair. I got a couple of milliliters of water in one once and it was gone. Nikonos guru Bob Warkentin makes desk pen sets out of flooded Nikonos V's - and he makes a lot of them. Another minor disadvantage is that you can't mount the old version of the 15mm on a Nikonos V - the rear element interferes with the TTL exposure sensor. This really isn't much of an issue anymore - if you're enough of a dinosaur to use an old-style 15, you've probably got several Nikonos III bodies to put it on!\nNikonos IV: A transitional model, with flip-open back, autoexposure, no manual shutter speeds, and no TTL flash. I cannot imagine why anyone would use this POS except for snorkeling. The sealing is terrible - in an effort to make it easier to load than the early versions, Nikon used a gasket on the back rather than a true compression-type O-ring seal. It is flood-prone, and of course a flood will fry the electronics just like a V. The SB-101 autoflash, an underpowered unit with an external sensor, is if anything even more useless than the camera. This is the Nikkorex of underwater cameras.\nNikonos III: I own six of them, vs. one Nikonos V, so that tells you my opinion. This ancient mariner is all mechanical, all manual and built like a tank. It demands operator skill, not least to load it since you have to take it apart in three pieces. If it is properly maintained and inspected it is the least likely of ALL underwater cameras to flood, and even more important, you can recover from a flood in the field! I once flooded a Nikonos III on an exploratory expedition aboard the old Pacific Nomad in an obscure part of Fiji. I took it apart, cleaned off the back of the lens, and put the rest of the camera in a bucket of clean fresh water. Then I went diving with my other camera. When I got back from the next dive, I took it out of the water, blew it out with an air hose, and put it in the engine room overnight so the heat would dry it out. The next morning I loaded it with film and went diving. It stayed dry and functional for the rest of the trip. I sent it in for overhaul after the trip; I still have the camera and it still works. Try that with your auto-everything wonder!\nThe Nikonos III has a few disadvantages: It's really old, so service can be an issue. The combined film advance/shutter release takes some getting used to. The tiny viewfinder is useless underwater; you need an accessory finder. You need to get an accessory external meter (expensive) if you want to take pictures with available light. And, of course, being all-manual it is slow to change settings if you suddenly get a photo opportunity that you aren't set up for. The Nikonos III works best with a tray and strobe arm that is set up for the camera and its ancillary meter, add-on trigger, etc. and these old setups can be hard to find in decent condition. Nonetheless, it remains my go-everywhere and do-everything camera.\nNikonos II: There aren't all that many of these left in service. It is similar to the III, but the wind mechanism isn't as strong and there are a couple of other disadvantages. I wouldn't bother; they aren't any cheaper than a III and offer no advantage.\nOne last point on the Nikonos: there is really only one place to get it serviced. Bob Warkentin in Texas is the master. Nikon USA has a rotten reputation among u/w photographers for slow service and high prices. There is also a lot of buzz that the warranty on a Nikonos doesn't mean much. I personally would never send a Nikonos to Nikon for any reason except a recall (that reminds me, the SB-103 strobes are subject to a safety-related recall). I have ALWAYS gotten my Nikonos work done by Warkentin and it was always first rate, on time, and reasonably priced.\nAaron Taylor , January 23, 2002; 01:13 P.M.\nNot everyone floats so you may want to check on this before you do something stupid.\nMarvin Jones , May 29, 2003; 12:09 A.M.\nThere's a 3rd option: Freediving. I moved from scuba to freediving several years ago and have not regretted it. I have an underwater web page off of each of my Bonaire and Anguilla web sites: www.jonz.net/Bonaire/ , and www.jonz.net/Anguilla/ . Both sites are a little \"long in the tooth\" and require updates from numerous visits to these islands since the web sites were first thrown up. 'Til now I've been using an Ikelite AuquaShot housing that uses Fuji (and Kodak) disposable flash cameras. Results are decent -- certainly `ok` for web publishing. I am now moving up to a Nikon Coolpix 2000 with (again) an Ikelite housing. We'll see how that turns out.\nDon Williams , June 16, 2003; 08:13 P.M.\nRolleimarin with camera\nThe Nikon Action Touch is mentioned in the discussion. I have one but have never heard it mentioned by anyone else. I do use it for wet and snow conditions, and as my standard Point and Shoot camers. It's also great for swimmming pool pictures.\nI have been a scuba diver since 1947 and have used several camera housings, the first of which I built myself, rated at 300' housing an Argus C4.\nMy current housing, probably not known to most above-water photographers, is the cadillac of housings, the Rolliemarin IV, which is used with my Rolleiflex 3.5F. This housing has all the camera controls available to the diver and includes the ability to swing close-up lenses and filters into position underwater.\nDon Williams La Jolla, CA\nRobert Hall\n, July 04, 2003; 10:01 A.M.\nMy wife teaches marine science and needs a simple point-and-shoot camera suitable for wet environments. We have gone through about 8 different cameras: three minolta weathermatics (110 film), two minolta 35mm, two canon sure-shots, and a canon elf (aps). The minolta 35mm died way to soon from a leak as did one canon sure-shot. After two years of wrangling canon sent me a replacement. The Elf was good except I don't like aps film (expensive to process) and my wife got her finger in the image on half of the shots. It worked OK for me, however. It was pretty rugged; it survied having me dump an entire bushel of scallops on it as I emptied my catch bag into the wrong box, getting kicked around the floor of a boat, and other such modest abuse. Any such camera requires great care to be sure the seal is clean. You need to carry q-tips in your bag and use them between every film change. Avoid running them under the sink because the pressure is greater than that at 15 feet; just immerse them in a dishpan of clean water to rinse off salt water.\nIf anyone knows of a good UW camera of this ilk, please advise!\nJoseph Liftik , November 15, 2003; 12:52 P.M.\nAfter years of SCUBA diving I concluded that u/w photography can produce interesting views of fish, coral and other unusual underwater creatures. However, the wonder of the underwater experience can seldom be captures on a still frame. Even the best u/w photographers rarely capture the experience. I think this is due to the limitations of the gear in the u/w environment. On the other hand, I found the u/w video is truly capable of conveying what the underwater world is about. For example, I have a 30 second video of an eagle ray dancing right in front of my video camera lens, I put it to music..... no way you can convey this with a still frame. I think that in the underwater medium, it is movement of the subjects that creates the image.\nPaul Alford , February 11, 2004; 09:52 A.M.\nDon't go out and buy U/W gear, rent it on location. I always rent and have no bother finding outlets where I can do this. In Hurghada there are 5 outlets, Sharm has 7 that I know of. Decent PADI 5* dive centres will most probably have kit to hire, if not at they will point you in the right direction.\nIf after several dive trips (IMO it will take this many to become accustomed) you feel a need to mve forward in this area, then consider buying gear. I have shot images on over 50 dives now and I'm still ages from even considering buying my own kit.\nG D , February 20, 2007; 05:31 P.M.\nFinally dipped a finger into Still Photography underwater. Nik V with 35mm lens and 1:1 extension tube as well as Oceanoptics Macro lens. Sea and Sea YS 50 Strobe.\nAfter a long week in the Red Sea my photographs progressed every roll of film. Shooting Kodak Portra 400 VC I got a couple of really great shots. I ran out of film after about 45 minutes so had to think about how much film to shoot and when, balancing tester shots with keepers. 1 roll of slide film still to process, but it was deep, dark and silty.\nMy Video shots are deffinetly better than the stills, but I do prefer stills: need to work on tripod and second strobe as well as 15mm lens.\nI think that digital is deffinetly a better bet than stills for Underwater stuff, particularly a housed Fuji F30 with a Wide angle conversion lens and a couple of strobes - ?900 Having brought all that I know that I would want the housing for my 5D and then i would probably flood it costing another ?900.\nYou can get my package for about ?270 and about ?375 for the 15mm lens. and this is something that i would still use when i get the housing for the 5D.\nI shot a mixture of approaches: Aperture priority, and TTl flash with good results on macro, but underexposed when trying to do a foreground with blue water background. Manual 1/30th f8, 11 ,or 16 with Full flash giving me the best results on negative film. and the aperture priority with full power flash givign good results.\nYou need two strobes or a fill flash card on macro shots. The YS 50 is not powerfull enough for anything other than macro and close ups. You need really clear viz for Slide film.\nI'm still learning, but realy happy to have the Rangefinder, and actually used the 35mm lens out the water with great results.\nLovin the Nikonos V\nP.S. if you read the manual and always use fully round O rings you will not flood it.\nRemember to go into robot mode when changing film at the end of the dive and before a dive preparing all equipment You have to be extremely attentive to detail.\nSee R , March 15, 2007; 04:08 A.M.\nI've gotta wonder if I would be able to operate my Shen Hao in an Ewa bag, although I am most positive that if I could it would be a miserable experience and with most likely poor results.\nJoseph...beyond catching movement with video...also consider macros of colorful invertebrates as well as panoramics to capture the totality of it all in a glance....although largely yes, I agree with you it is hard to really capture...either on still or video.\nBill Van Antwerp\n, April 07, 2007; 08:36 P.M.\nThere is a rumor that Cathy Church housed a Sinar for shooting some B&W underwater stuff, forget the EWA unless you are really crazy. For macro, also forget the Nikonos, have you ever tried to get a pygmy seahorse (see my portfolio) or a long nosed hawkfish into a framer and stand still. Wide angle with the Nikonos 15 mm is still awesome, but for macro I think a housed digital SLR is the only way to go.\nBill\nJosef Swaney\n, July 24, 2007; 11:22 A.M.\nI feel compelled to offer a response to Bill's post above. There have been literally millions of great macro photos taken with the Nikonos system, and the vast majority of photographs that were published for a generation were taken with the Nikonos system.\nThere are several Nikonos options that allow you to photograph skittish macro subjects. My favorite is the Spot Shot by Underwater Photo-Tech. There is a version that works with the Nikonos close-up set and others that work with Helix extension tubes. The converging beams of light do not seem to frighten subjects the way framers do, and they work well to get sharply-focused images.\nSome folks take the simple expedient of cutting off one or both framer sides of an extension tube and framer set (or unscrewing the uprights in the case of the Sea&Sea extension tube sets), which also significantly reduces the frustration you might feel when your framer uprights scare your subject just as you are ready to take a shot.\nThe migration to digital has driven the price of Nikonos systems down significantly, but Nikonos cameras and lenses continue to be capable of producing true professional-quality photographs when used by capable photographers. You can purchase a complete Nikonos system on eBay for less than what a quality housing for a digital SLR camera will cost, have all the equipment serviced (highly recommended!), and be ready to take images that will make superb enlargements and astound your friends with their housed digital compact cameras.\nOn another front, as noted in a number of posts above, floods happen. There's a saying about underwater photographers--they fall into two groups--those who have flooded something and those who will flood something (often at the most inopportune time). With a Nikonos, the impact of the eventual flood is far less costly than with your housed D200 or (insert your favorite new digital brand/model here), and your normal camera continues to operate properly for the rest of your vacation if you ever do flood a Nikonos.\nJoe\nRobert Hall\n, July 25, 2007; 08:27 A.M.\nIt is a shame that more people do not visit this page. We need quality reviews of the new cameras, Sea&Sea and all the rest.\nJaap Voets , June 03, 2008; 05:32 P.M.\nIt might be time to heavily revise this page. I think only a few percent of the UW photographers is still using film, the rest has switched to digital.\nBasicly because digital has huge advantages. 36 exposures on film versus 8 Gb (let's say 2000 shots) memory cards. Under water there is no way to reload your camera with fresh film. Being able to see what you just shot is a great aid as well. Especially with housed DLR's you are looking through a mask, a housing and then through the viewfinder. Try it on land, hold your eye 5 cm's from the viewfinder, you will quickly notice that composing isn't quite easy that way.\nThe techniques are ofcourse still the same: get close, get close and get closer, either with a macro or wide angle lens. And make sure to bring a decent flash unit if you want any color besides blue or green in your picture.\nMike Roberts\n, June 16, 2008; 07:12 P.M.\nWhile I certainly would agree that a Nikonos is capable of incredible uw pix, I don't know if it's the best bet for uw photography anymore.

I'd say the combination of Nitrox with Photography should not be started before the 70th dive.\nThis argument becomes completely irrelevant if the dive does not go deeper than what allows for a reasonable chance of oxygen toxicity. So with Nitrox I (EAN 32) if the dive (ocean or lake floor) is not deeper than 130 feet or with Nitrox II (EAN 36) if the dive is not deeper than 100 feet, then it is not possible to exceed 1.6 bars (ATA) of oxygen partial pressure. For example if you dive the HMCS Yukon in San Diego, the bottom of which lies at 100 feet and you use EAN 32, you can't exceed 1.3 ATA, and yet you increase your bottom time.\nThe world is full enough of divers who can not control their buoyancy and devastate 2 square metres of coral reef for one mediocre shot of a coral with the spot where a terrified fish fled from when they took the photo.\nThat is a different story--I agree 100%\nMike Roberts\n, November 14, 2008; 11:25 A.M.\nI think if you read DAN stats, you'll see that DCS is more common among experienced divers rather than the newer diver. Also that Nitrox is the safest way to dive - of course you must keep depth limits in mind but most good photo ops are well above 90-100 feet. The only thing wrong with nitrox is the cost.\nAgain, the Nikonos is a great camera but it isn't capable of a shot like this.

Underwater Photography\nshayne ancheta\n, March 07, 2010; 04:30 A.M.\nhello all, i want to add my two cents. I am a diver for a living. Now i dont get to go around and look at all the pretty fish. (that is what id like to do though!) I work on the oil platforms and that type of stuff.\nDiving is very dangerous........ Sounds like some people on here have some experience with scuba. I have used lots of nikonos and even things like nikon coolpix. I will say being a diver with alot of time in the water, i dont worry about the diving part it sorta like muscle memory now. Point is i guess i never really thought to much about technique. I read alot of great advise in this thread and even learned a thing or two. My general preperation before i go take pics is to grab one or two ikelite 800's. That typically solves any lack of light problem. Backscatter can be a problem if you need to see large pic but of welds and things like that just set aperature and distance and fire away. And try to hold as still as possible. Taking pics u/w is like taking pics dry with light that is always to the point where you need a tripod but you didnt bring one and you never will. Anyway thats is my two cents. goodluck\ngeorge sweeney , July 19, 2010; 09:13 A.M.\nJust a bit of nostalgia. \u00a0I lived in Egypt in 1953-54, and would often go scuba diving at a site south of Suez \u00a0where there was an easily accessible coral reef, and a moderate depth of about 30 feet. I wanted to take some underwater photos, and had to devise my own system.\nI purchased in the bazaars of Cairo a conventional hot water bottle - rectangular, with a single circular opening. I then had a circular piece of glass cut, the size of the opening, and had a clamp made to hold it on place. Then, I inserted my 35 mm camera inside the bag, by stretching the opening with my fingers. I could then operate the camera by feel through the soft rubber. \u00a0I took quite a few good shots this way.\nWill Magnussen , October 09, 2010; 04:52 P.M.\nThis string is completely useless to anyone thinking of shooting underwater. Get a housing for your camera, strobes, learn to dive properly, especially buoyancy, take a trip with a photo pro, spend a lot of time in the water shooting. Except for the wire goby, all the other underwater images on this string are terrible and not anything close to publishing quality.\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

This distance can be adjusted (the process of focusing). Any points at a different distance will be rendered more or less unsharp, and this unsharpness increases gradually as we move away from the \"sharp\" focus plane. Within some limits it will be small enough to consider the image of our point \"sharp enough\" for a given purpose.\nWe are talking here only about the unsharpness due to the subject being out of the focused distance. Other sources of unsharpness are possible: camera shake, dirty lens, atmospheric conditions, and various optical flaws of the lens among others. These reasons remain outside of the scope of this article.\nThe term depth of field (DOF) is often used to refer to the fact that points not exactly in focus are rendered acceptably sharp in the image. Quantitatively, DOF is often defined as the distance between the closest acceptably rendered point on the lens axis and the furthest such point. Obviously, this value will depend on how much unsharpness we are willing to accept.\nIs it good or bad for your pictures?\nFor many types of photography we would like to have everything in the frame as sharp as possible. This includes, but is not limited to, landscape, architecture, documentary, and vacation/family snapshots. Usually the more DoF the better for these applications.\nIn some cases, however, we may want to use a more creative approach, with the main subject of the picture being sharp, while the background (and, if applicable, the foreground) is fuzzy, out of focus. With the main subject \"standing out\" from the surroundings, the picture may have more impact, being generally more pleasing to the eye. In such cases we want to minimize the depth of field. This approach is especially useful in portraits, but not only.\nWhat is \"acceptably sharp\" \u2014 circle of confusion\nThe extent of the depth of field depends on what we understand as \"acceptably sharp\" in the definition above. If we are willing to accept more unsharpness, the depth of field (or whatever we accept as depth of field) will extend more. For sharpness-critical applications, it will be very shallow.\nA (hypothetical) lens without any optical flaws, placed at a given distance from the image plane (film or digital sensor) will create point-like images only for point subjects at one given distance (as measured along the lens axis).\nFor a point subject at any other distance, its image will be a circular spot, referred to as circle of confusion.\nThe acceptable size (diameter) of the circle of confusion depends on how the photographic image will be magnified in the printing or viewing process, and from what distance it will be viewed \u2014 plus of course, on what you mean by \"acceptable\" in the magnified (printed, displayed) image.\nObviously, a smaller image created by the lens has to undergo stronger magnification to be viewed.\nThis is why, from the DoF standpoint, it does matter on what size camera a lens of a given focal length is used.\nFor example, a frame from a 35 mm camera has the size of 24\u00d736 mm. To be printed as a typical 30\u00d740 cm (12\u00d716 inches) enlargement, or viewed on a 20\" (diagonal) screen, it has to be magnified 12.5 times (note that because of a different aspect ratio, the usable part of the frame is only 24\u00d732 mm).\nFor the same print size, an image created on the 2/3\" sensor of a typical non-SLR digital camera (6.6\u00d78.8 mm) will require a magnification of about 50\u00d7. The circle of confusion has to be five times smaller to result in similar perceived sharpness of the viewed image.\nThe human eye has a resolving power of about 1/1000 of a radian. This means that we can see detail of the size of about 1/1000 of the viewing distance. A typical viewing distance for a 30\u00d740 cm print is 40 cm or more; this results in an acceptable circle of confusion of 0.4 mm (about 1/60\" of an inch). Reduced into the film plane (divided by 12.5) this translates itself into a CoC diameter of 0.032 mm for 35-mm film. For a Four Thirds digital sensor, with the sensor two times smaller (diagonally), the CoC will have to be two times smaller: close to 0.016 mm.\nVarious sources a value varying from 0.025 mm to 0.033 mm for the 35-mm film. This is already hairsplitting; I will be using a value of 0.03 mm, a little bit more conservative than one shown above.\nTo account for differences in format size and aspect, it is handy to define the size of the circle of confusion as a fraction of the diagonal of the film (sensor) frame. For the 35 mm format, the value of 0.03 mm equals to 1/1440 of the diagonal.\nStill, designers of mass-market cameras often assume that 1/1000 will be enough for their intended users, while in scientific and technical photography the value of 1/3000 is not uncommon.\nBasic facts\nAssuming the image frame size (film, sensor) stays the same, the following is true:\nAt any given focal length depth of field increases as the lens is closed down (i.e., the F-number increases).\nAt the same lens aperture and the same subject distance, depth of field is greater for short focal lengths (wider lenses) than for long ones. This difference is quite dramatic.\nAt the same lens aperture and image magnification (i.e., width of the frame, measured in the subject plane), depth of field remains approximately constant for various focal lengths.\nAt the same focal length and aperture, depth of field increases with the subject distance (even if measured as a percentage of that distance).\nWhile points (1), (2), and (4) are getting quite a lot of exposure in photography books and articles, (3) is mentioned rather rarely. Some people may even think that it contradicts (4), which is not the case: both statements are valid. (On another extreme, some authors stress (3) and claim that (2) is not true. Once again, all depends what are the other controlled variables kept equal.)\nNote, however, that using a longer lens will not lead to shallower DOF in portrait shots, assuming the subject is identically framed in both cases; this is a direct consequence of (3).\nAnyone who wants to use and control the depth of field creatively in his/her photographs must realize and understand the points (1-4) above; without that all process will be reduced to a guesswork. Therefore if you are not sure, go back to the beginning of this section and read it again. No instant gratification here.\nThe formulae leading (directly or indirectly) to these conclusions can be found near the end of this article, so can be graphs illustrating them.\nWhat's so special about digital cameras?\nActually, not much, except that most have sensors smaller (or much smaller) than the 35-mm film frame. Therefore the CoC size used to define \"acceptably sharp\" also has to be proportionally smaller.\nThis would, seemingly, lead to less DoF in small-sensor cameras, if not for one additional fact: for the same image angle (field of view) a smaller sensor requires also a proportionally smaller lens focal length.\nFor example, a 100 mm lens on a 35-mm film camera gives the same field of view as a 25 mm (approximately) lens on a digital camera with a 2/3\" sensor. This is why we often say that the EFL (equivalent focal length, implying the 35-mm film as a reference) of the latter lens is 100 mm. The ratio of these two values (here: 4.0) is often referred to as focal length equivalence ratio, or focal length multiplier. In this article I will denote this ratio as\nsimply M.\nSome writers refer to M as crop factor, which is a wrong term. It suggests that the optics of a digital camera is the same as of the film one, except that we are using just a part of the frame. This is not the case: for the same sharpness of the final picture, a digital lens with a given M should have the absolute resolution (measured in the image plane) M times higher than a corresponding 35-mm film lens. On the other hand, it needs to deliver acceptable images only within an image circle which is M times smaller than in the other case. Would you say that a 35-mm camera has a crop factor of 2.5\u00d7 compared to a 6\u00d79 cm, medium-format one?\nDefinition Reminder: Consider a camera using a lens of some focal length, f. This lens provides us, for that camera's image frame, with a given angle of view. The same angle can be achieved on a 35-mm (24\u00d736 mm) camera with a focal length feq. The ratio\nM = feq / f\nwill be referred to as focal length multiplier (or focal length equivalence ratio) for the first camera.\nM remains the same for any lenses used on that camera and depends only on its frame size.\nfeq is referred to as (35 mm-) equivalent focal length of our lens/camera combination.\nHere we are for some surprise. Even if the acceptable CoC size in digital cameras is M times smaller, the actual unsharpness of the image drops even faster because of the focal length being M times shorter (for the same field of view). As a result, cameras (digital or not) with smaller frames show more depth of field!\nThis can be seen in the comparison of Figs. 1 and 1a showing DoF for two cameras with different sensor sizes, but even more clearly in Fig. 3 .\nThe M\u00d7A Rule\nThe relationship turns out to be quite simple. It can be summarized as\nThe M\u00d7A Rule:\nThe depth of field of a camera with focal length equivalence ratio of M, at a given aperture (F-number) A, is the same as that of a 35 mm camera with a lens of the same angle, closed down to the aperture of M\u00d7A.\nFor example: you are using a Four Thirds camera (M = 2) with a zoom lens set to the focal length of 25 mm (EFL = 50 mm) at the F/2.8 aperture. The depth of field you will be getting will be identical to that obtained with a 35-mm film camera using focal length of 50 mm, providing the same image angle, closed down to F/5.6 (as 2.8\u00d72=5.6).\nThis has nothing to do with your camera being digital \u2014 it is entirely a result of smaller frame size. Digital cameras come with differently sized sensors; the rule of thumb is that entry-level models have smallest ones (i.e., larger M), and for those models the effect is, obviously, strongest.\nThis, by the way, is a lucky coincidence: the users of small-sensor cameras will usually be concerned in getting most depth of field, to get everything sharp in the picture. They usually tend not to worry about creative, out-of-focus background, and these cameras, usually are lacking direct control over the aperture, therefore providing no control over depth of field. As a result, switching from film to digital resulted in millions of vacation snapshots becoming sharper than before.\nOn the other extreme, discerning photographers may want to control the DoF. This is one of the reasons why the so-called full-frame (M = 1) digital SLR are so common among professionals. Medium-format digital backs or cameras are also available, with M less than 1.\nFor example: the Mamiya ZD digital SLR has the frame size of 36\u00d748 mm, which translates into M = 0.72. To get an EFL of 100 mm you will have to use a focal length of 140 mm, and at F/2.8 the DoF will be comparable to that at F/2.0 on a 24\u00d736 mm camera using a 100 mm lens. You can focus on your model's eyes, keeping her ears out-of-focus.\nFrame sizes and equivalence ratios\nVarious digital camera models use sensors of varying sizes. These are usually denoted in terms of \"inch fractions\", a holdover from fifty years ago, when such a value actually corresponded to the outer diameter of a glass tube holding the image sensor in TV cameras. The glass tube is gone, the notation remains.\nHere is a sample of typical sensor sizes (nominal and actual), with the corresponding values of M, the focal length multiplier. The M values as shown are more than good enough for any practical use.\nSensor/Film\n[3]\nNotes:\nCanon publishes the efective size of image (as opposed to the overall sensitive area, part of which does not fit into the final image frame). This makes sensor size estimation easy and reliable.\nNikon, I believe, lists the overall sensor size, including the pixels (photosites) not used in the final image. This makes the estimate harder to do.\nThe Nikon values in our table are based on indirect information on the D300. It uses a 12 MP Sony CMOS sensor with the pixel pitch of 5.49 micrometers (according to Sony). Multiplying that by the image pixel dimensions of 4288\u00d72848 pixels, we arrive to the effective frame size of 15.6\u00d723.5 mm.\nIt is possible that Nikon frame sizes subtly change from one model to another. The reasons for secrecy (and hence confusion) are unknown.\nThe frame size I'm listing for 4/3 sensors is the area from which the image is collected, not the overall photosensitive size, which is 13.5\u00d718 mm.\nFor the whole discussion of DoF to have sense, the pixel pitch (i.e., distance between centers of neighboring pixels) has to be smaller than the accepted CoC size. This is true for all cameras of two megapixels or more: even in a 2 MP sensor (1200\u00d71600) pixel pitch is 1/2000 of the diagonal; less than the CoC of 1/1440.\nGood news and bad news\nFor most photographers the vastly increased depth of field in digital cameras is good news. Too many pictures taken with our 35 mm cameras were not quite good, running out of the depth of field. Especially in landscape photography it is very nice to have sharp foreground.\nIn 1932 a group of American photographers, including Ansel Adams, founded Group f/64. The name was derived from the small aperture opening the group members deemed necessary for achieving acceptable depth of field with use of large-format view cameras.\nNow, you may think that F/64 gives you a huge depth of field. Let us have a closer look. A full-format view camera has a frame of (approximately) 8\u00d710 inches (20\u00d725 cm), with a diagonal of 32 cm. This means, that for a given image angle, it needs a focal length 7.5 times larger than that for a 35-mm camera, or 30(!) times that for 2/3\" sensor digitals.\nA quick application of the M\u00d7A rule brings us the bare truth: from the viewpoint of DoF, F/64 on an 8x10 camera is equivalent to F/8.5 on your 35 mm SLR, to F/2.1 on the E-10/E-20 (2/3\"), or even wider apertures on most other non-SLR models!. In other words, the depth of field attained by closing a view camera lens all the way (with the resulting multi-second exposure times) is matched or exceeded by your digital camera's lens fully open!\nBeing able to work with wider apertures (smaller F-numbers) allows us to use higher shutter speeds, thus eliminating another source of image unsharpness.\nNeedless to say, most digital camera manuals do not mention anything on the subject: remember, we are just mass-market customers, a bunch of illiterate idiots! Still, program modes in such cameras are aware of that, clearly favoring wide apertures and high shutter speeds. Let us also remember, that with more DoF there is less need for accurate autofocus, especially if the sensor is really small (1/2.5\" or less).\nEven with a Four Thirds camera, M = 2: shooting at F/4 results in DoF like at F/8 on a 35-mm film (at the same image angle), a considerable advantage \u2014 if you are after more DoF. Now, whenever I'm shooting in aperture or shutter priority, I have to break my long-embedded SLR habits, and use apertures much wider than I'm used to. Usually there is no sense in using openings smaller (F-numbers greater) than F/5.6, when shooting at the wide-to-medium lens angle.\nSmall apertures, i.e., large F-numbers, may lead to image degradation due to diffraction effects. While for a given image size it is the relative aperture (F-number) what counts here, small frames need more magnification for the same final (printed or viewed) image size; this is why diffraction is more painful with digital cameras, especially those with smallest sensors. This is one of the reasons the digital camera makers limit themselves to F/8 or F/11 on sensors of 2/3\" and smaller, although greater DoF (greater F-numbers) could be quite useful in macro applications. The topic, however, is out of the scope of this article.\nThe bad news is that it is much more difficult, using a digital camera, to blow the background out of focus, which is a pleasing effect in portrait and nature photography. You will have to use the longest possible focal length, and keep your lens wide open. Well, there is no free lunch. I would love to see a 50 mm, F/1.4 Four Thirds lens, capable of DoF as shallow as a 100/2.8 lens on my film SLRs. (The 30/1.4 lens from Sigma comes close, but may be a tad too wide for portraits. 50 to 60 mm would be perfect!)\nComputing depth of field\nThe near and far distance values defining the limits of acceptable sharpness can be calculated as\nd1,2 =\n1\u00b1ac(d\u2013f)/f 2\n[1]\nwith plus in the denominator used for the near (d1), and minus \u2014 for the far (d2) value. The notation is:\nd1 or d2 \u0097 the minimum or maximum subject distance in acceptable focus (measured from the lens, or, more exactly, from its front cardinal point, see below)\nd \u0097 the focused subject distance\nf \u0097 lens focal length\na \u0097 aperture (or F-number) value, e.g., 2.8\nc \u0097 the diameter of the acceptable circle of confusion.\nThe value of c should be set to the 1/1440 of the frame diagonal: for example, 0.03 mm for 35 mm cameras, 0.0061 mm for ones with 1/1.8\" sensors (Olympus C-series from C-2000Z to C-7070WZ), 0.0077 mm for 2/3\" ones (E-10/E-20), or 0.015 mm for the Four Thirds system, and so forth.\nAs mentioned above, you may use another fraction, like 1/2000 or 1/1000, as long as you know what are the implications, and if you use the same value for all comparisons.\nYou may like more the same formula re-shuffled to a slightly different form, proving exactly the same results:\nd1,2 =\nh\u00b1(d\u2013f)\n[2]\nwhere h = f2/ac is close (but not equal) to the hyperfocal distance, described in a section that follows.\nNegative results for the far limit (i.e., with a '\u2013' in the denominator) mean that it reaches the infinity. Remember that all lengths have to be expressed in the same units (whatever they are: millimeters, inches, or nautical miles).\nInstead of using the above formula to compute di, some people prefer to compute the absolute value of\n\u0394di = |d\u2013di|.\nIt can be computed from this definition, or from another, equivalent, form:\n\u0394d1, 2 =\nh/(d\u2013f)\u00b11\n[3]\nIn other words, if your camera is focused at d, acceptable circle of confusion will be achieved for subjects ranging in distance from d1 to d2, or from d\u2013\u0394d1 to d+\u0394d2.\nNitpicker's notes\nWhile the general dependencies outlined in the first half of this article work for any lens type and distance range, the numeric results of the formulae [1..3] are approximate. They are good enough for any practical use when the subject distance is much greater than the focal length (say, ten times or more); at lower distances they may start becoming inaccurate, especially for some types of lenses. Therefore using the formulae as they are needs some caution. Here is why.\n(The remainder of this section can be skipped , if you wish, without a harm to the general understanding of the DOF issues. This is for nitpickers only!)\nIn all these considerations the object distance is measured from the front cardinal plane, or front nodal plane (these two differ only if the medium on both sides of the lens is not the same, as in underwater photography). For an ideal lens, consisting of a single, symmetrical element, this plane passes through the lens center; for more complex lenses it may be elsewhere: within the lens barrel, or even outside of it; some (true) telephoto lenses have the front cardinal plane well ahead of the front element.\nThe camera makers, however, usually define the object distance as measured from the image plane. This is, obviously, larger by a value of the distance between that plane and the front cardinal one. This distance depends on the lens design, its focal length, and often even on the object distance. There is no easy way of knowing it for a particular lens. (For a simple, idealized, lens the difference equals just the image distance, close, in turn, to the focal distance.)\nThe difference between these two ways of defining the object distance can be neglected if that distance is much larger than the focal length; usually a factor of ten is enough.\nIn many lenses (especially longer ones) the focal length starts to change as you focus closer, with the photographer being unaware of the fact. One more reason not to publish any tables for distances below 10\u00d7 focal length (nominal, that is).\nFor example, at larger subject distances (say, three meters or more) the field of view of the Olympus 15-54 mm ZD lens fully zoomed out is about 20% narrower than that of a 14-45 mm ZD; this reflects the 20% difference in the maximum focal length. When the focus is at 50 cm or so from the camera, however, the first lens covers slightly wider field than the second one, a surprise. This means that the focal length of the first lens decreases when focused close (this may be the case with both lenses, but in the second one the effect is less strong.)\nThere is another, much less-known reason why the equations shown above are only approximate. This happens for asymmetric lenses, characterized by the so-called pupil magnification being different than one. That magnification is the ratio of the apparent aperture size seen from the lens rear to that size seen from the front. (You may also define the pupil magnification as the distance between the rear principal plane (with focus at infinity) and image plane, divided by the focal length.)\nThe best known cases of such lenses used in film photography are the true telephotos, with the elements shifted significantly to the rear, or wide-angle lenses (using the inverted telephoto design), where these elements are shifted to the front, usually to make enough room for an SLR mirror.\nLenses used in digital photography almost always use the inverted telephoto design, for a number of reasons, at least in the wide-angle to normal range.\nOnce again, these deviations from our equations tend to disappear as the object distance increases; ten focal lengths is usually considered to be a reasonable limit of applicability. This is why my tables do not go below this value.\nThe issue of asymmetric lenses is usually neglected even in advanced sources on photographic optics. The best description I was able to find is in the very informative article by Paul van Walree .\nThe exact formula which should be used to account for lens asymmetry, is\nd1,2 =\nh\u00b1(d\u2013f)\n[4]\nwith Q = (P-1)/P, where P is the pupil magnification mentioned above. Note that this formula differs from [2] in just one detail: the Qf(d\u2013f) term in the numerator.\nUnfortunately, I'm not aware of any manufacturer who would publish data on lens asymmetry, therefore we have no choice but ignore this correction. On the other hand, DoF tables published for some particular lenses may have the asymmetry accounted for (this, for example, seems to be the case for Olympus; I am not sure about other makers).\nThe hyperfocal distance\nHave another look at the formula [1] above. The far DoF limit (the one with a '\u2013' sign used) becomes infinity for a single value of the subject distance, which is\ndH = f2/ac + f\n[5]\n(You may often neglect the final f, as it is usually much smaller than f2/ac, and then dH becomes identical to h used in [2].)\nThis is the so-called hyperfocal distance, and, as you can see, for any given focal length f it depends on the used aperture, a.\nAlso note, that when we use d = dH in the DoF formula to compute the near DoF limit, the result will be dH/2.\nThus, another handy thing to remember:\nThe Hyperfocal Distance:\nSetting the focus to the hyperfocal distance (which is a function of the aperture) will result in the DoF extending from half that distance to infinity.\nDigital cameras, with their shorter focal lengths, have much smaller hyperfocal distances. For the common focal length ratio, N=5, the \"normal\" focal length (EFL = 50 mm) is 10 mm. Using this value (with c=0.0061mm), for the aperture of F/4 we arrive to dH=4.1 m. Set your focus manually to this value, and you can take sharp pictures from two meters to infinity!\nExperienced photographers know and use this rule, which allows them to skip autofocus, and shoot reliably and quickly, without any autofocus lag. This works best for short and normal focal lengths; with longer lenses the hyperfocal distance may be too large for most applications.\nOn the other hand, under many circumstances we are more willing to accept some unsharpness in closer subjects than in more distant ones. This is why some photographers prefer to set the focus to infinity (even if some DOF is \"wasted\" in the process).\nIf the lens is focused at infinity, the near DOF limit becomes close to the hyperfocal distance; more exactly,\nd1=dH\u2013f,\nor just h.\nIn my own practice, I often use a mixed approach, setting the focus to the hyperfocal distance computed for an aperture one stop (sometimes even two stops) wider than the one actually used.\nThe tables\nHere are depth-of-field tables for four groups of Olympus digital cameras with different sensor sizes:\nFour Thirds system SLRs : from Olympus E-1 to E-30 and E-620, Panasonic L-1 and L-10, Leica Digilux 3; also Micro Four Thirds EVF cameras, like the Panasonic G1. The tables cover focal lengths from 7 to 500 mm.\nC-series (C-30x0Z, C-40x0Z, C-5050Z) , EFL = 35-105 mm or 32-96 mm (1:4.93); nominal sensor size: 1/1.8\";\nThe C-5060WZ and C-7070WZ with the EFL of 27-105mm (1:4.80 focal length ratio); sensor, I believe, just about 3% larger than 1/1.8\"; sorry for hairsplitting;\nE-series (E-10, E-20) , with the EFL = 35-140 mm (1:3.89); sensor size of 2/3\";\nThe tables are also applicable to other cameras of similar sensor sizes, and therefore M, see the Appendix below.\nFor comparison, and for those who may need them, here are\nTables for cameras with the 24\u00d736 mm frame (digital or film)\nTo automate the calculations, I wrote a simple program, Doffy, which generates an HTML page with tables for user-defined values of apertures, distances, and focal lengths; you can then view or print that page with any Web browser.\nAs soon as I have Doffy nicely packaged (including user documentation), I'll include the download in my Works section; if you need it before that, let me know.\nDoF graphs\nSome of the readers of earlier versions of this article asked for graphs, especially, if not only, to illustrate points [1..3] in the Basic Facts section. Here let me just illustrate the above points with some graphs.\nIn all these graphs the horizontal axis shows the subject distance (meters). The vertical one shows how much depth of field extends ahead (negative values) and beyond (positive values) the subject, expressed as a fraction of the subject distance.\nFor example, the values of -0.2 and +0.6, at the subject distance of 5 meters, mean that DoF extends from 1 m ahead of the subject (0.2\u00d75) to 3 m beyond the subject (0.6\u00d75), of from 4 to 8 m counted from the lens.\nFig. 1. Relative DoF as a function of subject distance for various apertures (F-numbers). The F-numbers, counted from the x-axis out, are 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6, 8.0, 11, and 16.\nComputed for a 25 mm lens on a Four Thirds system camera (EFL = 50 mm, i.e., the same field of view as a 50 mm lens on a 35-mm film camera), CoC of 0.015 mm.\nIt is clear that (a) larger F-numbers offer dramatically more DoF; (b) at smaller distances DoF rapidly decreases, even if expressed in relative terms. This is as stated in points [1] and [3] above.\nAn example of how to read this graph: let us find the DOF for the focused subject distance of 5 meters at F/2.8. That aperture corresponds to the second pair of lines (counted from inside), shown in purple. The lower purple line crosses x=5 at about -0.25; the upper one at 0.5. This means that DOF extends from 25% of the (5 m) distance ahead to 50% beyond the 5-meter plane; in other words, from 3.75 m to 7.5 m.\nOther graphs should be interpreted in a similar way, except that various lines correspond to another controlled variable.\nFig. 1a. As Fig. 1, but for a 50 mm lens on a 35-mm film camera, or any camera with a 24\u00d736 mm sensor. While the values are different, the general behavior of lines is the same, also illustrating points [1] and [3]. Computed with CoC of 0.03 mm.\nA close look reveals that the third innermost pair of lines in this graph (green, for F/4.0) behaves exactly like the innermost one (aqua, for F/2) in Fig.1, the fourth pair (yellow, F/2.8) \u2014 like the second one in that picture (purple, F/2.8), etc. This is not a coincidence, see the M\u00d7A Rule .\nFig. 2. Relative DoF as a function of distance shown for a fixed aperture of F/4 and for various focal lengths. Four Thirds format, CoC of 0.015 mm. From the innermost pair of lines out the focal lengths are 75, 50, 35, 25, 17.5, 14, and 11 mm (double those values to get EFLs).\nThe upper green line (35 mm) looks close to that for 50 mm, F/2 in Fig.1, but only for larger subject distances. Let's not get into that.\nFig. 3. Relative DoF as a function of distance for different equivalence ratios, M, but the same EFL (equivalent focal length) of 50 mm. From the innermost pair out, the curves are for M of 1 (24\u00d736 mm), 1.5 (APS-C), 2 (4/3\"), 4 (2/3\"), and 5 (1/1.8\").\nExcept for the APS-C lines (second from inside, aqua), all others could be seen in Figs. 1 and 1a. If you've read carefully the M\u00d7A Rule , you will know why...\nGraphs generated with Kalkulator\nAppendix: sensor sizes for selected cameras\nHere is a partial list of sensor sizes used in some cameras from major makers. The list does not pretend to be a complete reference and I am not planning to maintain it, as new models are showing up all the time. If in doubt, check the inch sensor size as given by the manufacturer and use the table above.

Lovecraft wouldn\u2019t have minded having his headstone photographed by two of his biggest fans. Especially on his birthday. Not to mention that one of these fans, Caitlin R. Kiernan , has cited Lovecraft as one of her main influences in writing her own horror/fantasy novels and short stories.\nThe other fan is Kiernan\u2019s partner, Kathryn A. Pollnac, a photographer who has been visiting Lovecraft\u2019s grave since 1989.\nAs soon as the two women pulled up to the headstone at Swan Point Cemetery outside of Providence, Rhode Island, a security guard pulled up in a white car and told them they could not take photos. He then accused them of not having any respect for the dead.\nKathryn asked if he had any respect for the living because it was apparent that he did not.\nThis caused him to lose his temper, which made Kiernan believe he may have been drunk. This is how she describes the incident on her blog:\n\u201cHe unleashed a stream of profanities at Spooky and me both. No, this does not make much sense. Within seconds, he was threatening to \u201ccall the PD\u201d and proclaiming that he was \u201ckicking us out.\u201d So, yes, I was being kicked out of the cemetery where HPL is buried, where I\u2019d only come to pay my respects and leave a plastic frog (I\u2019ve been visiting the spot since 2000, Spooky since about 1989), where our great offence was snapping exactly two photographs of one of the most photographed headstones in New England. I said something to Kathryn, to the effect that we should just get back in the car, which was parked very nearby. The man continued to shout an inexplicable stream of threats and obscenities, including a couple of homophobic remarks. I only wish we\u2019d had a tape recorder, or that Spooky had not been so rattled that she\u2019d had the presence of mind to turn on the camera\u2019s video, because I really wish that we had a word-for-word transcript.\n\u201cAs Spooky was getting into the car, I finally looked him in the eye and said the only thing I said during the entire encounter (which elapsed over the space of maybe three or four minutes, start to finish, at the most). I pointed a finger at the man and, very quietly, I said, \u201cYou will be reported.\u201d He screamed, \u201cYou do that, you piece of shit!.\u201d This is the only time I got a clear look at the man. He was white, late middle-aged, seemed to have about three-days worth of beard (salt and pepper), and spoke with a heavy regional accent (don\u2019t ask which one). I am fairly certain that he had been drinking, and he may have been intoxicated. He certainly acted like a belligerent drunkard.\u201d\nKiernan has vowed to continue fighting for her rights by writing letters to the Providence Journal newspaper as well as the people who run Swan Point Cemetary.\n\u201c\u2026I urge anyone else whose had trouble with Swan Point security to come forward. Last night, I was appalled. Today, the whole affair seems utterly unreal. If we\u2019d been tagging gravestones or smoking weed or performing some obscene ritual to raise Cthulhu, even then his behaviour would have been questionable. As is, it was abusive and inexcusable (and, I suspect, illegal).\u201d\n"}, {"score": 465.5154, "uuid": "e328c0b7-217d-5078-b598-938bbe9486ae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0816wb-18-16937", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/phoenix-police-department-still-mum-over-raid-on-blogger", "page_rank": 1.1834547e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Phoenix Police Department still mum <em>over</em> raid on blogger | Pixiq", "snippet": "Publicity, kicking <em>over</em> <em>a</em> log and looking at the things that scurry out, things that <em>prefer</em> the dark, is the only way to achieve justice in this world.

(Optical Image Stabilizer) system. The camera also incorporates an enhanced 1/1.63-inch CCD that is capable of capturing 10.1-Megapixels and has been designed to provide more space for each pixel to minimize image noise and optimize image quality and dynamic range. The CCD is also capable of reproducing images in 4 aspect ratios (4:3, 3:2, 16:9 or 1:1), and the Multi Aspect mode allows the camera to take an image in all three aspect ratios simultaneously. It also boasts the Venus Engine FHD high performance image processing LSI to dramatically reduce image noise (even using the high sensitivity setting of ISO 12800), and provide fast shooting performance with an incredibly fast shutter lag, and burst shooting capability.\nThe DMC-LX5 is further distinguished from other cameras by its full manual capability for both stills and video. These features include a Film mode that allows users to emulate the effects of different film types, a multiple-exposure feature for creating artistic photos by overlaying up to three consecutive images, and easy-to-use Manual modes that give the user greater shot-making flexibility and control. If you choose not to use the manual mode, then Intelligent Auto Mode will do all the work for you. In addition the camera can also capture video clips in HD, and standard video formats.\nThe camera's large 3.0-inch LCD is outstanding for both shooting and viewing. With a 3:2 aspect ratio and high 460,000-dot resolution, the LCD panel provides bright, easy-to-see images over a wider viewing angle. Furthermore, the Intelligent LCD function, assures comfortable viewing in virtually all conditions by automatically adjusting the backlighting of LCD as the ambient light level changes. The camera also provides an impressive slideshow feature where users can select the images, choose for a series of creative transitions and even add music to the presentation - all within the camera. And the camera has HD output capability (Requires an optional HDMI cable) to view your images, slideshows and video clips in beautiful HD quality.\nLarge 1/1.63\" 10.1-Megapixel High Sensitivity CCD\nThe CCD in the DMC-LX5 produces high resolution, noise-less images even in high sensitivity recording and richly reproduced gradation in highly contrasted situations with the exquisitely wide dynamic range. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity CCD and the brightness of the lens, minimum illumination of the DMC-LX5 is as low as 3 lux in movie recording. Also, the maximum setting is ISO 12800 enabling shooting in extremely dark places.\nDynamic Range\nThe expanded dynamic range is made possible by the improvement of on-tip-lens design with larger light concentration and VCCD expansion while deepening the photo diode to manage richer signal more effectively.\n24-90mm f/2.0-3.3 Ultra-Wide-angle Leica Lens\nThe lens unit consists of 10 elements in 9 groups with 3 aspherical lenses with 5 aspherical surfaces. Minimal distortion, high resolution, minimum artifacts such as chromatic aberrations, ghosting and flaring are the proof of uncompromising imaging made possible by an f/2.0 24mm ultra wide-angle Leica DC Vario- Summicron lens.\nThe 24mm ultra wide-angle lens is rare on a compact camera. It gives you a wider range of composition possibilities. The super-high-quality Leica DC Vario- Summicron lens minimizes distortion at the wide end, so you can get stunning, true-to-life images with outstanding resolution and detail. The DMC-LX5 captures approx. 213% larger viewing space compared to that of normal 35mm cameras, and even approx. 136% larger compared to that of 28mm wide-angle lens.\nThe fully open f/2.0 aperture lends a beautiful soft focus to photos with a shallow depth of field. It is especially effective for macro shots of flowers, insects, or intricate objects. This setting is also ideal for dimly lit scenes that require greater exposure, such as deep, natural forests, dimly lit historic buildings, and artwork displays. In addition, the DMC-LX5 lets you get as close as 1cm to your subject. The fully open f/3.3 aperture combines with the 90mm telephoto end of the zoom produces optimal portraits. The high resolution and excellent contrast also express fine details, with natural gradation for smoother complexions.\nDigital Zoom\nThanks to intelligent resolution technology, the intelligent zoom is available with the DMC-LX5 which extends the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x maintaining the picture quality when using the digital zoom. This means the 3.8x optical can virtually extend to 5.0x equivalent. Furthermore, the extra optical zoom function that extends zoom power to 6.7x by using the center part of the large CCD to bring subjects even closer.\nStep Zoom\nThe Step Zoom function, allows you to set the zoom to 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 70mm or 90mm via the menu. This is like changing fixed focal length lenses on a D-SLR. Max. 800mm is available if combining the Intelligent Zoom and digital zoom.\nMEGA O.I.S. with Intelligent ISO Control\nEveryone has had an experience of taking a photo at night and hoping to capture all the memories and beauty, only to be disappointed at the poor result. Panasonic has worked on the low-frequency vibration hand-shake component, which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) nearly doubles the hand-shake correction power of conventional MEGA O.I.S. You get bright photos without blurring even from handheld shooting at slow shutter speeds.\nMulti Aspect Ratios\nConventional cameras generally use almost the entire CCD area when recording an image. The DMC-LX5, however, employs a 1/1.63-inch CCD with a total resolution of 11.3 megapixels. Using only about a 10.1 megapixel area of this large CCD makes it possible to give three aspect ratios - 16:9, 3:2, and 4:3 - the same angle of view with lens settings from 24mm to 90mm (35mm camera equivalent). And rather than digitally producing \"simulated\" images, the DMC-LX5 captures the actual, real-life image for each one of the aspect ratios at the ultra-wide 24mm setting.\nAspect Switch, Aspect Bracket & 1:1\nThe aspect ratio can be changed directly with the aspect switch on the lens barrel from 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 1:1. The 1:1 aspect ratio is a unique square frame that adds to your possibilities. Aspect Bracket lets the camera take an image in all aspect ratios simultaneously, so you can choose the best one after shooting.\nVenus Engine FHD\nFor the image processing, the DMC-LX5 features the Venus Engine FHD provides higher-speed, higher-performance while compiling the intelligent resolution technology. It enables the recording of beautiful photos and high-definition movies with higher quality signal processing. The triple CPUs in this imaging engine dramatically speed up processing while achieving exceptional noise reduction performance. The Venus Engine FHD's excellent energy efficiency supports long-time AVCHD Lite movie recording, and allows the output of both images and sounds via HDMI.\nSonic Speed AF\nThe Sonic Speed AF system in the DMC-LX5 includes a higher-speed actuator, optimized algorithms and parallel software processing. The result is fast and accurate AF performance. You can quickly get moving subjects in focus, such as when you're shooting sports scenes.\nFast Start-up & Short Release Time\nThe parallel processing of software resulted in ultra high-speed start-up and the shutter release time lag is as short as approx. 0.007 second, making it easy to capture sudden, spur-of-the-moment photo opportunities.\nIntelligent Resolution\nThe advanced image processing technology \"Intelligent Resolution*\" is incorporated in the Venus Engine FHD for the DMC-LX5. With the Intelligent Resolution technology, 3 areas - outlines, detailed texture areas and soft gradation areas - are automatically detected and optimum signal processes are performed to each area. Apart from the uniform enhancement of sharpness, the innovative technology of Intelligent Resolution precisely performs signal processing pixel by pixel in the most effective way for it. As a result, images are naturally clear and crisp in both photo and movie recording.\nHigh Sensitivity - Low Noise\nThe graininess that results from picture noise and the flatness that sometimes comes with noise reduction measures are major concerns when shooting at high sensitivity levels. The Intelligent Resolution minimizes noise to produce sharp, clear images.\nExtended Battery Life\nThe energy-saving Venus Engine FHD image processing engine and the efficient, rechargeable lithium-ion battery work together to extend the shooting time of the DMC-LX5. This lets users take approx. 400 shots on a single battery charge.\nRAW Format\nYou can get original image data, recording the image directly from the sensor without any image processing. The SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.1 SE software utility lets you develop RAW data files. For example, you can develop RAW data to create an image with the effect you were trying to capture when you took the shot. You get high-level basic image processing abilities that give you control over such things as unnatural edges from saturated color borders, false colors in structures with intricate detail, and chromatic noise in photos taken at high sensitivity settings. This utility provides a unique combination of high resolution and extraordinary color separation performance.\nBuilt-in Flash\nSelect the flash synchronization you want from 1st Curtain Sync. or 2nd Curtain Sync. This is effective for capturing nightscapes with a natural flow of light. You can adjust the intensity within a range of +/-EV 2 in 1/3 EV steps.\n3.0\" 460,000-dot Intelligent LCD\nThe DMC-LX5 is equipped with a 3.0\", 460,000-dot Intelligent LCD with super high resolution and a wide viewing angle. The big screen reflects fine details, making it easy to check the focus before shooting. It also serves as a small photo and video viewer, allowing the user and friends to enjoy viewing the still and motion images together. Plus, adopting the High CRI (Color Rendering Index) LED backlight realizes vivid, impressive color reproduction true to the memory color that your eyes remember. The Intelligent LCD function automatically adjusts the brightness in 11 steps according to the shooting conditions. At the highest of these 11 steps, the LCD backlight becomes approx. 1.4 times brighter than normal. In addition, the AR (anti-reflective) coating LCD minimizes glare and provides clear images, for high visibility even in outdoor brightness.\nIntelligent Auto\nIn the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode, the camera does all the work, leaving you free to compose shots and capture moments. Just press, aim and shoot. Detection and correction functions work appropriately just by entering the iA Mode for you to take beautiful photos and movies with maximum ease. In addition, the intelligent resolution technology is always activated in the iA Mode, which results in the clearer and higher image quality in every photo and movie with extended zoom range equivalent to 5x optical zoom by the intelligent zoom. iA Mode automatically and simultaneously activates advanced detection functions: The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) to detect hand-shake, the Face Detection AF/AE to detect faces in the frame, the Intelligent Scene Selector to detect scene conditions, and the Intelligent Exposure to detect the ambient light. It also activates AF tracking, Intelligent ISO Control, and Happy Mode.\nIntelligent Exposure\nThe Intelligent Exposure instantly analyzes the framed image and adjusts the brightness in areas that are too dark due to dim lighting, backlighting or use of the flash. Adjusting the brightness of dark areas, this produces natural images that are close to the way they actually look to the human eye. The DMC-LX5 lets you adjust the effect in three levels - high, normal, and low.\nAuto Bracketing\nThe Auto Bracket function records 3 photos at varied exposure levels in a compensation range of \u00b1EV 3 in 1/3 EV steps. Then you can select your favorite photo from the different exposure settings.\nScene Modes\nThe DMC-LX5, a hybrid still/motion image model, includes numerous Scene Modes for taking stills and movies. Switching from still-image to movie shooting is seamless because the optimal Movie Scene Mode is automatically selected. The versatile Scene Mode range is a unique Lumix feature that handles just about any situation and subject type. By simply selecting a Scene Mode, the camera makes the optimal settings for you automatically, so anybody can take superb photos and movies with ease.\nPanorama Assist Mode\nThis is a handy function for aligning panorama photos using the included software PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition. The after image of each previous shot is displayed, so you can use it to precisely line up the second and third shots.\nManual Functions\nManual functions are the key to taking highly controlled and distinctive photos. Aperture-priority Mode lets you open the aperture up wide for stunning portraits with softly focused backgrounds. Shutter-priority Mode makes it possible to express the dynamic power of a flowing stream by slowing down the shutter speed. And Manual Exposure Mode gives you total control of special shots, allowing you to achieve a higher level of photographic beauty.\nManual Exposure Asst\nWhen you choose the Manual Exposure Mode, this function shows how much your setting differs from the setting the camera considers optimal. This serves as a convenient guide for anyone using the Manual Exposure Mode.\nExposure Compensation\nYou can adjust the exposure within a range of +/-EV 3 in 1/3 EV steps. In Program AE, Aperture-priority, and Shutter-priority Modes, you can retrieve the exposure compensation value and manually adjust it directly with the jog dial.\nProgram Shift\nYou can use Program Shift in Program AE Mode to keep the exposure fixed while changing the combination of shutter speed and aperture. This function lets you choose the exposure setting yourself to capture exactly the image you want.\nQuick Menu\nFrequently used functions can be quickly retrieved and easily switched by using the Q.MENU button. The function names are displayed in text form, making them easy for anyone to understand and use.\nCustom Mode\nCustom Mode 1 lets you register a series of settings you use often, you can instantly recall a pattern of the settings. And Custom Mode 2 lets you register patterns for up to 3 more settings. Together, they store 4 sets of frequently used settings in memory, for instant recall with the mode dial.\nFunction Button\nYou can allocate frequently used functions to the Function button. Functions that normally have to be selected from a menu or switched can be assigned to this button for faster, easier operation.\nFilm Mode\nThe same way photographers select different films for their distinctive coloring and contrast, you can manually choose from 6 color types and 3 monochrome types \uff0d even when shooting movies. When shooting in black and white, the contrast, sharpness and noise reduction for each mode parameter can be customized in five steps and stored in memory. The same is true when shooting in color, with the addition of the saturation adjustment. You can make a total of 4,125 settings, and you can get the exact image you want.\nMy Color Mode\nThe My Color Mode is a special option that gives free reign to your creativity and makes it easier and more fun to create interesting, expressive images. You can adjust the settings that best suit the shooting conditions and your expressive intent, for greater photographic control. It is available also in movie recording giving you a wider range of expressive possibilities to explore.\nWhite Balance\nTwo-axis adjustment feature gives you a finer white balance adjustment for Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Shade, Flash, or Halogen conditions. It can also be used when adjusting the Color Temperature setting or White Set function. You can adjust with a reference to the horizontal axis for amber to blue and the vertical axis for green to magenta. With still image recording, you can use the White Balance Bracket setting, which automatically shoots 3 consecutive photos with slight changes to the white balance setting of each photo in both the vertical and horizontal axes, by simply pressing the shutter button once.\nISO Sensitivity\nYou can set the ISO sensitivity to Auto, Intelligent ISO, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 or 12800 from the newly adapted ISO Button. When the ISO sensitivity step is set to 1/3 EV, the number of ISO sensitivity setting options increases, allowing you to make fine adjustments and achieve the level of image quality you want.\nIn Manual Exposure Mode, you can either select ISO Auto or make settings from ISO 200 to ISO 3200. With ISO Auto, once you set the aperture and shutter speed, the camera automatically judges the ISO sensitivity and maintains the appropriate exposure. For example, you have to use a fast shutter speed to capture moving subjects, while closing down the aperture enough to extend the depth of field for focusing ease. With this kind of shot, you can set the shutter speed and aperture manually, and then leave the exposure up to ISO Auto.\nConsecutive Shooting\nThe DMC-LX5 lets you snap off consecutive shots at approx. 2.5 frames per second even in RAW format. You can take a series of shots, then choose the one you like the best and delete the rest. You can also select High-speed burst mode or flash burst mode from Scene Mode.\nMulti Exposure Function\nThe Multi Exposure function lets you take up to three exposures in a single frame. For example, you can layer subjects that wouldn't ordinarily appear in the same frame by making one of them translucent and super-imposing the other for an artistic effect, or make one subject appear two or three times in the same frame. By shooting from two opposite directions, you can create a symmetrical mirror effect. The DMC-LX5 allows you to shoot while checking the image. After you've taken the first shot, it appears with a translucent effect, so you can use it to set up your second shot. The same for the third shot. The camera also automatically adjusts the gain to optimize the exposure.\nFocus Switch\nThe focus switch on the lens barrel lets you quickly change the focus mode between AF, AF-Macro or MF. The focus button helps to achieve finer focusing during both shooting and playback. During AF operation, it serves to activate the variable AF area, and during MF operation, it changes to a handy One-shot AF to provide initial focusing. During playback, this convenient and important function gives you one-touch zoom playback of subjects in focus.\nVariable AF Area\nYou can select the AF setting from Face AF, AF Tracking, Multi-AF (23-area) or 1-area AF. With the 1-area AF, the position of the AF area can be freely moved. This is convenient when you want to frame a shot for a special effect, like focusing on a subject at the very edge of the frame. The AF frame size can also be selected from among Spot, Normal, L, and XL.\nContinuous & Quick Auto Focus\nThe DMC-LX5 can be preset to either Continuous AF or Quick AF. Continuous AF automatically and continuously focuses on your subject, providing a clear, sharp focus even for moving subjects. Quick AF starts operating as soon as the camera is pointed toward a subject, in comparison with the ordinary AF function, which is activated when the shutter button is pressed half-way. Both Continuous AF and Quick AF dramatically reduce the shutter delay time and let you take pictures quickly. They are ideal for taking photos of children and pets, sports action, and animals in nature. And they make sure that spur-of-the-moment shots aren't out of focus or blurry, and minimize the time lag for shooting.\nAF/AE Lock Button\nThe AF/AE Lock button lets you frame your shot freely while keeping the focus locked, or maintains the same exposure setting regardless of the subject color when taking multiple shots.\nManual Focus\nSelect manual focus with the focus switch on the lens barrel, and use the jog dial for super-smooth focusing. When you focus in the manual focus mode, not only the focus distance but also the DOF (depth of field) according to the zoom range and aperture is displayed.\nManual Focus Assist\nMF Assist function enlarges the image to make focusing easier. The focusing area is movable, which also contributes to easy and comfortable manual focusing.\nMacro\nThe DMC-LX5 lets you get as close as 1cm to your subject. When the focus switch on the lens barrel is set to AF-Macro, or when the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode is selected, Macro Mode is activated automatically. This is ideal for taking dynamic, intricate close-ups of flowers and insects, or for rendering artwork and handicrafts in spectacular detail and rich expression.\nMovable Guide Lines\nWith the DMC-LX5, you can move the guide line according to the subject's position. This is handy when you want to take extra care in framing, especially when using a tripod.\nOptional Accessories\nThe DMC-LX5 is a system camera with a wide variety of options to choose from to match your shooting situations and style, including external viewfinders, external flashes, wide conversion lens, ND filter, PL filter and fast-draw leather carrying case. These accessories let you further improve the DMC-LX5's mobility, while upgrading the system to ensure you don't miss those once-in-a-lifetime shooting opportunities.\nHigh-definition motion Movies in AVCHD Lite\nIn addition to Motion JPEG images, the DMC-LX5 can record high-definition motion images in AVCHD Lite. This format features almost doubling the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format.\nMinimum illumination\nThe minimum illumination is as low as 3 lux thanks to the f/2.0 super bright Leica DC Vario- Summicron lens and the high sensitivity CCD.\nOptical Zoom During Video Shooting\nThe DMC-LX5 lets you use the 3.8x (25-95mm in 35mm camera equivalent in movie recording) zoom for motion images. It takes you up close for nature, sports and other distant scenes.\nIntelligent Auto for Movies and Stills\nThe iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode is also available in motion image recording. The iA Mode automatically and simultaneously activates 4 advanced detection functions: The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) to detect hand-shake, the Face Detection AF/AE to detect faces in the frame, the Intelligent Scene Selector to detect scene conditions, and the Intelligent Exposure to detect the ambient light. Since the camera automatically optimizes the settings, it lets you shoot stunning HD movies every time.\nCreative (Manual) Movie Mode\nApart from the movie recording capability of conventional digital compact cameras, the DMC-LX5 also features a Creative Movie Mode, which lets you set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies, which is especially suitable for shooting fast-moving subject. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances and it is desired to have each of them stand out.\nMy Color Mode & Film Mode for Movies and Stills\nYou can use the My Color Mode and Film Mode for shooting movies. They render highly unique expressions by matching the colors to your subject and surroundings. In the iA Mode, you can apply Happy Mode as well, for even brighter coloring.\nScene Mode for Movies\nYou are naturally supposed to take the same subject in the same situation when you start recording movie while recording photos. So you do not have to set the Scene Mode again for movie recording once you are in the Scene Mode of photo recording. The result is a beautiful movie best optimized for the scene.\nHigh Quality Sound\nThe DMC-LX5 features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio, so you can match your beautiful movies with outstanding sound.\nWind Cut\nThe Wind Cut function is available to block out most of the noise from background wind. This gives you higher quality sound when taking images on breezy days.\nCategory Playback\nYou can playback photos from a total of 10 settings, including the Face Recognition, which lets you search for and retrieve specific subjects.\nPictBridge\nThe PictBridge standard lets you print directly on a compatible digital printer. Print size, layout, date and other settings can be made with the camera. Of course, you can also make multiple prints of an image, or print only the ones that you have selected.\nSlideshows with Music\nThe DMC-LX5 can play a slideshow with music. Choose from 4 types of music: natural, slow, swing and urban. Then, select the transition effect to match your music. You can also use the optional mini HDMI cable to connect the camera to an HDTV for breathtaking, large-screen viewing*. For musical slideshows created with the included PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition, you can choose your favorite iTunes music file as background music and burn it onto a DVD disc as an MPEG2 file. It is also possible to upload the slideshow to YouTube.\nPhotographer's Name Recorded\nThe photographer's name can be embedded to the EXIF information of the picture and it can be confirmed via the updated PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition.\nTitle Edit/ Text Stamp\nThe Title Edit function in playback mode lets you edit the titles of any photos you want. Baby Mode and Pet Mode, let you enter the date of birth and name of your subject in advance. With the DMC-LX5, you can also enter your destination and the date of travel in advance, in the Travel Date setting. The title, name, age based on the birth date, date of travel information, and date of shooting are displayed during playback, and can be printed on photos.\nPHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition Software\nThe latest version of exciting software PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition comes bundled with the DMC-LX5. With quick start-up and fast read-in of images, the PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition makes it possible to sort and organize photos not only of those newly taken but also of those stored in your computer. The Face Recognition function that recognizes the faces in the image to automatically sort the photos by the registered faces without picking out each photo one by one when you only want images of a specific person. You can also enjoy slideshows with a variety of effects and use your iTunes music library as background music and burn it onto a DVD disc in MPEG2. Motion images can be uploaded directly to YouTube using the built-in YouTube uploader even in HD (High Definition) quality. It also lets you create a 360\u00b0 rotation panorama file in MOV, which is especially easy if Panorama Assist Mode in the camera is used. The software is of course compatible with the Windows 7.\nSILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.1 SE Software\nThe DMC-LX5 records original image data in RAW file format, which allows images to be developed according to your intention. A number of highly advanced functions can be applied to these RAW images by using the SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.1 SE software utility, with its unique combination of high resolution and extraordinary color separation performance.\nGo To\n"}, {"score": 549.4287, "uuid": "7782d065-0e3a-5bdb-a41e-8b2087dc3af9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1214wb-05-12221", "target_hostname": "www.seriouscompacts.com", "target_uri": "http://www.seriouscompacts.com/f41/review-ricoh-gxr-camera-28-50mm-lens-sensor-modules-3356/", "page_rank": 1.1838894e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Review: Ricoh GXR <em>Camera</em> with 28 and 50mm Lens-Sensor Modules", "snippet": "Of course, your criteria might differ from mine, so <em>I</em> <em>should</em> warn my dear readers that <em>I</em> am easily pleased when it comes to high ISO--<em>I</em> don&#x27;t expect nor need to distinguish individual eyelashes in <em>a</em> <em>portrait</em> shot at ISO 3200. My one question <em>for</em> Ricoh is this: Where is ISO 6400?", "explanation": null, "document": "Review: Ricoh GXR Camera with 28 and 50mm Lens-Sensor Modules\nIntroduction\nThe Ricoh GXR body and lensors came loaded with firmware v.1.18. I tried out the 50mm on my way back from work and found the AF to be very slow; once on the metro it struggled to focus in that poor light and most of the time just gave up. I didn\u2019t feel positive about the upcoming weeks shooting with the camera. When I got home I went to Ricoh\u2019s website and found that the most current firmware available was v.1.36--I installed it immediately (on the camera body and lensors). Wow, what a difference! In my dimly lit office the camera could now focus without problems, and in the well lit kitchen the AF was a lot faster than earlier in the day. Crisis averted! Moral of the story: Upgrade your firmware the moment you get the camera; find the latest firmware here .\nLet me make something clear: All images you will see in this review have been shot in RAW and processed manually in Adobe ACR 5.6. None of them are straight from the camera, as that's not how I make my photographs. I report here on my experiences producing personal work with the GXR, which I treated as if it were my own camera for the 4 weeks I had it. Whenever I went out photographing my aim was to take real photos, not test photos. I used no other camera during this time and the GXR became my \"main camera\" for this period of time. Thank you to Amin and B&H for providing me with this equipment.\nGXR Body\nErgonomics\nThe camera is even smaller than I expected, and except for a slight protrusion in the grip area, it is basically a thick rectangle. Ricoh won\u2019t win any industrial design awards with the GXR ! [Edit: Actually, see Remko's comment proving me wrong.] That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s ugly; let\u2019s just call it \u201cfunctional\u201d. Going back to the grip, it\u2019s covered in rubbery material that helps the fingers keep a solid hold, and this material is present in ? of the back, where the thumb rests. The small grip may not seem like enough, but given how light the camera is I had no problems holding it. But just in case, and as I\u2019ve done with all mirrorless cameras I\u2019ve used, I attached a wrist strap to it--it makes it easier to carry while not shooting and impossible to drop (I tie a knot in the strap so it\u2019s tight on my wrist).\nControls\nThere are plenty of buttons on the back of this small body and a control wheel in front of the shutter release button, but what made me the happiest is the rear jog dial (located where you'd find a second control wheel/dial on a DSLR, this is a rocking dial that is also clickable like a button). There are DSLRs that don\u2019t have one (Pentax K-r, Canon Digital Rebels, Nikon 3100...) and it\u2019s annoying whether you\u2019re shooting M or Av/Tv. In the GXR \u2019s case you can set it to control any of 5 functions, but I left it at ISO almost all the time. It\u2019s not a wheel, it\u2019s a jog dial, but it can get the job done once you\u2019re used to it. It\u2019s also a button, which allows you to quickly choose the function it performs.\nAnd speaking of choosing functions, there at 2 buttons (left and right on the rear control pad) that are simply labelled Fn1 and Fn2; you can assign almost any function to them (choose from 21 options!). Given this apparent philosophy of customisation it came as a let-down to find out I couldn\u2019t customise the magnification/zoom buttons just as much. If you\u2019re not using a zoom lensor, they\u2019re of little use while shooting. You can set them to control digital zoom, EV comp (which is already handled by default by the up/down keys on the control pad), or white balance. Seriously, Ricoh? WB? I would have much preferred an AF and AEL option as I like to decouple AF from the shutter release button; sadly, this is impossible on the GXR (but could be solved with new firmware).\nAnother bad decision is the macro button, which does nothing but transition from macro to non-macro distances when using AF (it\u2019s a focus distance limiter). If you have set up the camera for Auto Macro, this button is redundant, and if you haven\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t it be better to have this in a menu? Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but I\u2019ve never been in a situation where I\u2019ve thought \u201coh god, I\u2019ve got to switch to macro RIGHT NOW without a second to lose...thank you for a direct macro button, camera maker! You saved the day.\u201d Nope, never happened to me. The delete button doubles as the self-timer and the display button cycles through various display types: info, info + histogram, no info + grid, no info; what if you want info + grid? Not on this camera. Hold the display button down and the electronic level will appear (see what I was talking about dual-function buttons?). Finishing off the right side of the camera is the play button, which I can\u2019t see it having more than that function.\nOn the top-left of the rear are the remaining 3 buttons: Direct (shows all current settings in a single screen and allows you to navigate them to change them), open lightning (which sadly doesn\u2019t produce a bolt of lightning but simply pops open the flash) and VF/LCD (which switches between the EVF and the LCD, and when the EVF isn\u2019t attached acts as a handy LCD off switch to conserve battery).\nMenus\nLong long long long looooooong. There are 3 sections: Shooting, Key Custom Options and Setup, and they each have 3, 2 and 4 pages, respectively. Take into account the number of lines per page is 10. That\u2019s not the worst part, it\u2019s navigating them that sucks: There is no way to go from page to page without using the up/down arrows to cycle through all 10 items.\nAnother issue I have with the menus is the scattering of the drive settings. I really don't understand this; there should be an individual menu (called...Drive Settings!) to house single frame, continuous shooting, interval shooting, bracketing and self timer. Instead, it appears Ricoh scattered them randomly within the first 2 pages of the Shooting menu.\nOther settings don't seem to have been organised any better and I was very happy when after a few days I had the camera set up like I wanted it and didn't have to go into the menus any more. What a relief!\nHere's the #1 tip I can offer a new GXR owner: Go to Setup > page 3 > item 6, Store Menu Cursor Position. Are you there? Good. Now set it to \"On\". The default is \"Off\", which means every time you press the Menu key you will appear on the first page of the first menu (Shooting); if that setting in on, then you will appear wherever you were in the menus when you exited. Trust me, it will save you a lot of frustration.\nLenses & Sensors\nI'm not going to spend much time on the IQ of the lenses because, as I've written before , I'm not too concerned with them as long as they're the focal length and aperture I want, and their IQ is adequate. I only had two lenses for this test, which are the two 12MP APS-C units currently offered by Ricoh. They are both primes, which suits me fine as that's the type of lens I favour for street photography.\nI'll discuss the sensor separately from the lenses, like we used to do back when they didn't come joined at the hip.\nSensor\nThe sensors gave consistent results to the unaided eye, meaning I didn't take photos of a test chart with each lensor and compared them, but rather when looking at the images on Adobe Bridge I couldn't tell just by looking at them what lensor I had used. That's good enough for me.\nThe image quality from these sensors was par for the course of previous generation sensors: Very good up to ISO 800, good at 1600, usable at 3200. Of course, your criteria might differ from mine, so I should warn my dear readers that I am easily pleased when it comes to high ISO--I don't expect nor need to distinguish individual eyelashes in a portrait shot at ISO 3200.\nMy one question for Ricoh is this: Where is ISO 6400? Even the lowly Olympus E-PL2 with a smaller 4/3 sensor has 6400. I hope a future firmware from Ricoh will add the extra stop of ISO.\nAs far as dynamic range is concerned, it was enough for me; I didn't have any issues with it. There is some noise in deep shadows, but you have to boost them by 3-4 stops to see it, and even then it's quite grain-like and not distracting; again, I didn't have any issues with it. Where I could run into some issues is with highlight recovery. I didn't conduct any specific tests, but playing around with a few RAW files it didn't seem like there was much headroom in blown highlights, maybe 1/2 stop. Luckily, the GXR meters consistently, so I never found myself having to reel in highlights in postprocessing. One thing I will note is that I ran the GXR at +0.3EV as I found it exposed a bit too dark for me.\nLenses\nBoth lenses focus reasonably fast, given that they're using contrast-detect AF. Though no brick walls were harmed in the conducting of this review, I can say that there is no flagrant distortion visible in real photos. Chromatic aberrations are noticeable by their absence; is this due to in-camera correction? I don't know. Do I care? Not really, but you may.\nAs agreed, I didn't shoot any brick walls, but I can tell you the corners are soft when shot wide open; I found the sweet apertures for these lenses are f/4 to f/8. That said, I had no qualms shooting wide open at f/2.5 when the light levels required it, but in these cases I did my best to keep my subject close to the center of the frame.\nA12 28mm f/2.5\nAt first I had a hard time with this lens . That's not the lens's fault, but rather me not being used to using such a wide angle. By forcing myself outside of my comfort zone and using this lens for long spells, I learned to appreciate the focal length and what it had to offer. Indeed, I ended up taking many images that would have been impossible had I been shooting with the 50mm.\nThe lens focuses reasonably close at 20cm, as measured from the sensor; that's about 17cm from the front of the lens. This allows for the classic wideangle view where one gets very close to the subject while showing a lot of the background thanks to the wide FoV. The action of the focus ring on this lens was very smooth, making it nice to turn for manual focusing, but easy to knock out of focus too.\nA12 50mm f/2.5 Macro\nThis is my go-to focal length for street photography so I immediately felt at home with it mounted on the camera. This lens is also close focusing (hence the term 'macro' in the name), allowing for a 1:2 magnification ratio. This might be useful to some, but I would have preferred a lens with maybe 1:4 magnification but a wider aperture, say f/2 or f/1.8. Maybe Ricoh will offer the option soon because they do have a patent for a 33mm (50mm-equiv.) f/1.8 macro from back in 2009. Of course, making this lens macro increases its size, which is why I'd prefer it to be non macro.\nUnlike the 28mm, the 50mm lens had a very tight-feeling focus ring, making it a chore to turn. The action is so different from the 28mm that I wonder if it was defective. Luckily, I found AF to work fine for my needs, so I rarely used manual focus.\nAs for its macro function, it came in handy more than once when I came upon something tiny I wanted to photograph. It does only allow 1:2, but this is challenging enough when hand-holding on a slightly windy day...photographing an ant on a flower. The above photo is cropped slightly, and is one of a few attempts, but that's the good part about digital, that you can take a few shots and you're likely to get the focus right on one of them.\nMacro lenses have long focus throws, which can make them slow to focus if they start hunting and need to run from one end of their focus distance to the other to find the subject in focus. There are no switches on the lens itself, but there is a focus limiter set through software which has its own button on the body. This is both smart and useful, and you can set it so that AF will use the complete focus range, macro range, or long distance range, depending on how far your subject is.\nVF-2 Electronic Viewfinder\nI finally figured something out: I like viewfinders, but I hate add-on viewfinders. If I'm going to have an electronic VF on my camera, I want it to be integrated into the body and not some piece I slide precariously into the hotshoe. The camera is small and rectangular, and the VF-2 sticks out, almost literally, like a sore thumb. I was constantly worried it would come off the hotshoe as the camera dangled from my wrist strap, and when the time came to take a shot, I found myself using the rear LCD most of the time. In the end, I just left the VF-2 at home.\nHaving said all that, this is just my experience and it has nothing to do with the VF-2 being an EVF, something it does quite well. I've read elsewhere that the image it shows is the same size as that of the Panasonic G2 and GH2, but to me it felt smaller (I couldn't compare them side to side), though still a good enough size for me. I liked that it could be tilted up by 90 degrees, which came in handy when taking flower shots lying on the ground, and even when shooting standing up but crouching down a bit, as I could just tilt my head down saving me from bending my knees so much.\nThe EVF has a very generous diopter adjustment and photographers with glasses should be able to see the whole frame without problems; plus, the rubber cup won't scratch their glasses. I nice touch is that the rigid pleather case it comes with has a small collar allowing you to attach it to the camera strap.\nShooting with the GXR in the Real World\nI went out shooting often with my new tiny friend, and it was an overall enjoyable experience. I shot mainly in Av with the rear rocking dial set to control ISO; the two Fn buttons were set for Snap Focus and Focus Mode, and EV comp. was available via the zoom buttons whenever necessary. If I wanted to move the focus point, I had to press the rocking dial, choose the appropriate icon, click again, then manoeuvre the AF region to where I wanted it. It sounds complicated, but once I'd done it a few times I was able to go through the motions quickly and use it even for non-stationary subjects. Oh, and if this was the last function used on this dial, clicking it again would bring it up directly, saving some time.\nAny street photographer knows that stealth is a welcome trait, and this camera helps tremendously by being almost silent. In fact, on an average street the sounds of people and vehicles drown out the soft huh-wick sound the leaf shutter makes. If I was ever spotted taking a photograph, it was not because of the camera making noise. Furthermore, it is so small, that it doesn't call attention, and I could often stand next to someone with the camera to my side, or even lifted to my chest, and they wouldn't realise I was photographing. On the occasions someone noticed, they didn't look intimidated like they do when I'm using my DSLR. And yes, I did get caught sometimes.\nAuto focus was good. Not excellent, not lightning fast, but good enough that I got the shot I wanted most of the time. Accuracy was extremely good, though not perfect, as on a few occasions the LCD picked something to focus on, but the photo was focused far behind the subject. This happened maybe 4 times over the 4 weeks I used it, so it's not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it. As for manual focus, I found little need for it thanks to Ricoh's exclusive (as far as I know) Snap Focus feature, whereby you can choose a distance and assign one of the Fn buttons to focus the camera to that distance when you press it. You can choose from 1m to 3.5m in 0.5m increments, and also 5m and infinity. I had mine set for 3.5m, which with the 28mm lens gave me a depth of field of around 3-10m when shooting wide open, and around 2m-infinity at f/4. I know this because in manual focus (or Snap Focus) modes, there is a DoF scale on the left side of the screen. All camera brands should take note.\nOnce I was familiar enough with the camera to use it without looking down, it became an extension of my arm, and I found myself shooting a lot without looking at the screen, just bringing it up to my belly, crossing my arms, from the side with my arm hanging down and tripping the shutter with my thumb... Sometimes I would lift the camera over my head, pointing it down, and because it's so small, everyone thought I was a silly tourist and didn't pay much attention. In fact, because people pay less attention to you when you don't look like you're taking a photograph, that's exactly what I did a lot of the time. Can you do this with a DSLR? Sure you can, and I do, but it's that much harder to control a DSLR with a single hand given its bulk and weight.\nI complained earlier on about the menus, but I rarely, if ever, had to access them \"in the field\", so that turned out to not be much of a problem. Shooting during the day also helped me keep ISO down, which helped IQ, but I did sometimes miss an ISO 100 option for slower shutter speeds.\nAnd speaking of slow speeds, the GXR does take its time writing to memory, so don't buy this camera if you like to spray and pray. I tested out the Continuous Drive Mode and found it took 4 shots in quick succession before locking up for several seconds while it wrote to the card. This was shooting RAW+ (there is not \"just RAW\"), so it's better in just JPEG, but it's not great either way. As for me? I rarely take more than one shot a second, so it didn't bother me. But beware here, when in Continuous Drive Mode, it doesn't matter if you take the maximum number of shots or just one, after you're done, the camera will lock up until it's finished writing the files out (obviously, it locks up longer the more shots you took). When in Single Drive Mode, you get a black out lasting about 1s after every shot, and during this time you see nothing on the LCD or EVF, and you can't take any shots. You've been warned.\nConclusions\nI like this little camera! It's unobtrusive, easy to carry, sturdy, customisable, and the 12MP sensor performs adequately. The 2 lenses I tried worked nicely, though I would have preferred a faster than f/2.5 aperture on the 50mm. The camera is a bit slow to process images and shot-to-shot times are longish in single-shot mode; for my style of shooting that was fine, but I know it will annoy other shooters. Autofocus worked well enough for me and I rarely missed a shot because of it; manual focus, on the other hand, I really hated, unless I was zone focusing, in which case it has the best system on the market. I cannot overstate how important it was to me that it has two control dials, one in front and the other in the front; this is how all cameras should be! The rear rocking dial isn't as nice to use as a wheel, but it's effective and gets the job done. Being able to shoot this camera in M mode and have dials for both aperture and shutter speed was glorious. Despite being such a lovely camera to use, it does have some issues that I suspect will keep it from selling well.\nThe main thing holding the GXR back is the lens and sensor being attached to each other. I'm sure there are many photographers who will not be able to get over this \"feature\" of the system, and they have good reasons. I think 12MP is fine for most people's needs, but the high ISO capabilities of the sensor lag behind sensors in current compacts such as the Sony NEX line, and maybe even micro-4/3. In 2 or 3 years it will be way behind micro-4/3 sensors and owners might feel cheated at having to repurchase ALL their lenses if they want a new sensor. And this is the reason why I don't expect Ricoh to sell many of these cameras. But that might be OK with Ricoh, who have always seemed to me to be that cool kid who doesn't talk to anyone in school and sits at the back of the class, but knows the answers to everything and always gets an A in every exam. However, now that Ricoh have bought Pentax, that kid might have decided to start making noise and let everyone know who he is. Will we hear his message? Or will it get lost in the cacophony of competing me-too cameras from the competition? Time will tell.\nPros\nSmall body size, yet sturdy and well built\nGood ergonomics for such a small camera\nTwo control dials\nNear-silent operation (when all sounds turned off)\nBest zone focusing system on the market\nLots of customisable external controls\nHighly customisable settings\nLots of control over noise reduction (overall levels and by ISO)\nThree custom shooting modes\nGood EVF (given current state of EVFs)\nFocus distance limiter for the 50mm macro lensor\nDid I mention it has TWO control dials on a really small body?\nCons\nNo Auto ISO in M mode\nLong shot-to-shot time\nManual focus is slow and kludgey to use\nMax ISO is only 3200\nHigh ISO IQ not up to current standards\nMagnification for manual focus is too mooshy\nRear screen and EVF ramp up when light levels are low (this is a personal pet peeve)\nLens isn't always kept wide open during live view, which can hinder manual focusing\nNiggles\nMenus slow to navigate and somewhat randomly organised\nMiddle-of-the-pack AF speed\nMax of 1/1000s shutter speed when lens wide open due to leaf shutter\nNo dedicated AF button\nCannot shoot just RAW, it has to be RAW+JPEG\nNo 1/2 stops for aperture and shutter speed, only 1/3 stops\nOnly full stops for ISO intervals\nAddendum: My Thoughts on Ricoh's Strategy with the GXR System\nSince the introduction of the GXR system I have been racking my brains trying to figure out why anyone would weld the sensor to the glass. I still don't have any definitive answers, but I do have some ideas of what Ricoh should do to boost sales of the system. I present them here for your reading pleasure.\nOffer to upgrade your lensors with a new sensor for a nominal fee, say every 2 years.\nOffer discounts if you turn in your old lensor when purchasing a new one with a better sensor. Ricoh could reuse the glass assuming they don't change optical formulas.\nCall it a test run, and just release a module with a Ricoh mount and lenses for it. If they're really smart, they'll use the upcoming M mount module with added connections so Ricoh GXR lenses can be mounted and their AF controlled, while at the same time allowing use of standard M mount lenses. Call it the GXM mount.\nLower the prices on lensors so it's not so painful to rebuy your whole collection every time a new sensor comes around.\nI doubt they'll follow idea #4, but I suspect we won't be seeing many more lensors released. You see, the fewer lenses you own, the easier it will be for you to rebuy them when you upgrade your sensor.\nIdea #3 is the one that makes the most sense, but I would be willing to bet Fuji beats them to it.\n_____________________\nMiserere is a scientist by day, which is why he tries to keep his photography passion as non-technical as possible.

I\u2019m still not at the point where the camera disappears in my hands, but I know that day is rapidly approaching.\nNow let me address different aspects of shooting with the Canon S90 .\nLCD Screen\nWhen you have a camera that lacks a viewfinder, a good LCD is important, and in every respect the S90\u2032s screen excels. It is crisp and bright; so much so that I have it set to its lowest brightness and have no problem using it in bright sunlight. The antireflective coating no doubt helps in this mission. I don\u2019t know how resistant it is to scratches (I hope you\u2019ll understand that I don\u2019t take a nail to it to find out), all I know is that there are no marks on it yet after about 1 month of living in my pocket, often with my BlackBerry. For those of you who like to wear polarised sunglasses while shooting, here is the low-down: The LCD screen is horizontally polarised, so brightness is maintained while shooting in landscape format; if you rotate the camera to portrait, however, brightness decreases considerably\nPhotos displayed on the LCD look great, and you can cycle through them with either the left/right arrows (with each photo popping up immediately) or with the rear wheel (which shows the photo shrinking as the next one flies in). When you press the up arrow in playback mode, you access the playback menu that allows you to look at photos by date, by category (a type of tag you can set in-camera) or jump them by 10 or 100. Also in playback mode, you can press MENU to start a slideshow and access options for that photo (erase, protect, rotate, add category, crop, correct red eye, resize, etc, etc; all for JPEGs except \u2018category\u2019).\nAnd speaking of playback, it can be used even when the camera is off. Just keep the play button pressed for 1s and you can browse your photos without the rest of the camera turning on or the lens extending.\nAnd here is what the screen looks like while shooting. It appears cluttered, but for me most of it just goes away when I\u2019m shooting; I only pay attention when I need to consult the histogram or know the value of a setting. Basically, I see through it unless I need to look at it.\nAllow me to decipher the less-obvious features for you: The big M tells me I\u2019m in Manual mode; the MF indicates Manual Focus; on the bottom, the green circle with holes next to the current shutter speed indicates the rear wheel is controlling it; the two green brackets to the right indicate the lens ring is controlling the aperture, currently set to f/2; the two square brackets in the lower-left corner tell me I\u2019m metering in center-weighted average mode; finally, the scale running along the bottom half of the right side is the light meter, which in this case is telling me I\u2019m 1 1/3 stops overexposed. The dark bars along the top and bottom delimit the 2:3 aspect ratio, and the grid is the famous rule of thirds, which I actually use to get straight lines straight. The center square is the area that gets blown up to roughly twice the size to aid in manual focusing. last of all, that little camera icon with the arrowhead on top tells me which way is \u201cup\u201d; turn the camera 90\u00b0 in either direction and the icon will turn to point up. But if you turn the camera upside down, the arrow will point down.\nShooting Modes\nShooting modes available are the standard M, Av, Tv, P and AUTO, plus C (custom mode), low light and SCN (scene mode, with a hefty 17 settings: portrait, landscape, night snapshot, kids & pets, indoor, sunset, night scene, fireworks, beach, underwater, aquarium, foliage, snow, color accent, color swap, nostalgic and stitch assist). Movie recording is accessed as another mode on the dial.\nScene mode names should be self-explanatory. Some of them are quite pleasing, such as the nostalgic scene (which offers 5 different \u201cnostalgic\u201d looks), while others (such as snow, or fireworks) will be superfluous to any experienced shooter who understands camera settings. The real downside is shooting is completely automatic in SCN mode, so the photographer can only control the focal length, thus rendering this mode useless for RAW shooters.\nAnother interesting mode is Low Light. Again, all you can control is focal length, while ISO varies automatically between 320 and 12,800. That\u2019s not a typo. What the camera does is bin up pixels 2\u00d72, so the output image is only 2.5MP in size (1824\u00d71368 pixels), or 1/4 the native resolution, thus gaining 2 stops in effective ISO range. Needless to say, the resulting image is a JPEG. This \u201cgain\u201d in ISO can also be achieved by downsampling a RAW file in postprocessing, and likely with better results.\nAs far as I can tell (because the manual doesn\u2019t), the only modes that give you RAW output are Av, Tv, M and P.\nNow for the modes I use the most: Av and M, the former for general shooting, the latter for low light shooting.\nAv: I seem to have settled on using the lens ring for aperture, the rear wheel for EV comp., the shortcut key for AE-L, and I change ISO through the FUNC. SET key, who\u2019s first item is ISO, thus acting like a shortcut key (see screen grab below).\nM: I\u2019m still battling for the best way to set up Manual mode for low light shooting. I am undecided between the method I described in part 1 of this review and the following: Lens ring for aperture, rear wheel for shutter speed, shortcut key for AE-L, and I change ISO as in Av above, through the FUNC. SET key. Neither are perfect, both have their drawbacks. For slow shooting, either works fine and I have no complaints, but for candid shots in low light where brightness changes quickly, I yearn for auto ISO in M mode. A quick way to set the correct exposure in M mode is to half press the shutter, then press the up key; the camera will set aperture and shutter speed to what it considers appropriate.\nFocal Lengths and Maximum Aperture\nI complained in part 1 about how slow this lens was towards the long end so I thought it would be useful to list here how the maximum aperture changes with focal length in order to help owners better choose what focal lengths to use if they want to maximise light gathering.\nCanon S90 maximum aperture\n"}], [{"score": 429.76614, "uuid": "9ccff074-bcde-5513-899c-db7b2ff34bc4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0902wb-68-25868", "target_hostname": "www.daydreamlily.com", "target_uri": "http://www.daydreamlily.com/2010/08/panasonic-lumix-g-series.html", "page_rank": 1.2131995e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Win <em>a</em> Panasonic Lumix G2 | DAYDREAM LILY", "snippet": "(reading through the comments so far <em>I</em> feel like Kit Palaskas <em>should</em> win <em>for</em> such beautiful words, as much as <em>I</em> would like to take better&#x2F;more <em>photographs</em> <em>for</em> my own blog)... it would definitely make me <em>a</em> better photographer because right now all <em>i</em> use is the <em>camera</em> on my iphone.", "explanation": null, "document": "Sponsored by NuffNang\nI was super excited when NuffNang told me about a new campaign with the latest Panasonic Lumix G2.

Olympus is a late-comer to this market segment but with a 28mm to 112mm equivalent f/1.8 to f/2.5 image stabilized zoom lens, face detection, a 3 inch 610K dot resolution screen, ISO up to 3200 (6400 at reduced resolution), and the ability to shoot 720p HD video, it has entered the fray fully armed. At 4.35 x 2.55 x 1.67\" and weighing just under 10 ounces, it is small and light. And if you already own the VF-2 finder for one of it\u0092s bigger siblings from the Olympus line of m4/3 cameras, there is a spot for it on the top of this camera as well.\nControls and Settings\nWhat can I say? Controls and Settings - check. It\u0092s got \u0091em. As you can see from the above picture, it\u0092s back features a pretty standard array of buttons for this size camera. It has the standard function (or \u0093OK\u0094) button for accessing settings such as ISO, white balance, etc., surrounded by the larger rocker button that allows even quicker access to exposure compensation, flash setting, single/multiple/timer setting and macro. That is surrounded by a wheel to change the settings. Really the only button back there that isn\u0092t pretty self-explanatory is the chrome one with the red dot in the middle of it up on the right top corner. That is instant access to the video mode - press the button and the camera starts shooting video. Press it again to stop the video. A nice touch if you want to shoot some video without having to change settings or access a menu. Push the menu button and a host of options are before you in a clear, organized, no frills screen. The screen itself is high resolution and high contrast.\nSitting atop the camera are the shutter release, the zoom control, the on/off button, and the dial for choosing the shooting mode, which includes the standard shutter priority, aperture priority, full auto for letting the camera make the choices, full manual, scene (portrait, landscape, etc.) and \u0093art.\u0094 A lot of people seem to get excited over the \u0093art\u0094 filters (Pop Art, Soft Focus, Grainy Film, Pin Hole, Diorama and Dramatic Tone) which each give a picture a certain \u0093look\u0094 pretty much self-described by the names. But, as with the S95, I shot this camera in RAW using Aperture Priority and processed the files in Lightroom 3 and Nik Silver Efex Pro 2 because I like to use all of the information a camera gives me and decide for myself what to do with it. I think these filters were first introduced by Olympus in their mid-range DSLR E30 a couple of years ago, so it is nice that they have put them in this camera too, though I think a far more appropriate name for these would be \u0093Fun\u0094 filters rather than \u0093Art\u0094 filters. Not that there is anything wrong with fun - that\u0092s why we\u0092re all into photography to some degree (I hope).\nLast, but certainly not least - the late entry by Olympus has allowed it to to borrow/steal/be inspired by some of the better ideas in compact camera design, including that adjustment ring around the front lens from the Canon S90/S95 cameras. It is nicely implemented although, unlike the Canon version, one can\u0092t assign functions to it - each setting comes with its own pre-determined use of the ring. For Aperture Priority, for example, it controls the aperture setting. Well, that\u0092s what I would have used it for anyhow so it worked fine for me.\nIn the Field\nIn the field this little camera is a gem. Not as \u0093pocketable\u0094 as the Canon Powershot S95 though.\nOn paper, the XZ-1 is only slightly larger, but that small increase in size means that, unlike the S95, it is not a comfortable fit for a shirt pocket. In fact, it is a bit tight in my khakis and forget about tucking it into your jeans. It is a nice fit for the pockets of cargo shorts, though. All things considered, It is still a very compact camera given its image quality.\nI found the auto focus to be quick enough for me. It is still in the \u0093compact camera\u0094 class, which is to say it takes a moment to lock on - a bit longer than a DSLR, though it seemed to me to be slightly faster than the S95. I don\u0092t think it is a deal breaker increase in speed if one wants or needs the small size of the S95.\nI had both this and the S95 at the same time to review, and went into it thinking that I would like both cameras about the same. But the Olympus was, to me, the better, more fun, camera. First of all, I like its looks. I like the fact that the lens has glass you can actually see - it looks like a \u0093real\u0094 lens, not a compact lens. Now the built-in automatic lens cover in the S95 is a great thing, but there is something about the bigger lens that appeals to me - maybe its my retro sensibilities. But the attraction is not limited to the way the XZ-1 lens looks - I also like it\u0092s faster speed. At f/1.8 vs. the S95\u0092s f/2.0 at the wide end, there isn\u0092t a lot of difference. But the smaller S95 lens loses speed quickly as one zooms, with a max f/4.9 by the tele end. The larger XZ-1 lens has a max of f/2.5 at its longest zoom. That is quite a difference and I like it - it allows use of faster shutter speeds, lower ISOs and allows some limited depth of field even when fully zoomed.\nAdd to that the fact that this lens is really sharp, even wide open, and in my opinion, you have a winner here.\nI would be remiss if I didn\u0092t mention something though. While carrying the camera in my hand I noticed a certain wobble going on internally. After some investigation I discovered the source - it is the lens! The individual stacked rings that make up the lens when it extends fit together loosely - they actually wobble inside each other. Turn on the camera and gently wiggle the lens and the individual elements still move slightly. Now to be fair, the very first digital camera I ever owned was a 4mp Olympus C-4000z way back when and it\u0092s lens did the same thing, except much more. So I assume this is a deliberate design by Olympus. It doesn\u0092t seem to adversely affect performance in any way. Still, I thought I should mention it.\nThe OLED screen makes focusing, composition and review of pictures a snap, even in bright lighting. It has great contrast and sharpness and the color are bold and rich. Not accurate mind you, but saturated. The lack of accuracy didn\u0092t bother me - I mostly want the screen to work well enough for me to see what I am shooting and see if I have got the shot I want afterwards. So, this screen does it\u0092s job well, though to be honest I found it no more usable than the more straightforward LCD on the S95 which has about \u2154 as many pixels.\nThe camera comes with a lens cap that attaches using friction only, and could be easily lost but for the fact that Olympus thoughtfully includes a strap to attach it. In operation, it works simply and well - turn on the camera and the extending lens pops the cap off and you are ready to shoot.\nIn terms of macro, the lens has two settings, and both are easy to use. There is \u0093macro:\u0094\nand there is \u0093super-macro:\u0094\nI didn\u0092t really look up how close each would allow, but obviously \u0093super\u0094 let you get closer - though you can\u0092t zoom and are stuck with the lens at its widest.\nAll in all, I found this a very usable camera in the field - in fact, from a \u0093walking around with a camera standpoint,\u0094 this is one of my favorite cameras of all time - it just hits all the right notes for me.\nResults\nIn comparing results with those from the S95, I think the image quality is comparable. The XZ-1 files have a little more noise at any given ISO, but also a hint more detail and sharpness.\nEven at ISO 400, I found the image quality to be outstanding.\nThere is a fair amount of noise in the shadows, even at ISO 100. In this scene the shadows on the walls, particularly in the upper corners, were pretty dark, and the resulting noise when I lightened them was something of a surprise - but I was able to fix it easily in Lightroom without resorting to any additional noise reduction software.\nAs with every compact camera I have ever used, the dynamic range of the XZ-1 is not great. However, it is plenty \u0093good enough\u0094 for most situations. A little care, and reference to the live histogram (a feature I love on compacts) should keep you on the right course. Plus I found the metering system to be really good in this camera - I really didn\u0092t have to resort to exposure compensation very often to get consistently good results in a variety of lighting situations.\nOne of the potential problems with images from compact cameras is that their pixels, from the smaller pixels in compacts, can\u0092t be manipulated (or as I prefer, \u0093tortured\u0094) as much as those from cameras with larger pixels - even when using RAW. Sometimes technical quality must be sacrificed for aesthetic quality (in my opinion) if the \u0093mood\u0094 of a picture is more important to the photographer. This is one (of many) reasons I prefer black and white for many of my pictures - to my eye those can be pushed to limits, and sometimes beyond, better than color pictures. I tortured a few shots and think they turned out well.\nI printed this one at approximately 12 x 16\u0094 and it turned out great with lots of texture and detail.\nA few less tortured but still very \u0093tweaked\u0094 shots:\nAnd finally a few with minimal tweaks:\nConclusion\nI love this camera. I love the fast, sharp lens, I love the intuitive controls, I love the build quality, I love the image quality, I love the small size. I wish it were a little more \u0093pocketable,\u0094 but I suspect the faster lens had to be this size and so Olympus wisely built a body to balance with it. It is still small enough to take everywhere. It is a beauty to admire and it takes great pictures. How great? Well, according to the algorithms at Flickr (and who can argue with Flickr\u0092s algorithms?), 4 of my top 12 most interesting pictures of all time were taken with this camera. Actually 3 of my top 10. Actually my number one most interesting picture of all time. Pretty amazing. Now I\u0092m going to say that this is as much because of my affection for this camera as it is about the camera itself. All I can say, really, in conclusion is that I really enjoyed shooting this camera and I found the resulting files were very satisfying. It doesn\u0092t have AEL or AFL (that is, Auto Exposure Lock or Auto Focus Lock), but I have to say that I never even noticed. It did an outstanding job of focusing on the intended subject no matter where it was in the frame and so I didn\u0092t really have to focus and then recompose - something that can benefit from such locks. It probably should have those features, but I personally didn\u0092t miss them.\nComparisons\nWell this whole review has been filled with comparisons between this camera and the Canon Powershot S95 , primarily for 2 reasons - 1) I think the Canon is the standard by which other nominally \u0093pocketable\u0094 compacts are judged these days; and 2) I had both of them at the same time to compare. Despite my personal preference for the Oly, let me be clear that I think quite comparable results can be obtained with the two cameras - that is, I think both are fantastic. If the smaller size of the S95 appeals to you, and you don\u0092t mind that its lens is slow at the tele end, then you can\u0092t really go wrong with the S95. Also, it is $100 or more cheaper. On the other hand, I think the XZ-1 benefits in design from its late entry into the battle, as it has been wonderfully thought out and is designed as a real photographer\u0092s tool. It is a joy to use and it produces outstanding results for its size.\n_____________________\nJeff Damron has been photographing since receiving a Minolta SLR and a basic darkroom setup in 1976.

Because it is a well designed, well built, largish \u201ccompact\u201d camera with a largish \u201csmall\u201d sensor, a largish and fast manual zoom lens, a \u201creal\u201d viewfinder, and an array of bells and whistles that are, for the most part, actually useful? Yes. Oh, and it has amazing image quality for a compact as well.\nTwo things before we start really talking about this camera. First, this came out at a horrible time for me! All the autumn foliage is gone here and this area looks bleak! Plus it has rained a lot! So barren trees and rain - not the best combination. Also, I have been very busy with my day time job lately. So I have not had the opportunity to shoot this little camera like I would like. Secondly, my normal workflow is to shoot RAW and work on everything in Lightroom. This is probably due to the fact that I developed and printed my own black and white pictures in a darkroom. So I think Ansel Adams was right - the negative is the score and the print is the performance. In short, I\u2019m used to tweaking my shots during the printing process. Plus, I shot and developed my film to maximize detail without losing anything in the shadows or highlights. That ensured I obtained printable negatives, and that made shooting easy and the \u2018thinking\u201d came when I was printing. Shooting RAW is much the same - there is nothing missing from the \u201clossy\u201d JPEG compression, white balance can be tweaked, and I can save a good deal of my \u201cthinking\u201d until I am in front of my computer screen with a nice warm (or cold) beverage at my side. When I received this camera the only software that could be used on RAW files was Silkypix - software so maligned by others that I didn\u2019t even want to try it. So, contrary to my usual habits, I shot JPEGs exclusively. This camera produces gorgeous JPEGs as it turns out, so that is okay. But there are so many options to apply that I had to do more thinking when shooting than is normal and natural for me.\nControls and Settings\nThe Fujifilm X10 has the usual controls found on enthusiast level compacts - physical buttons for accessing many of the most common choices on the back arrayed around a 2.8 inch 460K dot LCD screen. You have a lot of options as to what information you want displayed on the screen, including the always handy live histogram for avoiding clipped highlights and lost shadows. The button for accessing the menu is surrounded by the standard circular rocker control that allows one touch access to macro modes, the self timer, flash settings, etc., that in turn is surrounded by a knurled wheel for navigating menus. There is a button to allow quick changes in auto exposure and auto focus modes, to lock the auto exposure and auto focus, to access white balance, to shoot in RAW if you are shooting in JPEG, and a horizontal wheel for making adjustments - such as to the selected aperture when in Aperture mode. There is a small dial on the front of the camera to choose between single or continuous auto focus, or if you prefer, manual focus. Other reviewers have complained about how difficult manual focus is with this camera. The auto focus works very well so I didn\u2019t even try the manual focus mode.\nSize-wise, the Fujifilm X10 is near the top of the \u201ccompact\u201d heap, rivaling my Olympus E-420 in size. I would classify both as \u201ccoat pocketable\u201d - the Fuji a little more so than the E-420 with 25mm Zuiko pancake lens. Neither of them are going in your jeans though.\nThe top of the Fujifilm X10 features a dial for exposure compensation up to +2 and -2 in \u2153 stop increments. Always a hit with me. Plus there is an Fn button you program to your choice of menu shortcut functions. I started with it tied to ISO but later changed it to access the \u201cfilm simulation\u201d modes. There is also, of course, a dial for accessing the many modes of this camera. You turn the camera on by twisting the lens. Some have raved over this. It is okay with me, though so different that it took some time for me to get used to it. There is also a hot shoe for an accessory flash if you want to use one. The camera has a tiny built-in flash as well, as is typical for a compact camera.\nThe lens is great, by the way. A fine, sharp shooter, that opens up to a fast f/2.8 at its 112mm equivalent max tele end, and to an even faster f/2.0 at its 28mm equivalent wide end. And the fact that it is a manual zoom means you can zoom to absolutely any length in between and are not limited to the \u201csteps\u201d of the typical compact zoom lens.\nAnother feature of the Fujifilm X10 is a real, bright, glass, zooming optical viewfinder with built-in diopter to provide sharp views for every eye. It only covers 85% of what the camera sees, and doesn\u2019t have parallax correction for accuracy. And the lens intrudes into view at the wider settings. So, not the greatest viewfinder in the world, but usable when you, for example, are in a dark place and don\u2019t want your face lit up with distracting light from the LCD (which can be turned off).\nThe \u2154\u201d EXR 12MP CMOS sensor and the EXR processor in this machine work together brilliantly! A bit larger than sensors in other compacts (except for those like the Fujifilm X100, Sigma DP line and Leica X1 that feature APS-C sized sensors), but a fair amount smaller than m4/3 sensors, I am amazed at its ability to handle low light, high ISO situations. Part of that success comes from the processor\u2019s ability to combine pixels, which can be used to either increase the dynamic range (allowing greater detail in shadows and highlights), or to decrease noise in high ISO shots (for producing cleaner pictures in low light situations). The upside is that this really seems to work! Fujifilm has included this technology in cameras with smaller sensors and the general consensus seemed to be that the technology worked better at increasing dynamic range than decreasing noise, but it seemed to me to work well for both purposes with this larger sensor. But there is no free lunch, right? Everything is a trade off in photography. The trade off here is that you end up with a 6MP image instead of a 12MP image. I have a 12x18 picture from my old 6MP Digital Rebel hanging in my living room, so I can live with that trade-off.\nThis is EXR mode\u2019s high ISO and low noise option at ISO 3200 with Astia film simulation (soft colors)\nThis is EXR mode\u2019s high dynamic range mode. Yeah, some burn out but that is the sun!\nOkay, so let\u2019s talk about options. There is the standard Aperture priority (\u201cA\u201d), shutter priority (\u201cS\u201d) and program priority (\u201cP\u201d - for professional according to some videos annoying \u201cserious\u201d photographers on Youtube these days (at MWAC Attack-Episode 1: The Camera - YouTube ), plus manual (\u201cM\u201d). There are two \u201ccustom\u201d modes on the dial for saving favorite settings that I didn\u2019t use. There is a setting for making 1080p HD movies that I didn\u2019t use. There is an \u201cAuto\u201d setting. I\u2019m frankly not sure how that differs from the \u201cP\u201d setting to be honest as I never use either of those. Actually, of all of these I only used aperture priority. There is an \u201cSP\u201d (\u201cSemi-Professional?) setting. Oh wait, that stands for \u201cScene Position\u201d and allows you to choose from such presets as \u201cportrait,\u201d and \u201cportrait enhancer\u201d (why ever do a portrait when you can do an enhanced one?) and \u201clandscape\u201d and \u201csport,\u201d etc. So yeah, Semi-Professional.\nWhen it comes down to it, there are only 2 options on that dial that interested me other than aperture priority. Those are \u201cEXR\u201d and \u201cAdv.\u201d EXR allows access to the options for extended dynamic range and high ISO with low noise, which both reduce the output to 6MP by combining information from the 12MP sensor. There is oddly a third option under EXR - high resolution to make sure you end up with a 12MP image. Not sure how that is different than just selecting \u201cFine\u201d image quality in the menu. (The menu, by the way, is not this camera\u2019s finest feature - more on that later.)\n\u201cAdv.\u201d is short for \u201cAdvanced\u201d - \u201csophisticated techniques made easy\u201d according to the manual. (The manual, by the way, is also not the finest feature - more on that later too.). Anyhow, choose this on the mode dial and you can access three more options in the menu - motion panorama 360, pro focus, and pro low-light. The first allows you to capture a panorama by \u201csweeping\u201d the camera around up to 360 degrees. I actually achieved about a 390 or more since my car is in that particular picture twice.\nSo yeah, it works okay. The second one gives a sharp subject but a blurry background \u201csimilar to those produced by SLR cameras\u201d the manual brags. Another feature I did not try. However, the third option, \u201cpro low-light\u201d provides yet another way to eliminate noise in high ISO shots. The camera quickly takes 4 exposures which it combines into 1 picture. This seems to work well as long as the scene is stationary so the 4 images are of the same subject.\nThis is the first picture I have ever made of one our Christmas trees that has earned my wife\u2019s approval!\nWhat is there to dislike? Well, as I mentioned, I found the camera\u2019s menu system to be subpar. It just didn\u2019t seem all that intuitive and required too much wading through long option lists. The menus on the Canon S95 and Olympus XZ-1 I reviewed back in the summer, by comparison, were much more intuitive. This is not helped by the fact that the Fujifilm X10 has so many options. It could really benefit from a menu system that is easier to navigate. Although, to be honest, I was getting through the choices much quicker after using the camera for a while. So, not a deal breaker by any means, but an annoyance. Choices you can make in the menu include \u201cfilm simulation\u201d(the color ones named after Fuji slide films - Velvia for vivid, Provia for normal and Astia for reduced saturation which is good for portraits), plus several black and white options including use of several color filters and a sepia toned option), ISOs up to 3200 in fine mode (up to 6400 in \u201cM\u201d mode which is 6 MP and up to 12,800 for even smaller pictures) plus auto ISOs with a choice of top sensitivity of either 400, 800, 1600 or 3200, image size (L, M, S) and dimensions (4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 1:1), image quality (fine or normal), dynamic range, and on and on. Suffice it to say that you can customize how you want your JPEGs in a ton of ways, though I don\u2019t know why anyone would buy this camera and set the image quality to anything less than fine or image size to anything less than L (except for those EXR settings that produce 6MP \u201cM\u201d sized images).\nNow the manual would be a logical place to go try to figure out all of the choices available. But if the menu is a bit muddled, the manual is worse. I learned more from just playing with the various options on the camera, and from pointers picked up on the forums here at Serious Compacts, than I did initially from the manual. I think that if you already are familiar with the X100 this camera will be easier for you to master. However, again, I have to admit that now that I know my way around this little gem a little better, the manual is a bit clearer and more helpful.\nIn summary, this camera is customizable in an almost infinite number of ways, making it a good fit for however you shoot as long as you take the time to learn it and set it up your way.\nIn the Field\nIn the field, in the house, in the yard - where ever I took it, this camera was a joy to use. A Joy! I had to do a little thinking (a dangerous pastime, I know) to decide how saturated I wanted the picture, or if I wanted monotone, whether I thought a boost to dynamic range or a high ISO was needed, etc. But I caught on quick enough as to what I needed to do to get the look I wanted from each picture. With a little use, a little internet research, a little review of the manual, and a little experimenting, this camera becomes easy to use and offers a diverse, useful and powerful tool set.\nResults\nEnough words, lets look at some pictures.\nHere\u2019s a couple that were made using \u201cVelvia\u201d film simulation:\nAnd a few taken in \u201cProvia\u201d mode:\n(ISO 400)\nHere\u2019s another one of my dog Buddy shot at ISO 1600 with no EXR or Adv. processing but a curves adjustment and some vignette applied in Lightroom:\nAnd this one was shot at ISO 1250, also without EXR or Adv. processing:\nThis shot of one of the vintage ornaments on our Christmas tree was made in EXR\u2019s high ISO and low noise mode at ISO 2000, also using the macro mode:\nThese were both at ISO 3200 (EXR mode) and are straight out of the camera:\nThis one is also from the EXR mode at ISO 3200 with the BW conversion made in Nik Silver Efex Pro 2:\nand a crop at 100% from that earlier pic of my Christmas tree in \u201cPro Low-Light\u201d mode::\nThe \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201csuper-macro\u201d (which allows you to get closer than mere \u201cmacro\u201d but not to zoom) settings work wonderfully.\nThe Fujifilm X10 also has built in black and white options, including replication of common filters used in monochrome, such as yellow, red and green. The option works well for those who prefer SOOC:\nI personally still prefer doing my BW conversions in Nik Silver Efex though:\nJPEGs from this camera hold up pretty well to a lot of adjustment:\nas evidenced by this before\nand after\nConclusion\nThe Fujifilm X10 is an excellent camera - a tool that gives a dedicated user a lot of options in a relatively small package. Thanks to its fast lens, large sensor, EXR processing and image stabilization, the ability to work in low light is amazing. It\u2019s retro styling and all-black construction makes it discreet yet elegant. It can be made virtually silent to operate and turning off the LCD screen and using the optical viewfinder means you can shoot almost anywhere. One would expect a compact in this price range to perform well in good lighting, and this camera does, but its versatility makes it a real star. I\u2019m not a fan of the menus system but that is becoming less and less of an issue. I am a big fan of everything else about this camera. I know there have been complaints about white balls, orbs, globes, spots - whatever - in specular highlights, but my camera has exhibited none of those problems. My camera is a champ!\nComparisons\nComparing the Fujifilm X10 to other fixed lens compacts I have used recently, I have to say that it overall has the best image quality. I love the look of pictures from the Foveon sensor in the Sigma DP2x , but that camera is not nearly as versatile. The Fuji lens is one stop faster at its widest setting, has higher ISOs, looks better at higher ISOs and has much, has image stabilization and much better auto-focus.\nThe X10 also has much better image quality than the Olympus XZ-1 and the Canon S95 I previously reviewed. Those cameras are, on the other hand, far more \u201cpocketable.\u201d The Oly has an excellent lens that, like the X10, is fast at f/2.0 to 2.8 throughout its range. The Canon has a slower lens (though it starts at a fast f/2.0 at the wide end) but it does fully retract. It is the only one of these cameras that can be carried comfortably in a shirt pocket (big shirt pocket, that is). So if portability is a concern, there are definitely more portable compacts.\nBut let me end with this. Though I have liked all of the cameras I have tested for Serious Compacts, I have never actually bought one before. That ends here. You may have notice that I started referring to this specimen as \u201cmy\u201d camera late in this review. I purchased the X10 . It fills a niche for me. The Oly E420 and 25mm pancake lens are going on ebay. And though I will probably end up buying an even smaller compact to fill another niche, I believe this will be the camera I reach for most for the foreseeable future. And, as the newly released Lightroom 3.6 now supports this camera, I will be shooting some RAW and will post something on my thoughts regarding that. But I will sleep easy in the meantime knowing that the JPEGS are great and may, in fact, well end up being what I shoot most.\n_____________________\nJeff Damron has been photographing since receiving a Minolta SLR and a basic darkroom setup in 1976.

Even at -50\u00b0C they work perfectly (any other kind dies pitifully, especially the kind of small lithium batteries they put in most compacts nowadays). They even make other batteries with that technology, like AAA or the\nCR2 for the Ricoh. But in the unlikely event that you have to withstand temperatures below even that, know that no battery in the world can help you, unless you want to lug a car battery around. Directly linked to this battery issue is the fact that digital cameras die very fast in the cold as they drain more power. To give you an idea, at -70\u00b0C my F100 would last about 30 minutes while a more recent D70 wouldn't last more than 3 or 4 minutes.\nSo in summary it's a very good idea to carry a spare set of batteries in a warm pocket. If you need to warm up a battery fast, put it under you armpit, directly against the skin.\nI don't recommend carrying the camera under your clothes too close to the body since the sweat will fog it when you put it back from outside (not only the lens, but also the film inside, leaving grey spots on the pics), but sometimes it's the only solution.\nIn extreme cold conditions the film may freeze and break in the camera, and this has happened once to me after having left the camera in long exposure at -70\u00b0C. Solutions involve wrapping the camera in insulating foil and dropping a couple heat packs underneath or bringing the camera back inside to let it warm up before advancing the film. Note that this is not an option with motorized cameras. For this reason for my winterover in Dome C I bought an old Nikon EM for 50$ on eBay. I would just put it on a tripod outside, trigger it with a cable release and let it for a bunch of hours to do star rotations, shooting stars and satellite overpasses, then bring it back inside and let it warm before the next shoot. Also having a manual film advance lets you wind the film carefully.\nRight: The green stripes are where the gelatin on the film broke during advancement. This film later snapped completely while shooting for 7 hours at -70\u00b0C and I had to retrieve it in the darkroom.\nAnother strange issue I've had to deal with in extreme cold (think well below -50\u00b0C) is exploding batteries. Three times I've had batteries become so hot in either my GPS or my camera that they scorched the skin against the pocket where they were. They didn't really explode but when I pulled them out they were all bloated. So again, a manual camera with the battery removed will work just fine, you just have to guess the appropriate exposure.\nAbout very cold weather you'll still hear this old story that you need to have the grease removed from the camera as it can harden and lock the mechanisms... Well for several decades there haven't been any grease inside cameras, only very liquid synthetic lubricants that don't harden with the cold, so rest easy.\nAlso practice operating your camera at home while wearing big gloves. There will be times when you don't want to remove them to fiddle with little button settings or tiny wheels. In other words, if there are functions that you cannot use with gloves, learn to do without. For instance I personally like to use the camera in Aperture Priority mode and turn the aperture wheel manually; but it's impossible to do with gloves, so on cold days I just set the camera to Program mode.\nAnd while we are at it, if you have a tiny P&S, be careful not to put your glove in front of the lens... Yeah, I know it sounds like stupidly obvious advice but you won't believe how many mountain climbing pictures I've seen with a fuzzy red blob in the corner.\nLeft: The Concordia 2005 winterover team united during the record low temperature of the winter: -78.6\u00b0C. Camera on a tripod which didn't stay outside for long (neither did we with removed face masks). (Photo Karim Agabi)\n\"My advice for climbers or photographers is to really tune into your own passions and not just what other people are doing or aren't doing. Figure out what works for you, what turns you on, what gives you the greatest amount of energy and feeling of satisfaction.\"\n\u2014\u00a0Galen Rowell.\nMisc issues\nFilm choice\nUse slide film; as you can't get as much detail with negatives, except when comparing high sensitivities which you'll never use for climbing anyway; and slide shows with friends and a good glass/mug/bucket of wine can be so fun... Same goes for digital, use the lowest sensitivity of your camera (usualy 100iso, 50 or 200).\nI used to use mostly Fujichrome Velvia 50 asa slide film. 50 asa is not much, but when you are on snow or with a wide aperture lens you get great results. Colors are awesome and grain is virtually non existent. Personally I like it better than even Kodachrome 25\u00a0! The bluish hue on some of my pictures is due to the altitude. The Velvia, when underexposed, will give you green snow. Yuk\u00a0!\nIn 2000, the new Fujichrome Provia 100F made me change my mind. It has the same grain as the Velvia, colors almost as saturated and it gives you more flexibility in the exposure. I sometimes take B&W, in which case I use Fuji Acros 100 (after a decade with the Kodak T-Max 100) and an orange-red or greenish filter.\nIf you have a digital camera and you find the hues on the image to be somewhat off, there are two things to do:\ncalibrate your screen and take RAW files which you can later process in software to extract the proper color balance.\nLeft: The effect of light coming parallel to the rock, enhancing every tiny edge. That's me on a 5.11d at Shelf Road, Colorado .\nRight: Example of digital manipulation put to good use: sequence of pictures of Jason on SuperCrack in Utah . Put the camera on a tripod, take a bunch of shots, scan them all then use the clone brush of your graphic program to copy the different climbers from each separate shot.\nThe right time\nMostly, when in the mountains, the trade secret for the best landscapes is to take the pictures at the right time: around sunset and sunrise you have a 10 minutes window when the light is great (less at the equator , a lot more near the poles ).\nAvoid taking pictures in the middle of the day, except if you can have the light of the sun parallel to a cliff, thus casting long shadows off tiny outcrops and highlighting details. Look at the picture on the right to have an idea of what I mean by that: see how the skin of the climber (me) is burned out by too much direct light, while the tiniest holds on the rock are visible.\nWatch for cloud movements. Wait while they are in front of the sun if you expect them to go away.\nPolarizing filter\nIts function is to stop any light that is not polarized according to a given angle. This polarization angle is an intrinsic property of every photon of light. So when used on a normal beam of light it just stops half of the photons (since they come with random angles), requiring more exposure. Now if the light is polarized in the same direction as the filter, it goes through unchanged; if it is polarized 90\u00b0 from it, it is stopped entirely. Now what does this have to do with climbing\u00a0? Different physical mechanisms can polarize a normally random light, first of all a reflection (on glass or on a surface of water), but also the diffraction of the light of the sun by the atmosphere. This diffraction is most effective 90\u00b0 from the sun: look at the sky through a polarizing filter: in the direction of the sun or 180\u00b0 away from it, there's no difference; 90\u00b0 left or right you can darken it a lot by turning the filter. Know how to place the camera in respect to your subject while pointing 90\u00b0 from the sun; and yes, this works great on digital cameras too.\nFilters\nAs you don't want to haul tons of accessories with you up a climb, the two main filters used for climbing photography are the UV filter and the polarizing filter. The first one stops the UV from getting through the lens. It doesn't make a huge difference at sea level, but at altitude where the amount of UV is quite high it does reduce the blueish hue of the pictures (note that if you have a digital camera you can emulate it by using the white balance function, and if you have a scanner you can use the color balance filters to remove it afterwards). Besides that, its true use is to protect the front lens against shocks, falling ice, bouncing against rocks and scraping in the pack in case you loose your lens cap. When selecting a UV filter in a store, open all the various models' packages and place them on a white sheet of paper; select the least colored one. Avoid skylight filters which give a pinkinsh hue to the images.\nThe polarizing filters come in two varieties, circular required for AF cameras and linear for manual or compact cameras. The effect is the same. This filter makes darker skies on pictures when used properly, it increases colour saturation and it brings out clouds and foliage against the sky. Its drawbacks are: it eats up about 2 stops of light, you need to rotate it each time for best results, it's a pain to use on lenses with a rotating front lens and it gives weird results on wide angles (half the sky clear, the other half dark). If the atmosphere is loaded with humidity, there's not much effect, but at very high altitude it can give you a not very natural looking ink-black sky that makes it look like you are climbing in outer space ... It's possible to use polarizing filters on some compact camera, but you have to remove it each time to figure out the angle of rotation by sight, and you must overexpose by two stops (most compacts don't let you do that though).\nExposure\nPlenty of people will say \"over-expose on snow\", \"use the spot meter\", \"meter your hand\", \"Use the 1/16 rule\" and other tricks, but the truth is, with modern SLRs you can trust the matrix metering in 99% of the situations, even on snow. You have a doubt, a violently backlit subject or a potential exceptional shot\u00a0? Take 2 additional shots, braketting lighter and darker by one stop. Film is cheap compared to having to hike in again to take the same shot, don't you think\u00a0?\nThe only time I consistently over-expose are on north-facing ice climbs, otherwise the ice turns out too dark. And also sometimes on rock climbing in the shade, particularly if the background is lower and in the sun, it will trick the meter.\nLeft: Notice how the flash brightens up the ice, particularly the falling chunks which would be invisible otherwise. That's Jenny ice climbing in the Ouray ice park, Colodaro .\nWhen there is a lot of contrast, think about using a flash. It's not useful if everything is in the shade (it will only make the foreground appear too bright and the background too dark), but there are 2 places where it's quite good: rock climbing and ice climbing. Rock climbers always have their face turned towards the rock, cutting off the light. Use the flash, associated with the rear-curtain, to light it up a bit. Only problem is that, because of the distances involved, you need a powerful flash for that, and it's not very convenient to carry an external flash up a mountain. For ice climbing the context is different since usually the climb happens on a north face and there's no sun; even a small flash from a compact camera will put reflections and sparkles in the ice. Just remember that most compacts' flashes won't work further than 2~3 meters. Notice the flash enhancing the falling ice on the picture on the right ?\nTripod\nYes, a tripod is always useful, think about night pictures, star rotations, climbing sequences, long stands waiting for that 9a move, self portraits... Three choices only for climbers:\nA very small super light one that fits in a pocket. Even if it's all plastic and can barely hold the weight of your camera, it's good enough to put the camera on a rock and orient it the direction you want. Most photo stores have those for cheap. Really take the smallest so you will not be tempted to leave it at home\u00a0!\nThe Gitzo Mountaineer G1128 is quite expensive but very lightweight thanks to its carbon structure. The legs fold in 4 so it will fit in a pack even though it's a full 1m40 extended (not counting the optional head).\nAnything heavy that will always gather dust at home or stay in the car...\nWhile climbing\nRight: Jenny and Lisa merging vertical perspective while climbing in Golden, Colorado . 20mm.\nAs you will notice soon enough, it's quite hard to climb and take pictures at the same time. No I don't mean it literally. If you want to do the hardest routes, you can't afford the burden of a camera. If you want to take well crafted pictures you can't spend most of your time/energy climbing. It's a tradeoff.\nOne handed operation is very important. Some cameras like the Ricoh can be pulled out of the pouch, turned on, used and tugged safely back inside only with the right hand. Same, if a little harder with the F100. So it's a good point for checking out a camera in a Mom&Pop store instead of ordering it on Internet. For instance the Fujifilm Silvi F2.8 has one trigger button on each side, indeed a rare camera for left handed people.\nFor rock climbing, get a locking belaying device. It will allow you to take pictures while belaying (well, kind of...). Just don't let your partner see you\u00a0! If you have a small P&S camera, keep it in your breast pocket (or some other pocket that won't get crushed if you fall off).\nWhile belaying, attach the camera to a shoulder sling with a biner, let it hang away from rock and belaying device. Remove the lens cap. pre-focus it and set it to some Program mode while your partner is not moving (or not looking); this way you can grab it and take a shot in less than a second when she is in the heat of action. Also if it was your lead, try to organize the belay so as to facilitate photography: make your tie-in line just the right length so you can look over the ledge safely (that's why I prefer to tie in with a clove hitch instead of an often too short daisy chain).\nRight: Where's the bottom, where's the top\u00a0? Example of lost perspective at Golden, Colodaro .\nAdvanced tricks\nSome advanced cameras (like the MF-21 databack for the Nikon F801s ) allow you to do tricks like very long exposure (good for night pictures with star rotations, picture 1 above), automatic multiple exposures (picture 3 above) or long-delay self-portraits if you want to take pictures of yourself while you are quite far (picture 2 above).\nI like to keep track of the date and time a picture was taken, but I hate to see it on the pictures. For film, a solution is the databack for the Nikon F4/F5 which prints it between the frames (but inconvenient on slides since it disappears under the mount). Better is a cable+software to retrieve them like HarTalk , but you still have to sort things out. The best solution so far is some Contax which leave the first two slides blank and then, on rewind, write all the film information on them so you can just keep all the slides together. Obviously this is not an issue on digital cameras as all the info is embedded within the Exif field and sometimes even in the filename.\nFor long exposure, you need a tripod (if there's no wind) or a plastic bag filled with rice/dirt. Take a bunch of shots below f3.5 from 1 minute to 20 minutes if the full moon is up or 10 minutes to 3 hours if it's pitch black. For star rotation pictures, you need a sky as black as possible (no moon, no city lights nearby); and don't walk around the camera with a headlamp while it's taking the shot unless you know exactly what you are doing. I recommend purchasing a used manual camera like the Nikon FM on ebay (~50$): remove the battery, add a cable release and you are set for exposures as long as you want (use low sensitivity film). This beats digital.\nIt's very hard to take good rock climbing pictures if it's just you and your partner on a route because you are either right below or right above him/her. The best times to take pictures are on traverses.\nSo a corolary of the previous statement is that you should be more than two climbers. Either one party of 3: one to climb, one to belay and one to take pictures; or two parties. That's how pro photographers do it: they climb or rappel the route in advance and wait in a good spot for the party of 'models'. And another pro trick is to use two long poles (up to 5 meters) to move away from the rock while on rappel; this way you can be in the back of the climber.\nAbove: Possibilities of orientation while holding the camera vertical: crack climbing, hard overhang or resting on the ground\u00a0! Yes, it's the same picture of Jenny on Devil's Tower El Matador.\nPerspective\nRight: Brad stemming a vertical perspective. Golden, Colorado . 20mm.\nA note about perspective: one normally holds the camera in a straight manner, either horizontally or vertically, but it's not illegal to cheat by tilting the camera a bit in order to make things appear steeper. But make sure that there is no horizon line in the frame and also that hanging things like ropes, quickdraws, hair or even trees won't give you away... Beware of clouds in particular. Be careful when you do it and don't overdo it: if the cheat is visible, the picture will end up in the garbage.\nAlso if you hold the axis of the camera vertically (either shooting towards the ground or the sky), the usual rules of perspective don't apply anymore and you can decide to put the sky/cliff/model anywhere, even after the picture has been shot: just rotate the picture to a more dramatic position.\nAbove: Examples from Devil's Tower El Matador holding the camera pointing vertically with 3 different rotations. The overall impression is quite different although they all seem like proper pictures: just crawling on the ground, crack climbing or insane overhang. Yes, it's the same picture. Also on the right are two pictures taken with a wide angle pointing up, you see how the vertical lines merge in the middle.\nBe creative\u00a0! One of the best training ground for creative climbing photography is boudering. Nothing looks more similar to a boulder than another boulder, and it's not easy to render in an impressive way someone who still has his butt barely off the ground... So use the whole nine yard: super wide angle, extreme close ups, flash, pics from above or right between the legs, slow motions, second curtain, multiple exposures, expressions (distorded faces), details (crimping fingers, crying eyes, cringing teeth...), light effects (shadow canceled by reflectors, sunlight diffused through chalk cloud...), repetitive falls shown in sequence, important surroundings (worried spotters), body movements (think dance), trash... The advantage of bouldering photography is that you can take with you as much gear as you want (reflectors and flashes come to mind).\nForget about taking pictures fom the ground: you don't see the climber's face and she's gonna be too far, for instance top-rope climbing hardly ever gives results worth keeping. Of course there are exceptions. As I stated before, the best angles are on traverses but also diagonaly from above.\nLook at magazines. In their competition against one another climbing magazines are very creative in their choice of photography (if only they would compete on the editorial content as well...). Get inspiration by analyzing how they were done or even imitate, it doesn't matter if the original was on a 5.14 and yours is on a 5.7.\nPeople\nLeft: Climber on top of the Lost Arrow, Yosemite . I had to tell him before I traversed that I wanted to take some shots of him standing on the summit. 20mm lens.\nIt may not be photography of top models, but pay attention to what they look like: if they are mostly undressed, enhance the muscles by playing on the direction of the light, if they are dressed make sure it's colorful, and if they are climbing bums make sure their sweat-drenched ripped-off shirts show all the food-stains of the last two months. And if you are thinking about publications, remember that you need to have a written permission from the models (even for your website). Several times I've had people ask me to remove a picture of them I'd taken from a distance and didn't bother to ask for authorization. It happens.\nStill about 'models', pay attention to details, in particular the helmet always hides half of the head and casts a dark shadow over the eyes, hiding them in the dark. Ask your partner to remove his/her helmet, just the time to take a shot or two; and don't drop rocks in the meanwhile\u00a0! Actually it's a general problem of rock-climbing: the climber faces the rock and never has light on his face, so the face is always hard to see. The only remedy is using a powerful flash to light up the shadows. It's quite impractical to carry up routes, but think about it if you do only a top-rope and have it sent to you somehow. Or ask your model/partner to turn her/his head towards the light.\nIf you have good looking people around, try to get them to climb something for the picture. If you have a good looking rock, try to get someone to climb it for the picture. A classical example is a protruding spire (pic on left) taken from another spire, you need to ask another party to climb it while you take pictures, and not only that, you sometimes need to ask them to take poses (\"lay back from the wall\", \"stand on top\", \"now do a handstand\"), promise them prints as an incentive\u00a0! It's hard to yell orders from a distance at someone who's busy doing knots or getting pumped on the crux.\nIllustrate. Some of the best climbing shots aren't from actual climbs; they are of climbers joking, gearing up, topping out in the sunset, tossing ropes, camping or whatever.\nRight: A tiny spec of a hiker gives a sense of scale to the ridge of the\nVercors and Mt Aiguille.\nEven if all you care about is the mountain, introducing humans somewhere in the image will give a sense of scale to what otherwise may just be a pile of rocks. That is, unless it's Tomo Cesen on the 4km high South Face of Lhotse taken from kms away, in which case it won't even fill a pixel on the image...\n\"Free soloing can be deadly, even if it looks great in the photos.\"\n\u2014\u00a0From a Climbing editorial.\nSoloing\nA few cameras offer gadgets that can be useful for the solo climber taking a pic of his own scared face while hanging by the other hand. For instance the Fujifilm Silvi F2.8 has couple things that make life easier when taking pictures of yourself:\nTwo triggers on either side of the camera, so you can hold it with either hand (left handed people will love it and it's also good for taking pics while belaying);\nA tiny indicator that tells you if you are aiming at yourself properly;\nAn infrared remote control;\nAn optional date stamp (so that archeologists of future generations will know when you fell into that crevasse).\nStupid details\nHold your camera horizontal ! [except if you want to fake the steepness, see above]. It sounds like totally obvious and stupid advice, but when you are on a slope without too many reference points it's not so easy to do. As a reference use the horizon line if you can see any of it, or the underside of clouds, or the vertical lines shown by trees... Now that I do panoramas and I need to connect pictures to each others, the horizontality becomes crucial and I've noticed I always tilt my camera about 1\u00b0 to the left if I don't pay attention. I purchased a gridded focusing screen (for Nikon, the reference is 'E type') and it helps a lot. Some digital cameras can display optional grid lines in the viewfinder or on the LCD screen; use that very good option.\nLong hair is a major pain when taking shots on windy days. It shows up on a lot of pictures. Shave it or glue it (that's what I'd do if only Jenny would let me)\u00a0!\nWhen taking pics with a small P&S and wearing gloves, be careful not to put your gloves in front of the camera... Sounds silly, but you have no idea how many pics I've seen with a big red blob on a side, especially on vertical shots.\nWhen it's cold and windless, try not to breath too hard while focusing, even if out of breath: ice deposit can fog the lens, or more often the eyepiece, and then you have to wait for it to clear up. Never attempt to clean a lens with a dirty glove\u00a0!\nCareful when switching lenses on a wall, make sure you have all the movements planned in advance, and also make sure that even if you loose balance (from a tug on the rope for instance) you won't drop everything. Just think about your 1000$ lens bouncing down the cliff and you'll be able to grip the lens just as much as the crimpers on the lead that got you to the belay anyway.\nTake the pictures yourself. Yes, the stupidest tip of all, but oh so true. If you want a picture with someone in it, don't ask Billy-Bob Passerby to take it of you. He'll take a shitty shot even if you prepare all the settings beforehand. Ask him to pose instead. Even with 7 missing teeth the result is likely to be better this way. Too bad you won't be on it but you can't be both photographer and model (and neither can Billy-Bob)...\nDon't forget to take pictures when you are in trouble. A typical slide shows go something like this: \"...and then we had to bivy and it was tough and we barely survived and we were rescued after a week and all but I'm sorry I was too cold/hungry/tired to take pictures\". The part that will interest both climbers and non climbers the most is never documented. For instance I don't have any pictures of the mexicans who offered me shelter after my solo ascent of Huascaran and I regret it, as well as many others situations that are now fading from memory. Disclaimer: I'm not saying to take pictures when danger is looming instead of running for shelter; what I mean is that most people take pictures only when conditions are ideal; and when they are tired, hungry, thirsty, cold, late, in their sleeping bag or such, they forget all about photography. Keep in mind that in those cases the quality of the picture is secondary, it becomes reporting instead of art. When I came back from Dumont d'Urville , the windiest place on Earth, I noticed that I had only _one_ picture taken during a bout of katabatic wind. One, over an entire year when half the time the winds were above 150km/h... and I came back with only pics of sunny days that made Antarctica look like an easygoing ski resort.\nGet out of your sleeping bag. Yeah, it's nice and cozy, and you are tired, but some of the best pictures are taken at night: star rotations if there's no moon, moonlight over mountaintops otherwise. You need a tripod (even tiny) and a camera that can do B or T pause.\nB pause is the most common but it's useless 'as is': the shutter stays open as long as you keep your finger on the trigger. Since the camera will vibrate if you touch it in any way, you can't take any picture this way (and I'm not even taking finger cramps into consideration); it needs a cable release which most cameras cannot even have\u00a0! Companies that put a B-pause on a camera without cable release should be fined.\nThe best and most simple solution is the T-pause: press once and the exposure starts; come back after a few beers, press a 2nd time and the exposure stops. Very few cameras have that (the Ricoh GR1/GR21 comes to mind)...\n\"Move back! Move back!\" Be careful when you say that in the mountains, it's exactly how Catherine Destivelle broke a leg in Antarctica : she took a step backward to fit in the frame and fell off the summit\u00a0! Ensued a heinous self-rescue... Be careful up there, don't take risks just to take a picture: my friend Fabio fell 26 meters when he tried to take a picture over the rim of a cliff. Don't worry, he was okay (after 6 months in the hospital), just a little bit uglier than before. He even managed to take a lead fall on a multipitch climb and loosen a few screws the very day he was finally released from the hospital...\nSetups\nRight: Lightning strike picture in front of our condo, Colorado . 20mm. Put the camera on a tripod with a cable release in T-pause. Close to a fair amount (say f/16 or more) Determine the maximum exposure from the meter (say 1 minutes) and never go above less than half of that (you want the sky to be dark). Start the exposure and release it as soon as either a lightning occurs or you reach the maximum time. A large angle lens and a lot of film are necessary. If you want to try during daylight storms, you will need a neutral density filter to increase the exposure time. It's much cheaper to use a digital camera for that.\nSo, after all this text, what are the best equipment setups for climbing photography\u00a0? It depends on how light you wanna be...\nSuperlight - Film\nA small compact camera (like Ricoh GR1 or Silvi F2.8) in a pocket or tied to the harness, a tiny tripod in the pack, one spare roll of Provia 100F. For multi-pitch rock climbs, long mountain routes where you need to go fast and light...\nSuperlight - Digital\nI haven't found a way yet (2007). The Ricoh GRd is a fine camera but it suffers from overblown highlights even if you lower the contrast of the image. A compact Fuji with both a SuperCCD SR sensor and a wide angle zoom would be ideal but I'm not aware of any model.\nDay trip\nSame as above plus an SLR with something like a 28-105 (film) or 17-50 (digital) zoom and a 20mm fixed focal, polarizing filter, a tiny tripod, some Provia 100F if you use film, spare batteries, a plastic bag for the rain. For easy mountain routes, rock climbing where you leave the pack (and the camera) at the base...\nExpedition, car camping...\nA film SLR with 28-70/f2.8, 70-210/f2.8-4 and 20mm, or a digital SLR with 17-50/f2.8, 50-150/f2.8-4, lens shades, a compact camera backup, polarizing filter, partial grey filter (to darken skies), cable release, stable tripod, large flash, spare films and batteries, a hand-crank or solar battery charger, spare lens cap, insurance.\nConclusion\nSo, if there can be only one climbing camera, I'll choose... the Panasonic LX3 in 2009.\nYou get better at climbing by climbing. You get better at photography by taking pictures as often as possible. Make your own conclusion for climbing photography. And I'm sure you could take plenty of excellent pictures by doing the exact opposite of all the advice I gave here.\nI also believe that if the climb is hard, high and scary the pictures will be interesting, particularly if there is a good story wrapped around\u00a0!\nFor some great climbing pictures on the Web, look at: Tuan's photography page and Galen Rowell's pro pictures .

But the X100 is not supposed to replace a high-end DSLR and that is not why I was interested in the camera.\nThere are some things that are in need of work though.\nOne is the continuous autofocus. It really does not work well.\nThere are two autofocus settings:\nAF-S (Single autofocus and lock) and AF-C (Continuous autofocusing)\nWith AF-S, the X100 focuses on the selected AF area, and holds it. With AF-C the X100 tries to keep focusing on whatever\u2019s in the center of the image (even when you do not have the shutter pressed halfway) and its not very quick. And even if it could track quickly, the camera stops focusing when you half-press of shutter. Definitely a bug.\nThe camera also will not track an image across the frame.\nNow this is not a sports camera, so all this is not all that important except that if you are going to have a continuous mode, it needs to follow focus quickly and accurately. Not every target is stationary.\nAnother problem is the frame rate. Single is fine, but it also has the ability to shoot 3 or 5 frames a second. It is quiet, but after the burst, that camera is unusable until the files are written. Additionally, focus and exposure are locked in on the first frame, so it does not track. Useless for a subject that is moving toward you or away.\nNow, in all fairness this is not a camera you would use to shoot sports. It is a camera for a more deliberate shooter. But looking to get one shot of a moving subject can be a real challenge.\nI have included some more images from shooting on Capitol Hill.\nMore posts to come.\nExposure Time: 1/160 F Number: 4.5 Exposure Program: Shutter speed priority AE ISO: 800\nI find the above image truly amazing from a small camera.

My old friend keyboard player Martin Lesch and a group of extraordinarily talented musicians were playing a Delta Blues & Bayou Tribute that night and it was phenomenal. For now they are playing every Monday night, so if you happen to be in the area, it is well worth the trip to see them in this great intimate setting.\nI took a few images of them that night and the results are below.\nExposure Time: 1/125 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 3200\nExposure Time: 1/125 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 3200\nExposure Time: 1/125 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 3200\nUPDATE \u2013 September 26, 2011 \u2013 Final thoughts on the FujiFilm X100\nFirst I should start by saying that I shoot almost exclusively with DSLRs. I am a Nikon guy and happy to be so.\nThat said, I always wanted a camera that was \u201cLeica-like,\u201d meaning small and non-threatening but does not cost almost as much as a car. You would think for that price they would just give you the damn scarf and beret to make you feel extra special.\nNow I know there are a bunch of cameras that fit this description, but I am a bit more picky.\nI ALSO want a camera that can shoot in RAW mode and is excellent in low light. And when I say excellent I mean as excellent as a D3 or D700. I want to be able to shoot at ISO 3200 or 6400 and not think twice about it.\nYes I am spoiled. Photographers are shooting photos today that 10 years ago we would not even consider looking through the viewfinder to compose since we knew the image would be crap. Not so anymore, so that is what I want.\nExposure Time: 1/2000 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 3200 (an accident, looks damn nice)\nOverall I love the FujiFilm X100. I love the look and the feel of it in my hands. The quality of the images, especially in low light and high ISO\u2019s is exceptional and on par with my Nikon D700. The f2.0 lens is sharp and fast. And let us not forget that this camera is quiet which lends to discreet shooting.\nI have found that for quick shooting, the electronic viewfinder is the way to go. Although it takes a bit of getting used to since there is a delay of some sort when you press the shutter down halfway. I have found that the camera does seem to focus quickly if you just take the picture without waiting on the scene in the viewfinder to focus. It seems the photo will be in focus even though the viewfinder has reflected so yet.\nI love the quality at high ISO\u2019s so much that I have the camera set on Auto ISO all the time. The metering in the camera is so good I rarely have to worry about it.\nExposure Time: 1/105 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 200\nI do have a few ergonomic issues with the camera.\nThe exposure compensation dial is too easy to move. I would suggest either making the dial a bit smaller so it does not come to the top edge of the camera or having a way to lock it down.\nThe diopter correction dial is also a bit too easy to move. Might consider recessing it just a bit more so that someone would have to intentionally set it with their fingernail or other instrument.\nThe camera really should come with whatever filter/hood combination that would protect the lens. It would be so easy to damage it as shipped that it makes it a mandatory purchase. Raise the price if necessary but it needs to be in the kit.\nIn my opinion the whole menu system needs to be rethought. Settings like image quality, image size and dynamic range should be under the Set-Up menu. The format command to erase the SD card should be under the Shooting Menu.\nExposure Time: 1/1500 F Number: 2.5 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 200\nThe continuous shooting mode is the most annoying feature for me as a photographer. There is no point to shooting at multiple frames a second if the camera will not track the subject as it moves. This along with the extended time that that camera shuts down while the images are written to the card makes the whole thing unusable. Additionally, I am not keen on having to turn the multiple frame option on every time I want it. Why does the camera revert to single frame mode after shooting a continuous burst?\nI also am disappointed that I am unable to shoot over 6400 in RAW mode. I think that if this camera is to be marketed to professionals, and I think it should, that Fuji should consider RAW the standard for shooting. If you cannot do it in RAW there is no reason to do it in JPG.\nAnother thing I do not understand is why I cannot shoot faster than 1/1000 sec when the aperture is set to 2.0. Someone said it was due to the design of the shutter, but I have not heard a definitive explanation. Of course the built in ND filter is a big help here, since I love to shoot wide open, but it is just one more step I don\u2019t feel I should have to take since the shutter speed does go to 1/4000 sec.\nExposure Time: 1/20 F Number: 2.0 Exposure Program: Sutter priority AE ISO: 3200\nSummary\nAs it is now the camera has a few quirks and bugs that need addressed, but I would not consider them to be a deal breaker. The X100 is a breakthrough in digital photography.\nThe FujiFilm X100 is a great camera for a deliberate shooter. For a photojournalist who may need to react quickly, it takes a bit of a learning curve and it needs some tweaking. Hopefully much can be fixed with firmware upgrades.\nThe camera I have is on loan from FujiFilm for the purposes of this review.\nI plan on buying one and I doubt that I can wait for the next edition.\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, July 31st, 2011 at 7:45 pm.

For the shots, remember to have a tripod and a remote controller.\nFor the first Christmas tree picture, my friend Tudor used flash (with -2 exposure) in rear mode, in low light. Picture was taken in \u201cProgram\u201d mode.\nThe second Christmas tree picture has +3 exposure, no flash, and low light environment. Longer exposure time in this case: 20 sec.. Picture was taken in \u201cShutter Mode\u201d.\nThe white balance in case of such photographs is better set to \u201cauto\u201d since the colors from the lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby. After all, the multitude of colorful lights is what makes Christmas beautiful.\nNow let\u2019s see the close-ups: the most simple setting scheme is: \u201cProgram\u201d Mode, rear flash, adjusted exposure (differs from scene to scene), tripod and remote control or 2 seconds shutter delay. For brighter scenes you can put the flash off and increase ISO.\nOn most of the photos, on post-processing, I added a warm filter to make the tree have a yellowish green, and to make the red color stronger.\nHow to shoot great pictures of caves \u2013 a guide to cave photography\nDuring these summer months, I\u2019ve been traveling to various caves in Romania. First, I will show you the pictures I took with Nikon D40x, 18mm lens, and then I will tell you how to obtain something similar yourself.\nDoing cave photography is an exercise in frustration. The biggest problem is that you are working in near total darkness. Trying to photograph large formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be nearly impossible. (It\u2019s best to have your own lamp with you, however, in my case, the cave was illuminated for tourists since many years).\nComposition is based on everything you already know about landscape photography as much as it is on your headlamp. Focusing can be similarly difficult. Lighting placement may seem easy at first until you get your processed images back and discover the glaringly over or underexposed portions of the photograph. By this time, you\u2019re probably miles away from the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon. This can be very frustrating.\nAs for composition, you can make landscapes, covering the entire cave, you can focus on details \u2013 certain interesting formations, or, you can have a person standing there, adding the human factor to the natural environment of the cave. But, to be more specific, a good photograph does not have a person \u201cstanding\u201d in the picture, but actually \u201cdoing\u201d something: climbing or other action inside the cave.\nThe camera settings I used are:\n1. shutter speed mode: around 1/30sec (longer exposure time will likely cause motion blur and overexposed areas near the lighting source)\n2. ISO 1600 (Slower speeds limit your capability with the light sources you carry, faster speeds give you more of a problem with contrast and graininess)\n3. exposure +3,+4, +5 (depending on how illuminated the scene was) \u2013 if your camera supports bracketing, do so \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to get the right exposure from the first shot\n4. flash on: rear mode (this is what creates a different light color in the pictures \u2013 the blue one, for near objects)\n5. manual white balance (I played a bit with this one in the ice cave)\nNow let\u2019s talk about lighting - illuminating the scene. Using the flash is not necessary if you want to create a mystery scene in which all is black but the lamp illuminated formation. But, I do believe that lighting is the most effective tool of a great cave picture (and, after all, you are providing all the lighting for the image), so I\u2019m going to point out some tips from ephotozine :\nCave photographers mostly use flashguns as their primary light, followed by bulbs as their second main source. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Bulbs of all shapes and sizes are still used a lot by cave photographers. There are several reasons why they have not been totally replaced by the use of flashguns \u2013 they have a higher light output than many strobes. When photographing a large room, nothing beats the output of a flashbulb. They also give off a wider arc of light than a strobe.\nSlaves are remote electronic switches that you attach to each of the different flash units distributed around your cave photo area. The flash on your camera sends out the message to all the slaves to fire when your camera shutter opens. In this way, they are all synchronized and give you the perfect exposure. This also helps to eliminate the need for tripod.\nA dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly burned edge to offset it from the darker background. Try putting a light on either side of a subject with the lights aimed at one another.\nIn close-up shots, the use of a softened light (soft box or even just a piece of tissue over the flash tube) is frequently better than a hard light. Sometimes the cave passage itself, if it is reflective, can serve as a bit of soft box on its own.\nAs a last word, I remember you to do not touch or walk on formations or clean areas that are off trail \u2013 protect the nature or else you will only picture the past and not the eternity.\nRockets\u2019 Red Glare: How to Photograph Fireworks\nFourth of July celebrations often end with a firework extravaganza that captivates us all with its awesome beauty. So be prepared to \u201cooh\u201d and \u201cah\u201d along with the crowd. And, if you\u2019re like many of us, plan to have your camera ready to capture the \u201crockets red glare.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the best way to take \u201cgreat\u201d firework photos? According to Chuck DeLaney, Dean of the New York Institute of Photography (NYI), the world\u2019s largest photography school, it\u2019s easy if you do a couple of simple things. \u201cMost of all you need a steady camera, a long exposure, and medium speed ISO setting,\u201d DeLaney explains.\nFirst, you\u2019ll want to take a time-exposure. If you have an SLR camera, this should be no problem. Many point-and-shoot cameras have a special Fireworks setting, but if the camera you are using doesn\u2019t, try to \u201cfool\u201d the camera into keeping the shutter open. Here\u2019s how: When you see a rocket shoot skyward, press the shutter-button. The darkness of the sky should cause your camera to keep the shutter open for a time-exposure, and you can end up with a splendid picture.\nWhat about using a single-use \u201ccardboard\u201d disposable camera? NYI says, forget it! These cameras usually have a fixed shutter speed, and you can\u2019t \u201cfool\u201d them into doing the right thing no matter what you do.\nSecond, and equally important, since you are taking a time-exposure, your camera should be on a solid, unmoving base throughout the exposure. A tripod is best. If you don\u2019t have a tripod, try bracing your camera against some solid structure \u2013 for example, a wall, a post, or a railing. They\u2019re not as good as a tripod, but they\u2019re better than hand-holding your camera. And hand-holding is the road to disaster \u2013 no one likes blurry fireworks photos.\nThird, to add an extra-special touch to your picture, try to include something on the ground to give a sense of location to the firework display in the sky. For example, across the bottom of your frame you might show silhouettes of the crowd, or a statue (George Washington on horseback?), or the skyline of thecity. This one trick will do more to make your fireworks pictures stand out than any other single thing you can do. \u201cThere are some special do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that will help digital photographers get the best results,\u201d notes DeLaney. \u201cWe\nwritten a special article just to address those issues.\u201d\nFor lots more advice on how to take \u201cgreat\u201d fireworks pictures, and some great fireworks photos, visit http://www.nyip.com/ezine/holidays/firewksintro.html or read the other photo tips on the New York Institute of Photography (NYI) Web site at http://www.nyip.com .\nReprinted with permission from the New York Institute of Photography\nPhotos by Lau\nRemote Controls for Your Camera\nI had the idea to inform myself (and you) about this camera accessories because I felt the need of a remote control while shooting night Christmas scenes. To explain better, my Nikon D40x, like many other cameras, can not make an exposure longer than 30 seconds without a remote \u2013 at least that\u2019s what the manual says. I did managed to get to \u201cbulb\u201d option on manul mode, but, for that, I needed to keep my finger on the sutter, fact which causes the camera to shake and the picture gets blurry. Therefor, I\u2019ll start with pointing out the advantages of a remote control and then I\u2019ll give you a list of remote controls to choose from according to your camera.\nA remote switch is a cable with a switch on the end \u2013 just as simple as that. It duplicates the action of the shutter button \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 half pressure activates the exposure metering and focus while full pressure fires the shutter. The units differ simply in the length of the cable and the type of connecter plug used to attach the cable to the camera.\nA remote switch will allow you to fire your camera without the need to touch it. This is very useful when the camera is fixed to a tripod or supported on a wall. It eliminates the movement that can be transmitted to the camera as the shutter button is pressed.\nOne of the question you might have is \u201cwhy are some cables longer than others? why is lenght important?\u201d.\nThe answer is that when you are further away from the camera, you have more chances to remain unnoticed by the photographed subject \u2013 speaking of wildlife photography. Extension cables are suitable for such situations.\nSo let\u2019s go back to the situation I mentioned at the begining: I want to make a long exposure using a remote controler. With a remote release, once you have pressed the button you can lock it down by sliding the button forward. Now the shutter will stay open without you having to keep pressure on the button. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrunning lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means you are free to work with very long exposures, limited only by your camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battery life. To close the camera shutter, simply slide the remote switch button back and let go.\nSo war I\u2019ve been talking about the traditional way of remote picturing, but, the\u2019s a new and more effective way these days: A wireless controller not only acts like your television remote controller, but it also works in the same way \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 by infrared. More than that, a friend of mine has an universal remote controller which is his TV controller and camera controller in the same device. A wireless controller has a transmitter and a receiver. The receiver is connected to the remote plug on the camera, and an extension cable can be attached if you need to be even further away.\nQuestion: How long can this exposure be?\nAnswer: Digital cameras need power when the shutter is open to keep the CMOS sensor active. This means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than that for film cameras.\nIMPORTANT TIP FOR LONG EXPOSURES: If you are interested in shooting star trails, you will reduce the noise levels in the images by shooting on cold winter nights rather than warm summer evenings.\nFor Canon users:\nRS-80N3: 80mm cable with N3 connector for professional and mid-range digital EOS cameras\nRS-60E3: 60mm cable with E3 connector for entry-level digital EOS cameras\nRS-60T3: 60cm cable with T3 connector for early EOS models\nTC-80N3\nWireless Controller LC-5\nMore complex remote controler like the TC-80N3 have a few extra features over and above other remote switches: a built-in self-timer, interval timer and long exposure timer, which can all be set in one second increments from one second to 99 hours. It also features an exposure count setting.\nAs for the connectors, take a look at E3 and N3 in the firts place, but note that there is no adaptor that allows you to use a N3 remote switch with an E3-compatible camera. This means that it not possible to use a TC-80N3 with any of the E3-compatible cameras, such as the EOS 350D or 400D.\nFor Nikon users:\nNIKON MC30 and MC-36 Remotes (designed for use with Nikon SLR cameras equipped with a 10-pin remote terminal) are compatible with Nikon D300, D200, D100 (with MB-D100 grip attached), D3, D2H, D2Hs, D2x, D1, D1H, D1x, F100, F6, F5, F90X and F90.\nNikon MC-DC1 Remote Cord is for Nikon D70S & D80 Digital SLR Cameras.\nNikon ML-3 Compact Modulite Remote Control is mostly useful for wildlife photography up to 8m. Can Also Fire The Camera Remotely When A Subject Moves Between The Transmitter And Receiver\nOpteka Wireless Radio Remote Release for Nikon D300, D200, D100, & D2x SLR Digital Cameras \u2013 100m range, and it can activate auto focus, release shutter, activate continuous drive mode or keep the shutter open for bulb photography as well.\nNikon D80 User Guide\nIf you have just purchased your Nikon D80, the controls on the outside of the camera coupled with all the menus and custom settings can be \u2026 all \u00bb downright overwhelming. We give you a structure for looking at the controls as well as a repeatable ritual for taking great photos with your new camera. You spent a bundle on this camera. Let it be an extension of your hands rather than a struggle. The Nikon D80 is a powerful piece of equipment. A solid understanding of its features and controls can really unleash its potential. Once you learn how the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s components work together, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have all the tools you need to capture the best image under all conditions.\nUnderstanding AF Area Selections Topics include:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Be Prepared (To Get the Shot)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Shutter Priority\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Aperture Priority/Depth of Field\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Focus Alternatives\n"}, {"score": 364.90018, "uuid": "6fba0bf0-e76c-5495-926c-448e94735d30", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1913wb-27-06183", "target_hostname": "www.bigeventphotographybozeman.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bigeventphotographybozeman.com/2010_03_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 1.8555989e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "EVENTSGALORE: March 2010", "snippet": "Posted by Photogrpahs &amp; Events at 4:24 AM 0 comments Characteristics <em>for</em> this type <em>photographs</em>: <em>a</em> very expressive <em>portrait</em> - because of the dark shadow on the right side of the face ideal <em>for</em> men <em>portraits</em>.

But so far there are no new sensor standard. If you invest in the wrong system could do, how are its lenses to glass.\nHalf-, full-or - now - Pro-format? Or would you prefer Thirds? And what really is APS-C? The camera industry is fighting for a standard in the sensor size, and adjacent to the understanding of many consumers is the pleasure in buying on the track. For those who invest into the wrong system could even drag in a short time, his expensive lens on the glass container.\nSensor size is an issue in all system cameras - so wherever lenses and other accessories are interchangeable. Admittedly, the bayonet - the mechanical interface between the camera and lens, which lens adjusts the camera, but defines the size of the sensor, how does the lens and whether it visually makes sense to connect this lens.\nBefore Leica on Monday evening with the presentation of his camera system S2 \u00dcberformatsensor surprised with the full frame was regarded as the hot topic of photokina. Full Frame - full-bodied touted by many camera manufacturers as innovation - meaning no more than that the digital photography here at last arrives, where the film was already 80 years ago. Back then put Leica inventor Oscar Barnack a feature film in a camera: photography had arrived at the recording format of 36 x 24 millimeters - the size of miniature classic film. In addition to presenting Canon Nikon and Sony cameras now available in full format - and do bravely as if they had never had something else in mind.\nDicker sensor, thick picture\nThis time the half size was considered the ultimate in digital SLR photography. For the price of sensors increases exponentially with size. So you still obstructed and build sensors with about half the small picture format. Since this size corresponds approximately to the (never successful) movie format, APS-C, such cameras are often called APS-sensor cameras.\nThe size of the sensor, however, has direct bearing on the photo. The smaller the sensor, the smaller the photographed image - and lenses have to be redesigned so that they represent another big shot. Nikon, the world's second largest after all of the terms of sales SLR manufacturer, invented ado DX lenses. These only fit to cameras with APS or Halbformatsensor. The largest manufacturer Canon showed a total of more reserved, but also resulted in an EF-S lenses that are manufactured for the cameras with small sensors.\nFull Frame is affordable\nNow, however, digital camera with full frame sensor Discontinued cost around 1,500 euros - and the prices will fall further. The seeing at the show to brand-new models cost 2500-2800 euro - the ubiquitous price decline may be only for months, until these cameras for well under $ 2,000 are available and coming in the financial reach of amateurs. Further price cuts are as safe as with all other products in the electronics industry - the pain with other digital SLR cameras currently stands at just under 400 euros.\nIt is therefore likely that the full format will prevail across the board - and all designed for the small sensor lenses are useless, sooner or later. This is likely for many professional and dedicated amateur photographers, who have often invested four-digit totals in lenses, will be a bitter experience.\nLeica is raising the bar\nIn this time of change the traditional Leica surprised with the presentation of an oversize format. With a chip size of 30 x 45 mm recording area of the new full frame camera, the S2 outperforms significantly. Of course, for this Leica \"Pro-format sensor format called again special lenses needed.\nThe target group for the noble Leica S2 are professionals who share the uncompromising image quality. Accordingly, look like the pricing for the 37.5-megapixel camera and lenses. More detailed information was the interim CEO, Dr. Andreas Kaufmann, to make it yet. With a five-figure sum for a camera-lens combination we may expect, however.\nWhether it will succeed Leica to enforce a new sensor format, the future will tell. After all, the traditional company has ever been a recording format established worldwide. One thing is definitely that the ever increasing resolution needs of photographers in the state of today's sensor technology can no longer be satisfied with small sensors. However, whether some amateurs with oversized cameras, which have to be larger and heavier from the optical out to be the current laws Vollformatkameras, will run through the zoo or Palma de Mallorca, is doubtful. Average consumer buys from the money that would be necessary for such equipment, prefer a used car.\n"}], [{"score": 355.81815, "uuid": "817f01be-ce78-5ba4-9c93-7d7ec87c1a91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0903wb-83-16604", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/reciting-a-poem-about-new-orleans-on-a-key-west-street-corner", "page_rank": 1.201261e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Reciting <em>a</em> poem about New Orleans on <em>a</em> Key West street corner | Pixiq", "snippet": "Gets Arrested <em>For</em> Photographing From Bridge o <em>Should</em> This Miami Cop Have Allowed <em>A</em> Woman To Use His Car As <em>A</em> Lounge Chair?", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nI became a poet three years ago when I returned to Miami after a ten-year hiatus and enrolled in a creative writing class at FIU taught by James W. Hall, who has always been one of my favorite writers.\nHall showed me that poetry does not have to be an abstract babble of boredom written by dead white men, but sometimes the only method to express what\u2019s in your heart.\nI began using poetry as an outlet for my political rage. And I\u2019ve taken this rage up on stage at various spoken word venues throughout town over the last three years.\nI became a videographer last year when I visited Key West in April with my then-girlfriend, who had one of those small Canon cameras that allow you to shoot video.\nAs a born storyteller, I became fascinated with both poetry and videography because they were added elements to the storytelling process.\nI was so fascinated with videography after the Key West trip, I ended up buying a Canon TX1 and then a Canon HG10 . And I even started getting paid assignments by the end of the year. And now I\u2019m saving up to buy the Canon XH A1.\nHere is a clip from that Key West weekend. We had been walking down Duval Street when we came across these jazz musicians from New Orleans. They were in between sets so we asked if we could film them. Yes, I know I didn\u2019t have to ask, but I wanted everybody to be at ease.\nWhen they started playing, I became possessed by the music and started reciting a poem I had written about New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\nLike many of the decisions I\u2019ve made in my lifetime, my decision to start reciting poetry was purely impulsive. I even caught my ex-girlfriend off guard, which is why she wasn\u2019t even filming me when I started the poem.\nThere is something spiritual about New Orleans jazz and blues that takes control of my soul. I guess it is that voodoo vibe.\nIn seeing the video, I realize that I need to slow the poem down to make it more effective.\nThis was only the second time I had recited the poem without the written words in front of me. The first time was at the Medical Marijuana Benefit Concert in Tobacco Road a few months earlier where I performed with a local jazz band. All the times before that and since, I\u2019ve recited the poem without music and it\u2019s not nearly as powerful.\nI think I did a fairly decent job considering this collaboration with musicians was completely unrehearsed and unplanned (the performance at Tobacco Road was planned, but unrehearsed).\nI think I was rushing through the poem because on the back of my mind, I was wondering if these musicians were annoyed about me reciting poetry to their music.\nThey told me afterwards they really liked it. And they were insistent on seeing the video. They said it reminded them of playing in San Francisco where people have walked up to them and started reciting poetry. But nothing like that has ever happened to them in Florida.\nI had written the poem in the weeks after Hurricane Katrina drowned New Orleans. I had been in New Orleans only a year earlier as drove back to Miami from Phoenix and the memories were still vivid. And I had been to the Big Easy three times before that, always coming home with memorable experiences.\nThe poem is actually much longer than what was captured on the video.

Today\u2019s self-employed photographers must have marketing savvy to spare. This guide from a widely known and respected industry insider provides that-and much more. In Successful Self-Promotion for Photographers, freelance photographers learn what they must do to improve their skills after the pictures have been developed. Featuring sections such as \u201cFocus Your Image,\u201d \u201cSharpen Your Client Focus,\u201d \u201cIdentify Your Market,\u201d and the ever-important \u201cSpot Trends,\u201d here are dozens of surefire strategies for selling services, staying on top of the latest market trends, and winning enough high-paying work to survive and thrive in this very competitive business. For any photographer looking to make it big behind the lens, this indispensable reference shows how to get the right exposure every time.\nWeissberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book is divided into 10 sections. Each addresses a unique issue in building, marketing and promoting your business. At the end of almost every chapter is a list of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dos\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as extra tips. The first two chapters mainly outline solid start up points for amateurs. Chapters three and four give in depth coverage of winning strategies behind building on the desires of your market by showing how you can provide everything they want through ads and portfolio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Weissberg takes the time to describe how this can look different in a variety of markets including magazine, fine art, fashion and design. Chapters five and six will give you fresh perspective. Weissberg sets you on your way with practical skills with creating a marketing plan based on your tastes, your budget, and your clientele market.\nChapters seven through ten wrap up with other fantastic marketing ideas especially for photographers: from gaining recognition through portfolio review, to designing sourcebook ads, mailings, and understanding your client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language.\nNot only a great resource, but also an engaging read that wont leave you with anything less than dozens of ideas for expanding your photography business and your own marketing techniques.\nThe fine art of fashion photography\nFrom a talk given at the Museum of Modern Art, London, by the senior lecturer in art, publishing and music at Oxford Brookes University.\nFashion photography is carried out in order to sell clothes; it is a part of the wider advertising industry and exploits desires and aspirations through reference to lifestyles. As such, it is an unapologetic appropriator of styles and techniques. This poses questions about the meaning of street photography \u00c2\u00ad if it includes fashion photography \u00c2\u00ad and about its place, too, in the canon of art photography. While you might at first see fashion photography as different because it is commercial, perhaps it is rather a good example of the need to contrive in all photography. Looking at fashion photographs we wonder to what extent other, apparently spontaneous, photographs were contrived. The idea that fashion photography represents a debasement of the medium must be challenged at a time when the visual language of advertising has permeated \u201chigh\u201d art. In any case, the \u201ccaptured moment\u201d in its diversity and manipulation, is the basis for all photography.\nPerhaps categories of photography exist not only because of context or subject but because of the need for definitions within a medium that has been widely employed by amateurs, technicians and professionals in many fields. Bourdieu sees that problems of definition in photography place it outside the cultural hierarchy. The \u201cuneducated\u201d consumer \u00c2\u00ad his phrase \u00c2\u00ad feels able to view and judge photographs without having to acquire the kind of specialist knowledge necessary for mainstream art. His view that photography falls outside the \u201cconsecrated arts\u201d does not prevent those inside attempting to appropriate and/or marginalise it. Fashion photography falls between art and commerce. Donovan, Klein and Tillmans have worked in the fashion business. Donovan, although his work was not confined to fashion, worked in the commercial world. Klein and Tillmans have moved between the commercial and art worlds. Klein\u2019s preoccupation in the 1950s with intervention \u00c2\u00ad in relation to his subjects and during processing \u00c2\u00ad can be seen in his fashion and street photos. He got into the action and later, during processing, bleached and cropped his images for a highly contrasted, grainy effect. That he was influenced by documentary photo and cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 is clear, but, in the fashion shots, v\u00e9rit\u00e9 has given way to cinema. He actually acknowledged being influenced by Cecil Beaton.\nEven the greatest and most original of photographers must respond to the commercial imperative. Klein\u2019s extremely and obviously contrived fashion photos have a formality that is not seen in Tillmans\u2019 images.\nTillmans, like Klein, has done a lot of fashion work and, according to Russell Ferguson, \u201call of his various types of photos can be shown together producing an over-archingly structural view of urban life. He has been working through the past decade at the same time as certain fashion photographers have aimed at a particular realism that reflects aspects of urban life.\u201d Corinne Day\u2019s photographs of Kate Moss caused a sensation in the 1990s \u00c2\u00ad they were too realistic, even though carefully staged and no more \u201creal\u201d than Mike Leigh\u2019s films.\nThe acceptance of photography as part of the art world took place in the 1960s and, since then, it has come to displace painting. As a result, artists such as Cindy Sherman and Jeff Wall can now bring narrative into fine art photography. Their styles are very different: Jeff Wall building a kind of realism and Cindy Sherman working within a fantasy world. We can see both approaches mirrored in contemporary fashion photography. So I seem to be coming down on the side of fashion not being separate from mainstream photography; how can it be otherwise when Tillmans won the Turner Prize last year? Fashion may be regarded as a category of photography, but it has had a symbiotic relationship with art photography, both through its practitioners and as a reflection of movements and styles.\nAn article by Catherine Atherton\nNikon unveils 24.5MP D3X digital SLR\nNikon has announced the D3X, its latest high-resultion professional DSLR.

February 2012 06:56\nNevercenter Redesigns Photo Editing With Release of CameraBag 2 for Mac and PC\nInnovative Workflow, Suite of Photo Tools Added to Popular Filter App\nNew York, NY - February 2, 2012 -\nNevercenter today released CameraBag 2 for Mac and PC, a desktop photo app with a whole new approach to photos. Redesigned from the ground up, CameraBag 2's new Analog Engine pairs a full suite of photographic tools with the high quality filters and vintage simulations the series is already known for. Its key innovation is a stunningly straightforward approach to layering, rearranging, and endlessly tweaking all of these effects in realtime. The 100+ fully-adjustable filters and 25+ professional controls CameraBag 2 ships with are only the beginning, forming the palette from which users create their own styles. ( Watch CameraBag in action )\n\"The most common feedback we got from previous versions was that the user wanted greater control, without sacrificing CameraBag's straightforward, accessible nature,\u201d said Tom Plewe, Nevercenter\u2019s president. \u201cWe came up with a simple tile-based system which presents all the additional control from the new Analog Engine in a quick, intuitive way. Then we added full-screen Quicklooks and instant previews to emphasize a visual decision-making process. Instead of starting from scratch with a photo, you can compare a lot of great options, choose the very best one, and then start tweaking. And you never have to do the same work twice; once you create a new look or workflow, you just add it to the menu for next time.\"\nKey Features\n- Choose from 100+ built-in styles and filters, or create and share your own.\n- Full suite of 25+ manual photographic tools including advanced curve editors.\n- Stunning new interface.\n- State-of-the-art image processing via the all-new Analog Engine.\n- Add any look you create to the toolset as a fully-adjustable filter.\n- 32-bits-per-component color depth.\n- Easy layering of styles and adjustments.\n- Quicklooks and hover previews for visual decision-making.\n- The Remix slider, which smoothly transitions between endless variations.\n- Large, precise controls.\n- RAW format and metadata support.\nFreedom to Play\nWith CameraBag 2, you don\u2019t have to know what look you want to get started. CameraBag 2 lets you see all the possibilities at once: old-school instant film or modern high-contrast portrait, subtle color adjustment or complete artistic overhaul. Choose from side-by-side comparisons with the fullscreen Quicklooks, or get large, instant previews on mouseover; the emphasis is on creative exploration. Once you\u2019ve chosen a filter, its components are all in the tray to tweak and adjust non-destructively with large, interactive sliders. The Remix slider in particular brings back the \u201chappy accidents\u201d of analog film, smoothly transitioning between infinite natural variations for each style.\nAdvanced Control\nThe new CameraBag features a full suite of photographic tools, from simple exposure and cropping to advanced vignetting, color correction, and curves. The built-in styles also now have full control over their strength and variation. Since every adjustment appears as a tile in the tray, it\u2019s easy to see everything affecting the image at once, and rearrange tiles or edit amounts without compromising image quality. Adjustments and styles can be freely layered to create new looks, which can be saved right into the interface as new filters. Whenever a filter is loaded, the user once again has full control over all of its tiles.\nThe Analog Engine\nAt CameraBag 2\u2019s core is the brand new Analog Engine: high-fidelity, 32 bits-per-channel, non-destructive, multi-threaded image processing. In other words, it\u2019s fast and smooth. CameraBag 2 matches the power of high-priced software, yet it\u2019s light on its feet and starts up instantly. Its old-school looks are particularly high tech: recreating the natural blemishes and random variations of the analog world is one of the hardest digital challenges, and that's where we've devoted much of our research. Even the most heavily-modified photos retain smooth, film-like colors (especially with the extra color information in RAW files).\nPrice and Availability\nCameraBag 2 is available now for Mac and PC. A single cross-platform license is available at www.nevercenter.com for $29 (launch sale price: $24), and a Mac-only version is available via the Mac App Store for $24 (launch sale price: $19). A free, fully-functional 30-day demo is included in the download from www.nevercenter.com, where more info, tutorials, and videos can also be found.\nCameraBag was initially released as an iPhone app, climbing as high as #2 across all paid apps. The first version for Mac and PC \u2013 CameraBag Desktop \u2013 soon followed, proving that the concept scaled beautifully to high res photos. CameraBag 2 for Mac and PC is a gigantic step forward from both CameraBag iPhone and CameraBag Desktop on every front. It has been rebuilt from the ground up specifically for desktop computers, now including a full suite of photo tools, a whole new interface for finding and creating filters, ne\u00adarly 10 times as many built-in looks, and a rewritten engine under the hood, all while maintaining the intuitiveness and approachable feel of the original app.\n"}, {"score": 339.90826, "uuid": "00df044a-e111-5adf-89c2-f6b3bc072d8b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1903wb-42-28487", "target_hostname": "www.photographytalk.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photographytalk.com/photography-articles/1639-10-tips-for-fall-color-photography", "page_rank": 1.1739719e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "10 Tips <em>For</em> Fall Color Photography", "snippet": "When <em>I</em> am in the forest <em>I</em> <em>prefer</em> overcast light in most situations to avoid harsh contrast.

With a focal length of 35mm, the Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE should feel right at home on the streets.\nEquipment\nThe 35mm Focal Length\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at ISO 100, f/3.2, 1/2000 sec\nThe Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE feels great mated to my 5D . A 35mm lens on a full frame body is great for environmental portraits and street photography. The 35mm focal length really is a must-have for anyone interested in shooting street/urban photography. It\u2019s a very natural focal length and by that I mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human eye sees. I feel that this is important when reproducing photographs that depict everyday life. When paired with a crop body, the Zeiss 35mm F/1.4 will end up being closer to a 50mm lens which is what I personally prefer to shoot with. If you shoot with a crop body, I would consider checking out the Zeiss 35mm F/1.4 for your 50mm equivalent lens.\nHandling\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - Shot at ISO 400, f/7.1, 1/200 sec - No signs of flare\nAfter using the Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE for a few days, I\u2019ve started to get used to having to manually focus ALL of the time. As I stated in the last post, without focus confirmation or a different focusing screen, I wouldn\u2019t be able to use this lens. While the Canon 5D does have a nice big and bright viewfinder, I cannot always tell when I have my subject 100% in focus. I have rediscovered that the markings on the lens can be your best friend. They allow you to zone focus or you can even preset your focus if you can guesstimate your distance from your subject before you bring the camera up to your face. This will drastically reduce your focus time once you have the camera up to your eye.\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - Shot at ISO 100, f/5.6, 1/500 sec\nInstead of using my Camdapter hand strap, I decided to go back to my beloved Black Rapid RS-7 . As I said in my last post, at over 3lbs., this lens has a bit of a weight problem. Carrying this lens and a camera in your hand for an extended period of time can get old very quickly. I strongly suggest you pickup some sort of padded sling strap if you are going to carry a lens of this weight.\nImage Quality\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - Shot at ISO 100, f/5.6, 1/800 sec\nNow that I\u2019ve had this lens for a few days, I\u2019ve been able to feel out this lens\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. The good part is it only has a few weaknesses and one of them is dealing with back-lit subjects. Like most lenses, when you have a large amount of light pouring directly into the lens, your images are going to come out with less than ideal contrast and they will look washed out.\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at ISO 100, f/2.8, 1/1600 sec\nAs I said in the last post, Chromatic Aberration is apparent at the lenses widest apertures but it is not as bad as some of the other lenses I\u2019ve tested (e.g. Sigma 85mm F/1.4). I know this is a very expensive lens and many people will expect perfection from Zeiss (and I can\u2019t say that I blame them) but I try not to worry about things that can easily be fixed in post processing. So the lens has a hint of CA, I personally don\u2019t have a problem with this because the lens excels in other areas that make CA a non-issue for me.\nI personally think the Zeiss 35mm \u2018s biggest weakness when compared to the competition is the lack of AF, but I\u2019ll get into that in the next section.\nDon\u2019t get me all wrong, the Zeiss 35mm is not all bad. Beyond the build quality and great looks, this lens produces excellent results. I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, this lens produces images that have an unexplainable uniqueness to them; subjects seem to really pop from the background areas. Also, I enjoy having to slow down and put thought into what I\u2019m shooting.\nConcerns\nCanon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - shot at ISO 400, f/5.0, 1/125 sec\nI honestly thought this issue would come up before day 3 of the review, but it really reared its ugly head when I was out shooting in town. The issue I\u2019m talking about is the lack of AF. I know, I know, AF isn\u2019t everything and there was a time when AF wasn\u2019t an option but there are times when AF really comes in handy. I missed a few shots that I would have love to have nailed but the lack of AF really restricted me from getting the shot. Maybe if I had more time to practice with the lens I would have nailed the shots, maybe not. I\u2019ve become so accustomed to AF that I couldn\u2019t react quickly enough in order to get the shot.\nSo should the lack of AF be a mark against the lens? Honestly, I don\u2019t think it should be. This lens is what it is. It may not be the ideal lens in all situations, but what lens is? I think if you can live with occasionally missing a shot or if you want to dedicate time to perfecting your manual focusing technique, then you will be more than happy with the Zeiss 35mm F/1.4 .\nBe sure to check back for day 4 of the review when we take the Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE to a birthday part.\nPlease Support The Phoblographer\nWe love to bring you guys the latest and greatest news and gear related stuff.

This means it is in competition with other serious compacts such as the Nikon Coolpix P7100 , Olympus XZ-1 , Canon Powershot G12 , Panasonic Lumix LX5 and others .\nFujifilm FinePix X10 Features\nThe lens features a physical zoom that is also used as the on / off switch, with the lens compacting into the lens when off. The 28mm - 112mm equivalent 4x optical zoom lens with a bright f/2.0 to f/2.5 aperture is only slightly beaten by the f/1.8 - f/2.5 lens on the Olympus XZ-1 .\nFujifilm FinePix X10 On\n12mp EXR CMOS 2/3inch sensor\n4x optical zoom lens - 28mm - 112mm, f/2.0 - f/2.8\n2.8 inch screen, 460k dots\nFlash Hot Shoe\nOptical viewfinder with dioptre correction\nFull HD\u00a0Video mode, stereo sound\nOptical (Lens based)\u00a0Image Stabilisation\nBurst Mode: 7fps full resolution 10fps at 6mp\nManual Control, RAW\nISO 100 - 12800 (6400 at 6mp, 12800 at 3mp)\n1cm Macro mode\nFujifilm FinePix X10 Handling\nHandling - The camera has an excellent rubber thumb grip on the back and a stylish texture covering surrounding the camera and front hand grip. With an extremely solid metal body, dials and shutter button on top, the camera feels extremely well built.\nFujifilm FinePix X10 Pop Up\nThe controls on the top of the camera are a mode dial with 2 custom positions, a shutter release, exposure compensation and function button (this defaults to ISO setting). The function button is used in conjunction with the control dial on the back that can be pressed in as well to select the option. The camera will be extremely popular with people who are a fan of physical controls, with a dial on the front to select the focusing mode.\nFujifilm FinePix X10\nMenus and display: The default display on the back of the camera is to show a status screen, much like you would find on a Digital SLR\u00a0or Digital Rangefinder, with the camera being set so that you can use the optical viewfinder. This display can be quickly changed by using the display button, where you'll also find an electronic spirit level and customisable screen, as well as the ability to switch the screen off.\nInfo Display\nStandard View\nThe menus are like other Fujifilm menus, such as the X100 or F600EXR , so if you're familiar with Fuji menus then you should be able to find your way around quite quickly. Although there is no F / Finepix button. The majority of the photo settings are set in the shooting menu where you can alter colour strength, sharpness, highlight tone, shadow tone, noise reduction and more. Some of the more advanced photo options are found in the setup menu, where you can set the Fn button, AEL\u00a0options, RAW\u00a0mode and more.\nBattery life - The battery life is rated at 270 shots according to CIPA standards. The camera uses a small battery with a 1000mAh rating, although by switching off the LCD on the back and adjusting additional settings, Fujifilm say 640 shots should be possible. We were able to take 260 shots before the battery went flat.\nSpeed - We tested each camera's performance at focusing, shutter response, shot to shot time, continuous shooting etc, and have posted the results below. To test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same conditions.\nFujifilm X10\n"}, {"score": 313.61145, "uuid": "703da615-aefe-5acc-b051-6883b8c1b185", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0006wb-73-24342", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/canon/5D/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Canon EOS 5D Review - photo.net", "snippet": "<em>I</em> have to agree totally with this review of the 5D.

Incredible photos, I have no more need for film. Crop and zoom are clear and sharp.

Too Bad even my photos are great with this camera.\n, May 23, 2006; 03:55 P.M.\nellypses\nlook at verticals at the right building\nBought an EOS 5D two months ago. Just great for reportage, especially in low light situations. Work with a 17/40. Both excellent. NEVERTHELESS... My purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 TSE I already had on a EOS 1N RS, amazing lens. I find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the Canon Pro Services recently told me it was the \"inconvenience\" of full frame captors. But Canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations. I'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional. Camera is just great, but for the TSE system... http://www.jb-avril.com\nTONY (ANTHONY) ROWELL , July 08, 2006; 05:07 A.M.\nI have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the ISO for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the ISO 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then ! there are many settings if you would need them but to many for what i need,i will not need another camera now i have this one what ever canon brings out,mind you if i was a lottery winner,well, say no more !\nImage Attachment: rasberry ripple !.jpg\nvincent martin , July 30, 2006; 05:01 A.M.\nI have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations. I have used 1d mkII, 14n, slr/n, S3pro. etc. S3pro is what i liked best as far as digital. If it is not going to be printed bigger than 8x10 or if it is for web use then virtually every digital becomes the same whether it is $150 or $3000. It makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.\nIf you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job. Who cares if it is 3000 or even 10,000.\nI perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, \"wow I can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier.\" that change makes sense. The have been there and done that (film that is). If they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.\nDo you want to be a photographic machine? Do you want to have all your work essentially be defined by 1's and zero's? If you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like. Shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you. Any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera. If you are rich and dumb, I would definitly suggest going digital. But if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film. I am sure you will. Film kills digital, I know this. Someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something. OK sure and when I whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures. You will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.\nThere is a difference between art and digital is all that I am saying. As far as I am concerned, If you are trying to make what you do take less time and be more efficient, then perhaps you should rethink what it is you are doing. So you did a million weddings and a zillion portraits? Are you ever actually going to look at any of those pictures again? I don't think so. But hey, you got to pay the bills right? wrong!\nWant to really do something? Find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass. Add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what. And you will have spent a lot less than 3000 I guarantee. People throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras. What about film cameras? they hold thier value beautifully. Do the research. Do not complain about high digicam prices. Digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock. You will have more fun. Be smart, do the research. there is a nice hefty dose of text. the bigger the film the better! 1mp=22mp! get the film feelin! collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array! I will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my RB67 lenses and ektars. Now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor. then i could have some real fun!! Can digital do that? no and you don't even need electricity for that one!! you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement. wow that would have been sweet. imagine all the gold coins and shillings you would collect!\nken osborn , September 04, 2006; 02:14 P.M.\nWell, vincent, I agree with what you say and I disent. Having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here. I've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras. Difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras. I went digital in 2001 on a trip to Egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff I brought. OK, I had no plans to shelv my Pentax K1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom. But then I got so many projects going using the \"dry\" darkroom in my computer. And then there were the old family photos, one dating to 1899. After 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, I found I rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old. Go figure! It may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but I've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown. As it should be. I still have my old Pentax and it is loaded, but I don't know when I'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.\nMister Ken (given to me by my students in Egypt)\nFelix M\u00fcller\n, September 08, 2006; 03:24 P.M.\nHow can you call $2900.00 consumer-priced? And what can you do with 13MP? Nothing but giant prints or croping. But if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow. But in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75MP if it is bang up to date and HD-ready with 1080i. But much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record. And traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.\nclaudia veja , September 16, 2006; 08:15 A.M.\nperspective in buildings it's natural and normal\nABOUT ellypses\n@ Jean-Baptiste AVRIL\nThe \"problem\" with that image that you have [posted here is NOT the lens or the camera's problem... From where you stay it's NORMAL to have PERSPECTIVE because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower NOT perfectly \"PERPENDICULAR\" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my English, I'm not a native...) so THAT\"S THE REASON WHY you don't have perfect PARALEL lings there. Perspective is a natural resolt of that...\nTHE 5D it's \"almost\" like the CANON 1Ds MARK II at a much lower price so FOR ME IT\"S GRATE REALLY it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.\nClaudia\nMichael Kelly , September 21, 2006; 10:48 A.M.\nI've gone through two EOS 5D bodies in one week, both purchased from Amazon.com. Each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (I thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _MG_0001 rather than IMG_0001. (It turns out this is not a problem. The underscore means the white space was changed from SRGB to Adobe RGB. Odd that the Canon tech didn't know this.)\nAll CanonUSA could do for me was apologize and take down my information. It is hard to tell whether the dust problems began with Amazon.com or are the result of poor quality control from Canon. I've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.\nI've only used the camera for a brief moment. While I was impressed with the images, I'm disappointed that I'm returned the camera again. My only recourse is to purchase from a local dealer where I can inspect the camera before I buy it to make sure there is no dust in the viewfinder. I've got two extra batteries so I may bring them along, although I'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.\nDust is an issue with digital SLRs, but not right out of the box! If you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware. You may want to do what I'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.\nI shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired. I have been using a 1D for the last 4 years. It is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 MP imaging sensor. I had considered getting a 30D with the ES-F 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but I'm not sure I like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30D and not the 1D or my Canon film bodies. I also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5D is the only choice.\nCanon's quality control has diminished in my mind and I'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box. Unfortunately, I'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1D to finish it. Four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.\nGuido Ersettigh (Milan) , October 08, 2006; 05:45 P.M.\nClaudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -. Unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion. He has all the reasons to complain.\nDavid Manzi , October 09, 2006; 02:33 P.M.\nWell, I love the 5D camera, but to dismiss Nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off. No, Nikon cannot match Canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that Canon is. But if Canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to Nikon? Why can't Canon create a metering system like Nikon's color 3D matrix metering? Why can't Canon make a wide angle zoom as good as Nikon's 17-35 2.8? Canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the Nikon. Canon still has a bit to learn from Nikon in some areas.\nAntonio (Italy) , October 13, 2006; 03:46 P.M.\nHi to all! I've found the review quite irritating for more or less the same reasons that Vincent Martin wrote about -despite i don't agree totally with your post Vincent-. The common error that Philip Greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones. Ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a \"common user\" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense. But if you use the camera like a creative tool maybe the question makes a little more sense. Digital camera like Canon 5D takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances. And they are the present and the future of photography, i know that and i'm very happy about that. But try that little experiment: you took some photos with your brand new 2,799USD Canon5D, some are truly artistic masterpieces and you want to print them. Ok, fine. They're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera. You know that a good print (say Lambda) must be 300dpi to be called a good photo-print...and so? So, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14. Hmmmm... not SO big! A little consideration more: the Hasselblad H3D-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print. A 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a Coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18. Canon 5D or 1D are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.\nevita m , October 17, 2006; 03:42 A.M.\n\"Digital camera like Canon 5D takes terrific images \"\nI still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.\nTom H , October 18, 2006; 09:59 A.M.\nEvita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that. But having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.\nI started with the 300d, switched to the 20d and now have the 5d. And in this time I have started selling images through stock agencies. I do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass. A good camera without the right glass is useless too\nTom\nAntonio (Italy) , October 18, 2006; 05:49 P.M.\nI apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post...\nPedro P. Polakoff III , October 22, 2006; 03:24 P.M.\nStraight from the Camera, No Photoshop except to sign & size it.\nI have to agree totally with this review of the 5D. As one who has shot Leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when I decided to make the transition from my trusty Leica R8's & Leica lenses to the digital world of the 5D with EF-L lenses. I have shot over 8000 images with my 5D now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my Leica.\nI am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5D's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when I did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or Canon' service facility.\nIn all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.\nArunas Salkauskas , December 10, 2006; 02:09 A.M.\n\"A 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a Coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.\"\nIt's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself. A good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.\nAs soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is. I gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital SLR - I could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints. There was one less mis-interpretation of the colour of the original.\nGeorge Carter , December 16, 2006; 03:19 P.M.\nI bought my first DSLR a Canon 30D about 6 months ago and have been well pleased. I have been looking at the 5D as my primary and my 30D as my backup so I won't be losing time changing lenses. If the 5D is a tough as my 30D I will be well pleased. The 30D got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back. No dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens. I was blessed. I do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30D. I have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices. Just looking for some recommendations from who to buy from for the best price.\nSteve Wright , December 21, 2006; 10:15 P.M.\nWell.. what to say? It always fascinates me, just how much passion can be stirred up by the discussion of an artistic tool, in this case, the 5D. I guess painters must debate paintbrush issues as hotly on their forums?? As a keen amateur for 25 years, I've owned a 5D for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination... and I think there lies a fundamental principal. As Evita M put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.\nFor some people, the film v digital argument is relevant and will legitimately continue for a long time. But not for all. The current relative merits and weaknesses of both media have been well-detailed and seem almost rhetorical now. However, digital still-image capture is still very much in its infancy, when compared to the length of time that film has been with us. Who knows where digital will take us in the future? Whilst recent advances have been made in the film domain, they are small and in the future, further advances are likely to remain small, when compared to the strides that have been taken in the digital domain in recent years. Such are the relative natures of well-established and on the other hand, emerging technologies. For me, the argument in favour of digital is all about time, practicality and accessibility. I wonder how many photographers have never gone to the trouble and expense of having their own darkroom, but in recent years have successfully used their computer to shape and knock out great images from their digital camera? Images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.\nVincent Martin's compelling contribution to this discussion highlights the superiority of both the quality and professionalism associated with state-of-the-art film-based work. However, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution JPEG straight to printer, without so much as a mention of Photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect. Like me, they have taken the time and effort to understand, for example, what a colour space is and whether a device uses an RGB or CYMK model. The learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques. They are simply different. Different ways to achieve what in principle, should be the same end, surely?\nWhilst film reigns supreme in many people's opinions, others would argue differently. A recent review of a top photo printer (and by that I mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom. That is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5D, I can understand his claim. Similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical. Both media have their weaknesses.\nIf someone is prepared to arm themselves with generic photographic techniques in order to digitally capture the best possible image in front of the camera, then manipulate that image's properties to produce a work of art, then surely their efforts and dedication to the photographic art should be encouraged and commended?\nDanny Yee , December 30, 2006; 06:35 P.M.\nThe one thing that really impressed me when I had a play with a friend's 5D was the viewfinder. Compared to any of the smaller sensor DSLRs I've used - and certainly the 350D and various Olympus cameras - it's huge.\nFor my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my Olympus E1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).\nI still can't get over that 5D viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of Four Thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get a bigger viewfinder image than the E1's.\nSiya Singh , January 14, 2007; 09:40 A.M.\nhi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously. per minute atleast 10 images or less?? where n is there is option?\nGeorge Pentzikis , January 15, 2007; 03:22 P.M.\nTC-80N3. http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/tc-80n3.shtml, http://www.usa.canon.com/html/cameras_slr/eos3acc.html\nMichael Brown , January 23, 2007; 12:55 A.M.\nVincent, That is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard. It doesn't matter whether you use film or digital. The creative process is not dependant on the tools. Arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer. A good image is a good image whether it was shot on film, with digital, or hand drawn on the back of a stained bar coaster. As for printing, guess what, I can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if I want to go wet. So what's the big deal? The difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't). The difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film. Digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want). Digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film. I'm not saying one is better than the other. I'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense. Sure, I could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5D, but I'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than I would on a good digital camera.\nTom Moore , January 25, 2007; 08:35 P.M.\nI am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then I ever did with film.\nTom\nDick Arnold\n, January 28, 2007; 09:38 P.M.\nI am not an expert. I had own my own photo business which I closed about the time I converted to digital in 2003. I used Bronicas and a number of Canon bodies and lenses. I loved the slide films in the studio. I enjoyed making prints in my dark room I did PR, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books. I miss film. However I know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital. I have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a Canon D60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19. I do, however, use L lenses which I think more important than a couple of megapixels. I use photoshop and shoot raw. Digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality. I can do in 15 minutes what used to take me all day in the dark room In my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture. It needs to be supported with acceptable, not super, equipment. The best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the PandL. Some artists work with a knife and others with a fine brush. There is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than I can sell the originals. I am thinking about a 5D, but frankly I shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 I have. The 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640. I have not been able to resolve this megapixel issue in my head i.e what is an acceptable minimum? How much better is eleven megapixels? Is full frame visibly sharper to the viewer than 1.6 at usual viewing distances? I don't really know. Perhaps I don't keep up as well as when I had the business. A little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19. Again, I am no expert but I have taken a lot of pictures.\nBrian Cincotta , February 02, 2007; 04:58 P.M.\nTom, you made a comment and you said:\n\"I am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then I ever did with film.\"\nCould you explain?

I'm sort of at a loss. ********************************************\nHi Brian-I don't think I am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.\nI would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed. Plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.\nI bought the DigiRebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because I used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.\nBefore digital, I had to pay to have the negatives developed and the photos printed--the good ones AND the bad ones!\nNow, I just delete the bad ones and print ONLY the good ones! :)\nI LOVE my Canon Digital Rebel! :) I am having so much fun with it! Again, my answer is only a guess.\nNedine O'Brien , February 27, 2007; 06:21 A.M.\nGreetings all,\nI've only been studying photography for three years and started doing B&W film in a wet darkroom. I really enjoyed being in the darkroom. I found it very relaxing. My Canon EOS 10 is still my favourite camera but it is now in need of repair :-( So I got myself a 300d. I ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot. I really don't enjoy the digital darkroom. Also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close! I don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital. The noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.\nI received my 5d for xmass this year. I love this camera! It has meant a huge learning curve for me. I put aside all thought of film and decided to learn how to use digital properly. I enrolled in a digital class and things changed. I believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film. They are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours. You cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end. It is the same as film and digital to me, you end up with a photograph at the end but they are not the same. (am I making any sense?)\nWhen I got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing. I've suddenly rediscovered my love of photography. I still don't enjoy the digital darkroom that much but I am learning and starting to get results. Compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film. It also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time. They are now approaching what I use to produce with my film camera. When using digital you need to 'think' digital.\nfloyd H , February 28, 2007; 01:14 A.M.\nLCD Screen Troubles\nGreetings camera fans, I've had my Canon 5D for at least six months and everything is great EXCEPT the LCD screen. Sure, I know it's a lot bigger than than the 20D and I've read all the who-ha of people praising it but I noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and I though my light meter was off. On the LCD skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine but I need my LCD to show me exactly what I'm getting. My 20D does this. The LCD is saturated and colors pop. What you see is what you get. It's great. I thought I was going to get that and more when I bought my 5D. Boy was I in for a surprise. There is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot. You can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings. Clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum. I shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount. I just can't seem to get a saturated look on the LCD and it causes frustration during the shoot. It's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a LCD screen as good as my $500 point and shoot. I took it to Canon Factory Service and they said there was nothing they could do. \"That's the way it is\". So far there is no firmware update to correct this. I know I don't need glasses. Maybe I just bought the only 5D lemon. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem. I know some of you are probably saying \"use the histogram\"! I do. When I work I constantly use the histogram and I need to make snap judgments based on the LCD image and my exposure readings. I love the fact that the 5D has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots I find myself using the 20D. I really think Canon dropped the ball on this one. There is no color settings to adjust the LCD, you can only adjust the brightness levels. I must say that the 5D's image quality is great. It's just a hard camera to use for glamour. I think I may be selling this one soon.\nDavid Palermo , March 01, 2007; 03:45 P.M.\nHello all,\nI am in the market for a new pro camera - I currently do \"pro\" work with a Nikon D70 but it's time to get something more durable and higher resolution. I don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the D70. I want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with LITTLE or NO noise in shadow areas. I work mostly with available light so I have to have to make sure I buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - I shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.\nMy camera choices are: Nikon D2x, Nikon D200, Canon 5D, Canon 1Ds Mark II (or wait for the new Canon 1D Mark III (8mps)).\nDo you recommend a 5D for what I do? I could buy the 1DS Mark II as a backup (kidding!).\nIf I shoot at ISO 100 or 200 with a longer shutter speed will I notice as much noise? I have used a Canon 1DS Mark i and II and I found the quality to be excellent. I am hoping to use a D2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5D will do well.\nAny advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated. If I decide to switch to Canon now is the time since I don't have too much Nikon equipment. Although the D70 would make a great backup camera.\nThanks,\nDavid\nBeren Patterson , March 12, 2007; 02:32 A.M.\nI'm hanging out for the 5D Mark II! I don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but I would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3\" LCD off the 1D Mark III. I don't know if the 3\" LCD will fit onto the back though. I would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.\nBeren : zhero.net\nJonathan Farmer , March 22, 2007; 01:31 P.M.\nCan anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5D, D2Xs and the FinePix S5 compare with respect to image quality. I am at the cross roads of staying with Nikon optics or going over to Canon full frame system (a major expence)\nvermac santos , March 31, 2007; 07:52 P.M.\nJonathan, I'm in the same dilemma, thinking about 5D, FinePix S5 or simply buy a Nikon fisheye for my D200 for my landscape images. I already own a Sigma 10-20mm and a Nikon 18-200mm for this job.\nThe D2Xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large Canon's sensor nor the tremendous S5 dynamic range. I see the 5D more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics. I don't see the interpolated Finepix megapixels exceed the Canon. The only problem for deciding for 5D is the price.\nVertino Machado\nDavid Alpert , March 31, 2007; 11:31 P.M.\nThe 5D is excellent in low light. Check out Thomas Hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at ISO 1600. The richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing. I can't get close to that with my D200.\nBernie Ess , April 01, 2007; 06:35 P.M.\nHi, I have the 5d since 1 year now, before the FUJI S2 and S3. TO make a very long story short: Both Fuji and Canon have their strengths, the Canon with the right converter for RAW (I prefer Canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc. However have been used to 12MP files from the Fuji, although it was an interpolated 12MP, and the Fujis - both S2 and S3 - made nicer colors. Both richer and more pleasing, and more \"film like\". The Canon always looks to me like reduced, I guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors. Dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the S3 pro (and now the S5). Highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.\nHowever I like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor. 85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective DOF/ unsharpness when I wish. Also I use the 24mm TS-E shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any Nikon or Fuji camera. Only Canon builds DSLR with full frame sensor right now.\nConcerning film versus digital: Both have advantages, but it is mainly a very personal question. WIth digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not \"overshoot\" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest. It is possible, just a question of self- control.\nAll in all, the 5d has made me shoot things I would never have shot without it. It is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.\nRegards, bernie\nJonathan Farmer , April 06, 2007; 10:51 A.M.\nThanks guys for your advice. It is still a hard decision; I think I will be shooting with the D200 for a bit longer and wait to see if Nikon do go FF or if they stay with DX.\nI have read that Nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.This link is not bios in my opinion and it is not writen by Nikon.\nhttp://www.michaelclarkphoto.com/d2xreview.html\nDavid Falk , April 06, 2007; 03:45 P.M.\nAnyone know when Canon will be updating the 5D?\nAsher . , April 14, 2007; 02:01 P.M.\nB&H, not Amazon\nPhil- not sure if PN has some backroom deal going with Amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier is B&H Photo : huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service I've ever experienced.\nAmazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.\nmark powell , April 14, 2007; 03:58 P.M.\nThe film vs. digital is such a worn out debate. In all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important. Wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.\nKarl Westphal , April 28, 2007; 10:22 P.M.\nSouthern Ladies\nI was thinking about buying a 5D but have decided to wait a month and buy a 1D Mark III.\nI currently own a 20D and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a \"real\" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera I had used was a single use disposable film camera).\nI only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which I have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent. I would not sell any of my images.\nI use Photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc. I won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other \"non-original\" images into the photoa. For the most part I keep the original RAW files and print the best of them. I keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.\nI understand vincent's viewpoint but we all have different levels of purism. It is my opinion that it is \"cheating\" to use some of the more advanced Photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a \"better\" image than you originally captured. I think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of Photoshop work afterwards.\nI have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.\nDigital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (I admit I am one of these people however I have a \"moral code\" regarding the level of digital adjustments I will make). With a 8 gig. memory card I can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking I will have a few great images; with film unless I had tons of cash I would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.\nIs film or digital better? A photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital. Film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (I have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class). If you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or I have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.\nPersonally I dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.\nBest Regards\nAndrew Klerck , May 03, 2007; 03:44 A.M.\nI work at a Photo lab. After seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, I would have to say that almost everything from the Canon 5D has been the closest i have seen to film quality. It certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.\nDigital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!). A real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one. Its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......It really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.\nAside from all my rambling though, the 5D is definately the best digital camera out there!\nPhilippe Poussier , May 09, 2007; 11:27 A.M.\nThanks for the review first.\nOwning a 30D with satisfies me quite well, I must say that I miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5D is definitely the choice for me.\nNow, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5D version makes me slow down my upgrade...\nDoes the 5D has it all or is there any solid rumour of upcoming good upgrades on it in the coming 6 month ?\nRobert Ingram , May 11, 2007; 12:39 P.M.\nI just bought a Canon 5D. Apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the Canon 5D with the Sigma DC 17-70 f/2.8 lens. Being very uneducated on the 5D sensor, I went along with his request.\nI just got everything in the mail today and I am experiencing MAJOR vignetting from this lens. Can someone please explain this? I am assuming this lens is not designed for the 5D. Could someone with more knowledge on this issue please expound?\nAnd, with that said, what would be my best alternative for event photography?\nAndrew Klerck , May 12, 2007; 04:19 A.M.\nhey Robert, well the 5D is a full frame sensor (like a film SLR). Whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20D, 30D etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts. Saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem. I would say that if you have the money to spend on a Canon 5D then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses. The canon 17mm-40mm F4 lens works beautifuly with the 5D and if you want the F2.8 then try the Canon 24mm-70mm Pro lens. These may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5D is so you can produce QUALITY pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!! a cheaper alternative but still good is the Tamron range of lenses and they go down to F2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.\nRobert Nurse , May 15, 2007; 11:41 A.M.\nHi Beren,\nHave you read anything about the 5D Mark II or any type of replacement? All I'm finding are rumors. I'm in the market for a 5D and wouldn't mind waiting if I knew what the feature set would be.\nJeremey Barrett , May 18, 2007; 12:22 A.M.\nRobert (Ingram), the Sigma DC 17-70 is designed for APS-C sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5D. The salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5D (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).\nJose Escobar , May 18, 2007; 02:26 A.M.\nMy 5ds had a defective light meter.\nI had two samples of this camera sent to me by B&H and Canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!). The light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations. My 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.\nI then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results. So a total of 3 5ds and all of them underexposed with backlighting. The only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure. This is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding. You can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.\nNeedless to say I am still using my 20d for demanding shoots, but I am considering a 1d mark III or a 1ds mark II. If the rumors are true and Canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d I might be interested in that as well. I felt compelled to speak up when I read that Philip said this is ?the best digital camera available.? Not in my experience.\nColin Mark Chapman\n, May 21, 2007; 03:10 P.M.\nI was just at my local Jessops store & the guy there told me that production on the 5D has now ceased! And, that there are no plans for an upgrade or the inevertable 3D. Has anyone else heared of this? I'm torn on buying the 5D. This dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for Canon right now). Weather proofing, D O F button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) I just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1D mk3.

Digital is just someone's opinion, but I find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.\nArtistic Film, and Artistic Digital Photography are two different beasts. In film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print. In Digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).\nTo be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the Digital Tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to \"tweak\" a photograph is so much greater than that if film. Its almost a non-comparison.\nThe remark is also extremely snobbish.\nDigital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, Digital Photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie. photo processing stores). Not enough people have the resources to set up a full B&W/Color Photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of \"fine art\". So what do we have? We have millions of Average Joe's with an $800 DSLR that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.\nI've done both, and personally, Digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos. I have SO much control over my images, it scares me. I loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures I took are just sitting up in a box somewhere. Why would I spend extra money on development and enlargement on a photo that cannot even be manipulated on basic levels that is such commonplace in Digital Photography today?\nFilm Vs. Digital, is insulting. There are no \"winners\" just have fun with what YOU like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.\nradek hensler , June 14, 2007; 02:01 P.M.\nWell, everyone says it's a perfect camera, but... I've got one issue to clear up. What about autofocus in 5D. I've heard lot complaints from those who used Nikon D200 and switched to canon 5D. After this they appreciate AF they used to have in Nikon. Obviously there is nothing better to them than full-frame sensor in 5D but how really bad is with Autofocus in 5D? Can anyone tell me? I know the problem from my old film EOS and I've never been happy about this AF. Even AF from basic Minolta worked better than mine. So, please tell me that canon did some progress in this case in 5D Best Regards Radek\nBuck Lovell , July 13, 2007; 05:44 P.M.\nPhilip Greenspuns very ignorant statement in his review \"the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses\" bring into question his entire review. There is NO magnification with the smaller sensor cameras. It is a crop factor only. The sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else. I suggest Mr. Greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.\nBuck Lovell\nLandrum Kelly\n, July 16, 2007; 10:41 A.M.\nBuck, the key word here is \"effectively.\" When you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the EFFECTIVE focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size. In very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor. Without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.\nPut another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an EFFECTIVE focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10D, 20D, 30D, and Digital Rebel Series. That is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience. (The actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the Canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the Nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)\nI rather, uh, suspect that Phil G. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word \"effectively.\" If he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully. Sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.\nAs for the 5D, I bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time I am using it, as well as looking at the finished work. I will never miss the Kodak 14n that it replaced, although I occasionally miss the aperture rings on my Nikon lenses that I had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high ISO.\nLooking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and Canon v. Nikon, etc. These are all valid tools. Shall we not use them? Shall we not suspend judgment until we have actually tried them?\n--Lannie\nShane Phil , July 19, 2007; 12:46 A.M.\nI have tried both Canon and Nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: Canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the ISO which is not automatic. The 5D especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses. It lacks a proper LCD display. Flash system is average. It is a patient studio photographer's camera. Nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts. The auto ISO is one of the best features that can be put into a digital SLR. Nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art. Nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's. Even a camera like the D40 has a much superior LCD than the 5D.Tests say the Nikon's Vibration Reduction system is better than Canon's IS system. If you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go NIKON.\n, July 19, 2007; 09:10 A.M.\nGO NIKON! GO CANON! Nothing like objectivity. . .\nShane, here is a group of guys who just might disagree with you. This is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly EOS systems at the Olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where \"every moment counts\" (your phrase). After you have felt the full impact of the above photo, go read Bob Atkins' preview of the Canon 1D Mark III .\nI have to admit, however, that both the Nikon D200 and the Nikon D2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d. The 5D does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest Canon DSLR, but at present neither Nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1D Mark III does.\nIt is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just Canon and Nikon--and not just at the high end. I do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.\nThere are certainly a lot of good Nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at this link for Nikon products . Although I have never shot either, the specs on the Nikon D200 and the Nikon D2x are very, very impressive. They are very fast for DSLRs. In addition, the build quality of Nikon cameras is legendary.\nThere are a lot of good cameras out there from quite a number of manufacturers. As for the 5D, yes, I believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed. Although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly \"a patient studio photographer's camera,\" and no one who has used it would characterize it thus. It is also a good bit less expensive than the Nikon D2Xs. In a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera. Things keep changing.\n--Lannie\nShane Phil , July 21, 2007; 01:13 A.M.\nLannie,\nThanks for your comments. My comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon. Its just my personal opinion just like anyone else's on this site. I'm no big fan of Nikon, I just like the cameras they make.\nOfcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.\nYes, i chose my camera based on my requirements, and i recommended them on this site.

At least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.\nAndrew Robertson , August 24, 2007; 02:32 A.M.\nCome on, I see at least 2 or 3 Nikons out of the 60 or so cameras in that Olympics shot. That's pretty good market share for Grandpa's camera brand!\nIn all seriousness, Nikon has been lagging behind Canon for years now, especially when it comes to long lenses and of course full frame digital. As a Canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, I hope that Nikon absolutely trounces Canon with its new full frame D3 and its D300 cameras. Heck, the Pentax K10D trounces the 40D due solely to its in body anti shake.\nAll this competition is really going to benefit everybody here. So hurray Nikon and hurray Pentax.\nI think all we have seen thus far in the DSLR game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.

I have done clay, batique as well as crayons. Even tried my hand at oil. I never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button. When I purchased my first 35mm camera 26 years ago, I realized a new brush. I have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform. I also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art. In some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression. After much review, I am purchasing the 5D. I think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with. I have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., I have just added to what I enjoy.\nXiaoyuan Gu , November 28, 2007; 10:12 A.M.\nIt is time for Canon to throw the goodies of 1D MKIII and 40D to a 5D MKII, to seriously compete with the Nikon D3. Had I not invested a good number of Canon L glasses, I would definitely go for Mamiya or Nikon D3. At the 10K range, the benefit of MF is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1Ds MKIII's 6.4um. Yes, Canon can do 14bit AD conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the AD stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)? Single pixel size MATTERS! That's why 5D is such an amazing gear, will so is the Nikon D3.\nI do not care about the difference between 12Mp and 22Mp. As a matter of fact, I print photos not posters most of the time. And I am fine with 3-5 FPS, as I am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though). I am waiting for the 5D MKII, and keeping my finger crossed that Canon with stay with 12Mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5D, and come up with a quality LCD such as that found on the new Nikons, dust removal (5D is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.\nCanon, forget about the Megapixel and FPS fight! Get the LCD and autofocusing right!\nQuico \u00c1lvarez , December 05, 2007; 06:03 A.M.\nHi, Folks:\nI am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so I think that my choice should be The Eos-5D. The only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's A/D conversion is 12 or 14 bits. I am afraid that the answer is the first one, because Canon don't say anything about it in the \"specs\", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand EOS-1Ds Mark III. So I am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.\nQuico \u00c1lvarez , December 06, 2007; 02:44 P.M.\nI found it: EOS-5D is 12 bit per channel in color depth. So it is not so professional as pretended.\nJoao Pedro Jorge , January 13, 2008; 02:36 P.M.\nI've been reading reviews on the 5D and the 40D because I'm thinking of buying a new camera. I got two cheap lenses: the ordinary EF 28-90 and a Voigtlander 19-35mm. I'm very fond of wide lens photography and I wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :). I found two shops that sell the 5D for $849 and the 400D for $339 which is incredibly cheap. So, given the fact that the 5D is so cheap, should I buy that one instead given the facts that I presented to you?\nalan cukurs , January 16, 2008; 01:01 A.M.\nget the 5D. If you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit. On the price, are you getting one used? Be aware of online scams. Do a store review before purchasing.\nJoao Pedro Jorge , January 19, 2008; 10:08 P.M.\nThanks Alan! Actually I've done exactly that, and you were right :(. It's in fact a scam! After that I've found so many scams like that one that I recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online. So, my procedure was the following: 1. Search for prices for the camera I wanted. 2. Get a sort of average price. 3. Any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases). Just Google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: \"BestPriceCameras reviews\"\nSo, it seems that the cheapest 40D (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5D around $2200. Well, I guess it's not a big news for you guys :).\nThanks again\nJonathan Farmer , January 25, 2008; 05:47 P.M.\nSurly the 5D is due for a make over; will it be the 5D Mk2??

He said I should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5D was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500. So, I hope he really did have the inside info, and that a Canon \"5D II\" is on the way.\nBrandon Boghosian , April 05, 2008; 11:09 P.M.\nI'd like to thank everyone out there buying Canon 5D's and other dslr's. You've successfully driven the price of a EOS 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on eBay. For that, you're in my debt.

It's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price. I am sure you will enjoy your EOS3. I enjoy shooting with my Elan7, as well as my CANON 5D. I have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my Xti to the 5D. Either way, I have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely L-glass. Happy shooting.\nBrandon Boghosian , May 26, 2008; 10:55 P.M.\nAlan, The same way hybrid's are killing the SUV market. More and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.

I agree it would be nice to have the price of Canon L series drop. I was not sure what you meant by \"effect\". I enjoy film and still purchase film equipment. I have found some really good deals on medium format cameras. It is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.

Cheers\nRobert Cudlipp , June 04, 2008; 05:12 A.M.\nI have a Canon 20 D and am very happy with it.\nHowever, the issue of the cropping factor continues to be a source of frustration. This is particularly the case as I like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm SLR speak) to 35mm.\nSo far as this is concerned, given the very diffucult engineering required to produce a high quality wide angle zoom, I would prefer to purchase wide angle prime lens : L series only.\nAt the moment I have the following Canon lens: 24- 70 2.8L; 70 -200 /4L; 135/2L; 80/1.8 ,non L; 50/1.4.\nI would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5D appeals, even if the \"motor drive\" is limited to 3 fps.\nI can readily purchase a quality 40D, but to me that is not going forward.\nBy the same token, I cannot afford any of the more upmarket Canon full frame digitals.\nIs there a view that the 5D is just the first full frame pro-sumer digital that will soon be replaced by Canon? If so, I would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40D.\nI have a quality range of L series glass and if I went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes. You are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging \"one wide angle zoom that suits all\" etc. Would be quite happy using L series primes, only need to purchase 25mm L and that would complete my lens complement.\nAny views?\nalan cukurs , June 07, 2008; 02:56 A.M.\nI have a friend that purchased a 40D. He likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5D. If you have not used a 5D, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you. I typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well. One thing to note which I think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges. I shot with a rebel xti and when I went to the full frame 5D I noticed the vingetting. There are remedies for this, similar to shooting 35mm film with a wide angle lens. It really is a great camera for what I do, mainly portraiture and some landscape. If you need high frames per second, I would not recommend this camera. I do not know about the engineering but I seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe. One last thing, I found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings. Instead of buying a wider lens I opted to go with a bigger frame 5D. Best regards.\nGeorge Slusher , August 23, 2008; 06:59 P.M.\nNice review. One nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8L. The 70-200mm f/4L is a LOT cheaper (the f/4L IS is cheaper than the non-IS f/2.8L) and a lot lighter (the f/4L IS is about half the weight of the f/2.8L IS). Some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4L IS is a \"better\" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8L at the same apertures. The IS will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money. About the only reason I can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8L would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds. I have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.\nColin Carron\n, October 03, 2008; 05:16 A.M.\nNow that the Canon 5D Mk II has appeared (september 2008) the original 5D is looking rather outdated. And the 50D with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5D Mk II are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.\nBut nonetheless the 5D is still probably the most affordable full frame around. It's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower. So for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5D may well still be a good buy.\nI enjoy using my 5D as much as ever and will continue to do so. I think I will prbably not upgrade to the Canon 5D Mk II as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear. By that time I hope Nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that I can think aout returning to Nikon.\nMeanwhile it is instructive to look at the posts above if only to note that the predictions and rumours in them are all entirely wrong.\nZoe Hellar , January 01, 2009; 03:51 A.M.\nThe Canon 5D Mark 2 has generally been given rave reiviews and has be tagged as the wedding photographers camera of choice. I have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com\nFolarin S , February 05, 2009; 09:00 P.M.\nA New Perspective\nAs a new member on photo.net,I have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful. The daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users. I for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.\nKudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology. And we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.\nHaving recently found a great deal on a 16-35L,it seems clear that I should do the right thing and move from a Rebel to a 5D(MkII still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass. I just wonder whether the 'dust magnet' issue will come back to haunt me further down the line.\nJDM von Weinberg\n, June 16, 2009; 02:52 P.M.\nAs a very late visitor to this page, long after the Mk II is out, and after I have bought myself a nice used 5D, I have to say that the original review was nice, but many of the comments above seem to me to be by people who either haven't ever actually used the camera, or, at the least, have never read the manual.\nNot that it matters, but I think one would do better to search for 5D on the EOS forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.\nAnuar Patjane\n, October 03, 2009; 02:36 A.M.\nIt survived a trip to Mexico?

One of the advantages of static subjects is that the photographer can use a tripod to maximize sharpness. When shooting fast moving objects, the photographer must either increase the shutter speed (shutter controls the duration of the exposure) or open the diaphragm (a series of overlapping metal leaves that can be adjusted to specific apertures to control the amount of light entering through a lens) (Carver & Lee, 1985). Opening of the diaphragm (aperture) is rated in f/stops. The lower the f/stop (ex., f/2.8), the larger the aperture, the more light entering the camera, the slower the corresponding shutter speed, and the more shallow the depth of field. The larger the f/stop no., (ex., f/16) means the faster the corresponding shutter speed, that less light enters the camera, a smaller aperture opening, and a greater depth of field. The depth of field is that area of acceptable sharpness in front of and behind the subject that is in sharp focus (Carver & Lee, 1985). In taking photographs, you have probably noticed that some areas are in focus while others are not. In order to have the maximum sharpness in all areas of the photograph, the photographer must use a small aperture (a large f/stop--ex., f./16). Static subjects help in accomplishing this by, as previously stated, allowing for the use of a tripod and f/stops of 64 or higher. This is an area for which the medium and large format camera is especially well-suited. The 35mm, as noted above, is meant for the active and dynamic subject. For the teacher, this type of camera offers the best selection of features, including: ease of operation, light weight, size, and is excellent for use with both dynamic and static subjects.\nThe Lens\nIn most cases, when purchasing a camera, one just gets the body. This is especially true for the SLRs and the more expensive medium range cameras. Deciding which lenses are needed becomes a difficult and sometimes confusing endeavor. Perhaps the most popular lens for the SLR is the normal lens which is usually about 50 mm (focal length -\"the distance from the film to the center of the front of the lens (when focused at infinity)\" (Horenstein, 1974). In addition to the normal lens, there are the wide-angle and the telephoto. The wide-angle, the most common being either the 28 mm or 35 mm, is excellent for wide-angle shots (i.e., landscapes). The telephoto lenses are generally the 105mm, 135 mm, and 200 mm. It is also possible to buy 500mm and even 1000 mm. These lenses are, however, extremely expensive and require a large aperture opening (usually an f/8 or below). Besides landscape photographs, the 90-105 mm lens is excellent for portrait photography.\nPerhaps one of the best bets in purchasing a lens is to buy a zoom lens. The zoom lens, according to The Basic Book of Photography (Grimm, 1985) is \"a lens that can be adjusted to varied focal lengths while keeping the subject in focus\" (p. 347). The zoom lens in an excellent accessory and at times a definite necessity. The two most popular zooms are the 35-70 mm and the 70-200 mm. With these two lenses in hand, there are very few pictures which cannot be taken. From wide-angle to normal and telephoto, these two lenses will provide a variety of focal lengths. The 70-200mm is an indispensable attachment at weddings, parties, vacationing, and especially for informal portraits. By setting the lens at 105 mm an excellent normal range close\u2011up may be taken. By increasing the lens to 200 mm, the pictures take on an interesting air of modeling or sophistication. The 70 mm creates a nice full length shot. It should be noted, that in selecting the zoom over stationary lens (e.g., 35, 50, 105, 200 mm, etc.) one must sacrifice some quality of sharpness. With new technology in lenses, the difference in clarity is not normally perceivable.\nIn connecting the lens to the camera body, the manufacturers have chosen two approaches. The first, called the screw mount is exactly that - the lens is screwed into the camera body. The second method is called the bayonet mount. In this mount process, the lens is dropped into a slot, usually indicated by a red dot, and turned slightly. The lens then locks into place. Although normally, one mount is a useful as the other. In an emergency, however, time is of the essence. Even the few seconds required to unscrew and screw on lenses may cause the loss of a picture. For this reason, the bayonet method is usually preferred.\nThe autofocus lens, a relatively new invention, helps the photographer in determining the correct distance for taking a shot by automatically adjusting the lens to the correct focus (Grimm, 1985). This is accomplished by the use of an optical sensor. Autofocus lenses and cameras are becoming abundant and affordable. It is also possible to exchange some autofocus lenses to other autofocus cameras. Until recently, the autofocus produced several unfavorable effects. The most obvious was the tendency of the camera lens to focus on the center of the object. This is undesirable if the photographer is attempting to focus on several items or an item outside the center of sharpness. New advances have nearly eliminated this problem.\nAnother lens which should be discussed is the close-up lens. The close-up lens has the ability to focus on extremely close objects, making it possible to take pictures of flowers, insects, etc. These lenses attach in front of the normal lens and are usually screwed, by the use of threads, onto the normal, telephoto zoom, or individual close-up lens. Close-up lenses are usually referred to in power or strength sequences. Examples would be: +1, +2, & +4 . . . +10--a plus 10 being the strongest. An increased closeness may be obtained by employing a tube known as an extension tube. According to Grimm (1985), the extension tube is \"one or more rigid tubes or rings used for making close-ups; inserted between camera lens and body to increase lens focal length and magnify the subject\" (p. 337).\nThe macro lens is one which is sometimes confused with the close-up lens. The macro lens refers to the lens itself without the use of any extension (ex., close-up attachment or extension tube). This means that the macro lens looks similar to the normal, zoom, or wide-angle variety except that the lens is designed specifically to focus on extremely close objects. The macro lens, although more expensive than the close-up attachments, allows the photographer to take sharper, easier close\u2011up shots. Some lenses allow the photographer to focus as close as 2 inches in contrast to normal lenses which allow a close focus at no less than 1.5 feet.\nAnother consideration in selecting lenses is their price. Lenses, like everything else, vary greatly in cost. Some are available for less than $100.00, while others prices soar into the thousands. Although lenses are manufactured throughout the world, the best are produced in\nGermany\nand Japan - the cheapest in price being\nJapan\n. In purchasing a lens, several factors should be taken into consideration. These include: sharpness, maximum aperture opening (e.g., an f/1.2 is better than an f/2.8), and durability. Most lenses made by Nikon, Minolta,\nOlympus\n, Cannon are of excellent quality and durability. When it comes to lesser known manufacturers, there are however, several excellent bargains for the cautious buyer. Seek help from an independent professional photographer before purchasing any piece of expensive photo equipment.\nControlling the Depth of Field\nAside from light, one of the most important aspects of photography is controlling the depth of field. This photographic technique is often times misunderstood or ignored by the novice (in most cases with disastrous consequences). Although previously discussed, this topic deserves some further clarification.\nAccording to Carver & Lee (1985), depth of field is the \"range of sharpness, lying about one third in front of the focus point and two thirds behind . . .\" (p. 17). In some cases, it is desirable to have all areas of the photograph in focus. At other times, however, the photographer may wish to have certain areas of the print in focus while others are deliberately out of focus (Feininger, 1982). According to Horenstein (1974) there are three ways of controlling the depth of field. The first and most important control is aperture. By opening and closing the aperture (or increasing or decreasing the f/stop), a photographer can determine the depth of the shot. A large aperture (ex., f/2.8) means a small depth of field while a small aperture (ex., f/16) means a large field. The second way to control the field is by varying the distance between the subject and the camera. Quite simply, the greater the subject to camera ratio, the larger the depth of field. The final control is the focal length of the lens. A normal lens (50 mm) will provide greater depth of field than a telephoto lens (200 mm) which produces a shallow depth of field.\nIn determining the depth of field, the photographer using the SLR is assisted by being allowed to preview the final composition of the shot. \"As the aperture gets smaller or larger, the zone of focus visibly increases or decreases\" (Horenstein, 1974, p. 28). When using automatic lenses, however, the lens aperture always remains open to its fullest degree. This changes only the second the picture is taken. For this reason, another method must be used for determining or viewing the field. Therefore, many cameras have a manual or preview button on the side of the camera. When using the preview button the operator, while looking through the camera, presses the button (Horenstein, 1974). This steps down the lens to the prescribed f/stop opening. What about the depth of field scale? This scale, is located on the barrel of the lens. Printed on the camera lens are two movable scales. The first is the aperture ring which consists of series of f/stop numbers (ex., f/16 11 8 5.6 4 2.8 1.9). The second is the focusing ring. This ring, by turning to either the left or right, brings the camera lens into focus. This ring consists of a series of numbers known as a distance scale. When a subject stands a certain distance from the camera (e.g., 15 ft.) he will be in focus when the distance scale reads 15 feet. When the individual is in focus, turn the aperture ring to determine the correct f/stop setting. If you select a f/8 or any other f/stop number the depth of field can be determined by looking at the small line of numbers between the aperture and focus ring. These numbers are usually set up as follows:\n16 ' 8 '' * ' 8 ' 16\nBy using the above information of a focus of 15 feet and a f/8, the photographer can look at the middle non\u2011movable ring. In this case depth of field would be between 12 ft and 30 ft.\nExample:\nfocus ring or distance scale\nft 30 15 10 7 5 4 3 2.5\n16'8''*'8'16 depth non-movable ring\n16 11 8 5.6 4 2.8 1.9\naperture ring (f/stops)\nOne more term to remember, circles of confusion. This term refers to the \"range of sharpness both in front of and behind the point of focus . . .\" (Carver & Lee, 1985, p. 16). Most photographers, both professional and amateur have learned through trial and error, the importance of depth of field. Another area, closely related to depth of field is hyperfocus distance. This technique has been used by photographers for many years to produce outstanding prints. When the photographer focuses his lens on a subject a considerable distance away (ex., infinity), the \"depth of field extends from infinity to a point closer to the camera. Depending on the f/stop, the infinity to near focus distance is called hyperfocus distance\" (Carver & Lee, 1985, p. 19). Concerning this matter, Carver & Lee (1985) has suggested the following chart:\nf/4 f/5.6 f/8 f/11 f/16\n70 60 55 45 30\nPerhaps one of the best definitions of hyperfocus is provided by Maurice L. Haselgrove in his book, Photographers' Dictionary. According to Haselgrove (1963):\nThe distance on which the camera lens must be focused to give the greatest depth of field. Everything between half the hyperfocus distance and infinity will then be apparently in focus. If H is the hyperfocus distance, s is the stop number of the aperture used, f is the focal length of the lens, and contact printing is envisaged with a circle of confusion of 1/100 in. then\n100 f 2\ns\nthe units H being the same as for f. (p. 128)\nReturning to the circle of confusion, William A. Price (1992) states that it is important for all students to possess an understanding of how the circle of confusion works with different focal length lenses and amount of enlargement.\n[An understanding of this matter does] away with the old-wives-tales about wide angle lenses having enormous depth of field, especially when the amount of enlargement could be varied. This . . . [directs the student's attention toward] a discussion of using the lens focal length to control perspective rather than depth of field when enlargement can be varied. After a series of pictures with lenses of different focal lengths [it is concluded] that normal perspective is gained with a 100 mm lens on a 35 mm camera rather than the 50 mm so-called \"normal\" lens. (p. 1)\nThe Shutter\n\"A device, built in the lens or camera, that regulates the length of time that light reaches the film to make an exposure.\" This, according to Tom Grimm (1985, p. 344) is the definition for a shutter. Exactly what does this mean? This section will attempt to explain to the teacher or amateur photographer, in simple detail, the meaning, workings, and results of the photographic shutter.\nThe shutter has two main functions: controlling the timing and controlling the movement (Horenstein, 1974). In controlling the timing, the shutter is used to regulate the amount of light entering the lens of the camera and striking the light sensitive film. The time period during which light enters and strikes the film or the period in which the shutter is open is called the shutter speed. Speeds vary on some cameras from thousandths of a second to the \"T\" and \"B\" selections which allow for shutter to be locked into an open position. The \"T\" position (time) allows the shutter to remain open until the shutter button is repressed. The \"B\" position (bulb) is open as long as the shutter button, bulb, electronic shutter button, etc. is pressed. Once the button is released, the shutter closes. This may be achieved by either directly pressing the button, and holding it down with your finger, or with an accessory known as a cable release. The cable release is \"[a] flexible cable that screws into the shutter release and allows the photographer to trip the shutter without pressing the release with his finger; used for time exposures to prevent camera movement\" (Grimm, 1985, p. 333). In many cases the release is made of metal and consists of a stiff piece of thin metal which is affixed within a larger piece of hollow tubing. The hollow tubing is screwed into the shutter release on one end and has a metal plunger attachment on the other. When the metal plunger is pressed in, it inserts the thin flexible metal rod into a specially made hole in the shutter release button, thus pressing the button down. The bulb release, similar to the metal cable release, is a plastic or rubber cable which on one end attaches to the shutter button and on the other to a rubber bulb. When the bulb is squeezed, air is forced down the cable and presses the shutter button. As long as the bulb is squeezed, the shutter remains open.\nIn controlling the movement the shutter, if appropriate to the composition, is used to freeze movement. The faster an object or person moves, the higher shutter speed a photographer must use. If an object is at rest, a shutter speed of 1/30 of a second may be sufficient to provide no blurring. In fact in some cases the shutter may, as previously discussed, be allowed to remain open for seconds or even minutes. If, however, an object is in motion the shutter speed must be set to freeze the movement or action. A person walking may require a 1/250, while a speed boat may require a shutter speed of 1/1000th of a second. Another item to take under consideration when taking a picture is the steadiness of hand of the photographer. If the photographer moves his camera, even very slightly, there is always the possibility that the picture will be blurred. To prevent this from occurring a photographer should always, when hand holding a camera, use a shutter speed of 1/60 or higher (Eastman, 1981). If a speed lower than this is required, it's always best to use either a tripod or monopod. In a \"pinch\" a bean bag may be used to steady a camera. In this procedure, a camera is placed on the bag and the shutter released either by an air or cable release.\nIt should be noted, before moving on from the topic of shutters, that there are two types of shutters. Most photographers prefer the focal plane shutter. The focal plane shutter is located in front of the film and moves either vertically or horizontally across the focal plane. This type of shutter is used with SLR cameras which allows for the interchange of lens and faster speeds. There are however, states Horenstein (1974), two drawbacks. The focal plane shutter produces more noise, (which is not a great consideration unless one is working with excitable subjects) and also vibration, which can at low speeds cause blurring. The leaf shutter which is used in rangefinder cameras is located inside the lens and consists of a series of \"overlapping metal blades that open from the center of the lens toward the edges. The blades are controlled through a combination of gears and springs\" (Carver & Lee, 1985, p. 24).\nTaking the Picture\nAccording to Ernst Haas, an internationally recognized photographer, \"For me it is important to forget myself when I photograph . . .\"(Eastman, 1981, p. 23). There is much to be said for this technique. Just as the Zen Buddhist becomes part of the bow, leading the arrow on its true trajectory, so too must the photographer become a part of the photographic process \u2011 leading and being led. \"Trust that little voice in your head that says `Wouldn't it be interesting if . . .' And then do it\" (Eastman, 1981, p. 21). These words by Duane Michals, echo the feelings of many great photographers.\nTake pictures for the sheer enjoyment of taking them. Never get bogged down by technique and lose sight of the fun of photography. There are, however, several things one must know about the rules of composition. As rules, they are made to be broken. But to break a rule, one must first must understand the rule, apply the rule, and determine WHY in certain cases it should be broken. Also be prepared to defend your position why a specific rule of composition has been broken.\nThe Rules of Composition\n2. Use of Parallel Lines\n3.

Hummm.\nNPC / Pentax\nGood news for Pentax 645 owners (me included). A reader has reported that he visited Photokina yesterday and saw the first digital back for the Pentax 645.

They are apparently working on getting the electronics into the film insert cavity, so the second generation will be a lot more compact. Also, he will use a larger 645 chip as they become available.\nSaturday, 28 September, 2002\nPhase One\nDPReview has reproduced a press release from Phase One in which they state that they will be releasing their image processing software for the Canon EOS 1Ds initially, followed by a release for Nikon DSLRs.

My guess is that its the former, as I know how hard working a major trade show can be.\nPentax\nBut if that's the case then some major companies have not made needed announcements, and this is bad news for them. One that immediately comes to mind is Pentax, who really needed to position themselves properly vis-a-vis a digital solution for their 645 system. The salience is deafening. With their competitors Mamiya, Contax and now Hasselblad offering comparability with the very popular Kodak DCS Pro Back Pentax becomes the only major 645 format camera maker with no digital offering. It's my belief that unless they do so no later than PMA, many professionals will start to abandon them.\nNikon\nAnother major manufacturer that appears to be missing in action is Nikon. Now, Photokina is the largest photographic show in the world, and happens only every two years. It isn't as if it sneaks up on you. It could well be, as some readers have conjectured, that the Kodak 14 Megapixel camera took them somewhat by surprise. Sure they knew something was coming (they supply the body parts to Kodak), but I think that the jump in resolution that both Kodak and Canon have offered may have taken them off guard.\nMamiya\nA correspondant in Japan has alerted me to the fact that Mamiya has announced on their Japanese web site a 26mm f/4.5 super-wide angle lens for their 645AFD camera and also a 43mm f/4.5 for the RZ67 Pro II.\nContax\nContax today announced two new lenses for its N series film and digital SLRs.

The camera is a co-development between Hasselblad and Fuji. The H1 will be branded in Japan as Hasselblad/Fuji and in the rest of the world as Hasselblad. A Japanese language press release can be found here . (Trying using Babblefish for translation of this and other foreign language web pages).\nErik Sundstrom on the Medium Format Digest on PhotoNet reports that \"In an interview with a guy from Hasselblad in a local Swedish newspaper one can read that there will be an adaptor that enables the use of V-series lenses on the H1. That\u2019s good news. The article also mention that the cost for the whole development project was 35 million Euro\u2026 and that American wedding photographers is one of the prime target groups. The auto focus mechanism is supplied from Minolta and the lenses from Fuji, as already mentioned in the thread. Two thirds of the camera is supplied from external suppliers and the manufacturing of the camera house, finder and all assembling is done by Hblad in Gothenburg. The price will be about 55.000 SEK, that\u2019s about $5900, but I can\u2019t read from the article if the cost is just for the camera house or a package with other stuff.\"\nThe original source (in Swedish) is http://www2.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=118&a=102687\nBadger Graphics is quoting the H1 at U.S. $2,213 for the body and $5,695 with finder, grip and back. Robert White in the U.K. is quoting the package price as \u00a34,000 , which is about $6,225 U.S.\nSinar\nSinar has announced their Sinarback 54, which will utilize the new KAF-22000CE CCD image sensor, jointly developed with Kodak.

The chip measures 38.8 X 50mm, making it essentially the same size as 645 format film.\nSo now we have full-frame digital 35mm format cameras from Contax, Kodak and Canon, and full-frame medium format (at least 645) from Sinar.\nKodak\nIn addition to all of its other professional digital announcements Kodak unveiled the \"Kodak KAI-11000CM, an 11-million pixel interline transfer CCD color image sensor that enables professional photographers to capture high-resolution images with a full-field 35mm format image sensor... The KAI-11000CM also provides a fluid motion preview for viewing subjects on a studio monitor, making it ideal for portrait and social applications.\"\nThis is an OEM product and will end up soon in cameras and backs made by third parties. Clearly Kodak has lifted itself up by its bootstraps and now intends to become (remain) a major player in the professional digital imaging world. This is great news for every photographer in the days ahead as it will increase competition in this area and provide us with better products at lower prices.\nTuesday, 24 September, 2002\nMinolta\nMinolta has announced a number of new products today, none terribly exciting. Evolutionary rather than revolutionary.\nCanon\nAccording to a MacCentral news report out of Japan this morning the price of the EOS 1Ds will be U.S. $7,663, not the $8,999 price mentioned in the Canon U.S. press release of earlier today. A welcome $1,300 reduction, if true, but still a deterrent for many.\nImaging Resource has published a first-look review of the EOS 1Ds.\nHasselblad\nAs anticipated in yesterday's Kodak announcement of a its latest 16MP DCS Pro-Back, Hasselblad has now announced its new 645 format Hasselblad H1 . This is that venerable company's first autofocus camera and also their first 645 format model (though 645 backs were available for previous 6X6 bodies).\nPhotos Courtesy Hasselblad\nThe camera will take 120 and 220 film backs as well as Polaroid and digital backs. The initial HC series autofocus lens line-up includes a 35mm f/3.5, 50mm f/3.5, 50-110mm f/3.5-f/4.5 zoom, 80mm f/2.8, 120mm f/4, 150mm f/3.2 and a 210mm f/4. A 1.7X teleconverter will also be available. What an exciting offering! Last year Hasselblad looked to be in financial trouble. Now they've come roaring back with what appears to be a superb state-of-the-art camera system. No prices as yet, but availability is supposed to be before year's end.\nIt didn't occur to me when I first read the announcement of the H1 that the lenses might not be made by Zeiss, as they have since time immemorial (or at least since 1950). In fact the web page doesn't indicate at all whose lenses they are. A bit of sleuthing has turned up that the new Hasselblad's lenses are made by Fuji, not surprising given their XPan relationship.This is no bad thing since Fuji makes some superb lenses. Just a bit surprising given the company's long-standing relationship with Zeiss.\nOlympus\nPhil Askey of DPReview has posted photographs of Olympus' Four Thirds Systems prototype. These photographs are the first look anyone has had of what some have been calling the Olydak. This is a prototype, under glass, so it would appear that a shipping camera is still some ways off. Frankly, the size reduction promised (which is one of this new format's main selling points) does not appear to be evident from this example.\nIf you think about it, regardless of the merits of the system Four Thirds is a simply awful name for a new camera standard. \"So, what kind of camera do you work with?\" \"Me, I have a Four Thirds.\" What is that in metric, 1.33? Common!\nCanon\nThe excellent French magazine Chasseur d'Images has posted a first review of the Canon EOS 1Ds. This will appear in the November issue of the magazine. It is only in French, and unfortunately because it is in PDF format can't be translated online. But, the bottom line is that they give the 1Ds essentially perfect marks on every test.\nFor those that can't read French DPReview now has the full Canon press release and technical specs as well as a full preview report on the EOS 1Ds. Steve's Digicams also now has a 1Ds preview online.\nCanon Japan now has a slick \"Flash\" web site with a comprehensive EOS 1Ds product overview as well as sample images, including 32MB sample files for downloading!\nOf concern is that the Canon U.S. press release states the list prices as $8,999. Deliveries are to start in November. Regardless of the camera's merits, this may turn out to be more than many photographers are willing to bear \u2014 even many pros. This is medium format digital back territory (the 16 Megapixel Kodak DCS Pro back is somewhat more expensive at $11,995), and with Kodak's 14 Megapixel DCS-14n priced below $4,000 Canon may find considerable price resistance at this level.\nKodak / Olympus\nOlympus and Kodak have announced today their support for the Four Thirds Systems , a new standard for a reduced size universal lens mount system. This will also standardize a chip size smaller than full-frame 35mm thus allow lenses to be made smaller and lighter. It will be interesting to see how many other of the major manufacturer's climb on this bandwagon. Remember half-frame? Another Olympus idea that had merit never caught on.\nMonday, 23 September, 2002\nKodak\nDPReview has published comprehensive specs and the press release for Kodak's Pro DCS-14n , its new 14 megapixel full-frame CMOS digital SLR, previewed yesterday by a Rochester NY newspaper.\nKodak\nAlso being reported from Kodak is its DCS Pro Back 645H a new version of its excellent 16 megapixel digital back. What does the \"H\" stand for? (We already have this back available as the \"C\" for Contax and \"M\" for Mamiya.) The \"H\" is for Hasselblad \u2014 the long rumoured but now real Hasselblad H1. Quoting from Kodak's press release... \"The H1 camera body's contemporary design is specially designed for digital backs and film magazines. It features an all-electronic user interface that communicates with lenses, film magazines and the viewfinder. The LCD displays information from the digital back, providing photographers with quick access to histograms, format and white balance status.\" Interestingly, the H1 hasn't yet been formally announced by Hasselblad, though it certainly will within the next 24 hours.\nLeica\nPhoto Courtesy Leica\nLeica will be formally announcing the R9 this week. This appears to be a minor and incremental improvement over the R8, with a small weight reduction and a few additional features. Several additional R series lenses are also likely to show up.\nThe official press release by Leica is now online.\nSigma\nI overlooked including these in yesterday's summary, so here they are now.\nSigma at the end of last week announced several interesting new lenses. This company really seems to be moving up-market. Among the ones that readers here may find of interest are an 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6 EX \"OS\" lens, with the OS standing for Optical Stabilized. Yup, the first such lens from anyone other than Canon and Nikon.\nThe second is a 300-800mm f/5.6 EX IF HSM with a constant f/5.6 aperture. Now that should be interesting! No prices or availability yet. These lenses will be available in Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Pentax and Sigma mounts.\nCanon also will have new lenses. One that is known is the EF 24-70/2,8L USM , replacing the already superb 28-70mm f/2.8L. Hard to understand the raison d'etre for this lens at the moment.\nSunday, 22 September, 2002\nPhotokina begins on Wednesday the 25th in Cologne, Germany. There will be a huge number of new photographic products announced, some digital, some traditional \u2014 most evolutionary, and possibly a few revolutionary.\nAs the week progresses I will report on what I hear about that I find to be of interest (no \u2014 I will not report on the 396 new digicams that are going to be announced), and I will provide links to web sites that have breaking news and useful information. I'll also give you my opinions on what's announced.\nPhoto Courtesy Canon Corp.\nWith the show opening still 3 days away the two most exciting products for serious photographers are the Canon EOS 1Ds, an 11 Megapixel CMOS sensor digital SLR, and the Kodak DCS Pro 14n, with a 14 Megapixel (also CMOS) sensor, and a price of U.S. $4,000. I have a preliminary spec page on the Canon camera online, and more information on Kodak's Nikon-bodied digital SLR can be found in a report today in the Rochester, New York (home of Kodak), Democrat and Chronicle newspaper.\nPhoto Courtesy Kodak\nIf these two new cameras have you salivating, but you don't know where the money is going to come from to be able to afford one, you might want to read my just-published essay The Digital Revolution & Equipment Angst .\nPhoto Courtesy Sigma Corp.\nSigma will finally be ready to ship its Foveon-chip based SD-9 digital SLR in late October. The price has been announced at U.S. $1,800 making it (at least for now) the least expensive digital SLR, undercutting the Canon D60, Nikon D100 and Fuji S2 by $200-$600. The main issue that I see is that one will only be able to use Sigma lenses with this camera.\nSinar (I was their Product Manager for Canada about 25 years ago) has announced the joint development with Kodak of a 22 Megapixel CCD imaging chip for medium format camera backs. Some web sites are erroneously reporting this as a \"digital back\". Not yet. The chip measures 4080 X 5440 pixels and is 38.8 x 50.0 mm in size, close to the size of 645 format film. The implication for photographers is that while the new Canon 1Ds and Kodak 14n at 11MP and 14MP respectively boost 35mm format digital SLRs into medium format territory, medium format is now moving upwards as well. No indication as yet of when we'll see this in a commercial back, and for which cameras, or of price. But, you can be sure that it will not be inexpensive.\n\"Congratulations on Issue #5 \u2014 yet another stunning Video Journal.\nI eagerly look forward to them every three months\nand am continually impressed with their quality and usefulness\".\nVideo Journal #5 is Now Shipping\n"}, {"score": 292.3769, "uuid": "02360c86-da23-5d85-bc80-47af6e738435", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0003wb-84-27048", "target_hostname": "luminous-landscape.com", "target_uri": "http://luminous-landscape.com/new/photokina2002.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1807273e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "photokina-02", "snippet": "The KAI-11000CM also provides <em>a</em> fluid motion preview <em>for</em> viewing subjects on <em>a</em> studio monitor, making it ideal <em>for</em> <em>portrait</em> and social applications.&quot; This is an OEM product and will end up soon in <em>cameras</em> and backs made by third parties.", "explanation": null, "document": "Photokina 2002\nNews and Commentary\nEntries are presented in reverse chronological order, with the most recent news at the top of the page.\nThis page does \"not\" contain reports on the 3,546 new digicams being announced this week.\nPhotokina is now over.

There's good news and there's bad news. A readers has written that he saw the lens today at the show. He reports that it's around 18cm in diameter, about 57cm long and has a weight of approximately 5kg. Sigma says that the price will be between 8.000 and 10.000 Euro. (Roughly the same as dollars). Hummm.\nNPC / Pentax\nGood news for Pentax 645 owners (me included). A reader has reported that he visited Photokina yesterday and saw the first digital back for the Pentax 645. It is made by NPC in cooperation with Mosaic Imaging. The first generation model has the electronics off to the side, looking similar to a Polaroid back for the 645. They are apparently working on getting the electronics into the film insert cavity, so the second generation will be a lot more compact. Also, he will use a larger 645 chip as they become available.\nSaturday, 28 September, 2002\nPhase One\nDPReview has reproduced a press release from Phase One in which they state that they will be releasing their image processing software for the Canon EOS 1Ds initially, followed by a release for Nikon DSLRs. Up until now this software has only been available for the company's own medium format and large format digital backs.\nKodak\nDave Etchells of The Imaging Resource has just published the first hands-on look at the exciting new Kodak DCS Pro 14n .\nSigma\nLetsGoDigital has published a page on the new Sigma SD9 and the new lenses that we're previewed here a few days ago. I'm especially interested in the APO 300-800mm f5.6 EX IF HSM, which if it performs well be a very exciting lens for wildlife photographers.\nRollei\nRollei has dug into its past and resurrected their wide angle twin lens reflex from the 1960s. This new camera is named the 50mm Rolleiflex TLR. It features a Schneider-Kreutznach Super-Angulon 50mm f/4 lens.\nPhoto courtesy Peter Wolff \u2014 www.PHOTOgraphical.NET\nRollei was also showing their already announced 6008AF, the world's first 6X6cm autofocus camera. A surprise announcement was the new Rollei 35RF rangefinder camera, based on a modified Voigtl\u00e4nder Bessa R2 body along with with three leica M-mount Rollei-lenses. These are a Sonnar 40mm f/2.8, a 50mm f1.8 Planar and an 80mm f/2.8 Planar. Imagine \u2014 Zeiss design lenses in a Leica mount! Welcome to the new millennium.\nPhoto courtesy Peter Wolff \u2014 www.PHOTOgraphical.NET\nFriday, 27 September, 2002\nEither announcements from Photokina have died out, or the people reporting from Cologne are too busy eating Bratwurst and drinking Pils. My guess is that its the former, as I know how hard working a major trade show can be.\nPentax\nBut if that's the case then some major companies have not made needed announcements, and this is bad news for them. One that immediately comes to mind is Pentax, who really needed to position themselves properly vis-a-vis a digital solution for their 645 system. The salience is deafening. With their competitors Mamiya, Contax and now Hasselblad offering comparability with the very popular Kodak DCS Pro Back Pentax becomes the only major 645 format camera maker with no digital offering. It's my belief that unless they do so no later than PMA, many professionals will start to abandon them.\nNikon\nAnother major manufacturer that appears to be missing in action is Nikon. Now, Photokina is the largest photographic show in the world, and happens only every two years. It isn't as if it sneaks up on you. It could well be, as some readers have conjectured, that the Kodak 14 Megapixel camera took them somewhat by surprise. Sure they knew something was coming (they supply the body parts to Kodak), but I think that the jump in resolution that both Kodak and Canon have offered may have taken them off guard.\nMamiya\nA correspondant in Japan has alerted me to the fact that Mamiya has announced on their Japanese web site a 26mm f/4.5 super-wide angle lens for their 645AFD camera and also a 43mm f/4.5 for the RZ67 Pro II.\nContax\nContax today announced two new lenses for its N series film and digital SLRs. These are the Planar T* 85mm F/1.4 and Tele-Apotessar T* 400mm F/4 priced at $1,449 and $3,830 respectively.\nThursday, 26 September, 2002\nKodak\nThe only new film announced so far is from Kodak \u2014 who continue their product announcement juggernaut. Ektachrome E100G and 100GX films will replace Kodak Professional Ektachrome E100S and E100SW and will be available in the first quarter of 2003. I'll look forward to an opportunity to test these new films as I have yet to find a Kodak transparency emulsion that I prefer to those from Fuji.\nThe design and manufacture of Kodak's 14MP CMOS chip is by FillFactory , a Belgian company, and chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor an Israeli company.\nDurst\nIf you have a bit of extra room in your basement, and are finding that an Epson 7600 or 9600 isn't able to make large enough prints for your needs, you might want to consider the new Durst RHO 160 inkjet printer.\nWednesday, 25 September, 2002\nHasselblad\nI can now confirm that the Hasselblad H1 announced yesterday does indeed use Fuji lenses. The camera is a co-development between Hasselblad and Fuji. The H1 will be branded in Japan as Hasselblad/Fuji and in the rest of the world as Hasselblad. A Japanese language press release can be found here . (Trying using Babblefish for translation of this and other foreign language web pages).\nErik Sundstrom on the Medium Format Digest on PhotoNet reports that \"In an interview with a guy from Hasselblad in a local Swedish newspaper one can read that there will be an adaptor that enables the use of V-series lenses on the H1. That\u2019s good news. The article also mention that the cost for the whole development project was 35 million Euro\u2026 and that American wedding photographers is one of the prime target groups. The auto focus mechanism is supplied from Minolta and the lenses from Fuji, as already mentioned in the thread. Two thirds of the camera is supplied from external suppliers and the manufacturing of the camera house, finder and all assembling is done by Hblad in Gothenburg. The price will be about 55.000 SEK, that\u2019s about $5900, but I can\u2019t read from the article if the cost is just for the camera house or a package with other stuff.\"\nThe original source (in Swedish) is http://www2.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=118&a=102687\nBadger Graphics is quoting the H1 at U.S. $2,213 for the body and $5,695 with finder, grip and back. Robert White in the U.K. is quoting the package price as \u00a34,000 , which is about $6,225 U.S.\nSinar\nSinar has announced their Sinarback 54, which will utilize the new KAF-22000CE CCD image sensor, jointly developed with Kodak. This chip is 22MB and contains 5440 X 4080 pixels of 9 micron size. The chip measures 38.8 X 50mm, making it essentially the same size as 645 format film.\nSo now we have full-frame digital 35mm format cameras from Contax, Kodak and Canon, and full-frame medium format (at least 645) from Sinar.\nKodak\nIn addition to all of its other professional digital announcements Kodak unveiled the \"Kodak KAI-11000CM, an 11-million pixel interline transfer CCD color image sensor that enables professional photographers to capture high-resolution images with a full-field 35mm format image sensor...

But, you can be sure that it will not be inexpensive.\n\"Congratulations on Issue #5 \u2014 yet another stunning Video Journal.\nI eagerly look forward to them every three months\nand am continually impressed with their quality and usefulness\".\nVideo Journal #5 is Now Shipping\n"}, {"score": 288.64374, "uuid": "acf298c1-e7b6-5422-8f41-f66bb2c84aa7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-37-20550", "target_hostname": "blog.nikonians.org", "target_uri": "http://blog.nikonians.org/archives/2005/11/", "page_rank": 2.9486558e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Nikonians News &amp; Blogs: Interviews, Talkshows, News and More", "snippet": "<em>Nikon</em> appears to be rolling out the first firmware upgrade <em>for</em> its D2X and D2Hs digital SLR <em>cameras</em>. <em>Nikon</em> Asia&#x27;s website now offers <em>a</em> Mac and Windows updater <em>for</em> firmware version 1.01 <em>for</em> both of these professional <em>cameras</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 285.98047, "uuid": "5d854296-2b74-5cc1-ba58-923e77665c9c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0204wb-69-34421", "target_hostname": "www.normankoren.com", "target_uri": "http://www.normankoren.com/phototechnique.html", "page_rank": 1.5029958e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Photographic technique, part 1: equipment, mostly", "snippet": "<em>For</em> most of us that means choosing <em>a</em> <em>camera</em> from one of the two systems with the widest range of lenses, Canon and <em>Nikon</em> (unless you have the budget <em>for</em> Contax or <em>Leica</em>, which have superb lenses).

It's not intended to be comprehensive. Image quality and fine printmaking are discussed elsewhere on this site. I'll be adding details and links as time goes on.\nUntill March 2003 I used 35mm cameras (Canon FD manual focus SLRs and the Hasselblad XPan), which are capable of finer results than many people realize. With good 35mm technique you can make wonderfully sharp 13x19 inch prints (as large as most consumer photo printers can handle). Of course you can do even better with larger formats-- my best images in the 1970's were made with Hasselblad 6x6 cm. I have a flatbed scanner, the Epson 3200 , that can make scans good enough for sharp 13x19's from medium format; it scans film up to 4x9 inches. Medium format and 4x5 still tempt me\u2014 I've refurbished my old Hasselblad gear (a 500C with 50, 80, 120 and 250 mm lenses).\nSince March 2003 I've been using a Canon EOS-10D digital SLR with outstanding results. Although resoultion isn't quite equal to 35mm at its best, sharpness is excellent and consistent, colors and tones are superb, and there is no noise or grain at ISO 100 and 200, and it's minimal at 400. Some of the new lenses are outstanding. It replaces my Canon FD system, but I still use the XPan for panoramics.\nThis part discusses camera equipment and technique. Part 2 discusses photographic vision, panoramic photography, and travel.\n.\nCorrect monitor calibration\nis vital for viewing and making fine prints. Two key parameters, Black level (often labelled Brightness) and Contrast, are set on the monitor. A third, Gamma, is set in the video card lookup table (LUT). Contrast is normally set to maximum. Color temperature should be set to 6500K or lower\u2014 6500K looks best on most CRTs. It can be set on the monitor (preferably) or with the video card/color management software, but not both. Color quality should be set to 24 or 32 bits. The room should be dimly lit; no direct light should shine on the screen. Gray images should look subjectively gray to your eye. For flat screen (LCD) monitors, Screen resolution (right-click on the wallpaper, Properties, Settings) should be set to the monitor's native resolution.\nGamma defines the curve that relates the pixel levels in your computer to the luminance (brightness) of your monitor and prints, using the equation,\nLuminance = (pixel level/255)gamma + black level\nYou can estimate gamma from the pattern on the left side of the chart on the right by viewing it from a distance and observing where the average luminance across the pattern is constant. Gamma should be set to 1.8 for older Macintosh systems (2.2 seems to be the current standard) or 2.2 for Windows systems and the Internet sRGB color space using techniques in Monitor calibration: Setting gamma . Gamma is extremely sensitive to viewing angle in most Laptop LCD screens.This chart is only for monitors; it doesn't work on printed media.\nYou can set your monitor's Black level using the mostly black pattern on the right of the chart. This pattern contains two dark gray vertical bars which increase in luminance with increasing gamma. (If you can't see them, your black level is way low.) The left bar should be just above the threshold of visibility opposite your chosen gamma\u2014 it should be invisible where gamma is lower by about 0.3. The right bar should be distinctly visible, but still very dark. Black level interacts with gamma; you may have to go back and forth two or three times.\nThe pattern provides a good indicator of display quality. Cheap LCDs can't achieve a constant neutral gray appearance. But good flat screen displays can be excellent.\nFor more detail and a larger chart, see Monitor calibration: Gamma and black level .\nI encourage you to load this chart on your computer and check it occasionally.I'll be happy to grant permission to reproduce it on your website if you e-mail me, give me credit and a link to this page.\n. Camera\nSurprise! Your choice of camera body isn't all that important. (An exception is action photography, which includes sports, wildlife, children and pets, where fast autofocus with an option to follow action and matrix metering can make a big difference.) Lenses are much more important. For most of us that means choosing a camera from one of the two systems with the widest range of lenses, Canon and Nikon (unless you have the budget for Contax or Leica, which have superb lenses). (Minolta, Pentax and Olympus are also OK; I just don't know that much about them. Pentax seems to be improving.) I'll keep this section short because I don't keep up with the latest camera models and features. You can find plenty about cameras on photo.net and in the links below. Until April 2003, when I received the EOS-10D , I was using Canon FD manual focus cameras and lenses, made before about 1986. You can learn more about them from my the comprehensive Photography in Malaysia site and from Christian Rollinger's Canon FD documentation project . When I started using Canons in the 1970's they seemed to have more bang for the buck than Nikons. Now I use them out of familiarity.\nMy favorite 35mm camera is the all-manual Canon \"New\" F-1 , which was manufactured from 1981 to 1986 . It features exceptional construction quality, full manual operation (focus and exposure), and match-needle spot metering of the central 12% of the frame (ideal for use with the zone system ; it makes it easy to determine zone placement). The older Canon F-1 and FTb are also excellent choices and less expensive. The main advantage of the \"New\" F-1 is that its exposure meter operates faster in dim light. This makes a big difference with the manual aperture 35mm f2.8 TS (tilt/shift) lens which must be stopped down for metering and exposure. The precision feel of the \"New\" F-1 makes it a pleasure to use.\nOne problem with the old Canon F-1 and FTb is that they were designed for the PX13/PX625 mercury battery, which is no longer manufactured (it makes highly toxic waste). The solution is the MR-9 adaptor from C.R.I.S. Camera Services in Phoenix, Arizona, that allows you to use a silver 76 battery instead. It consists of a nicely machined adaptor and a five cent germanium diode to drop the voltage.\nApril 2003: Everything has changed now that I have the EOS-10D . I'm selling most of my Canon FD equipment. I'll probably buy a full-frame body (24x36 mm sensor) in about two years when prices should drop to my comfort level (I've love the 1Ds, but I can't justify $8,000 US.)\nLenses\nIf you want to make large high quality prints, lenses make a bigger difference that anything else, particularly if you support the camera with a decent tripod and use fine film. Lenses are classified as prime (single focal length) or zoom (variable focal length). Focal lengths under 24mm are considered ultrawide; 24-40mm, wide; 50-60mm, normal; over 80, telephoto; around 80-105, portrait.\nPrime lenses tend to be lighter, faster (larger aperture, i.e., lower maximum f-stop), less expensive, and have less flare (susceptibility to light bouncing between glass elements that tends to fog the image in contrasty light) than zooms of comparable focal length. The best modern zooms (for example, the Canon L-series) are very sharp, particularly at moderate apertures (f5.6 to f11); their performance often equals fine prime lenses. Cheap zooms vary in quality. Some are quite decent; some are junk. Zooms are incredibly convenient; they enable you to frame an image precisely, and you don't need as many lenses.\nLenses tend to be sharpest between two stops down from maximum aperture and f11. At f16 and beyond, sharpness is limited by diffraction. 35mm cameras should be set to f/16 or beyond only when extreme depth of field is required, but large formats cameras, such as 4x5 or 8x10 work well at apertures smaller than f/16.\nThe best site for lens reviews is PhotoDo . Unfortunately it's is no longer being updated; it doesn't have recent lenses. It uses modern MTF (modulation transfer function) tests, which are used by manufacturers in designing lenses. Its articles about MTF testing are well worth reading, as is my series, Understanding image sharpness and MTF . The old \"lines per mm\" tests were subjective and inadequate in many ways, though they could be useful for comparing lenses. Fredmiranda.com has a nice set of user reviews for Canon, Nikon, and independent lenses. Photo.net has excellent reviews of several lenses with user comments. I don't pay attention to lens reviews published in the major advertiser-supported magazines. They tend to be \"review-mercials.\" Popular Photography's reviews contain real data, but their format doesn't make for easy omparison of different brands and models.\nI used the Canon FD manual focus system, which was manufactured until 1986, until I got the Canon EOS-10D in April 2003. I've been gradually selling most of my FD bodies and lenses . EBay prices have dropped considerably in the last two years; some great bargains are available for film buffs.\nHere are some of my favorite Canon FD lenses:\n20mm f2.8\u00a0 An ultrawide with excellent sharpness. I've heard the 17mm f4 is also outstanding.\n35mm f/2.8 TS (tilt-shift; illustrated on the right) A magnificent sharp lens that turns your 35mm camera into a baby view camera. The tilt feature allows the plane of focus to be tilted, so for example, if you are taking a scene with close-up flowers in the forground and mountains in the background, you can get them all in focus without stopping down very much. This allows reasonably fast shutter speeds (important, for example, in photographing wildflowers, which sway in the slightest breeze), and helps minimize sharpness loss due to diffraction . I also have a 35mm f2 that is supposed to be excellent, but I haven't used it much.\n28-85mm f/4 and 35-105 f3.5 zooms both appear to be excellent, but not quite as sharp as the prime lenses in this range. I need to do some serious testing on these lenses. The 35-105 only focuses to 1.5 meters\u2014 an annoying limitation.\n50mm f/1.4\u00a0 Canon's old standard lens. Very sharp. Their 50mm f1.8 is also extremely sharp as well as being extremely cheap used. If you want a standard of sharpness to compare with zoom lenses, this is your ticket.\n100mm f/4 macro\u00a0 Great for close-ups, and very, very sharp. I prefer long focal lengths for close-up work; you don't have to get right on top of the subject.\n80-200 f/4 L zoom\u00a0 An outstandingly sharp zoom, equal to prime lenses. Expensive on the used market. The standard 80-200 f4 is also excellent (sharp, but not quite incredible) and much less expensive.\n300mm f/4 L\u00a0 Very sharp. I haven't used it a lot.\n400mm f/4.5\u00a0 Also seems sharp. Too bulky to carry on long hikes (at least for me); doesn't travel far from the car. Great for wildlife.\nWhen I'm traveling light I take the 20mm, the 28-85 or 35-105 and the 80-200. If I'm a little more serious I add the 35mm TS, 100mm macro and 300mm. If I'm not serious at all but I want to carry a camera just in case, I take the 28-85. Unfortunately, the FD lenses don't work with the newer (post-1986) EOS bodies, film or digital. My EOS (EF) lenses are listed on my page on the EOS-10D .\nAccording to Zeiss ( Camera Lens News No. 10 article on film flatness), \"more than 99% of all customer complaints about lacking sharpness in their photos can be attributed to misalignments of critical components in camera, viewfinder, or magazine, focus errors, camera shake and vibrations, film curvature , and other reasons.\" Film curvature is not a problem with digital.\nWhen you're shopping for a lens, you will be interested in the magnification at the lens's closest focusing distance. Canon doesn't give it in all its literature, but you'll find it here, on the USA lens listings .\nTripods\nA sturdy tripod is invaluable for making sharp photographs. You'll need to choose between the two types of leg material.\nMetal: Sturdy and inexpensive, but heavy.\nCarbon fiber: Extremely sturdy and very light, but expensive. Looks like plastic, but it's actually a \"composite polymer,\" which is another word for plastic. It might make you feel better after you see the price tag. Carbon fiber tripods are typically 2 to 3 pounds lighter than comparable metal tripods. This can make a huge difference on a 10 mile hike, especially if you're sixty. The Manfrotto 443 (3.5 lbs; 68\" max; 3 sections, $348 ), shown on the left, and 444 (3.5 lbs; 62\" max; 4 sections, $369 ) are both very attractive. Gitzo carbon fiber tripods, for example the G1127 Mk2 (2.5 lbs; 59\" max; 3 sections) and G1128 Mk2 (2.6 lbs; 55\" max; 4 sections) are an alternative, but also expensive. They work well with Manfrotto heads.\nYour choice depends on your application (no use bothering with carbon fiber unless you carry it long distances), budget, and degree of macho. (I once went backpacking with a guy who carried a cast iron frypan. He was proud of his strength. I thought he was nuts.) Some tripods come as complete units\u2014 legs and head together. The Manfrottos (Bogen in the US) I use allow you to purchase them separately. You'll also have to choose between a pan/tilt or ball head. I prefer ball heads\u2014 they're more compact and I find the easier to adjust. Photo.net has a useful tripod page. I have three tripod/head combinations.\n(My favorite; purchased summer 2003) The carbon fiber 443 with the 488RC2 head, described below. It's as tall as I need and as sturdy as the 3221WN, but three pounds lighter.\n(Heavy)\u00a0 The sturdy 3221WN (6.2 lbs; 71\" max; 3221W when I purchased it) legs with a 222 / 3265 grip head (described below; weight 1.8 lbs; supports 5.6 lbs; works especially well for panoramic imaging). Solid enough to comfortably support a 400mm lens. Taller than I need. Too heavy (for me) to take on long hikes.\n(Older; I no longer use it.)\u00a0 The lightweight 3001BN legs (3.9 lbs; 57\" max; 3205 when I purchased it) with a 3262QR ball head (discontinued; similar to the 484RC2 ). Not as sturdy or tall as I'd like\u2014 I have to stoop slightly when I use it. Adequate for lenses up to 200mm, a little wobbly, but usable with care, for 300mm, and pretty risky with 400mm.\nAll these tripod legs open wide so you can get really low if you need to\u2014 also very useful on slopes. I'm sometimes tempted to mount the 3265 head on the 443 legs because it works so well for panoramic photography.\nHeads\u2014 The 222 grip head ( 3265 in the US), shown on the right, is incredibly fast and convenient. Although it's only rated at 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) capacity, it's sturdy and capable of supporting most medium format cameras. I've used it successfully with a 400 mm lens on the 3221W tripod\u2014 it's great for wildlife. I'm a little leary about using it with the lightweight 3205 because it would become unbalanced when tilted sideways for portrait (vertical) orientaton. But I've had no problem with the 3221W, even with an 80-200 mm zoom.\nA solution to the portrait orientation balance problem is to use an elbow bracket\u2014 a device that attaches to the camera and has two quick release mounts that allow you to rapidly switch between landscape (horizontal) and portrait orientation. Really Right Stuff makes one for the EOS-10D that does not, alas, work with Manfrotto heads.\nManfrotto's model 341 Junior Elbow Bracket (left) works with the 3157N quick release plate used in the heads on this page. It has only recently become available in the US. It's on the Bogen's US page but not on Manfrotto's page . Adorama was out of stock, but B&H had it. You can make fabulous high-resolution wide-angle stitched panoramas by using it in combination with the 222 grip (above), which swivels when you partially squeeze it. The 341 has a small design flaw: the tightening knob lacks a retaining clip: it's completely loose\u2014 not attached to the bracket in any way. This makes it easy to lose when the bracket is removed from the camera. The clip from the 3157N quick release plate doesn't fit.\nManfrotto has new line of ball heads, models 484RC2 (weight 0.7 lb; supports 8.8 lbs)\u2014 similar to my old lightweight heads, 486RC2 (weight 1 lb; supports 13.2 lbs)\u2014 adequate for digital SLRs, 35mm, and perhaps medium format, and 488RC2 (weight 1.46 lb; supports 17.6 lbs), shown on the right\u2014 the best of the three for stability.\nAll of the heads mentioned (many of which now have the RC2 suffix) above use the same 3157N quick release plate. At $11 each, I like the price. I keep one on each of my camera bodies and long lenses. Photo.net's tripod page recommends the Arca Swiss B1 ball head. It's undoubtedly elegant, but at over $300 and $40 per quick release plate, it can become an expensive proposition; I see little real advantage. Manfrottos are perfectly fine if they're maintained properly.\nMaintaining ball heads\u2014 Manfrotto ball heads are excellent performers provided you clean and lubricate them about once a year.\u00a0 I take my 3262QR head apart using an Allen wrench, then carefully remove all grease from the ball and the metal parts that come in contact with it. If necessary I add a little waterproof bicycle grease to the tightening mechanism. But not too much\u2014 it tends to migrate to the ball, where it causes slippage.\nMoi! with some of my favorite gear\n"}, {"score": 277.2722, "uuid": "b5573e31-48fb-5208-a5ba-0f80a970f6bc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-26-25122", "target_hostname": "theonlinephotographer.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/collecting/", "page_rank": 4.094633e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "The Online Photographer: Collecting", "snippet": "<em>I</em> would dislike <em>a</em> more romantic approach, although there is still some feeling in the <em>photograph</em>.

Prints can be lost; they get discarded; they can be maliciously destroyed by people who don't like them or don't understand their importance (much of Paul Outerbridge's carefully crafted lifetime body of work was deliberately destroyed by his wife, whose \"morality\" was offended by their content \u2014partial nudes and some sado-masochistic references). They can tear, crease, get stuff spilled on them, or get crumpled. As John Camp so eloquently described in his Featured Comment to Part I, they can simply lose relevance or interest\u2014when nobody remembers, nobody cares.\n...Of course, \"nobody\" is a difficult set to prove. With most things, finding the person or people who care about them\u2014matchmaking between the right owner and the right objects\u2014is often key. Although that takes time and effort too.\nI'll give you an example, albeit a negative one. A decade or more ago, my brother's stepfather, who for many years worked for the Illinois Central Railroad, told me about the fate of 15 file boxes full of railroad pictures, dating back to the 1800s, documenting railway bridges and bridge repairs. The pictures had been stored forever in the company's headquarters, but suddenly they were moving and they no longer had room to store the boxes. Not knowing what to do with them, an executive decision was made: toss them in the dumpster. Now, having worked at a railroad magazine, I know that somewhere, there are railroad buffs or model railroaders who would have been very glad to have accepted those boxes. The problem was that, when the time came, those who were in charge of the move didn't have time to go find those people. (I don't think they tried very hard\u2014there's even an Illinois Central Historical Society! But that's the way it goes.)\nPaul Outerbridge, whose wife, after his death, fearing for his \"reputation,\" destroyed many of his fetish pictures. (Self-portrait.)\nSome of my own prints suffered an ignominious fate. I took a portfolio of prints to show to a girlfriend at her house\u2014and inadvertently left them behind. And there they stayed. But the relationship eventually turned sour, and it would have been awkward to show up asking for the pictures back because it would have meant an opening for a big emotional scene. Long and short of it\u2014I never went back to retrieve my prints, some of which were unique. I still remember which ones they were, and have often kicked myself for losing them in such a dumb and preventable way.\nWhen I talked to Christopher Bailey a couple of weeks ago\u2014he of the Lost Portfolio\u2014he mentioned that he actually did lose a number of his miniature portfolios because he would send them art directors, or used them as leave-behinds, and they were never returned.\nTell the tale\nStories benefit pictures, too. Some pictures contain their own stories: one tintype I have is of a relative who was a drummer boy during the Civil War. His story is contained in the picture\u2014there he stands, all of 12 or 14, dressed in his uniform, holding his drum. (I also have a society portrait of the same guy half a century later, richly dressed, portly and formidable looking, a captain-of-industry type. Name of Sam Collett.)\nYou can tell the stories of your pictures, too, to amplify their meaning and help other people appreciate them. I loved Robert's account from Saturday about turning over a photograph from the 1930s to find the legend \"Taken 3 months ago\" on the back. I can guess the situation: a snapshot mailed to another person at a specific time, probably\u2014a person who would want to know when the picture was taken relative to the \"now\" of whenever he or she opened the letter. Everything else was understood. Whoever wrote those words was definitely not thinking of posterity. That's okay\u2014not all of us want to use photographs for more than our immediate needs\u2014but it certainly illustrates the frustration of someone decades later wondering about the story of the picture.\nPhysical damage can descend in a bewildering myriad of forms. In Chicago, I lived in a marvelous rehabbed loft apartment, with 14-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls, and exposed ductwork. But the remodeler had removed the many decades' worth of flat tar roof by sawing down through the layers with a circular saw and carrying it off in 3-foot squares. Unfortunately, the chips and dust created by the saw from the old roofing worked down into the thick boards underneath\u2014which was the ceiling of my loft. So whenever anybody walked on my roof, little bits of tarry material would sift and fall into my condo. I now have dozens of prints that have little unremoveable black tar spots on them.\n(You can say I should have kept all of my prints continually covered or put away. All I can say is, that's easy for you to say. Imagine being housekeeping-impaired and coming home at the end of a long day to find black tar dust covering everything in your theretofore clean kitchen. It was all I could do to remember to keep the lid on the sugar bowl.)\nSetting things aside helps. Remember the photo of my book from Part I? Just the act of putting a few dozen prints in a book will greatly increase their chances of survival (or would have, had I used archival materials to make the prints). Reason? I've designated them as being important and put them into a handy \"final form.\" Out of thousands of exposures I've selected two dozen, and cropped and sequenced and printed them the way I think they should look. That's enough to at least indicate a sort of value in them. It might not be enough, but it might help.\nIf you leave a mass of photographica at the end of your life, even just having one box labeled \"Valuable Family Photos\" would greatly increase the chances of that one box being reserved from the general migration to the dumpster or Goodwill. Not all of your photographs need to survive\u2014but maybe some of them should, and you're the one who knows best which ones those are. So then, tell people. Designate your important work, your family pictures, and so forth. People will be more likely to respect them if you respected them.\nStart that box\nWe need to acknowledge that there are different purposes for archiving our work. While we're alive and working, what we need is to have our \"libraries\" of all our raw material organized and available for our creative use\u2014and the most organized among us have elaborate systems for organizing and preserving whole archives of shooting. But that can become almost an impediment when we die or retire or move on and our work is no longer needed or used for ongoing creative redaction. Why? Because entire archives are big and unweildy and require a commitment to preserve\u2014a commitment in physical space, in curatorial energy\u2014even in what you might call \"psychic\" energy. (That is, they are demanding enough of maintenance resources to require that somebody have some regard for their importance.) When an archive is too large and requires too much in the way of resources to maintain, the decision to trash the whole lot of it becomes tempting to temporary custodians who aren't invested in the work or particularly interested in it.\n(One of the leitmotifs of my existence is that periodically people come to me asking either what to do with old archives of work, or wondering if, and how, they might profit from them.)\nBy contrast, imagine having to clear out a relative's possessions, including heaps of undifferentiated photographica, and coming across a single, not-too-big box\nlabeled \"MY VERY BEST PHOTOGRAPHS\u2014John Q. Doe, 1937\u2013?\" With each picture in the box signed and labeled with date and time and subject? Who wouldn't set that aside and keep it, even if everything else were headed to the thrift shop?\nTwo boxes of valuable photos are more likely to survive than 20; a file box is more likely to survive than three filing cabinets. And so on. So start that box. Do it now. Why not?\nNumbers and locations\nBut back to physical preservation. I have to acknowledge that there is always an ongoing process of triage being performed here. The fact is, most of us, being clever people, could come up with an infinitely fastidious scheme for ideally insuring the survival of our work. But the fact is, those schemes will require huge amounts of work and attention and effort and time and money, and those are the things we don't have\u2014most of us would rather be out shooting, or at least reading camera reviews and thinking about what lens to buy next.\nSo it's all well and good to point out that making multiple copies of our prints will increase their survivability, and it's obvious that storing them in different locations will help guard against catastrophe. But often it just isn't feasible to translate that knowledge into action.\nStill, it's a bit curious to me that people are so commonly so obsessive about distributing their computer data over several locations, when you seldom hear of people doing so with their prints. The more different places the copies are stored, the better the chance of survival. I've argued in the past that the Folger Shakespeare Library shouldn't keep all of its Shakespeare First Folios. Seventy-nine of them in one place\u2014a third of the copies known to exist\u2014is convenient for scholars, but for survivability, it's a very bad idea. Having the one place be Washington D.C. is an even worse idea\u2014one terrorist bomb, and two-thirds of the world's First Folios could go up in smoke. (Of course that would be the least of the tragedy if such a thing were to happen.) My point is that if they have to all be kept in one place, they'd be better off in the middle of Kansas.\nConsider Jacques Lowe. Not much has been made of this, because, again, there were much larger dimensions to the tragedy. It was a significant loss to posterity nonetheless. Jacques, who died at 71 in 2001, was John F. Kennedy's unofficial White House photographer. (\"Stick around and record my administration,\" Kennedy told him. \"Don't worry, I'll make it worth your time.\") His precious, historically significant negatives were stored in one of the safest places on the planet\u2014the J. P. Morgan Chase bank vault in the basement of the World Trade Center. If anyone had suggest up till September 10th that those 40,000 negatives were in imminent danger of obliteration, the idea would have seemed almost preposterous.\nIt would have been much better, as it turned out, to have split the negatives into five groups and keep them in five different bank vaults, or, better yet, five different bank vaults in five different cities.\nJacques Lowe, unofficial chronicler of Camelot, moved to France and all but gave up photography after Bobby Kennedy was killed. \"I couldn't deal with these tragedies anymore,\" he said. \"I had to get out.\" There was to be one last tragedy for him, just after his death. Photo by Chester Simpson .\nA sterling example of how to use multiple copies and multiple locations to your advantage is provided by our friend Charlie Cramer and his picture Aspen in Fog, Boulder Mountain, Utah that we featured in our print sale that ended just last Friday. In the next two or three weeks Charlie will disseminate several hundred signed prints of that picture to voluntary custodians all over the world\u2014virtually all of whom have pre-qualified themselves as people who value that print, at least to the tune of $175.\nIt's almost certain that some number of those will not survive over time. Some will perhaps be handed over in divorce settlements or thrown to the vagaries of estate sales; some will be discarded when their owners tire of them; some will be lost to basement humidity or mildew or mold, or perhaps fade from months or years of blazing sunlight. Some will find unsympathetic inheritors. The picture itself might be the victim of changing fashions in photography; some prints, I'm sorry to mention, might fall victim to the irruptions of war, or bombing, or accidental fires, or confiscation. A box will be lost in a house move here, a print will be covered with snow when a tree falls through a roof there. A frame will fall with a crash from the wall and shards of glass will slash one print; another might get shuffled from spot to spot or house to house until the box it's in gets lost. And so forth. But I'll bet a number of them will still be around a hundred years from now, and probably some number will last for two hundred years, or even three hundred. No way to know for sure, of course. But the percentages now favor it.\nThe major issues in bullet points\nSo what are the best ways to ensure print survivabilty? Here are the ones I can think of:\n\u2022 Regard. People think I'm joking when I respond to questions about how to make prints last by saying \"be famous.\" But I'm not kidding. Value is a function of regard, of reputation, of accepted merit\u2014and valuable things get preserved. A Steichen print is more likely to be protected and preserved than an E. O. Hopp\u00e9 print, and an E.O.Hopp\u00e9 print is more likely to be preserved than a picture somebody's Uncle Earl took. Of course this aspect of survivability is not usually in our control!\n\u2022 Consider pictorial content. (I.e., what the picture is of.) Show things that people in the future will be interested in; things that change. (Charlie's picture doesn't do well in this respect. Presumably aspen trees will still look the same a hundred years from now. Then again, maybe not.) Portraits of famous people are more likely to be preserved than portraits of anonymous people; distinctive portraits are more likely to be kept than cookie-cutter portraits that look like a thousand other portraits. And so on.\n\u2022 Edit. How is some stranger going to know which of your pictures is worthy of attention from others if you haven't even figured it out yet? If you can't sort through the dross to get to the gold, how can you expect some stranger to take the time and effort needed to do so?\n\u2022 Inform. Things with labels last better because people stumbling across them have a clue what they are; things that go with other things have a greater tendency to be kept (nobody throws away no. 7 of a set of 12 when they're keeping the other 11); and things the significance of which is known can more easily find a home\u2014they can more easily be matched up with that one person or organization that is interested in preserving them.\n\u2022 Designate. Don't be afraid to set aside a little of your work and designate it for preservation, whether for your family or for posterity. Not everything you touch is worthy of deathless immortality. Someone will be grateful to know what you considered to be of significance.\n\u2022 Make it real. People like objects. They like to collect things, own things, handle and show off things. A picture that exists only as a file on your computer or an idea in your mind is unlikely to endure, because it isn't a thing.\n\u2022 Physical protection. Once it's an object, it needs to be protected. Objects are heir to all manner of assault and insult. Preserve against deterioration (light fading, acidity and pollution from within and without, etc.) by all means, but consider protecting the prints against physical harm, too. It's impractical to protect everything against everything, of course, but, again, if you've designated a small amount of edited work for preservation, at least you can take a stab at protecting that work. (A box to put prints in is a good first step.) And a related issue:\n\u2022 Condition. Keep things in good condition. As the appraisers often remind the audience on Antiques Roadshow, \"condition is everything.\" Damaged, scratched, dog-eared, dirty and decrepit prints are much more likely to be destined for annihilation.\n\u2022 Craft. Beautiful, carefully made things contain or encapsulate in and of themselves a recommendation for their own preservation. By crafting something in an exotic or beautiful fashion, or with inordinate skill, or with expensive materials, you're communicating that you value it\u2014in a way that can be interpreted as such by people in the future who know nothing else about it. (Just picture in your mind's eye someone holding an object and looking at it saying, \"I don't need this, but it just seems too nice to throw away.\" You might have done that yourself.) (A word to the wise, however: certain strategies can backfire! An excessively ornate or beautiful box, for example, might get your pictures discarded so the box be used to hold something the future owner values more.)\n\u2022 Play the numbers game. The more copies, the better. It's worth mentioning that this isn't an automatic guarantee, however. There's a story\u2014dim in my memory now\u2014of a guy who collected broadsides and pamphlets during the English Civil War. If it were not for him, all copies would have been lost to history\u2014even though they were reproduced in the hundreds or thousands and distributed everywhere. Of all the people who saw them, only one decided not to treat them as ephemera. So numbers alone don't necessarily guarantee survival.\n\u2022 Dissemination. The more different places the copies are stored, the better the chance of survival. I might point out that a number of the photographs in my grandparents' attic were there because they were duplicates\u2014family members would have a number of copies printed when they had their portraits made, to send to all their relatives. My grandparents and great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents saved them, is all. That's how the attic \"archive\" got so many pictures of aunts and uncles, cousins, more distant relatives, and friends. Even today, when I make family pictures in the summertime, I make copies to send to everyone.\nDon't sweat it\nAnd one final option? Don't worry about it. That's always an option. There's nothing that says your pictures have to last. Some people would like it if they would; some people don't care. Life is a river in which the water changes all the time. Not everything need be preserved. If your thing is to make image files out of mere electrons for transient enjoyment, sharing them with the friends you make them for and then letting them evaporate into the ether, lost forever, well, no worries. Personally, I have at least a sentimental regard for those humans of the future whose attics we are stocking with the work we do now. I imagine them\u2014a few of them, anyway\u2014as being interested in what I take pictures of now. I see myself in them\u2014myself as I was in 1983, discovering the treasures of my grandparents' attic.\nBut that's just me. Where you are concerned, of course, you decide.\nMike\nSend this post to a friend\nPlease help support TOP by patronizing our sponsors B&H Photo and Amazon\nNote: Links in this post may be to our affiliates; sales through affiliate links may benefit this site.

We were discussing the culture of the British Seaside Holiday, and people were encouraged to bring along any photographs they had to illustrate the subject. (Martin Parr wasn't even mentioned!) The participants were multinational. What we got were family photos of not only the British seaside, but also for example, the Chilean equivalent from the 1920s. Amazing historical records. Interestingly most people had brought along prints preserved by previous generations. A couple of people provided digital images of recent times, but it was clear that there seemed to be a divide between the time when family members put things thoughtfully in Mike's shoeboxes, and labeled them. (Almost all of these old prints had something identifying then written on the back). The feeling was that habit of keeping photographs as family documents had ended.\n\"My feeling is that the advent of digital is causing a problem. Even for enthusiast photographers, managing a digital archive is not a trivial task, and it's also one that needs constant maintenance. In addition the commonplace nature of photography these days is turning images into one day wonders that grace a blog page and then disappear. Once the old prints had been put in a box that was it\u2014all it requires is descendants who are suitably attuned to the value of social and family history. Every ordinary family knew how to do this instinctively. Now with potentially valuable documents scattered on mobile phones, Picasa, Facebook pages and heaven knows where, the chance are that those images which would be so useful to future generations will not be preserved. Sure you can print your digital images, but here again quantity and selection prove an obstacle. And why would an ordinary family adopt digital, and then go to the extra expense and bother of printing? Some do, I know, but I wonder how many?\n\"Something else emerged from the tutorial\u2014the difference between staring at an image flashed on a screen for a short period, and passing around handfuls of prints, or spreading them out on a table to look at collectively.\n\"This is not a rant against digital. After all, it means that there will be more, probably better-quality documents available. But I think there is an inherent problem when it comes to preserving them.\"\nFeatured Comment by Alex S: \" NASA had that 'don't sweat it' attitude ....\"\nMike replies: That is incredible.

We permanently spray-glued it to the drywall in a colleague's office\u2014it could be destroyed, but not moved elsewhere without a Sawzall. The company was sold, the building vacated, and the print now hangs in an empty office building, awaiting the next economic cycle.

My view of the world is not entirely self-referential\u2014I think of it as existing apart from me, and I'm comfortable with that view.

Olympus and Pentax have one too.", "explanation": null, "document": "How Shift Lenses Change your Life\nby Frank Sheeran, 1997\n-->\nHow to Take Bad Pictures\nSimple formula for poor pictures: put a building in the shot, then don't aim level. You end up with what is called \"converging lines.\" The left and right side of the building seem to meet somewhere above the picture. If that's what you wanted, fine. If not, get it under control.\nThe Band-Aid\nLevel off. You need to have the lens (and film plane) parallel to the edges that you don't want converging. (You don't actually have to be parallel to a side of the building, just an edge.) For most buildings this means vertical. You probably have zero height compared to a building, so for practical purposes this means aiming at the base of the building. But, when you do this, you are probably cutting off the top. So, you will back up quite a ways to get it to fit in. This makes it small.\nYou'll notice now that the building is only using the top half of the film. My example image shows beautiful green meadow, but you've got parking lots and hot dog stands. At the very least, you will have to crop half the shot away, and enlarge your grain twice as much as needed. Is there a better way?\nFilm Geometry\nBefore looking at the real answer to this stumper, look at the numbers in image 2. \"35mm\" film has images 36mm wide by 24mm tall. The \"centerline\" of each shot is exactly half that: 12mm down for horizontal compositions and 18mm down for vertical compositions.\nShift Lenses\nShift lenses do a few tricks but perhaps the main professional gimmick is letting you control that centerline. Within limits, you can put it where you want it, without changing the angle of your camera (and screwing up the perspective).\nShift lens documentation should tell you how much they shift. Let's look at the Canon TS-E 24mm/3.5L. Like the other TS-E lenses, it shifts up to 11mm. This is the distance the lens elements move up, but that also means the image moves exactly that much on the film. Since film images are upside-down, moving the lens up moves the image down. This means... fewer parking lots and hot dog stands. And you can go back to your original vantage point and get a bigger image.\nHow Close?\nHow far from your target do you need to be to get the desired shot without twisting the perspective? Believe it or not, no trigonometry is needed. It depends on the height of the target above your eye level, the height of the film above the centerline (red, above), and the lens' focal length.\nDistance / TargetHeight = FocalLength / HeightAboveCenterline\nUsing that, solve for anything if you know the other three. In practice, you know the focal length and height-above-centerline numbers exactly, or can dial in the height-above-centerline you need with a shift lens. Distance may be harder to estimate, and height can be tricky. With buildings, you can usually guess 5 meters or 15 feet per story for commercial structures.\nFor now, this can help you picture what shots a given shift lens lets you take. For instance, since the height-above-centerline is 12mm for a normal lens and twice that (well, 23mm) for the TS-E lenses with maximum shift... we can get twice as close to our target. Or, shoot a target twice as tall. Or use twice the focal length (say, the TS-E 45mm instead of a normal EF 24mm).\nLater, on a shoot, this can avoid a certain amount of trial-and-error. For instance, say you have a 24mm lens with 11mm of shift, and a four story building on a city street. You can back up to 65 feet away from your 60 foot target. The formula says 65/60 = 24/X. X is about 22mm. You know that's right at the limit of your shifting and the corners may darken somewhat. On the other hand, you not to even bother getting your 1.4x TC out unless a vertical composition would work (vertically, 65/60 = 36/X, X would be 33.3mm, and a you could get a maximum height-above-centerline of 18mm + 11mm x 1.4, or 33.4mm).\nDrawbacks\nWhen maximum shift is employed, shift lenses (with their unnaturally wide field of view) can show some light falloff in the corners, due to basic optical properties. In addition, even the widest filters may be visible in the corners of the shot. Smaller apertures typically fix the first problem but accentuate the second. Hopefully you have the option of backing away from your target and reducing shift slightly. If not, consider using an auxiliary filter holder instead of screw-on filters.\nThere are not yet any auto-focus shift lenses, even the Canon TS-E lenses with the auto-focus mount. Some shift lenses are a bit more primitive, making you stop down manually before shooting. This will be true for any \"old\" mount with manual aperture control, because it would take Rube Goldberg hardware to translate the mechanical movement at the mount to movement at the aperture, when half the lens moves up and down.\nYou will be paying quite a bit extra, both for the optics that make a larger, shift-able image, and the hardware on the lens that let you move the glass up and down. Even then, the lens will probably have a smaller maximum aperture than you'd expect. For instance, a Canon 24mm/2.8 is about $500 while the shifting 24mm/3.5 is more like $1200 on the street. If its any consolation, the makers are probably losing money on every one they make due to the low volume of production. You'll see all three Canon TS-E lenses for the same price, even with their vastly different optics, because Canon is offering them to complete its lineup, and not attempting to price them to recoup their cost.\nTele-Converters\nA tele-converter (TC) is a lens group that attaches between your objective lens and camera body. They typically magnify the image size by a factor of 1.4x, 1.5x, 2x, or 3x. TC's also (sadly) increase your f-stop by the same factor. Generally any older TC or 2x TC with less than seven elements will be crap.\nOn shift lenses, a TC will also (for practical purposes) increase the amount of your shift. The Canon TS-E lenses go from 11mm shift to 15.4mm (1.4x) or 22mm shift (2x). Looking at image #3, guess where you can now place your ground level. The horizontal format can suddenly lose the bottom third of your building, when the centerline moves to 10mm below the bottom of the frame with a 2x. The vertical format can move the centerline to 4mm below too. (Just as lens specs are not exact, teleconverter specs can be pretty loose. A nominally 2x converter may be 1.8x or 1.9x. Never seem to be better than advertised, even for Leitz and Zeiss.)\nNow, compare the Canon TS-E 45mm/2.8 vs. the TS-E 90mm/2.8. With a 2x TC, the 45mm/2.8 turns into a 90mm/5.6... but with 22mm shift possible instead of 11mm. Which sounds like more fun?\nSince TC's in effect take their picture from the center of the objective lens' image, they avoid problems that tend to arise in the corners of the objective.\nBut Wait! That's not All!\nAny Shot with Lines!\nThe example buildings can be replaced with trees. Show those forest canopies while avoiding the \"acid trip trees\" look. Or any other shot where there are two parallel lines... and if that sounds like \"most shots\" you get the picture. Back before rolls of film were invented, there was a time when all camera lenses shifted, and truing perspective was considered as important as focus and selecting shutter speed and aperture. (Back then, they also used a variety of terms for shift: rise was shift up, etc. Archaic people still do so today 8-)\nWith the first professional-use \"box\" cameras (as opposed to bellows cameras), a generation of photographers - and photograph viewers - grew up not having this advantage.\nAs time went on, all the serious 35mm camera marques issued \"perspective correction\" lenses. Or perhaps I should say, lens, usually with a focal length of 35mm. Zeiss does a 35mm for Contax, Leitz does a 35mm for Leica. Olympus and Pentax have one too. Minolta made a 35mm for the old manual lens mount, but doesn't have one for the auto-focus cameras. Nikon made (and makes) the 28mm and 35mm. Canon had the TS 24mm and 35mm for the manual mount, and the TS-E 24mm, 45mm, and 90mm for the current electronic mount.\nDistortion!\nBesides fixing perspective, you can use the same feature to screw up normal perspective. I took a band's CD cover picture, where the guitars are the size of battleships and the guitarists' heads are the size of gnats. Art is Truth.\nPanoramas!\nLook at the example vertical image #3. Assuming your shift lens shifts left and right (Canon TS-E's do), you can take the left half and right half of a panorama on separate frames, and combine the images in the darkroom or a photo touch-up program. There will be some overlap to help you assemble the halves into the final image. This overlap can be nominal if you use a TC.\nYou can end up with a scene that uses about 70mm width and 24mm height. This will give you strictly higher image quality that you'd get with a 6x6 medium format camera and cropping to get a panoramic slice - merely 55mm x 20mm. If anyone cares, that\u2019s 1.5x larger negative... advantage 35mm.\nThe Canon TS-E lenses will shift in any direction, and have clicks every 30 degrees. You can thus also get a shift somewhat up or down at the same time you shift hard left to get one half, and reproduce the exact shift amount and angle to take the second half.\nUnsightly Blemishes!\nNormally you can change your viewing angle to select the foreground and background that surround your actual subject. You may have artistic conflict, however, if there is a strong rectangular element in the subject that you want to render squarely. Examples are mirrors, railings, and windows.\nIf you face a mirror head on, you will be in the shot. If you move to the side, it turns into a parallelogram. With a shift lens mounted, move the camera to the side, turn the film and lens parallel to the mirror, then use shift to get the original composition back (more or less).\nSometimes you have limited access to a fixed display, especially in tight interiors. There might be a ceiling support exactly where you'd like to stand. Set up to one side and shift horizontally to reframe.\nDepth of Field!\nBesides shifting in any direction, the Canon TS-E lenses also tilt. Actually, this has nothing to do with the above shift stuff, except that the only lenses that tilt are the Canon TS-E's. What does tilt do for you?\nNormally, everything in a plane a set distance from, and perpendicular to your lens will be in focus. When you use lens tilt, you forego the \"perpendicular\" constraint. You can tilt that plane quite severely if desired. The plane of the back element of the lens, the film plane, and the focus plane will all intersect.\nThe classic example is for landscapes. You have wildflowers at your feet and Alps at infinity. f/22 won't give you the depth of field you need (well, it would at 24mm but at the sacrifice of sharpness). As its just after sunset there's not much light, and there is also a wind moving the flowers so a long exposure won't work. Fast shutter dictates big aperture, which means lousy depth-of-field... normally.\nAs you tilt the lens, you make the focus plane tilt. However, a small tilt of the lens creates a huge tilt in the focus plane. Just 10 degrees of lens tilt can rotate the focus plane to the point that wild flowers a meter away, at the bottom of the frame, are perfectly focused as are distant alps.\nThere are very mathematical explanations to calculate all the exact effect, but I don't know how you could use them accurately in the field. It would be nice if there was a focusing screen with a half-prism focusing aid at both the top and bottom of the frame. But there's not. The camera could also calculate this information for you and display it.\nThe other tilt trick is just the opposite. Say you want everything out of focus except for the subject. Say there is a row of columns ahead of you, running left to right. Tilt like mad, focus one column, and the equally distant neighbors to the left and right will be fuzzy.\nWhy You Can't Get a Good Exposure\nWide angle lenses get darker the further from center you get. This is called \"cos^4 vignetting\" and is due to the light hitting the film at an angle. This is a problem when the lens->film distance is small compared to the image width.\nOn SLR's, wide angle cameras use a \"reverse telephoto\" group at the back, so the rear of the lens is far enough away to leave room for the mirror. This extra glass hurts quality, but means that even a EF14mm/2.8L is about 40mm from the film, which is 36mm wide... which means \"cos^4\" is NOT visible on SLR wide-angles. Rangefinders like Leica M and Contax G and Mamiya 7 have no telephoto group, so their images are sharper - but the back of the lens is VERY close to the film, and the corners are much darker.\nSo what does this have to do with your shift lens? Everything! Shift lenses make a picture much wider than a normal lens, but the distance from lens to film is still about 40mm. Your lens shifts 11mm, so the image is 36mm (film) + 11mm * 2 = 58mm or so. Unshifted, only the center 24mmx36mm of the image hits the film, and has no more cos^4 vignetting than a normal 35mm. However, as you shift, the darker part of the total image hits the film.\nIf you externally meter, then a meter reading good for a centered shot will be too short an exposure for a shifted shot. How much too short? Who knows, bracket! 8-) On the other hand, the camera meter depends on taking readings of light off of partial reflections, and depend on the angle the light hits the sensors. When you shift, the light comes from a different direction and the sensors may see none of it (or too much), so they will suggest a bad exposure.\nHow to Get a Good Exposure\nIf you don't want to bracket, you need to build up some base-line cos^4 data for your lens. Perhaps the following might be agreeable:\nBuild comparison series: on slide film, photograph a grey card metered with 0 shift and no exposure compensation, then -1/3, -2/3, -1, -1 1/3 stop. (either internal meter or external is fine)\nFind worst-case dropoff: shift maximum (horizontally if you can shift sideways), and use the same shutter and aperture as the first shot of your comparison series.\nDevelop these shots.\nUsing the center of the series shots, determine whether the maximum shift is -2/3 darker or whatever. That maximum shift is 36mm(width)/2+11mm(shift)= 29mm from image center. If you want, measure the falloff at other distances.\nThen: after metering a scene with a handheld meter or unshifted lens, set the exposure manually but with the test-result compensation. This should be perfectly accurate with one caveat: Because the darkening is progressive, the maximally-shifted side will always be somewhat darker. For arrchitecture, this is perfect - it saves you from using an actual graduated filter to bring the sky and ground brightness closer.\nSince you may not be able to see this difference in the viewfinder, your probably still want to bracket, but bracket from the external/unshifted exposure to your test-result maximum compensation. Some picture in that range should be ok.\nWish List\nThe only return I get on writing an article like this is the right to voice my own opinions - and hopefully Canon's listening!\nNew Lens\nMore than anything in the world, I want a 35mm tilt-shift lens. The gap between the 24mm and 45mm is just too great. And, the 24mm is not sharp enough to have its images cropped 50% without pain. This lens physically works with the Extender EF 1.4x teleconverter (TC), but resolution seems to suffer somewhat. In effect, the TC creates a very expensive, 35mm f/4.9 lens with less than ideal sharpness. Instead, a one-piece TS-E 35mm F/2.8 or 3.5 lens should have much better optical quality (no TC), as well as being cheaper (no TC), lighter (no TC), and brighter (no TC).\nIt would be nice if the TS-E lenses became TS-EF - autofocus. I firmly believe that everyone's 24mm (and 35mm...) lens should have tilt and shift, for when they are needed, but autofocus when they aren't. Canon, with their great all-electronic mount, could easily allow this.\nNew Focusing Screens\nWe need a new focusing screen for shifted composition. Canon makes a screen with a grid, for verifying perspective. This is great, except the TS-E lenses are all manual focus, and the grid screen doesn't have a focus aid. There is a perfectly good screen with the usual split-circle, but no grid lines of any sort. So, we are left estimating ranges and looking at the distance scale on the focus ring.\nFor tilted composition, the situation is even worse - the distance scale only tells us what is happening at the image center. The scale might say 3 meters when the lens is actually focused at infinity on one edge and 50cm at the other. Calculating lens tilt mathematically is practically a black art. I only know a couple people that even know how, and they don't do it in their head on the scene. They guess a tilt, then squint at the viewfinder trying to guess if it is sharp enough. This is hard at f/3.5 (the Canon 24mm lens) or f/4.9 (same with 1.4x TC). I'd like a focusing screen with the normal split-circle focus aid, but instead of merely the image center, have a circle (or major portion thereof) at each corner or perhaps centered on each of four sides.\nMore Advanced Camera Electronics\nAn second alternative would be a camera that tells us what focus we're at, at the extreme edges of the camera. This would involve the camera asking the lens 1) focus distance, 2) tilt, 3) rotation of tilt, and 4) a constant or two related to focal length. The camera then calculates the focus distance extremes and displays them on the LCD. A photographer who could estimate ranges accurately could adjust the lens until the readout matches his estimates.\nA third alternative would have two focusing rings for near and far focus. It would use Canon \"E-M\". (This means that the focusing ring is just an electronic input sensed by the computer, that drives a motor to change focus.) We would get a focus motor, and a second motor that tilts the lens appropriately. The focus rings would be right next to each other, so normal operation would involve grabbing both simultaneously.\nIf this two-ring lens had autofocus (in untilted mode), Canon wouldn't mark distances on the focus rings, making the split focus screen mandatory. If the lens was manual focus only, the rings would have full markings, and ranges would be estimated by the photographer. I don't even postulate a camera with AF sensors at the frame's extreme corners, that attempted to tilt, rotate, and focus, simultaneously 8-)\nAdding electric control of the current tilt probably would be awful. Hopefully, just as many lenses are now internal or rear focus, the tilt effect could be accomplished simply by tilting one internal group.\nConclusion\nI hope at this point, you are sadder but wiser. Ideally, you should be discontent with every non-shift (and non-tilt) lens you have.

You end up with what is called \"converging lines.\" The left and right side of the building seem to meet somewhere above the picture. If that's what you wanted, fine. If not, get it under control.\nThe Band-Aid\nLevel off. You need to have the lens (and film plane) parallel to the edges that you don't want converging. (You don't actually have to be parallel to a side of the building, just an edge.) For most buildings this means vertical. You probably have zero height compared to a building, so for practical purposes this means aiming at the base of the building. But, when you do this, you are probably cutting off the top. So, you will back up quite a ways to get it to fit in. This makes it small.\nYou'll notice now that the building is only using the top half of the film. My example image shows beautiful green meadow, but you've got parking lots and hot dog stands. At the very least, you will have to crop half the shot away, and enlarge your grain twice as much as needed. Is there a better way?\nFilm Geometry\nBefore looking at the real answer to this stumper, look at the numbers in image 2. \"35mm\" film has images 36mm wide by 24mm tall. The \"centerline\" of each shot is exactly half that: 12mm down for horizontal compositions and 18mm down for vertical compositions.\nShift Lenses\nShift lenses do a few tricks but perhaps the main professional gimmick is letting you control that centerline. Within limits, you can put it where you want it, without changing the angle of your camera (and screwing up the perspective).\nShift lens documentation should tell you how much they shift. Let's look at the Canon TS-E 24mm/3.5L. Like the other TS-E lenses, it shifts up to 11mm. This is the distance the lens elements move up, but that also means the image moves exactly that much on the film. Since film images are upside-down, moving the lens up moves the image down. This means... fewer parking lots and hot dog stands. And you can go back to your original vantage point and get a bigger image.\nHow Close?\nHow far from your target do you need to be to get the desired shot without twisting the perspective? Believe it or not, no trigonometry is needed. It depends on the height of the target above your eye level, the height of the film above the centerline (red, above), and the lens' focal length.\nDistance / TargetHeight = FocalLength / HeightAboveCenterline\nUsing that, solve for anything if you know the other three. In practice, you know the focal length and height-above-centerline numbers exactly, or can dial in the height-above-centerline you need with a shift lens. Distance may be harder to estimate, and height can be tricky. With buildings, you can usually guess 5 meters or 15 feet per story for commercial structures.\nFor now, this can help you picture what shots a given shift lens lets you take. For instance, since the height-above-centerline is 12mm for a normal lens and twice that (well, 23mm) for the TS-E lenses with maximum shift... we can get twice as close to our target. Or, shoot a target twice as tall. Or use twice the focal length (say, the TS-E 45mm instead of a normal EF 24mm).\nLater, on a shoot, this can avoid a certain amount of trial-and-error. For instance, say you have a 24mm lens with 11mm of shift, and a four story building on a city street. You can back up to 65 feet away from your 60 foot target. The formula says 65/60 = 24/X. X is about 22mm. You know that's right at the limit of your shifting and the corners may darken somewhat. On the other hand, you not to even bother getting your 1.4x TC out unless a vertical composition would work (vertically, 65/60 = 36/X, X would be 33.3mm, and a you could get a maximum height-above-centerline of 18mm + 11mm x 1.4, or 33.4mm).\nDrawbacks\nWhen maximum shift is employed, shift lenses (with their unnaturally wide field of view) can show some light falloff in the corners, due to basic optical properties. In addition, even the widest filters may be visible in the corners of the shot. Smaller apertures typically fix the first problem but accentuate the second. Hopefully you have the option of backing away from your target and reducing shift slightly. If not, consider using an auxiliary filter holder instead of screw-on filters.\nThere are not yet any auto-focus shift lenses, even the Canon TS-E lenses with the auto-focus mount. Some shift lenses are a bit more primitive, making you stop down manually before shooting. This will be true for any \"old\" mount with manual aperture control, because it would take Rube Goldberg hardware to translate the mechanical movement at the mount to movement at the aperture, when half the lens moves up and down.\nYou will be paying quite a bit extra, both for the optics that make a larger, shift-able image, and the hardware on the lens that let you move the glass up and down. Even then, the lens will probably have a smaller maximum aperture than you'd expect. For instance, a Canon 24mm/2.8 is about $500 while the shifting 24mm/3.5 is more like $1200 on the street. If its any consolation, the makers are probably losing money on every one they make due to the low volume of production. You'll see all three Canon TS-E lenses for the same price, even with their vastly different optics, because Canon is offering them to complete its lineup, and not attempting to price them to recoup their cost.\nTele-Converters\nA tele-converter (TC) is a lens group that attaches between your objective lens and camera body. They typically magnify the image size by a factor of 1.4x, 1.5x, 2x, or 3x. TC's also (sadly) increase your f-stop by the same factor. Generally any older TC or 2x TC with less than seven elements will be crap.\nOn shift lenses, a TC will also (for practical purposes) increase the amount of your shift. The Canon TS-E lenses go from 11mm shift to 15.4mm (1.4x) or 22mm shift (2x). Looking at image #3, guess where you can now place your ground level. The horizontal format can suddenly lose the bottom third of your building, when the centerline moves to 10mm below the bottom of the frame with a 2x. The vertical format can move the centerline to 4mm below too. (Just as lens specs are not exact, teleconverter specs can be pretty loose. A nominally 2x converter may be 1.8x or 1.9x. Never seem to be better than advertised, even for Leitz and Zeiss.)\nNow, compare the Canon TS-E 45mm/2.8 vs. the TS-E 90mm/2.8. With a 2x TC, the 45mm/2.8 turns into a 90mm/5.6... but with 22mm shift possible instead of 11mm. Which sounds like more fun?\nSince TC's in effect take their picture from the center of the objective lens' image, they avoid problems that tend to arise in the corners of the objective.\nBut Wait! That's not All!\nAny Shot with Lines!\nThe example buildings can be replaced with trees. Show those forest canopies while avoiding the \"acid trip trees\" look. Or any other shot where there are two parallel lines... and if that sounds like \"most shots\" you get the picture. Back before rolls of film were invented, there was a time when all camera lenses shifted, and truing perspective was considered as important as focus and selecting shutter speed and aperture. (Back then, they also used a variety of terms for shift: rise was shift up, etc. Archaic people still do so today 8-)\nWith the first professional-use \"box\" cameras (as opposed to bellows cameras), a generation of photographers - and photograph viewers - grew up not having this advantage.\nAs time went on, all the serious 35mm camera marques issued \"perspective correction\" lenses. Or perhaps I should say, lens, usually with a focal length of 35mm. Zeiss does a 35mm for Contax, Leitz does a 35mm for Leica. Olympus and Pentax have one too. Minolta made a 35mm for the old manual lens mount, but doesn't have one for the auto-focus cameras. Nikon made (and makes) the 28mm and 35mm. Canon had the TS 24mm and 35mm for the manual mount, and the TS-E 24mm, 45mm, and 90mm for the current electronic mount.\nDistortion!\nBesides fixing perspective, you can use the same feature to screw up normal perspective. I took a band's CD cover picture, where the guitars are the size of battleships and the guitarists' heads are the size of gnats. Art is Truth.\nPanoramas!\nLook at the example vertical image #3. Assuming your shift lens shifts left and right (Canon TS-E's do), you can take the left half and right half of a panorama on separate frames, and combine the images in the darkroom or a photo touch-up program. There will be some overlap to help you assemble the halves into the final image. This overlap can be nominal if you use a TC.\nYou can end up with a scene that uses about 70mm width and 24mm height. This will give you strictly higher image quality that you'd get with a 6x6 medium format camera and cropping to get a panoramic slice - merely 55mm x 20mm. If anyone cares, that\u2019s 1.5x larger negative... advantage 35mm.\nThe Canon TS-E lenses will shift in any direction, and have clicks every 30 degrees. You can thus also get a shift somewhat up or down at the same time you shift hard left to get one half, and reproduce the exact shift amount and angle to take the second half.\nUnsightly Blemishes!\nNormally you can change your viewing angle to select the foreground and background that surround your actual subject. You may have artistic conflict, however, if there is a strong rectangular element in the subject that you want to render squarely. Examples are mirrors, railings, and windows.\nIf you face a mirror head on, you will be in the shot. If you move to the side, it turns into a parallelogram. With a shift lens mounted, move the camera to the side, turn the film and lens parallel to the mirror, then use shift to get the original composition back (more or less).\nSometimes you have limited access to a fixed display, especially in tight interiors. There might be a ceiling support exactly where you'd like to stand. Set up to one side and shift horizontally to reframe.\nDepth of Field!\nBesides shifting in any direction, the Canon TS-E lenses also tilt. Actually, this has nothing to do with the above shift stuff, except that the only lenses that tilt are the Canon TS-E's. What does tilt do for you?\nNormally, everything in a plane a set distance from, and perpendicular to your lens will be in focus. When you use lens tilt, you forego the \"perpendicular\" constraint. You can tilt that plane quite severely if desired. The plane of the back element of the lens, the film plane, and the focus plane will all intersect.\nThe classic example is for landscapes. You have wildflowers at your feet and Alps at infinity. f/22 won't give you the depth of field you need (well, it would at 24mm but at the sacrifice of sharpness). As its just after sunset there's not much light, and there is also a wind moving the flowers so a long exposure won't work. Fast shutter dictates big aperture, which means lousy depth-of-field... normally.\nAs you tilt the lens, you make the focus plane tilt. However, a small tilt of the lens creates a huge tilt in the focus plane. Just 10 degrees of lens tilt can rotate the focus plane to the point that wild flowers a meter away, at the bottom of the frame, are perfectly focused as are distant alps.\nThere are very mathematical explanations to calculate all the exact effect, but I don't know how you could use them accurately in the field. It would be nice if there was a focusing screen with a half-prism focusing aid at both the top and bottom of the frame. But there's not. The camera could also calculate this information for you and display it.\nThe other tilt trick is just the opposite. Say you want everything out of focus except for the subject. Say there is a row of columns ahead of you, running left to right. Tilt like mad, focus one column, and the equally distant neighbors to the left and right will be fuzzy.\nWhy You Can't Get a Good Exposure\nWide angle lenses get darker the further from center you get. This is called \"cos^4 vignetting\" and is due to the light hitting the film at an angle. This is a problem when the lens->film distance is small compared to the image width.\nOn SLR's, wide angle cameras use a \"reverse telephoto\" group at the back, so the rear of the lens is far enough away to leave room for the mirror. This extra glass hurts quality, but means that even a EF14mm/2.8L is about 40mm from the film, which is 36mm wide... which means \"cos^4\" is NOT visible on SLR wide-angles. Rangefinders like Leica M and Contax G and Mamiya 7 have no telephoto group, so their images are sharper - but the back of the lens is VERY close to the film, and the corners are much darker.\nSo what does this have to do with your shift lens? Everything! Shift lenses make a picture much wider than a normal lens, but the distance from lens to film is still about 40mm. Your lens shifts 11mm, so the image is 36mm (film) + 11mm * 2 = 58mm or so. Unshifted, only the center 24mmx36mm of the image hits the film, and has no more cos^4 vignetting than a normal 35mm. However, as you shift, the darker part of the total image hits the film.\nIf you externally meter, then a meter reading good for a centered shot will be too short an exposure for a shifted shot. How much too short? Who knows, bracket! 8-) On the other hand, the camera meter depends on taking readings of light off of partial reflections, and depend on the angle the light hits the sensors. When you shift, the light comes from a different direction and the sensors may see none of it (or too much), so they will suggest a bad exposure.\nHow to Get a Good Exposure\nIf you don't want to bracket, you need to build up some base-line cos^4 data for your lens. Perhaps the following might be agreeable:\nBuild comparison series: on slide film, photograph a grey card metered with 0 shift and no exposure compensation, then -1/3, -2/3, -1, -1 1/3 stop. (either internal meter or external is fine)\nFind worst-case dropoff: shift maximum (horizontally if you can shift sideways), and use the same shutter and aperture as the first shot of your comparison series.\nDevelop these shots.\nUsing the center of the series shots, determine whether the maximum shift is -2/3 darker or whatever. That maximum shift is 36mm(width)/2+11mm(shift)= 29mm from image center. If you want, measure the falloff at other distances.\nThen: after metering a scene with a handheld meter or unshifted lens, set the exposure manually but with the test-result compensation. This should be perfectly accurate with one caveat: Because the darkening is progressive, the maximally-shifted side will always be somewhat darker. For arrchitecture, this is perfect - it saves you from using an actual graduated filter to bring the sky and ground brightness closer.\nSince you may not be able to see this difference in the viewfinder, your probably still want to bracket, but bracket from the external/unshifted exposure to your test-result maximum compensation. Some picture in that range should be ok.\nWish List\nThe only return I get on writing an article like this is the right to voice my own opinions - and hopefully Canon's listening!\nNew Lens\nMore than anything in the world, I want a 35mm tilt-shift lens. The gap between the 24mm and 45mm is just too great. And, the 24mm is not sharp enough to have its images cropped 50% without pain. This lens physically works with the Extender EF 1.4x teleconverter (TC), but resolution seems to suffer somewhat. In effect, the TC creates a very expensive, 35mm f/4.9 lens with less than ideal sharpness. Instead, a one-piece TS-E 35mm F/2.8 or 3.5 lens should have much better optical quality (no TC), as well as being cheaper (no TC), lighter (no TC), and brighter (no TC).\nIt would be nice if the TS-E lenses became TS-EF - autofocus. I firmly believe that everyone's 24mm (and 35mm...) lens should have tilt and shift, for when they are needed, but autofocus when they aren't. Canon, with their great all-electronic mount, could easily allow this.\nNew Focusing Screens\nWe need a new focusing screen for shifted composition. Canon makes a screen with a grid, for verifying perspective. This is great, except the TS-E lenses are all manual focus, and the grid screen doesn't have a focus aid. There is a perfectly good screen with the usual split-circle, but no grid lines of any sort. So, we are left estimating ranges and looking at the distance scale on the focus ring.\nFor tilted composition, the situation is even worse - the distance scale only tells us what is happening at the image center. The scale might say 3 meters when the lens is actually focused at infinity on one edge and 50cm at the other. Calculating lens tilt mathematically is practically a black art. I only know a couple people that even know how, and they don't do it in their head on the scene. They guess a tilt, then squint at the viewfinder trying to guess if it is sharp enough.

It builds on the Digital Rebel XTi but adds a new sensor (12MP vs. 10MP), a larger LCD screen (3\" vs. 2.5\"), Live View, Spot Metering, ISO display in the viewfinder, Highlight Tone priority, High ISO noise reduction and a number of other software features, which are also found on the Canon EOS 40D.\nExternally, the Rebel XSi and XTi are very similar in size and shape and share a similar control layout. Due to the larger LCD screen of the XSi, a number of the control buttons have been relocated, but the same functionality is retained. To allow the center button of the rear 4-way controller to now activate the Live View mode, a separate ISO button has been added next to the main control dial.\nHannah Thiem\nFor the first time on any EOS DSLR, the Digital Rebel XSi uses only an SD(HC) memory card for image storage. All previous Digital Rebels, as well as the EOS 5D/10D/20D/30D/40D have used Compact Flash memory cards. The 1D series DSLRs have had the capability of using both SD and CF cards. The change isn't really a big deal since SD cards (and higher capacity SDHC cards) are now as easily available as CF cards, cost around the same in $/GB, and can be found in capacities of up to 16 and 32GB.\nBoth the XTi and XSi use a pentamirror viewfinder system, but the viewfinder screen of the XSi is slightly larger and also, to my eye, appears to be slightly brighter. The difference in size isn't huge, but every little bit helps. The viewfinder screen of the XSi has a center circle which makes the area of the spot meter. Both cameras use the same diamond shape of 9 focus zones.\nWhere to Buy\nPhoto.net's partners have the Canon Digital Rebel XSi available in the following combinations. Their prices are fair and you help to support photo.net.\nIf you are new to digital photography, start with the photo.net article on \"Building a Digital SLR System.\"\nContents\nBob Atkins\nOperating Speed\nThe Digital Rebel XSi is very responsive in terms of operational speed. The LCD display appears less than a second after the camera is powered up, but you can take a photo only 250ms (1/4s) after the power switch is moved to \"on\" before the LCD screen starts displaying data.\nIn continuous capture mode, the Rebel XSi is capable of 3.5 frames per sec (fps) for about 55 frames before the buffer fills and the rate drops a little. The buffer is significantly smaller when capturing RAW, and in that case the 3.5 fps drops to around 0.7 fps after only 6 frames. In RAW+JPEG mode, the buffer only holds 4 captures.\nThese numbers make the XSi faster than the XTi (3 fps) with a larger JPEG buffer (55 frames vs. 30 frames). However, the RAW file buffer is somewhat smaller (6 frames vs. 10 frames), presumably at least in part due to the larger file size dictated by the higher pixel count. The EOS 40D is good for 6.5 fps for around 125 JPEGs or around 18 RAW images.\nControls\nThe Rebel XSi uses a control layout, which should be fairly familiar to most users. The 3\" rear LCD screen is used to display operating parameters and the various software menus, as well as to review images. As with previous Digital Rebels, there is no top mounted LCD screen. Menu navigation is done via the 4-way buttons (allowing navigation up, down, left and right through the menus). The center \"set\" button is also used to enable Live View modes. In Live View, focusing is enabled by pressing the \"*\" button. When not being used for navigation, the 4-way buttons are used to select capturing mode, metering mode, AF mode, and picture style.\nThe menu structure is similar to that of the Digital Rebel XTi and the EOS 40D. Like the 40D there's a customizable menu screen on which you can place the functions you use most so that you can access them rapidly. I put Image Quality Selection, Memory Card Format, High ISO Noise Reduction, Highlight Tone Priority, Mirror Lockup, and Custom WB there.\nFor a complete and detailed description of all the camera controls and options, you can download a PDF copy of the Rebel XSi user manual .\nAuto Focus\nThe EOS Rebel XSi has a 9-point wide area AF sensor with the points set in a diamond pattern. The focus point can be manually selected, or the camera can decide which AF point(s) to use. There are 4 focus modes: One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF, AI Servo AF, and Manual. The central AF point is an improved cross type sensor with high precision for lenses with an aperture of f/2.8 or faster.\nIn Live view there are two focus modes. One is the same as that used on the EOS 40D, where the reflex mirror flips down briefly and the normal AF sensors are used to achieve focus. This is termed \"quick mode.\" The second focus mode (only available on the XSi) is \"live mode\" and uses a contrast-based AF system. The live image is used and focus is determined by looking for maximum contrast. It has the advantage that the LiveView is not interrupted, but it's significantly slower (focus may take a few seconds) and it may not be quite as accurate in all situations as quick mode.\nOverall, I found that most of the time the AF performance of the XSi and XTi were quite similar. However, there were some situations in very low light where the XSi could get an autofocus lock, while with the same lens under the same lighting, the XTi failed. This is consistent with a statement found in the press release for the XSi in which Canon states, \"The EOS Rebel XSi Digital SLR utilizes a precise nine-point Autofocus (AF) system featuring a newly developed AF sensor that improves the camera's subject detection capabilities compared to earlier models.\"\nMetering and Exposure\nHannah Thiem\nThe XSi adds Spot metering to the Evaluative, Partial and Centerweighted patterns of the XTi. The spot metering area is marked by a circle on the viewfinder screen.\nDigital Rebel XSi metering:\nEvaluative metering (linkable to any AF point)\nPartial metering (approx. 9% of viewfinder at center)\nSpot metering (approx. 4% of viewfinder at center)\nCenter-weighted average metering\nRange EV 1-20 (at 73\u00b0F/23\u00b0C with EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens, ISO 100)\nThe Rebel XSi has the same Highlight Tone Priority feature as the EOS 40D. This appears to be a hardware function, which adjusts the tone curve in order to prevent blowing out highlights in a scene that would normally exceed the dynamic range of the sensor. Exactly how Canon does this, they don't say, but it is more than just a software function. It affects both RAW and JPEG files. It's not a miracle cure for blown highlights, but it does give you about an extra stop of latitude at the expense of potentially more shadow noise. With Highlight Tone Priority enabled, the ISO range is restricted to 200-1600.\nThe XSi uses a 14-bit A/D converter, which could in theory give better tonal gradation, though in practice it's very difficult to see the difference from 12-bit images (such as those from the XTi).\nWhite Balance\nHannah Thiem\nThe XSi has the usual set of white balance modes: Auto, Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Tungsten, White Fluorescent Light, Flash and Custom. It doesn't allow color temperature to be set as the EOS 40D does. In typical Canon fashion, Auto white balance doesn't do great under tungsten lighting, giving a distinctly yellow image. In tungsten mode the color balance under domestic tungsten lighting is closer to neutral, but still noticeably warm. If you want the most neutral color rendition under tungsten lighting, the custom WB mode is best. In this mode you first shoot an image of a white or gray card under the lighting conditions you will be using. The camera can them use this as a reference for subsequent shots.\nLCD Monitor\nThe XSi has a 3\" (diagonal) LCD screen vs. the 2.5\" screen of the XTi. Both have 230,000 pixels, 100% image coverage and LCD brightness control with 7 levels. The XSi adds the option of 4 different color schemes for data display - black on white, white on black, light blue on dark blue and dark brown on light brown.\nViewfinder\nThe viewfinder of the Digital Rebel XSi is slightly larger than that of the XTi, but slightly smaller than that of the EOS 40D. The differences are not huge and you might not even notice them unless you compared the cameras side by side. The XSi viewfinder also seems slightly brighter than that of the XTi, but again the difference is small. Both the Xsi and XTi use a pentamirror system rather than the more expensive and heavier (but slightly brighter) pentaprism system.\nLike the EOS 40D, the Rebel XSi displays the ISO setting in the viewfinder at all times, along with the usual information such as shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation, flash status, AF status, buffer frames remaining (when that number is 9 or less), flash exposure compensation setting, high speed sync setting and exposure lock indication.\nThe XTi and XSi share the same 9 AF zone markings, but the XSi viewfinder adds a center circle marking, which defines the area covered by the new spotmeter in the XSi.\nXSi Viewfinder Specifications\nMagnification - Approx. 0.87x (-1m with 50mm lens at infinity)\nEyepoint - Approx. 19mm (from eyepiece lens center)\nDioptric Adjustment Correction -3.0 to +1.0 diopter\nDigital Sensor\nThe Digital Rebel XSi uses a new sensor with 12.2 MP and a maximum image size of 4272 x 2848 pixels. This is up by about 20% from the 10.1 MP sensors used in the Digital Rebel XTi and EOS 40D (3888 x 2592 pixels) and should theoretically enable about 10% greater linear resolution.\nIn practice, there's not a very noticeable difference in image resolution as you can see from the sample images below. These are 100% crops from JPEGs taken using the standard default parameters for sharpness with each camera.\nThe Rebel XSi may have a slight resolution edge, but remember these crops represent looking at sections of a very large image, probably something around 24\" x 36\" on a typical monitor screen. Despite the fact that both the EOS 40D and Digital Rebel XTi have the same pixel count, the EOS 40D image looks a little sharper. In all three cases, resolution may be increased slightly when capturing in RAW mode and making the optimal conversion to JPEGs.\nThe Digital Rebel XSi has \"anti-dust\" features built into the sensor, which includes an anti-static coating and an ultrasonic shaker to dislodge dust particles. There's also a software mapping function, which can be used to minimize the visibility of dust particles if for some reason you can't clean the sensor or you want to be absolutely sure of minimizing the effects of dust.\nISO Settings and Image Noise\nHannah Thiem\nBoth the Rebel XSi and XTi have an ISO range of 100 to 1600 in full stop steps (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600). The EOS 40D has a range of from 100 to 3200, with the 100-1600 range covered in 1/3 stop steps (100, 120, 160, 200 etc.). An Auto ISO mode is available on the XSi and EOS 40D, but it's limited in its range. In most exposure modes the range is 100-800, but in manual exposure mode ISO is set to 400 in auto mode. In the basic zone modes (everything except P, Av, Tv, M and A-Dep), ISO is always set to auto mode and cannot be manually selected.\nIn the set of test images below the three cameras are compared. Again all three cameras were set to their default settings and no additional noise reduction functions were enabled. These are 100% crops, meaning one pixel on the screen maps directly to one pixel in the image. Up to ISO 400 all three cameras give very clean images with little or no evidence of noise. At ISO 800 noise starts to appear, but is still well controlled. At ISO 1600 noise is much more visible, with the EOS 40D showing the least noise, followed by the 12MP Rebel XSi and with the 10MP Rebel XTi showing slightly more noise.\nSince a higher pixel count in the same sized sensor usually means smaller pixels, and since smaller pixels usually show higher noise levels at high ISO settings, these observations are consistent with what you would expect. However, noise is still pretty well controlled, even at ISO 1600 on the XSi and it's low enough that small to medium sized prints made from the images would be quite acceptable.\nA feature of the EOS 40D, which has found its way onto the XSi is a high ISO noise reduction mode. This appears to increase the amount of chroma noise reduction while not greatly affecting the luminance noise. The main downside of enabling high ISO noise reduction is that the camera can buffer fewer images when capturing in continuous mode. Presumably this is due to the increased processing power required for the noise reduction mode leading to slower compression and storage of images, so the buffer fills faster.\nLive View\nHannah Thiem\nFor the first time in a Digital Rebel series DSLR, Canon has added Live View to the XSi. Live view gives you a real time image on the LCD screen, just like a P&S digicam. To do this the reflex mirror is locked up, and in that position the camera can't use its normal AF sensors.\nThe XSi has two different methods of autofocusing while using the LiveView mode. The first is the same as that used on the EOS 40D. Pressing the \"*\" button on the back of the camera drops the mirror down and enables normal AF operation - though the image on the LCD blanks out during this process. When the \"*\" button is released, the mirror flips back up and the LCD displays the image in real time again. Although this sounds complex, it happens quite fast and Canon call this the \"Quick\" AF mode.\nThe XSi also offers another focus mode (not found on any other Canon DSLR at the moment), which they call the \"Live\" mode. In this mode the image is continuously displayed on the LCD and the camera uses that image to find focus via a contrast sensing algorithm. The drawback of this mode is that it can be slow (focus may take several seconds) and it may not be as sensitive or accurate as the normal \"Quick\" AF mode using the dedicated phase detection AF sensors.\nIt's also possible to use manual focus of course, and the LCD image can be magnified by 5x or 10x to assist in optimizing focus.\nIn-Camera Editing\nThough you can't actually edit the images in the camera once you have taken them, you can apply effects to existing images when printing directly from the camera. These include a \"Vivid\" mode which increases saturation for more vivid greens and blues, a noise reduction mode to lower image noise and three black and white modes (neutral, warm and cool).\nBob Atkins\nThe Digital Rebel XSi does have an extensive set of options, which you can select before an image is taken and affect the resulting JPEG image. There are preset picture styles (Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral, Faithful and Monochrome) - all of which can be edited and modified for sharpness, saturation, contrast and color, as well as monochrome color filtering simulation (yellow, orange, red and green). You can also create 3 custom picture styles based on modified existing styles and you can create entirely new styles with the provided Picture Styles Editor software.\nIf you choose to capture in RAW mode, the provided DPP (Digital Photo Pro) software allows you to apply any picture style to any image during the RAW conversion process.\nFlash\nThe XSi has a retractable pop-up flash with a Guide number of 13/43 (ISO 100 meters/ft). At ISO 400 with an f/4 lens, the flash range is around 6.5m (21.5ft). The flash covers the frame seen by a 17mm (or longer) lens mounted on the XSi. Recycle time is approximately 3 seconds.\nThe XSi has a standard Canon hotshoe and is compatible with all of Canon's EX series speedlites (the current models are the Canon Speedlite 220EX Flash , ( compare prices ) ( review ), Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash , ( compare prices ) ( review ) and Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash , ( compare prices ) ( review )). There's no PC connector for external studio flash, though of course hotshoe to PC adapters are available. Max sync voltage is 250v and the max sync speed is 1/200s.\nMemory Cards\nHannah Thiem\nThe Digital Rebel XSi uses SD/SDHC memory cards. This is in contrast to all previous Digital Rebels and the EOS 5D/20D/30D/40D models, which use Compact Flash (CF) cards. These days, there's little difference between SD and CF cards in terms of price, capacity and availability. The fastest CF cards are still faster than the fastest SD cards, but in a Digital Rebel or even an EOS 40D, the camera can't write fast enough to make use of the extra speed of the fastest cards.\nThe only real issue related to SD/SDHC and CF cards is compatibility with what you already own. Today, most digital P&S cameras use SD cards, so if you carry a P&S digicam and an XSi you'll only need to carry one type of card.\nBatteries\nThe XSi uses Canon Battery Pack LP-E5, which is currently only used by the XSi. The XTi uses a type NB-2LH battery pack. The new LP-E5 has higher capacity, but a different form factor so the two types of battery are not interchangeable.\nAC power can be supplied to the XSi via AC Adapter Kit ACK-E5. An optional Battery Grip BG-E5 is available, which can use 6 AA batteries or two LP-E5 batteries. It also provides a shutter button and control dial along with AE/FE Lock, exposure compensation and AF point selection buttons in a vertical orientation.\nMechanical Design\nThe Digital Rebel XSi is very similar in size and shape to the XTi. The edges and corners are slightly more rounded and the rubberized patches on the back and grip sections of the camera are slightly rougher and \"stickier\", making the camera a little easier to hold with one hand.\nDigital Rebel XSi - 129 x 98 x 62 mm - 524 g (with battery)\nDigital Rebel XTi - 127 x 94 x 65 mm - 556 g (with battery)\nLike the XTi, the XSi has a high strength plastic mirror box mounted in a small stainless steel chassis. The outer panels of the XSi are made from durable plastic.\nChoosing a Lens\nHannah Thiem\nThe Digital Rebel XSi is available as a kit with the new Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS , ( compare prices ) ( review ). This lens covers the same angle of view that a 29-88mm zoom would on a full frame camera, so it's useful for many types of photography including landscapes, group shots and portraits. The Image Stabilized (IS) system is a new low-cost version of Canon's traditional IS, but the performance is good and it can add up to three stops of stability, making handholding the lens in low light easier, despite the relatively slow maximum aperture.\nTo complement the EF-S 18-55/3.5-5.6IS Canon has a new Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS , ( compare prices ) ( review ), which is good for situations like sports and wildlife photography where a longer focal length is needed. It gives an angle of view equivalent to an 88-400mm lens on a full frame 35mm camera. Like the EF-S 18-55IS, the EF-S 55-250IS uses a new, lower cost IS system, but again it seems pretty effective adding up to three stops of stability. Zoomed out to 250mm, IS gives you a good chance of a sharp image while handholding the camera at shutter speeds as low as 1/60s.\nOf course, for an inexpensive fast portrait lens, you really can't beat the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II , ( compare prices ) ( review ). That's a lens I always recommend looking at.\nThere are many other lens options from Canon, Sigma, Tamron and Tokina. For an overview of what's available see The EOS System Guide\nCompared to Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Sony\nThe 12MP Digital Rebel XSi falls between the 10MP Canon Digital Rebel XTi , ( compare prices ) ( review ) and the 10MP Canon EOS 40D , ( compare prices ) in Canon's lineup. The XTi doesn't offer such features as Live View, spotmetering or Highlight Tone Priority. The EOS 40D offers those, plus a higher frame rate (6.5 fps vs 3.5 fps), a larger image buffer, support for studio flash, and a more rugged construction. Which DSLR to choose depends on your needs and how much you want to pay. All three cameras are capable of producing excellent image quality, so the choice should be mainly based on camera features.\nHannah Thiem\nIn the Nikon lineup the closest cameras to the Digital Rebel XSi would be the 10MP Nikon D40x , ( compare prices ) ( review )Nikon D40x and the 10MP Nikon D80 , ( compare prices ) ( review ) Nikon D80. The D40x is cheaper, but has a simpler 3 zone AF system and no provision for the use of Nikon AF-S (internal ultrasonic motor) lenses. The D80 is closer to the XSi in terms of features, having an 11-zone AF system, DOF preview and an optional vertical grip (all of which the D40x lacks). Both the D40x and D80 have the option of an ISO 3200 setting, which could be a consideration for those who do a lot of low light work.\nThe 10MP Pentax K200D , ( compare prices ), is the closest camera to the XSi in the Pentax lineup. It offers several features not found on similar Canon and Nikon DSLRs including sensor-shift stabilization built into the camera body. This means that all your lenses become stabilized and you don't need to buy special IS or VR lenses. The K200D is also sealed against dust and moisture to a greater extent than most other DSLRs of its class. It features an 11-point AF system and an ISO range up to 1600. It does not have a Live View capability.\nThe Sony Alpha A350 , ( compare prices ) ( review ) offers a 14MP sensor, ISO 3200 capability, an advanced Live View system, a tiltable 2.7\" LCD, sensor-shift stabilization built into the camera body and a 9-zone AF system. Maximum frame rate is a little slow at 2 fps, but it does pack in a lot of features for around the same price as the Rebel XSi.\nRebel XSi Key Features\n"}, {"score": 269.93262, "uuid": "12af4456-643f-56b9-ac88-38df68c49168", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-31-09064", "target_hostname": "merecat.org", "target_uri": "http://merecat.org/photo/", "page_rank": 1.2252647e-08, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "mere cat: Photography", "snippet": "Now you, too, can have nerves of steel <em>for</em> only $1800.

I have been putting my latest photos here . The old pages are still here:\nResources\nIntroduction\nI haven't written a formal biography of my life in photography (that would make a gripping read, I'm sure!), but it turns out that I have written a few paragraphs about myself. In December, 2001, I joined the Philadelphia Leica Users Group . That's interesting partly because I don't own a Leica camera (it's explicitly not a membership requirement), but also because I felt compelled to unburden myself of my psyche via an e-mail to the group's founder, Kyle Cassidy. For now, this will serve as my photographic autobiography:\nAs for my agenda, here's a summary that I hope will give you a sense of my interests, biases, and predilections. I've been \"serious\" about photography for about a year and a half. As far as equipment goes, I am interested in 35mm and larger formats using both black and white and color. I have no interest in anything that automates picture taking (auto exposure, auto focus, TTL flash, etc) and enjoy \"controlling\" everything myself manually. Well, at least some of the time. I also have almost no interest at the moment in digital photography. Notwithstanding my \"interests,\" what I actually own are two Nikon bodies (FM2n and F3) and four prime lenses, all AIS: 24mm f/2.8, 35mm f/1.4, 50mm f/1.8N, and 105mm f/2.8 Micro. My discovery of Leicas is the result of my interest in street photography. Being a timid soul, I've never attempted doing any street work myself, but it fascinates me.\nAs for film, I shoot slides primarily (almost always Fuji Astia with an occasional roll of Velvia). For print film, I like Fuji NPH 400. I have also begun to work with traditional wet darkroom techniques through courses I've taken at the Abington Arts Center. I develop my own black and white, but don't have equipment for printing. I've used Tri-X 400, Ilford Delta 400, and Fuji Neopan 1600 so far, but black and white is such a huge area; there is so much to explore. I feel like I barely know anything.\nAt this point, I feel confident with the mechanics of picture taking, although I am rather slow and deliberate in technique. I am looking to grow artistically in the sense of discovering what I want to say and exploring ways of expressing it. I enjoy looking at other photographer's work very much, and I am discovering new treasures all the time. If I had to pick a single favorite, it would be Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz.\nEven though I don't actually own a Leica myself, I feel a kinship with Leica users (except maybe the collectors. Oh, wait, they're not users, are they?). Of all the myriad kinds of cameras, the way a Leica handles seems to put up the fewest barriers to achieving a photographer's vision. It's like there's less machine in the way and more of a direct connection. Likewise, it may also be the most revealing of a photographer's strengths and weaknesses. If you take a bad picture with a Leica, it's not the camera's fault. I'm not sure I can explain it any better than that.\n[December, 2001]\nAn interesting footnote to my interest in Leicas: Brian Reid, the list admin on the Leica Users Group mailing list, conducted a random survey of 50 subscribers sometime in 2001 and found that only 50% of this group currently own a Leica. With approximately 1200 subscribers on the list, I probably have a lot of company. If I weren't so shy, I'd probably use the handle \"Ivana Leica.\"\nArchive\nThe entries below originally appeared on my home page .\nMonday, November 4, 2002\nI've been having some problems with Ilford HP5+ recently. The negatives show what I consider to be excessive grain. Maybe this film has always been grainy and I'm just getting fussy, but I don't think so. I remember it being more fine-grained than Tri-X, which is one reason I switched.\nI've been thinking a lot about the Zone system, and it's actually starting to make sense. The point of it all, I mean. Something else I've come to realize that's related to this is the old adage, \"Expose for the shadows. Develop for the highlights.\" Uh, okay, but why? Well, for one thing, the longer film is developed, the more highlight density builds up. The densest areas build up the most, while the shadows change least of all. This makes me wonder how short a time I can use and still get full development of my shadows.\nWhat prompts all this is noticing (and worrying) that I have to use filters of 2 or below or my shadows block up. In other words, my negatives have too great a density range (I think).\nTuesday, October 15, 2002\nBig day for me. Our Conifer Quarterly (the house organ of The Conifer Society ) arrived today. The editor had used some of the pictures I had taken to illustrate an article about the annual meeting. I was surprised (and pleased) at how many she used, including some color slides on the inside and outside back cover. Wow. My first published photos! I was beaming.\nMonday, July 1, 2002\nI reached a milestone today in my PAW (Picture-A-Week) project: 26 pictures. Halfway there. Check out the latest pictures .\nI've been craving a Leica M rangefinder since I first found out what they were a couple of years ago. Because these cameras are very expensive even bought used, I had given up hope of ever having one. Today my fianc\u00e9e, Anne, surprised me (that's an understatement!) with an M4 (built in 1967) and a Summicron-M 50mm f/2 lens! All I can say (besides that Anne is the most wonderful woman in the world) is: \"I'm not worthy.\"\nMay 20, 2002\nI developed my first roll of Delta 3200 tonight using Xtol 1:1 with a time of 12 minutes at 75 degrees. I couldn't find much in the way of firm times for this film, but I decided on this time (which, if anything, is on the short side) since I exposed the film at an ISO of 1200 in mostly contrasty light. It's hard for me to tell how things turned out just by looking at the negatives with a loupe, but at least the negatives don't seem underdeveloped. The grain of this film is quite prominent, but has a very pleasing \"look\" to it.\nMay 1, 2002\nI developed my first roll of Ilford HP5+ this week and made a contact sheet and one print last night. Maybe I shouldn't have done this with the first roll of a new film, but I rated it at 200 and underdeveloped it (10 minutes instead of 12 in Xtol 1:1 at 68 degrees). Underdeveloping provides a host of benefits, including reducing grain and increasing sharpness, although chiefly it reduces contrast. The penalty (every gain in photography involves a tradeoff) is a loss in speed, hence the need for overexposure. I had been processing Delta 400 this way for some time and was pleased with the results. In fact, the Delta negatives had plenty of contrast (so much so that I wondered if I was accomplishing anything by underdeveloping). Not so the HP5+. Most of the negatives were distinctly \"flat.\" At least I was accomplishing something by underdeveloping! I will definitely rate my next roll at 400 and process \"normally.\" So far I am very pleased with this film. One of the shots taken in very contrasty light looks great, so I think if I have low-contrast lighting and subjects, I should use normal development. Based on this limited experience, I think I prefer the tonality of HP5+ to the other films I have tried (Tri-X, Delta 400, and Neopan 1600).\nApril 30, 2002\nI have updated my PAW , although I am still about a month behind.\nApril 21, 2002\nI added a number of sections and pages to this site, mostly to remind me of the direction I want to go, not because there's any new content--there's almost nothing on those pages at the moment. The new pages are: Macintosh and AppleScript development, Restaurants, Photography Technique and Resources, Literature and Music.\nMy PAW was up to date as of a month ago, but it hasn't changed since then. I've been shooting, but I'm behind in everything else.\nApril 10, 2002\nI photographed the tree crew Monday for a while before I left for work. I used a Nikon A2 (81A) warming filter, which I bought because I had heard it recommended to restore a natural color balance to subjects illuminated solely by blue sky (as in full shade) or on overcast days. I had taken any number of shots made in full shade that were spoiled by a heavy blue cast. Yesterday was overcast, so I thought I would try it. In this case I think it was a bit too much; flesh tones were unnaturally \"warm.\" I now believe that the diffuse illumination from a light overcast doesn't need any compensation from a warming filter. Live and learn.\nApril 9, 2002\nWhat's the deal with fast lenses? Do you have one? Do you really need it? Do you ever use it wide open? How often do you use it wide open? (Hey, this is turning into a rant!) I used to think I needed fast lenses, but I've changed my mind.\nWhen I began acquiring prime lens to supplement my original 35-105mm zoom, I steered toward the fastest lens available in that focal length. Beginner though I was, I was still aware that fast lenses weren't necessarily the best lenses, but I needed to use the same lens for both \"available darkness\" conditions and sunlit landscapes. I thought a fast lens would benefit the former without compromising the latter. I did enough research to satisfy myself that the faster lenses were as sharp as slower ones. So I acquired a 50mm f/1.4 and 35mm f/1.4 (both AIS) with the idea that neither of these lenses made any major optical compromises for their speed. (I wanted an 85mm 1.4, too, but this was simply too expensive. I still don't have an 85mm.) I understood that these lenses might not be stellar performers wide open, but the rest of their range should be fine, and you had f/1.4 if you needed it.\nI was wrong about all this.\nFor one thing, it's my feeling that the 50mm f/1.4 isn't so great even stopped down (although maybe it's just my sample). I became dissatisfied to the point that I now own the much cheaper and lighter f/1.8 (It's AIS, but looks like an E series. Admittedly it's more plastic-y than the f/1.4--you can't have everything.) I'm very pleased with it.\nMore importantly than the performance of these lenses wide open, I discovered that for my purposes, the widest aperture wasn't really usable (at least handheld). Besides being the least-sharp aperture, the narrow depth of field makes focusing so critical that the inevitable focusing errors just contribute to the softness. I find myself longing for a dream world where I would never need to go wider than about f/4, which is still open enough for a nice selective focus effect, but giving up three whole stops of light isn't helping get the shot when light is dim. Giving up three stops means I would have to rate my 400-speed film at 3200. Not a good idea. Nevertheless, I'll be experimenting with pushing some 400 speed films and trying some faster films to decide what solution I want to use, but I don't think opening up all the way works for me.\nI realize that your mileage may vary when using lenses wide open. I've seen wonderful work that was shot wide open at even wider apertures than f/1.4, for example using a Leica Noctilux at f/1.0, so I think the problem is just with me. On the bright side (pun intended), one thing a fast lens does provide is a bright viewfinder image (in an SLR), although I only notice that the image is \"dark\" when the aperture is smaller than about f/2.8.\nApril 4, 2002\nI habitually underexpose my black and white negatives. This is surprising because I learned exposure by shooting lots of slide film, which has, basically, almost no room for error. I'm pretty confident figuring out an exposure for most scenes using slide film, so I know my technique and equipment are adequate, but somehow this experience doesn't carry over into black and white. Part of the problem is that I tend to shoot black and white in poorer (dimmer) lighting conditions, and I am overly optimistic about a film's ISO rating as well as the way I meter the scene.\nIn some recent pictures taken in good light, I've tried placing the scene's values more or less in the center of the film's curve, regardless of where they were in life. For example, for a low-key scene I would \"overexpose\" and for a high key scene I would \"underexpose.\" The theory I have is that I'm placing the scene's tones on the flattest part of the curve where I should get the best gradation. But I don't have enough experience to know whether this works or not. For my last two rolls I have also rated Ilford Delta 400 at 160 and reduced development time by about 15% (9 minutes in Xtol 1:1). The negatives seem fine, but I haven't printed any yet. We'll see...\nWhat's confusing me is some advice I've read in Anchell & Troop's Film Developing Cookbook. I gather from them that proper exposure of a black-and-white negative is just as critical as it is for slide film. They write:\nIf there is any secret to obtaining high sharpness and fine grain, it is to ensure that the negative has a low density range. Maximum density should not exceed 0.9 above base+fog for small negatives... [page 3]\nWith small formats, it is necessary to give the minimum possible exposure that will still record adequate shadow detail. This means the negative needs to be as thin as possible. The thicker the negative, the more grain and the less sharpness when you enlarge. However, the penalty for minimum exposure is slightly poorer shadow gradation in the negative. Special printing techniques like dodging and burning are often the only way to get a thin negative to show shadow gradation as rich as a thick negative. [page 6]\nBut for conventional films, thin negatives (density range 0.9) will be sharper and less grainy, both objectively via measurement and subjectively. [page 54]\nThey also refer to the \"cardinal rules of minimum exposure and minimum development time\" [page 59].\nSo what does this all mean? I thought a thick negative was a good negative. I have plenty of thin negatives and I don't like them (although mine are a little too thin). I guess I can take them at their word and try to achieve \"minimum exposure,\" but I'm not sure how to meter for this.\nApril 3, 2002\nI started a new course at the Abington Arts Center tonight: \"Intermediate to Advanced Black and White Photography.\" It was good to get back in the darkroom again. I can't print my black and white negatives at home, and so I had accumulated a backlog of negatives I had never seen.\nThis is my fourth course at AAC in the last year, having taken the Intro to Black and White course twice before. Four of the five students in tonight's class were returning as well. I think we all find the teacher (Bill Kelly) an inspiring influence, gently guiding us toward fulfilling our creative potential and achieving the highest level of darkroom craftsmanship we are capable of.\nMarch 29, 2002\nI had decided earlier this year to stop hopping from one type of film to another in some futile attempt to find perfection, and instead choose one film and one developer and try to learn the combination well (pushing, pulling, different dilutions, etc.). I finally decided on Ilford HP5+ as the film and Kodak Xtol as the developer. Ten rolls of HP5+ arrived today. The first roll is in the camera.\nWhy HP5+? Well originally, I considered choosing three films, actually, to cover all speed requirements: medium (ISO 100), fast (ISO 400), and very fast (ISO 800+). But after thinking about it, I decided that I didn't need the medium speed film; at the size enlargements I make, the grain and resolution of a 400-speed film aren't a big problem. At the other end of the speed range, I thought I would try to push the 400 speed instead of using a faster film. After all, the 3200-speed films (Ilford and Kodak) both need to be pushed when used at 3200.\nAs for my choice of HP5, I decided on this film in part because it's a traditional film (as opposed to a tabular-grain film like Delta 400). I had started in black and white with a traditional film (the venerable Kodak Tri-X), but I was disappointed with it, at least initially. I think it was mostly because I had no experience or basis for comparison. My first impression of Tri-X was that it was \"gritty\" and a little harsh-looking. At an 8x10 enlargement size, grain was also clearly visible. Looking back now on my first Tri-X prints, I think I misjudged the film. Sure, it's grainy (I never tried shooting and developing it for minimum grain), but it does have an engagingly rugged, honest personality. It's just that subtlety is not its strong suit. On the other hand, HP5+ has a reputation for subtlety and smooth tonality. I also expect its grain to be finer than Tri-X's; I hope somewhere between Tri-X and Delta 400.\nMarch 23, 2002\nSlowly but slowly, I've been workin' on my PAW (Photo-A-Week). Finally, it's sorta kinda basically up to date. Wooooo doggies!\nFebruary 24, 2002\nI've been reading Barry Thornton's \"Edge of Darkness\" and find his obsession with sharpness fascinating. Suddenly I must have a Rollei SL66! And all those developers (DiXactol, etc) to try... In case you didn't notice, I'll go to any length to avoid actually taking pictures. Must do more testing...\nSeriously, in the back of my mind I am looking for the \"ultimate\" film/developer combination (who isn't?), which in my case has led to a sort of \"developer of the week\" syndrome. I keep wanting to try a new combination before testing the last one. This is crazy, of course, and goes against what most wise photographers advise: pick a sensible combination and use it until you understand it inside and out. Then if you want something it can't do no matter how you tweak it, try something else.\nI've about decided to limit myself to two or three films, a \"slow,\" a \"fast,\" and a \"really fast.\" I haven't decided on the slow, but I think the fast will be Ilford HP5 and the really fast will be Neopan 1600. I've already used Neopan 1600 a bit and started by rating it at 1600. It seemed that at 1600, this film has virtually no leeway on the shadow end. You have maybe two or three stops below middle gray and that's it. Of course it could be the way I developed the film, but for now I think it's more like an 800 speed film. I'll find out when I do some controlled tests. It's promising, because for a fast film, it's not grainy at all.\nMeanwhile I've developed several rolls of Neopan 1600 and Delta 400 in my very first batch of Xtol. If I ever do a PAW, these rolls will provide the January pictures. To be strictly chronological, I may have to skip a week here and there. What the heck, I'm already a couple of months behind.\nJanuary 7, 2002\nI was looking forward to Thanksgiving vacation for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the opportunity to take some pictures for class (Photography 101 with Bill Kelly at the Abington Arts Center). Unlike some holiday vacations where every spare moment is committed to catching up with chores around the house, I didn't have that many commitments. Instead of feeling liberated, however, the empty time felt like a weight on my shoulders, so I procrastinated until vacation time simply ran out.\nWhat happened? I realized that I have reached something of a dead end. Since turning \"serious\" in the spring of 2000, I have been concentrating on developing my technical skills in photography. In other words, I was on a quest for a technically \"correct\" photograph--one that was properly exposed and that had the subject in focus. (If the composition was pleasing and the light was nice, that was a bonus.) Now my photographic skills had progressed to a point where I felt a sense of responsibility to make a good photograph instead of just a correct one.\nBut I wasn't sure what to do next. Usually I would sally forth full of enthusiasm restlessly searching for subjects. And I usually found some. But now it was nearly winter, and I missed the long hours of daylight and the abundance of made-to-order subjects among the lush growth of spring and summer. But more importantly, I realized I'd grown weary of random, senseless photography as much fun as I was having with it.\nSo here it is 2002 already, and I haven't made much progress except that I want to try some things with \"studio lighting.\" I read \"Light Science and Magic\" and am eager to try some of the exercises in the book. With my flash and a roll of tracing paper I decided to run some tests.\nPosts in \u201cPhotography\u201d\nJanuary 5, 2009\nBest of 2008 in Black and White\nLast year, I went through my photos to choose two for the Leica User Group Yearbook (and put a few others up on Flickr). This year was different. I missed the deadline for the yearbook, and it\u2019s just as well. 2008 was a terrible year for my photography. I didn\u2019t shoot much and still have half a dozen rolls languishing, undeveloped. From the ones I did develop, I chose two for the yearbook, before I realized I had missed the deadline. These were both taken on St. Patrick\u2019s day in Jim Thorpe, PA.\n"}, {"score": 269.64566, "uuid": "ca01a822-4ad0-5b12-b79a-eb680555f4a1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1508wb-05-13753", "target_hostname": "re-photo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://re-photo.co.uk/?m=201105", "page_rank": 1.3598649e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "&gt;Re: PHOTO &raquo; 2011&raquo; May", "snippet": "It looks and feels very much the digital <em>camera</em> <em>Leica</em> <em>should</em> have produced.

While with cameras like the Nikon D700, any Nikon user could pick it up and use it without even opening the 700 page tome - the camera certainly had some new features but was essentially the same as previous models - but the FX100 is breaking new ground.\nBut the FX100 is a deceptive camera. Pick it up, hold it and it looks and feels very much like one of my favourite all-time cameras, a classic Leica M or perhaps even more, the Minolta CLE, my own person favourite \u2018Leica\u2019 of all time.\u00a0 It has the same solid feel, a similar layout, a great optical viewfinder. It looks and feels very much the digital camera Leica should have produced.\nOf course it lacks one important feature of the Leicas - interchangeable lenses, but as someone who walked around for several years with an M2 and only a 35mm f1.4, perhaps I feel this is less important than some others. Of course since then I\u2019ve become rather attached to shorter focal lengths, and would have preferred Fuji to have chosen 28mm rather than 35mm equivalent.\nAt f2, the lens is a stop slower too, in fact the same combination as on one of my earliest cameras, the Olympus 35SP on which I took my first published pictures.\nThe big difference, and something that is taking me a while to get my head round, is the hybrid viewfinder. For me this really comes into its own for close up work, enabling focus down to around four inches, and also in providing a review image in the viewfinder, so that you see exactly what you have taken without the usual peering on the camera back at an image hardly visible in bright sun.\nBut I am having problems getting my head around all the different possibilities of display and view, and occasionally have just found it impossible to get the camera to work in the mode I want it too. I\u2019m not sure whether the fault is in my brain or in glitches in the firmware, but I am pretty convinced that Fuji need to come up with a firmware upgrade that sorts things out a little better.\nThe one big disappointment about the camera is that inexplicably Fuji have provided it without a filter thread. On the front of the lens is a useless front ring, which has to be unscrewed and replaced by the AR-X100 adapter ring before you can add filter and or lenshood. Hard to see why this ring was not a standard part of the camera. Also hard to see why when the ring is sold as separate item the lens hood is only available as a set with the ring. And triply hard to see why Fuji did not foresee that most owners of the camera would want these items, currently out of stock at most dealers.\nI\u2019ve not yet used the camera enough to write a sensible review - nor too have any of the people whose reviews I\u2019ve read, although of course Digital Photography Review have their usual (and valuable) in-depth technical stuff, I find this never tells you much about how a camera might need your actual picture-making needs.\nOne thing that has impressed me is how quiet and unobtrusive this camera is - much like the Konica Hexar F (another fixed lens 35mm f2 model I loved.) My Hexar F, even though I saved \u00a3150 by buying it from New York, still cost me around \u00a3500, and I think that was around 15 years ago, so at \u00a3900 I think the FX100 is hardly overpriced.\nThe other good news is about image quality, which I\u2019ve not yet fully explored, but seems to be more or less similar to that of the D300 and considerably better than the 4/3 competitors, noticeably so at ISO 800 and above.\nMore on this camera when I\u2019ve really done some work with it.\nKeep the NHS public\nTuesday, May 24th, 2011\nIt was surprisingly dark and gloomy on the Euston Road around 5pm when I arrived for the Islington march to \u2018Keep the NHS Public\u2019, which was gathering under the trees opposite University College Hospital. Although I know that digital cameras such as the Nikon D300 and particularly D700 that I use give great results at high ISO, I find I still have a great reluctance to push them into the regions that were off limits in the days of film.\u00a0 Looking at the results I got, it seems obvious that I should have given myself at least a stop more to work with most of the time, and there were just too many that were not quite sharp enough, either because of slow shutter speeds or insufficient depth of field.\nOne of the first people I met there was a woman I\u2019ve known for some years - and a former colleague of my wife - who embroiders her own placards for protests.\u00a0 The health service affects us all, and there were a very wide range of people attending the protest along with many medical students and health professionals, and I hope my pictures reflect this.\nI rather liked this woman who was walking around at the start of the march waving a red \u2018Unite - the union\u2019 flag, reminding me of a socialist realist poster, and took a number of pictures - several of them on My London Diary - though I don\u2019t think any of them quite caught what I saw. I also took several pictures of\u00a0 one of the organisers of the march, Janet Maiden, who works in the Haematology department at UCH, which I felt happier that they captured some of her energy - even if they weren\u2019t always quite sharp.\nBackgrounds are important too - and in the image above it is clearly to those who know London taken at UCH. More readily recognisable are perhaps these gates at Downing St, where a small group decided to sit down away from the main group.\nand even more so, the man on the column in this image.\nAlthough I perhaps took better pictures with the slightly less well known but still fairly recognisable National Gallery and portico of St Martins in the Fields in the background, which you can see with the rest of the pictures on My London Diary in Keep The NHS Public .\nLebanon Bans Altneuland\nTuesday, May 24th, 2011\nI have to admit not having paid a great deal of attention to the 2011 World Press Photo before today.\u00a0 I almost always go and see the show when it comes in London, and it is due at the Southbank Centre\u2019s Royal Festival Hall from 10 November - 29 November 2011.\u00a0 But although I always find some work of interest, the overwhelming impression is always one of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Yet more blood and though it is vital that photographers document such things and that they appear in newspapers, magazines, TV and on-line, I\u2019m often uneasy about treating such images as aesthetic objects on oversize display on a gallery wall.\nBut there are always some images, some projects that stand out, and one that I will certainly be looking for in November is by Israeli photographer Amit Sha\u2019al, brought to my (and the world\u2019s) attention by being banned in Lebanon - with the result that the WPP show there closed early.\nYou can of course see\u00a0his work in the winners gallery at World Press Photo - it took third place in the Arts & Entertainment stories category. I find it slightly annoying that in the larger slide-show view there I can\u2019t find a way to read the captions, which I think are essential.\nOn Sha\u2019al\u2019s own web site , you get a little more of the story behind the project Altneuland which these images are a part of.\u00a0 The idea came from the novel Altneuland, written in 1902 by Theodor Herzl , a Hungarian journalist who is widely regarded as one of the founders of modern political zionism and thus a father figure of the state of Israel, although he died in 1904.\u00a0 In 1896 he published Der Judenstaat, a pamphlet advocating the restoration of a Jewish state in their historic homeland of Palestine, and the utopian novel Altneuland six years later set out the great advances this could acheive - for both Jews and Arabs - over the course of a generation, with two travellers revisiting the new state after a period of twenty years and noting the changes.\nThe English translation, published in the same year was entitled The Old New Land, a straightforward translation from the orginal German, but the Hebrew version of the book came out with the title \u2018Tel-Aviv\u2019, later adopted for a new city now Israel\u2019s second largest.\nHerzl\u2019s vision of a Zionist state was very different to modern Israel. His vision was one of a nation where everyone (men and women) would have equal rights, where Hebrew would be one of many languages and Judaism one among other religions without special status. It was essentially of a humanist and mutualist state and he wrote: \u201cIt would be immoral if we would exclude anyone, whatever his origin, his descent, or his religion, from participating in our achievements.\u201d\nSha\u2019al collected black and white photos taken in Israel from 1926 to 1979and found the exact locations where the pictures were taken. He then photographed the pictures in these locations, holding the prints in his hand (resting on a tripod out of shot to keep it still) fitting them back exactly into their place in a wider scene. He writes on his web site:\nThe photos portray 3 different times: the old black and white photos, the present colored photos and the time that has passed between capturing both photos.\nThe third time mentioned is not a visual one, but a mental and emotional dimension, filled in by the knowledge we have of the dramatic changes that have occurred between the two times.\nThe pictures were on show in Lebanon for a week as a part of the WPP display there before anyone apparently noticed that Sha\u2019al was an Israeli photographer and the Lebanese censors demanded that they be taken down as Lebanon and Israel are still \u201cin a state of war.\u201d To their credit World Press Photo refused to comply with this ridiculous and unacceptable request, and instead closed the whole show ten days early.\nLibya v Libya\nMonday, May 23rd, 2011\nLast week I photographed a kind of composite demonstration opposite Downing St. Stop the War and CND had organised a demonstration to demand an end to the bombing of Libya, but what happened was rather more complicated.\nAlong with the regulars at Stop the War events, this protest, like the last one I photographed against the NATO bombing of Libya also attracted a number of Libyan supports of Gaddafi, complete with their green flags, headbands and scarves. This is of course a free country, and no reason at all why they shouldn\u2019t turn up to demonstrate, but their presence is perhaps a little embarrassing as the official Stop the War policy appears to be that they do not support Gaddafi, and a video of their previous demonstration has a Libyan saying that Gaddafi must go.\nA few yards down the pavement was another small group around the banner of the\u00a0 Workers Revolutionary Party Young Socialists, with their own megaphone and their own policy, essentially that they support Gaddafi as a liberator of his people and that the Libyan opposition movement is a bourgeois tool of imperialism which they back him in trying to smash.\u00a0 At one point there was a fairly heated argument between them and one of the leading members of Stop the War, who made it clear that they were not welcome and should organise their own protests. The group did move a few yards further away after this, although later the police moved them back.\nA few minutes after the protest started, another small group, mainly Libyans, arrived bringing an amplifier and speakers in the back of a vehicle and started setting up their protest in opposition to the Stop the War, calling for a greater effort by the NATO forces to help them in their struggle to get rid of Gadaffi.\nWith the rest of the photographers I was going backwards and forwards between the groups, and so there was plenty to take photographs of. The Libyan opposition with their \u2018freedom\u2019 flags and a rather more animated approach were certainly the most photogenic of the groups, and I was pleased with a series of images as a very vociferous woman, shouting and pointing at the WRP-YS speaker, tried to push her way through the police line and was held back.\nMore from this series on My London Diary\nAfter an hour or so, most of the Stop the War supporters left, simplifying the shouting match by leaving just the pro-Gaddafi Libyans at their end of the pitch and the Libyan opposition 50 yards away at the other (by this time the WRP-YS had given up and were just standing around their banner on the sidelines.) Eventually the Gaddafi supporters, perhaps overwhelmed by the greater power of the loudspeakers on the other side compared to their rather puny megaphone (curiously Stop the War had earlier been warned by the police and told they had to stop using a megaphone, but the police took no action against either group of Libyans)\u00a0 decided to give up, and made off towards Parliament Square.\nPhotographically, apart from trying to cover the various groups at the same time, there were few problems, and for once nearly everything worked perfectly, and the biggest problem I had was in trying to edit down to a sensible number of images. There was just one small problem with the pictures taken on the D700, where a small spot of something or other - perhaps a little bit of spit from someone shouting - had made its home on the large front filter of the\u00a0 16-35mm, giving a small diffused area near the top centre of every image. Often there was sky there, where it wasn\u2019t a problem, but this also meant there was little or no sign of it when I looked at the images through the viewfinder or on the rear screen. You may still just be able to see a trace of it in some of the pictures on My London Diary where you can see rather more pictures and read more about the events in For and Against Libyan Bombing .\nLife Through the Lens\nMonday, May 23rd, 2011\nSmartpress are a US on-line printing company dedicated to producing a wide range of high quality prints flyers, postcards, booklets and more and they have a blog that describes itself as \u2018Your #1 resource for graphic design, photography and print!\u2019.\nOne of the regular features on it are interviews with leading commercially successful photographers and I found several of these interesting although I don\u2019t always particularly like the work - which includes sports, wedding, travel and stock photography. One feature that I did find interesting that was linked from these is Hendra Lauw\u2019s Sharing Space with the Dead , black and white pictures taken at Manila North Cemetery.\nBut what actually brought me to the Smartpress blog was an \u2018infographic\u2019 based on questions that they asked these photographers about photography which they invite people to share on their blogs, and I\u2019m happy to do so:\nClick to Enlarge Image\nVia: Online Printing\nMost of the advice is pretty sound, if obvious, but there are some things I find interesting here. Lynn Michelle says \u201cShoot anyone and everyone that you know, in the best and worst light that you can find\u201d and I think that\u2019s great advice for anyone wanting to be a portrait photographer or to photograph people. First because too many people think the only reason they don\u2019t get on as portrait photographers is because they don\u2019t have access to the famous - forget it and shoot \u201canyone and everyone that you know.\u201d Second because I\u2019ve always liked to use light that was \u201cwrong\u201d or difficult and many of the most interesting pictures come from doing so. And with digital you have nothing to lose and the huge advantage of seeing the results straight away.\nAnd on the subject of digital, it was interesting to see an almost unanimous vote for digital rather than film. I can\u2019t agree with Kerry Garrison that film is better for learning how to really use your camera - if anything it makes the learning process much slower and more painful - which is why before we had digital cameras I was using video cameras and Photoshop as teaching aids for people learning to shoot on film. And I certainly see little point in schools of photography teaching out of date craft skills except for historical interest (let\u2019s all try wet plate!) But I do rather wonder what digital cameras Scott Kelby was using in the 1990s.\nBut the single thing that struck me most about the answers was the 90% for Lightroom against 10% for Photoshop. Regular readers of this blog will know it mirrors what I\u2019ve been saying here for some time.\nWheelchair Protest\nFriday, May 20th, 2011\nPerhaps what surprised me most about the \u2018Hardest Hit\u2018 march on May 11 was how cheerful and friendly everyone was, despite the great deal of anger at the government cuts which hit the disabled hardest.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t just the cuts in public services, although those with disabilities are likely to depend more on these than the rest of the community, but a process of trying to decimate the number of people who can claim mobility and disability benefits that was started by the previous Labour government.\nMost of us would agree that a policy of encouraging disabled people to work in ways that make use of their capabilities is a good idea, but the new policies while paying lip service to this actually fail to make any attempt to do so, and are just designed to get as many as possible off benefits, or at least onto lower scales of benefit.\nRather than proper and personalised assessments of people\u2019s capability and attempts to find ways that people can be integrated into employment, successive governments have contracted a private company to carry out tests using a computer system that cannot properly take individuals into account. Those administering the tests often lack the essential skills to make a proper assessment and are allowed insufficient time to do so. The company, Atos,\u00a0 has a financial incentive to carry out the tests on the cheap and to turn down benefit applicants.\nAlthough the tests are unfair to all, they are particularly unfair to some classes of applicants, particularly those with intermittent problems - many of whom if they attend the test centre are by definition having a \u2018good\u2019 day rather than a typical one - and those with mental illnesses.\nAs well as the disabled, there were many supported and carers taking part in the protest, which was one of the shortest marches I\u2019ve ever photographed. It started a couple of hundred yards before Big Ben\u2019s Clock Tower at one end of the Houses of Parliament and finished a couple of hundred yards after At Stephens tower at the other end, so a very large proportion of the pictures I took have these buildings in the background.\nAs always, the height of Big Ben is a problem - fine when people are holding placards above their heads - as above, but harder to use when people are sitting low down.\n"}, {"score": 268.61935, "uuid": "ae5f8361-6686-5502-86fb-ae8320e75562", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0905wb-60-33473", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/activist-video-reveals-study-in-contrasts-in-a-pair-of-tennessee-cops", "page_rank": 1.1723024e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Activist video reveals study in contrasts in <em>a</em> pair of Tennessee cops |", "snippet": "<em>A</em> passport is <em>a</em> federal item and local police can\u2019t look it up to confirm the information.

I want to post them online.\"\nHmmm. Well Ruby I think the goal would be not to take pictures like mine or someone else's, but to take pictures that are your own, that show a little bit about how you see the world. For me photography is not about what you choose to shoot, but about what you choose to leave out. And ultimately it's all about emotion. What do you love? Or hate? What things do you see that other people miss? What moves you?\nHighly biased advice:\nI've been taking pictures most of my life so it's pretty much organic. Know your cameras. Feel comfortable with them. Get to the point where you don't have to think about how to make the camera do what you want it to do.\nTell a story.\nI always tell myself to get closer. The closer you get (within reason) the more emotion you will find.\nLong lenses are not a substitute for getting closer.\nIf you are shooting people look your subjects in the eye.\nSlow down. Hang out with your subjects. Try waiting 10 minutes before pulling out the camera, or better yet, an hour.\nWait for the light to get better.\nOne of the silliest comments I see again and again is \"nice depth of field\" (ironically usually posted when the depth of field is shallow. People have gotten so used to digital cameras with high ISOs that stop down and keep everything in focus that they have forgotten the possibilities of wide aperture photography. Ditto for slow shutters speeds and motion. This said, don't let the wide aperture become a crutch. Just because you've focused on something at f 1.4 doesn't mean it's interesting.\nDon't post pictures of cats (dogs are ok, dogs show emotion, but be sparing).\nAvoid clich\u00e9s. Some common clich\u00e9s: zoo pictures, pictures shot and then modified with stock Photoshop filters, sunsets, flowers (unless your audience is full of horticulturalists nobody cares), abandoned buildings, graffiti, mannequins, people in clown makeup (or some other silly costume), fall foliage, water on glass (usually shot with a wide aperture), random people walking down an anonymous street, people in wacky t-shirts, pretty clouds, silly signs, empty roads, seagulls, swans, ducks, water reflections, couples on the beach.\nJust because you shoot with a macro lens/holga/polaroid doesn't make it interesting.\nWhen taking travel photos try to avoid the touristic. What is touristic? If you see a gaggle of tourists shooting in a particular spot, the images taken from there will be touristic. If it should be on a postcard, it's touristic. Photos of \"natives\" in tribal dress shot with a long lens, usually smiling at the photographer are touristic.\nTurn off automatic stuff: auto-focus, auto-exposure, auto-whatever. Make some decisions.\nEdit. Edit. Edit. (I am horrible at this.)\nShoot black and white now and then.\nWhen I choose a picture to post I ask myself \"so what?\". If I can't answer that for myself, I figure it's not worth posting.\nExperiment.\n"}], [{"score": 255.14798, "uuid": "deb56869-f430-5194-81e3-aa4b4685e9e5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0310wb-79-19310", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/equipment/canon/85-1.8", "page_rank": 1.2387155e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Lens Review - photo.net", "snippet": "The 85&#x2F;1.8 is <em>a</em> truly excellent lens <em>for</em> wide-field astrophotography.&quot; <em>For</em> those who use small-sensor digital SLRs and do <em>portrait</em> projects, this is <em>a</em> &quot;must-own&quot; lens. <em>For</em> those who use full-frame <em>cameras</em>, this is <em>a</em> &quot;probably <em>should</em> own&quot; lens.", "explanation": null, "document": "Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Lens Review\nby Philip Greenspun , June 2007 (updated March 2011)\nTweet\nThe Canon 85/1.8 prime lens is inexpensive and lightweight. It is a very good portrait lens for a film or full-frame Canon digital SLR and a great portrait/telephoto lens for a Canon small-sensor digital SLR, such as the Canon Digital Rebel XTi (Black) , ( compare prices ) ( review ). The f/1.8 maximum aperture enables capturing scenes, without flash, in light only half as strong as would be required for a professional f/2.8 zoom and light only one quarter to one eighth as strong as would be required for a kit lens. The wide maximum aperture also enables a photographer to throw a distracting background out of focus. Finally, the wide maximum aperture brightens the viewfinder.\nIf you've been accustomed to the L-series zoom lenses, the 425g (15 oz.) weight of the Canon 85/1.8 lens will come as a relief. This is only about one third the weight of the 70-200/2.8 zooms and not significantly heavier than a 50/1.4 normal lens.\nWhere to Buy\nPhoto.net's partners have the Canon EF 85/1.8 lens available. Their prices are fair and you help to support photo.net.\nCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM , ( compare prices )\nOptics\nThe lens design is simple, with 9 elements of glass arranged in 7 groups. This simplicity means that flare will be minimal and contrast high, especially compared to zoom lenses with 15 or more elements of glass (note the photos above right; despite the strong backlight, the contrast is normal on the faces).\nMaximum magnification is 0.13. With a full-frame camera, the smallest object that you can photograph is roughly the size of an 8.5x11\" (A4) piece of paper. This is not close/tight enough for a picture of just a child's face.\nConstruction\nThe Canon 85/1.8 is simple, plastic, and rugged, with a wide knurled manual focus ring. The ET65III lens hood is sold separately, and snaps onto the front of the lens, just in back of where you'd screw a filter (58mm) in. The lens incorporates a ring USM motor , which enables \"full-time manual focus\", even when the camera/lens are set to autofocus.\nAlternatives\nA professional traveling with just a handful of lenses would take portraits with the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM , ( compare prices ) ( review ). This is an excellent lens, but it is five times the cost and three times the weight of the 85/1.8. Due to the more than one f-stop of additional speed, the 85/1.8 will yield a brighter viewfinder and the ability to focus more selectively.\nThe Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM , ( compare prices ) ( review ), is a superb lens, as you'd expect given that it is both a prime (non-zoom) and an \"L\" lens. You'll feel a lot lighter in your wallet after buying the 85/1.2, but the burden on your neck will more than compensate; the 85/1.2 weighs 1025g (2.3 lbs), more than twice as much as the 85/1.8. The 85/1.2 is a superior optical performer, especially in the corners of the frame, but (1) that doesn't matter too much for portraits where people look mostly at the face and eyes, and (2) doesn't matter on a small-sensor digital camera where the corners have been cut off.\nCanon EF 100mm f/2 USM , ( compare prices ) ( review ) is so similar to the 85/1.8 that it becomes a question of personal preference. On a small-sensor camera, 100mm is longer than a standard portrait length. Most photographers oriented towards prime lenses would probably end up with the 85/1.8 and the 100 macro (see next paragraph).\nThe Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM , ( compare prices ) ( review ) is usable for portraits, and might be a better portrait length on a full-frame camera, but you lose one f-stop and the lens is heavier and bulkier. If you have the money, it is best to have the right tool for the job. Use the macro lens for macro projects and the 85/1.8 for portraits.\nFor additional flattening of perspective, consider the Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM , ( compare prices ) and Canon EF 135mm f/2.8 Soft Focus , ( compare prices ). With a small sensor camera, these are roughly equivalent to a 200mm lens and will have you standing too far back from your subject for most photographers' taste. The soft focus is a fun gimmick, but the lens hasn't been updated for decades and lacks an ultrasonic motor. The L lens is fantastic and provides more magnification than the 85/1.8, good for taking pictures of features smaller than a human face.\nAstrophotography\nRuss Arcuri, the author of an older review of this lens, wrote \"The best astrophotography lenses are sharp and fast. The 85/1.8 is a truly excellent lens for wide-field astrophotography.\"\nConclusion\nFor those who use small-sensor digital SLRs and do portrait projects, this is a \"must-own\" lens. For those who use full-frame cameras, this is a \"probably should own\" lens.\nWhere to Buy\nPhoto.net's partners have the Canon EF 85/1.8 lens available. Their prices are fair and you help to support photo.net.\nCanon USA page , includes modulation transfer function chart\nExamples\nKitchen table, diffuse lighting coming in from some windows, kid talking to her grandmother. ISO 400, f/2.8, 1/80th of a second. This is a good example of how the 85/1.8 enables reasonable quality photos in typical household background and lighting conditions. Only one eye and some hair are in sharp focus, but it is better than blasting the scene with on-camera flash.\nAt f/2.8, the face is sharp but more or less everything else is out of focus.\nLeaving the EOS 5D's computer system to choose an autofocus target results in some locks of hair being sharp. At f/1.8, the eyes don't fall within the depth of field and therefore are blurry.\nf/2.8 offers enough depth of field that you can take a portrait of two people... as long as their faces are approximately the same distance from the camera.\nf/1.8 and 1/20th of a second... At 85mm, you'd expect this image to be ruined by camera shake. A shutter speed of 1/85th of a second or faster should be required. However, I leaned my arms on a bookshelf and that provided a substantial amount of image stabilization.\nAt f/2.8 the background is still moderately distracting. A longer lens, e.g., 200/2.8, would have been better.\nAt f/3.2 the father's face is not quite sharp. This could be a plus, if the objective is to concentrate a viewer's attention on the baby.\nAt f/4, both father and daughter's faces are in focus.\nf/4 renders all of the statue in focus. This gives a good illustration of the lens's \"bokeh\", or rendition of out of focus highlights.\nText and pictures copyright 2007 Philip Greenspun . Unless otherwise noted, all images on this page were taken with a full-frame Canon EOS 5D , ( compare prices ) ( review ).\nNote that this review replaces an earlier one by Russ Arcuri and therefore many of the comments predate the review date.\nArticle revised March 2011.\nMichael K. Gardner , January 27, 1998; 11:18 A.M.\nRuss's brief review notes that the EF 85 f/1.8 USM lens is primarily a portrait lens, and that's certainly true. But it's a truly wonderful portrait lens. When I purchased this lens, I really wondered if I'd use all that much. Like many amateur photographers, I was addicted to the convenience of zooms. I can honestly say this is one of my most used lenses. Although I also own a 70-200 f/2.8 USM, the weight definitely makes me think twice about carrying it around. If I know my primary purpose is a couple of portraits, I'd just as soon use the 85 (assuming I'm able to move about to get the framing right).\nOne other thing: similar focal lengths (in terms of angle of view) in medium format (e.g., 165 mm on a Pentax 67) have sometimes disappointed me, because they have limited close focusing. Not true for the 85 f/1.8 -- you can get a tight head shot.\nI'd strongly recommend this lens for photographers who take a lot portraits and use the Canon EOS system. It's a wonderful lens at an affordable price.\nRuss Arcuri\n, February 17, 1998; 12:27 P.M.\nInterestingly enough, the close-focus ability of this lens is my only gripe. (I'd have mentioned it in the review, but I only recently began thinking of this as a problem.) If you want a REALLY tight head shot, this isn't the lens for it. It just doesn't focus close enough.\nMy example: I wanted a tight head shot of my daughter, who is only three weeks old. (Of course, her head is much smaller than an adult's head.) I was forced to attach a close-up lens (Nikon 6T, if you're wondering) to the front of the 85/1.8 in order to get in close enough for a tight head shot.\nThere is a problem with this method, though. If you get too close to your subjects, their noses (or whatever part of them is closest to the camera) will be magnified much more than the rest of their heads, creating an unnatural-looking perspective, even with the fairly long 85mm focal length. When shooting really tight head shots, a 100 or 135 would be a better choice for a more natural perspective on a person's head.\nIn my daughter's case, I was forced to use my 70- 210 zoom at about 135mm in order to get a tight head shot and a pleasing perspective.\nAndrew Kim , September 11, 1998; 02:48 A.M.\nThe point is valid that 85mm lenses are short for doing close headshots with a flattering perspective, even for adults...of course, depending on your taste. But, for the classic head and shoulders and even whole torso shots, it works really well and works in a reasonably sized room.\nI liked my 135mm for headshots a lot, I like the 200mm even better, but neither one is too easy to use as a head and shoulders or full torso lens in my small apartment space. Perhaps this is the origin of the \"studio lens\" comment?\nAlso, I feel Russ may be understating the value of the 85mm for landscape shooting, where gentle isolation of elements is a pretty effective technique. It's probably much more related to personal style and skill level than attributable to a given focal length: I personally usually muck up wide angle shots by succumbing to the urge to take in the whole grand scene without focusing on important elements and cutting out extraneous elements. I do that less often with a mid-tele lens for obvious reasons.\nThe close focus ability (I use the Nikon 85mm f1.8 AF-D) is actually pretty objectionable: I get better magnification with my 50mm f1.8 AF at closest focus than the 85mm. Also, the Nikon version only closes down to f16, which makes getting adequate depth of field tough sometimes.\nJosh Falls , September 17, 1998; 12:01 A.M.\nI most certainly agree this is the best portrait lens I have used. I choose it nine times out of ten over my 80-200 f2.8. My comment is not necessarily on the portrait ability of this lens, but yet the usefulness I have found when shooting basketball in high school gyms. Since they usually have very bad lights the extra light f1.8 gives me over my 80-200 f2.8 is much needed, plus it is much easier to carry when in for a tight shot under the basket, just in case you have to move very quickly.\nDevin Shieh , October 25, 1999; 10:08 A.M.\nThe 85/1.8 is also great for sports. Namely, basketball and volleyball. The focus speed of this lens rivals my 300/2.8L and is faster than my 70-200/2.8L. It's very sharp, and very well-built. A superb lens.\nJosh Hansen , January 23, 2000; 06:28 P.M.\nThis lens is probably my favorite lens. It has been mentioned that this is an incredible lens for portraits and that is certainly true. However, it is equally useful as a lens for landscape photography. Use it to pluck out an interesting section or use the shallow depth of field at 1.8 to isolate interesting objects. Galen Rowell says in one of his books that something like 90% of his top images were taken, or could have been taken, with a single camera and 24mm and 85mm lenses. Forget about cheap zooms and learn to move your feet. Did I mention that I really like this lens?\nRobert Ball , June 03, 2000; 04:30 P.M.\nThis lens is wonderful. I have used it for portrait work, but found an even better use for it in the last few weeks. I play in a pool league and we had our year end tournament. Since I would have large blocks of idle time I figured I would take pictures. I took my EOS-3, my 85 f/1.8 and my 70-200 f/2.8 lenses. The 70-200 just didn't cut it. I had to hand hold and a flash would have been too distracting to the players. I ended up using the 85 f/1.8. It's speed and weight were perfect. I was able to capture some great shots of players studying the table, lining up their shots or shotting just after contacting the cue ball.\nI used a shoulder stock and was in the 1/6 to 1/10 second exposure range with Portra 800 film. There were a couple of pictures that didn't turn out because the player moved a little. I was also bumped a couple of times. But, only one player noticed me taking pictures and for the most part the shots were well exposed and very clear.\nI made several 8x10 enlargments scanning the negatives using my HP 20S scanner and they came out great. I have had requests for 8x10 enlargments by players who saw the photos.\nThe combination of light weight, fast focus, sharpness and speed makes this lens a great one for low light work. I have been thinking about getting the 85 f/1.2 L lens so I can get even sharper images by picking up another 1/2 stop or so.\nPatrik Skolling M\u00f6ller , August 25, 2001; 03:21 P.M.\nI\u00b4d say that this lens is very sharp. I take 90% of my pictures with the largest aperture. I like the shallow depth of field.(I do that with all my other lenses aswell. 28-70 L,70-200 4,0 L and 24mm). I can\u00b4t see any difference in sharpness when stopped down. It is as sharp all over,offcourse the corners will be sharper when lens is stopped down, but you`ll need a loup to see that on 10 X 15 cm prints. I don\u00b4t see any improvments in contrast when the lens is stopped down either (You might be able measure the difference in contrast, but I tried to see any difference with my eyes and I DON\u00b4T see any worth mention). When taking nature pictures, like flowers at f1,8 ,the lens is fantastic ! Wonderful shallow deph of field thet never dissapoints me. Pictures turns out gorgeous with a \"painted-blured\" background. The lens is almost too sharp for portraits sometimes.(If a lens can be TOO sharp?) I use REALA and the new NPC 160 for most of the time.\n;-)PATRIK\nLarry Zaks , November 15, 2001; 06:41 P.M.\nYou can debate the merits of this lens compared to the 85mm f1.2L vs. the 100mm f2 vs. any other lens that remotely covers the focal length range. What I'd rather do is use this lens. It's a remarkable lens that produces consistantly fine results. I enjoy using it outdoors for people shots and landscapes and it really shines in the studio on a tripod for portraiture. Because of its size and weight, handling is easy and quick, even in tight places like crowds or small areas. The lens renders out of focus areas (bokeh) beautifully, like colorful (or monochrome) cotton candy. For the money, I can't imagine a better value in an EOS prime lens except maybe the 50mm 1.8 MKII. But the 50mm f1.8 MKII doesn't have ring USM, FTM and a metal mount.\nI weighed the merits of this lens vs. the 100mm f2 for quite some time before I bought the 85mm f1.8. The differences aren't great enough to merit much discussion. I regret spending that time now that I have the lens in that I could have or should been out using and enjoying the lens as I am now.\nFrank Bunnik , June 20, 2002; 06:13 A.M.\nThis is indeed an excellent lens. Supersharp. I used it both for portraits and fore landscape. Because of it's small size much easier for handheld photography then the 80-200 2.8. Also it is less \"frightening\" for the subject when a short lens is aimed at him/her then to see such a big telelens taking aim from just a short distance.\nGary Graley , October 11, 2003; 11:56 P.M.\nMy favourite lens, I used to own the 100 but found that I lacked backup room when inside trying to get nice head/shoulder shots and took it back to get the 85 and made a big difference, love the lens, that and my 24 are the two I'd not go without! G2\nPaul Hart , February 13, 2004; 05:54 P.M.\nThis lens must represent the best value for money in the Canon range, with the possible exception of the 50/1.8 lens. Razor sharp, compact, light, fast, well made, with beautiful out of focus areas, it is a superb portrait and landscape lens. It also demonstrates the inherent superiority of primes over even the best zooms.\nBen S , October 01, 2004; 03:26 A.M.\nif you take any portraits at all, even on a digital camera, buy this lens. i've got 24, 35 and 50mm Canon prime lenses and a sigma 70-200 that i've used for years before buying this lens used for a canon 10d. none flatter subjects like this sharp, contrasty, fast, fairly light (compared to the 70-200 certainly), USM lens. it is a tremendous performer. yes, hard to find space sometimes with a digital camera, but worth the effort.\nD N\n, June 03, 2007; 07:43 P.M.\n85mm has long been my favorite focal length for 35mm cameras. The f/1.8 lenses are particularly sweet for their speed and agility. I find that using either the EF 12mm or the the EF 25mm extension tubes in conjunction with the Canon EOS 85/1.8 makes the close focusing abilities adequate for close-up product shots of eBay-ables.\nJuha Kivekas , June 04, 2007; 07:09 A.M.\nThe EF 85/1.8 USM is one of my all time favourites. Unfortunately I don't own one, but have borrowed one. I used to have the huge 85/1.2 but the f/1.8 version is much more practical. Optically it is simply excellent, focus speed is adequate for sports and the focal length is nice for portrait be the crop 1.0 to 1.6 or anything in between. Excellent lense. I've got the EF100/2 which is very similar. That tends to be a bit too long for indoor use with a 1.6 cropper. With 1.3 cropper it's about ok.\nA. Davis , June 04, 2007; 09:53 P.M.\nI found my 85 f1.8 in the classified for $150, and drove through a snow storm to pick it up. I'm glad I did. Exceptionally sharp-I think more so than any of my other primes except the 100mm macro. When I'm shooting a wedding or event, either the 85 or 100mm macro stays on my 30D, with a 24-70 on my 5D-it's great for picking out faces in a crowd of people, and for those classic \"take a photo of me and my friend!!\" moments, with the only drawback being having to clear a path to back up.\nEllis Vener\n, June 05, 2007; 02:03 P.M.\nthe 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent lens. I have three Canon EF primes that I use regularly: the 85mm f/1.8, the 50mm f/1.4 and the 35mm f/2. All are terrific. I use zooms when I need too but much prefer the primes with a 1Ds mark 2 body.\nAlan Myers , June 05, 2007; 03:47 P.M.\nSomething I've not seen mentioned is that the EF 85mm is much more subtle than most zooms covering approx. the same focal length. This might be important for street shooting, travel or any sort of candid photography.\nA big white 70-200/2.8 almost shouts, \"Hey! I'm taking your picture.\" Particularly with lens hoods attached, the 24-70/2.8 and 24-104/4 IS aren't very very inconspicuous either.\nSo if you want to take pictures of people going about their daily lives in a natural way (i.e., not stopped, posed and grinning for the photographer), you might stand a better chance with the 85/1.8 and some of the other relatively compact primes.\nFor this and a few other reasons, I often use a \"walk-around\" kit that includes 20/2.8, 28/1.8, 50/1.4 and 85/1.8. This is used with a 10D or 30D (1.6X) most of the time now, but has served on full frame film in the past. A 135/2.0 is at the top of my shopping list, but that's another topic.\nOh, and I do frequently use 24-70/2.8L and 70-200/2.8L IS zooms, too, particularly in fast changing situations where they can be truly indispensible.\nBryan Costin , June 08, 2007; 01:39 P.M.\nIt is a very nice lens, and one of my favorite non-L primes (the others are the 50/1.4 and the 35/2). The only annoyances are a tendency toward purple fringing in high-contrast areas (not unique to this lens) and the relatively long minimum focus compared to some other primes I use. The first is fairly easy to correct when it's bad enough to be annoying, and the second is something that's one gets used to soon enough.\nmorgan terrinoni , June 12, 2007; 09:59 P.M.\nJust to add to the chorus of fans on the 85 1.8. On my 30D it just flat out delivers time and time again. The OOF areas are nice, the in focus areas tack sharp (in a good way), creating a nice 3D effect. I use it a lot more than I thought it would, mostly for portraits, but also for landscapes. I'm also a prime user (24 1.4L and 35 2.0), combined with the 17-55 2.8 IS, but the 85 1.8 is my favorite lens by far. My wife calls it the magic lens.\nAndre Reinders , June 15, 2007; 08:31 P.M.\nI got this lens a few months ago, and I too really like its qualities. I sold my Canon 75-300mm f4.5-5.6 USM lens and got the 85mm f1.8 and a Tamron 1.4x TC. I now can get a field of view of almost 200mm @ f2.5 on my 20D with the combo. Faster lens, and nicer images - it really improved the portraits I was making... over the 50mm f1.8 on the cropped sensor. I now also have a portrait lens for my film (Elan 7N) I am a happy camper :)\nDAN CASPERSZ , June 21, 2007; 03:55 A.M.\nA 50mm lens is more versatile for portraits on a 1.6x crop body. Flattens the features and also allows you to take a few steps back for more body/environment. And Canon produce superb 50mm primes for every budget (f1.8, f1.4 and f1.2).\nfast primes , June 23, 2007; 07:29 A.M.\nWhile the Canon 85F1.8 (and it's near twin the 100F2.0) is undoubtedly an excellent lens, there are a few \"user friendly\" quibbles to be thrown in:\nIt could focus closer than the common 3 foot minimum! The Olympus OM 100F2.0 and the Leica R 90F2.0 Summicron, both focus to a very usefull 2-foot minimum. With internal focusing, offering an extra foot of close focus should have been a slam-dunk. Canon does do this for the 135F2.0 L lens. Pentax also offers it for it's new portrait lenses--the 77F1.8 and 70F2.3 (for APS digital format) and it's standard AF 135F2.8 lens.\nAnd a built-in lens hood would be nice! With a prime portrait lens, being ready to go/capture-the-moment right now is a major advantage that offsets the small performance increase (from greater length) that a bayonet hood offers.\nWill Hore-Lacy , June 28, 2007; 09:25 P.M.\nCanon 85/1.8 as a sports lens??\nWhile I don't actually have this lens I have heard that is it an excellent lens for low light sports photography. The wide apeture and USM make it a good short tele lens for indoor sport when you are not too far from the action.\nG D , July 01, 2007; 07:52 A.M.\nI frequently use my 50 1.4 for low light and wanted the 85 1.8 but ended up with the 100 2.8 Macro. A coleague of mine has the 85 and uses it almost exclusively for Photographing bands in available light.\nIn a tightly packed camera bag and travelling it is hard justify 2 portrait length low light lenses: The macro is stunning and unbelievably useful. Cold mornings makes insects move slowly. with the Mr14ex ring flash its a gem.\nI lust after the 200 f1.8 for low light Wildlife shots, but it would be about 2% of my photography on Safari which in itself is too little of my life So I guess its out then...\nSteve Rinn , July 05, 2007; 06:46 P.M.\nI am always finding new uses for this amazingly versatile lens. Another one not mentioned above is theater/music performances. With my 20D on a monopod with the 85 f/1.8, I can take photos of my kids' performances on stages that are all too often poorly lit. Subject movement blur is still a concern, but careful timing can help with that.\nVANHAV VV , July 17, 2007; 10:34 P.M.\neconomy and utility\nSara Finton , March 21, 2008; 08:40 P.M.\nDoes anyone have some examples they could share of auditorium shots and/or indoor sports they could share?\njr miller , June 09, 2008; 12:14 A.M.\nAwesome lens!\nhttp://jrmiller.zenfolio.com/p1009860719/?photo=865188068\nJonathan Farmer , September 22, 2008; 01:59 P.M.\n.I use this lens at weddings and find it to be a fair performer. At 1.8 it is soft but gets sharp at 2.8.

I've shot this lens on both an Elan II and a Rebel XT, and the only autfocus issues I ever had were from the body's focusing speed abilities. My 85mm has almost always been spot on and quick, even in challenging lighting condiitions. Perhaps you have a bad copy?\nCheers!\nD. H. Harris , April 27, 2010; 07:38 P.M.\nNot my favorite or most widely used focal lengths, but if your looking for a good quality fast-focusing portrait lens at an affordable price - you won't be disappointed with this lens.\na soft image for certain (wide open, slow shutter speed), but it certainly captured the moment.\npaul langereis\n, March 10, 2011; 12:01 A.M.\nI am picking up a used copy of this lens tomorrow, and cannot wait.\u00a0 I am getting into more and more portrait work, and this lens seems to perform well in most situations that I will come across.\u00a0 I would like to thank all those people who posted here as this helped me make my mind up on whether or not to buy this lens!\u00a0 I am excited!\nPaul\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

I compensate by setting the ISO 1/3 stop low (ISO 80 for an ISO 100 film). This isn't much and some people might not notice it, but I do.\n(2) It's really nice to have the option of using AA batteries via the BP-50 battery pack and grip. Rechargable Ni-Cad's are so much cheaper in the long run than Li cells!\n(3) The wired remote is useful since it doesn't self cancel after some fixed time like the IR remote function\nToomas Tamm , February 17, 1997; 07:48 A.M.\nWhile Canon has omitted a list of the Custom Functions from the body, one can be easily created with a word processor and laser printer. With a 5-point font and essentially no line spacing one can fit 10 lines of readable text into the empty space on the left hand side of the bottom of the body (if you have the camera, you will find the space easily).\nIf you use TeX, you can find a sample source file for the labels at this url: http://www.chem.helsinki.fi/~toomas/photo/cf-labels.html .\nDennis M> Guten , February 27, 1997; 04:17 P.M.\nI have to agree with Bob that the problem of the cutom functions is easily solved by putting all the custom functions on computer and printing out at about a font size of 5. I did this and laminated it to the insides of all my lens caps so i always have this info available.\nAgnius Griskevicius , June 30, 1997; 06:56 P.M.\nAfter reading all the hyped comments about the Elan IIe, I bought into them. Now, half year later, I am sharing my experience with you.\nGood things:\nThe camera is light and controls are logically laid out, which makes camera a joy to use. Did I mention the camera is light?\nBad things:\nI also got an AA battery pack, but to my disapointment there was no exposure lock/focusing point selection buttons on it. For the same price you get the buttons on EOS-5, so I thought... Too bad! Batery indicator loves to tell me my AA cells are about to die. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not. It is quite anoying. Camera's autofocus/exposure randomly stops working in the remote locations, like Santa Monica Mountains. Could be quite a bummer! After sending camera to Canon, they replaced the contacts and the upper plate (printed on icons were coming off from my daily use). They could not find anything wrong with electronics. I haven't used camera much since, so I can not say if camera fully functional. Eye controlled focus works, but it is only usefull for slow moving/static objects. In fast action photography the selection speed is unacceptable. Metering is consistent, but underexposed.\nConclusion:\nShould have listened to Phil and gotten EOS-5. I probably would have been much happier with it. Now I am a proud owner of an EOS-1n, and haven't had any suprises yet. Meter is right on the money, and no \"experimental\" or \"work in progress\" features. It just WORKS! Now, with my trust into Canon restored, I can concentrate on taking pictures. For the money, I would get A2 or EOS-5. It is proven technology, and it works.\nAgnius\nJohn David Miller , July 21, 1997; 08:02 P.M.\nI was surprised to see that you didn't like the 70-300 4.5-5.6 EF II zoom. I found it to be very sharp, even around the edges. Even still, I returned it, the Rebel G body and the 35-80 I bought with it and now own the much-heavier Elan IIe and 28-105 3.5-4-5. Why? I wanted a wider range than the 35-80 and the 28-105 seemed to \"fit\" better with the Elan IIe. I must say, however, that the Rebel G works remarkably well (and is VERY light) for the ~$300 you pay for the kit. I returned the 70-300 EF not because I didn't like it, but because I liked it so much I want to get the USM IS model!\n-- jdm\nLuciano Costa , December 27, 1997; 12:44 A.M.\nElan II E. Wonderfull camera. Two small problems so far. First, some brands of batteries dont work with the camera !!! Second, the main dial of my camera has broken after 16 months of use. And the repair costs 40% of the camera price. Should I complain to Canon ?\nPiaw Na , January 24, 1998; 08:48 P.M.\nAbout the BP-50 grip. If you want to get a RRS QR plate for an Elan IIe equipped with the BP-50, RRS won't sell you one, because they claim that \"it's just not stable.\" The alternative is to get an EOS-5 and its grip, which RRS will sell you a plate for.\nJeffery E. Gale Sr. -- , January 28, 1998; 12:15 P.M.\nSeeing as how I just purchased the Elan II a few weeks ago. I have not had the opportunity to experence the camera at it's fullest. Althrough, when it has been put to the test, it has passed with flying colors. I did feel as through the BP-50 was overpriced. (80.00 dollars East Coast). I'am glad that I made the purchased. Seeing as how I was a Elan owner in the past I feel as through Canon has developed an excelent product. I will continue to be a loyal patron.\nV. LaBolle , February 15, 1998; 08:39 P.M.\nI have experienced the battery problem i.e., when changing from one brand of battery to another, the camera would not work. I recalled a post somewhere that suggested adding a thing piece of card board e.g., from a 3X5 card into the top of the battery compartment to assure good contact. This worked. Originally I had a Sanyo battery and when it wouldn't work I switched to a Panasonic with the piece of card. I have \"heard\" that a free repair is available from authorized repair centers. I live in the sticks so I haven't tried it.\nThomas Smith , February 26, 1998; 02:31 P.M.\nI like the camera, but for those that haven't found out yet, one of the custom fuctions (#2, I think) doesn't work the way you would expect. If you set it to leave film leader out after rewind, it only works when you reach the end of the roll and the camera starts to rewind automatically. If you press the rewind button halfway through a roll, you're stuck with no leader. The only way around it I found was to cover the lens and take blank pictures (in manual mode) till you reach the end of the roll.\nOne other finding...when I tested the 28-80 USM IV lens, it performed extremely well with slides under a loupe. However, when checking for consistent exposures across the range of f stops, (blue sky at 80mm), I noticed a white haze in the center of the frame (diffraction?) at the smaller apertures (f22-38). This probably isn't noticable in most scenes, but I'd be curious if anyone else has seen this.\nkevin kemner , March 09, 1998; 11:00 P.M.\nOn the BP-50 battery pack you need to use LR6 batteries our the equivalent. If you use standard over the counter AA batteries the meter will initially read low and after a few minutes use read full. This is due to the lack of surge capacity in commercial AA batteries. The LR6 is a photo battery with higher output and recovery although with a shorter life span.\nPiaw Na , March 20, 1998; 01:40 A.M.\nThomas, I've never had the problem you describe with CF2. I leave the leader out all the time, and have used it with mid-roll rewind with no problem. Are you sure your Elan isn't defective?\nI bought my Elan IIe May '97. I've played with a lot of other cameras since, including a Nikon N70, a N8008s, an EOS 1n, and an EOS A2e, and I have to say that by far, the Elan IIe is still the easiest to use camera I've encountered. The fact that most of the controls are knobs that you twist or turn mean that even in pitch black you can figure out what settings are set where. The camera is a pleasure to use, and never gets in the way. A laudable achievement!\nRich Buttiglieri , April 07, 1998; 03:33 P.M.\nYou can't use IR film because the frame counter in side uses an IR beam to count the sprocket holes. Most older cameras use a mechanical counter when the gear turns pulling the film by the sprocket holes... (this make sense??)\nAs for the leader-out debate, I read somewhere that you must be in one of the Creative Zone settings for mid-roll rewind to leave the leader out.\nHope this helps.\nBobby Downes , May 19, 1998; 03:44 P.M.\nI love this camera. Within two hours I understood every function, and have not once been confused by any of it. It is very well laid out, and I love the lockable command dial.\nThe camera has never let me down yet, and has even survived being sprayed with a super-soaker (although it didn't take too heavy a hit).\nIf you want a camera that gives you plenty of control without getting bossy, this camera is perfect. I just wish it had more focussing points, and more weatherproofing (so that rain needn't stop play).\nKarl Katzke , June 14, 1998; 10:30 P.M.\nI beleive that the Elan II is a keeper. While there are some features that I miss, such as the vertical grip ae lock, fp selection, and main control wheel, and some things like the metal finish that I don't particularly like(Try mounting an 'L' lens... the white ones... on this camera and then looking like a pro :(!!! ) , my experience in using this as an advanced ameteur/student has been overall good.\nI, too, found that the lower iso films (50, 100) are underexposed, no matter how I expose them. One of my friends with a Nikon had the same problem with the same type and roll-batch of film (Fuji Sensia II 100), so I ignored it and considered it a problem with the emusion.\nThe autofocus is fast and crisp no matter what. I really like being able to move the AF to the back button, that's a truly nice feature. Spot metering would be something I'd look for in a future camera... maybe when I upgrade in the fall.\nI've been pleased so far with Canons... I still think that no matter what, they make the best optics!!! Throw Nikons to the sharks!\n-KSK\nCliff LeSergent , June 21, 1998; 11:40 A.M.\nOne of the few things I dislike about the Elan IIe is the tacky aluminum finish. It's too bad Canon won't let us have the black version that is available in Europe. Maybe if enough people ask for it, they might reconsider...\nTed Marcus , June 29, 1998; 11:24 P.M.\nI just got an Elan II, after my trusty EOS 650 gave up the ghost after nine years. I'm still getting used to the different \"feel\" of the Elan II. One thing I still haven't figured out is the benefit of using center-weighted averaging versus evaluative metering-- the 650 had only evaluative metering and usually worked quite well with both slide and negative films.\nI have also noticed that the little red light that makes the selected focus sensor square blink is \"sloppy\"; there's a blotch of red light along the bottom of the viewfinder when the square blinks. This is most noticable when shooting in low light. I first thought my camera was defective, but when I had a look at other specimens in the store, they all did the same thing. At least this blinking can be disabled.\nThe Elan II is certainly lighter than the 650, and the control layout may turn out to be more convenient once I get used to it. I miss the partial metering button that was where the focus sensor select button is; the metering mode switch under the mode control dial is sometimes awkward to operate. I'm also finding that I use the \"one-shot\" AF mode, since the usual trick of focusing and recomposing makes the AI Focus mode think the subject moved and changes the focus; again, this problem may be a holdover from the 650 that will go away once I get used to selecting the right and left focus sensors.\nThe lens I got with the Elan II is the new Canon 22-55 zoom, intended as a normal lens for APS. It replaced the somewhat heavy and clunky 28-70 I've been using for nine years. Although this lens cuts corners with a plastic mount and lack of focusing scale, it's small, light, responsive, and decently sharp. It's an inexpensive way to get an ultra-wide lens, which is normally quite costly.\nKarl Katzke , August 24, 1998; 12:18 A.M.\nWell, I've had the camera for six months, and the verdict is in... I'm keeping it at least until Canon comes out with it's vauge new bodies in the next month or two. Not even the Canon sales reps know what the bodies will be or look like, Rumor has it that there will be two, something similar to the N90s, and something to replace the A2. Supposedly, it's supposed to be called the A3, but that's just rumor right now.\nBut about the Elan... I bought the model without the Eye Focus... I tried it in stores, and even after calibrating, it still seemed gimmicky and more like a toy than a tool for me. I need RESPONSE...\nI've stayed with the 28-80 that came with the camera, but recently I've expanded to a 75-300. We'll see how this one turns out... I may end up returning it. I'm planning on buying a 70-200 2.8L, but that's a little pricy for me right now. Waiting for the overtime pay I'll get from work this winter... And for the return of the Cash in With Canon rebates at the end of September.\nI did add the BP-50 vertical grip, and I'm waiting to use up the lithium battery I've had in the camera since I bought it. If you don't use the built-in flash, they last freakin' forever!\nI also added the 380ex flash, and I'm planning on adding a sunpak 4000 or the 540ez later on. The 380 is great, especially for fill flash, because of the super-synch that it has. I need some meat though, something to light up the night with. The 380 won't QUITE do that.\nI also padded the outside of the body with black gaffer's tape for grip. The plastic, although textured, got slippery after a while, in my experience.\nI'm happy with the metering, and the camera overall. It's a good buy, and I actually like the silver finish... :) Go for it, just don't get suckered into too many consumer level enhancements... pay the money!\n-KSK\n-- -- , December 29, 1998; 08:33 P.M.\nI purchased my Elan IIe exactly one year ago and for the most part, I love it. I bought it knowing that I would not outgrow it quickly like I would with a lower end body. It's a great camera to grow with.\nLately however, the eye controlled focus has not been reacting as quickly or as precisely as it once did. For example, I might want to focus to the left, but the system favors the right box.\nI tried recalibrating it, but it did not seem to correct it. So if anyone has any ideas, email me!\nOverall: great camera, logical controls and good price/value.\nMaury Weil , January 06, 1999; 04:00 P.M.\nI recently had an auto focus problem with the Elan IIE. It turned out that the focusing beam was hitting the lenshood of the 2.8 70-200 zoom. The problem could be corrected by shooting without the lenshood or by attaching the 380 EX flash and setting the center focusing point manually. The camera would then use the flash's focusing light which was not blocked by the lenshood.\nKevin Steiger , January 29, 1999; 10:57 P.M.\nAfter being an avid Canon fan for many years (FT-QL, F-1, AE-1, A1), I decided to try Nikon. The N70 is pretty much foolproof, but the controls were not at all intuitive. I absolutely MUST carry the N70 manual everywhere.\nThen I saw the Elan IIe with its controls so similar to my older Canons that I knew I would feel much more at home. Just love those quasi-analog dials! The Nikon sits in a camera bag while the Elan is my new\nMekissa Hutson , February 11, 1999; 02:54 P.M.\nI have done a lot of research before I decided to but a new camera. I settled on the Canon Elan II. I'm still waiting for it to get here, but from what I've read, I made the right choice!! Thanks to everyone for their input!\nMJH\nVinicius Matangrano , February 23, 1999; 05:47 P.M.\nFor Ted Marcus: I missed the partial metering button, too, when I started using my Elan II (I had a 500, before I bought the Elan). But with a little patience I got used to move the metering mode switch without looking at it. It's not as easy and fast as the back button, but it works. About the servo AF, I suggest that you set CF4 to 1, to link AF to the back button. If you want servo AF, keep the button pressed until you shoot. If you don't want it, release the button when focus is achieved, then recompose. Unfortunately (I think, maybe you don't), I guess your lens won't allow you to manually focus without switching to \"MF\", so that you could take full advantage of this really useful custom function. Maybe you'd like to try a 24-85, it's a nice lens (take a look at the review). Hope this helps.\nVinicius\nEric Yuzon , March 09, 1999; 09:28 P.M.\nI just purchased the Canon Elan II and I really love it. It is my first really serious camera and I settled on it after lots of research. I wanted to comment on the CF2 feature that leaves the film leader out. I don't if it was really settled. I did notice a few things about it. First, it is true that this function only operates in one of the Creative Zone modes. Second, when you switch to one of the Automatic modes, you'll notice that the CF indicator in the display will disappear. This probably means that none of the CF modes will work when the camera is in one of the Auto modes. I found this by mistake when I went to switch out a partially used film cartridge. Anyway, it's a great camera! Very easy and intuitive. With the camera doing exactly what I expect it to do, all I have to do is concentrate on composing pictures!!\nEric\nJoerg Michael , March 27, 1999; 07:01 A.M.\nI just got the EOS 50E last week. I made my decision mostly based by information I found here. Looks like I made a good decision. I got the 50/1.8 and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 USM with it and so far I4m one happy camper. Eye controlled focussing works like a charm for me after just one calibration cycle. I would also like to mention that photo.net was what actually caused my decision to get a new SLR in the first place. Nice work, Philip and the others!\nMario Giberti , May 01, 1999; 10:10 P.M.\nI too was looking to move up from my 15 year old Pentax K1000. Thanks to all of the advise from Phil and all of the other people posting here and in other related sites, I bought a Elan IIe with a 28-105 lens. The same week I ran into a dealer selling a mint 100-300 USM Canon 4.5-5.6 for $160 ( with a Canon skylight filter included) at the Spring Photographic Show at Waltham High School. My first three rolls resulted in a total of three of the best pictures I have ever taken. I just feel as though the camera is allowing me to concentrate on composing more then on the mechanics of focusing and setting the exposure. I will work on taking over control of the functions as my confidence with the camera grows, especially when the limitations of the metering system in unusual lighting situations arises Thanks again for all of the info.\nAndrei Lau , June 12, 1999; 10:31 P.M.\nI think the Elan 2e is well worth the money though there is always room for improvement.\nOne thing I think it should improve is that the meter goes off too fast after shooting. This is particular problematic when exposure compensation is set, that do not allow time to reset it to normal. Every so often if I am not careful enough, the next picture taken may carry the the unneccessary compensation from the previous one. Positive thinking it may help to develop the habit of carefully viewing all the view finder information before pressing the shutter. But I would prefer to have a custom function allowing the meter to go off longer time after each shot.\nAndrei\nChris Hay , June 16, 1999; 09:37 P.M.\nI have been a fan of Canon manual cameras for 30 years. Formerly a pro, now semi-pro, I thought it was time to move into the '90s (1990's) and try a little automation. Now mind you, my serious work is still done with an old RB - weddings, portraits, product photos - but photography is also my hobby. I know that the vast majority of people making a living with photography do what I do, but like the rest of you I hold out hope that I may capture some images that are salable to publishers as well. Carrying a well equipped 35 system makes that hope a possibility. Also, I just shoot for fun! Fun in medium format becomes tiresome and expensive. 35mm is adequate for most uses, and the Elan IIe fills the bill nicely.\nIt is cheap, light and dependable. Excellent photos depend more on the lens and tripod, but this camera body is more than adequate as a basic building block of a real system. I'd rather have the three of these bodies than just one \"professional\" body for the same cost. Of course, some models will have more this or faster that, but do you really need 1/12,000 sec. shutter speeds and lightning fast motor drives? Only highly specialized professional work requires this, and only rarely at that. For most, wanting more than this camera offers is just ego talking. True, there is no pc flash terminal on this model, but I fire my studio slaves with a camera mounted unit pointed upward at low output. (Studio photos are really the realm of medium format anyway!).\nIf you couple this camera with the 380EX flash, you have one of the most foolproof systems available. One walkthrough with the manual and I was ready to go - the camera is logical and intuitive in its layout. Eye control works perfectly for me. After calibration (which takes only seconds to complete) the eye control, including DOF preview, is dead on with my glasses, sunglasses, or no glasses. I have never used the highest available shutter speed, and the 2.5 fps motor drive is just right to catch a sharp image on the second or third frame of a slow speed hand-held shot. It is also fast enough to catch a variety of positions of divers, race cars and jumping dolphins.\nI have actually used this camera for portraits and weddings, and it is exceptionally easy to use and provides commercial quality results.\nIf you need a flexible, general purpose 35mm camera system, the Elan IIe has no competition. Dollar for dollar, you just can't get more!\nChris Hay\nEdwyn Schuchhard , August 02, 1999; 05:50 A.M.\nI use my Eos 50e now for 2 years and don't have many complains. It's a very light combination (I traded it for a much to havy Nikon system after towing it for 4 weeks in Sri Lanka jungle). And the weight was for me the number one choise. Last year I again travelled Asia, but with my Eos it was no pain.\nI have the 28-105 Canon USM lens and I am pleased with it, and I have a 80-300 Canon USM lens but I am not satisfied on the quality, hard the focus realy sharp, not realy that sharp pics. And I use a 100/2.8 Tamron Macro, this lens is my favorite. Realy sharp, it makes a good combination with the Eos. Also my Speedlite 540EX was a good choise.\nI use my camera often for travel (landscapes, for people I use a harmless looking Hexar) and nature photography and with great pleasure. But a had my problems to, not all brand batteries fit well as said by Luciano Costa. I had to use some paper underneath it to make contact with the poles.\nBut my main problem is that I sometimes had much to dark pictures using hi-speed films (Fuiji 800G Superpro) I haved used them in densed forests and cloudy areas. With my normal Kodacrome 64 films I never had this problem. Does anybody know of this?\nEdwyn\nMichael Walker , August 15, 1999; 11:05 P.M.\nIn July of 1998 I finally saved up enough money to buy a Canon Rebel G. Sure I had researched the Elan II (e) and would have loved to buy it, but alas, It was well out of my price range. Heck the Rebel was out of my price range, but hey when you get into photography, you either make yourself poor buying stuff or it sits in a closet somewhere collecting dust. I loved my rebel. It performed excellently and never once gave me a problem. I was never limited by it because I was \"to good\" for the camera. Now, at the end of the summer, I decided to move up. So I did the dumb thing and got a Rebel 2000. Sure, it has 35 zone metering and aprature preview, but other than that it was a Rebel G. I also noticed it was not built quite as sturdy as the Rebel G. I shot my first roll with it and by my second roll the pentaprizim was crooked. There is more plastic used in the 2000, and the pop up flash doesnt want to stay down. So I returned it. I have not lost my faith in Canon, no I love thier \"one-handed\" setup. With Nikon, you need three hands to operate the thing. One to hold the body, one to focus the lens, and one to hold the function/set buttons. With Canon, you have one on the body and one on the lens. So...I put an Elan IIe on the hold shelf, and come Wed. It will be making its way to my camera bag. From what I have read on this board, and heard from my co-workers (I work at Wolf Camera) The Elan II has not let them down. May this be a camera I dont outgrow for many years to come. I have a website that displays some of the pictures I took with my Rebel G, and like 2 that I took with the 2000, but I am constantly updateing it as new pictures find thier way onto film, and soon some actuall Elan II pictures will be showing up there, I encourage you to visit it and let me know what you think. The address is: http//:www.autocannon.homepage.com Thanks, and happy shooting. \"Photographers are one of the most violent groups of people, first they frame you, then they shoot you, then they hang you on a wall.\"\nJerry Cannon , September 25, 1999; 10:11 P.M.\nI bought an Elan II about 6 months ago, just to try out a canon camera, I have also a N-70 and an N-90S which I like very much. I also like the Elan II very much. So far I have done 2 weddings and several church functions with the Elan II and have never had a problem of any kind. It works very well, all of the controls are very east to find and use. I have had only good experiences as far as exposure and mechanics goes. It seems to on the money every time, as long as I do my part and pay attention to what I am doing. I think anyone who down grades the Elan II in the proper exposure department either don't want to take the time to learn how the E-TTL system works or wants only a point and shoot. I probable like the N-90s better, but not enough to justify the 500 dollars difference in cost. I had rather have 2 elans than one n-90s. I am a firm believer in Nikon camera, Nikon flash, Canon Camera, Canon flash. All in all I just don't see how you can go wrong with the ElanII, and 380 ex.\nInge Stubdal , September 27, 1999; 02:19 A.M.\nI just bought a Canon EOS Elan II yesterday, at the Bon Marchi in Bellevue, Wa.\nI have used a really, REALLY old Pentax EX II camera - that was the camera I learned photography on. I had a 58/1.4, a 200mm and a 38 - 100 Zoom lens.\nI was pretty happy with it - until I got my hands on the Elan II.\nI must say that it was an impulse deal - so it's good to hear your comments on it. to of my friends have in the past week bought a Nikon N-60 and a Nikon N-70. My choice was between the N-70 or the Elon II.\nTwo stores in the Seattle area said two completely different things - one recommended the N-70, and Nikon over Canon all the way, while the other store elevated Canon. It came down to personal taste, and the accessibility of functions on the Elon II. The N70 does seem rather awkward - although I lked the grip better on it.\nThe dual-dial on the Elon is wonderful. I really love that I can set the aperture using the dial on the back pane, as it is a real messs to reach on the N-70 - and the Elon II is cheaper ($ 414).\nI did not get the standard lens that comes with it, but instead I got the new Tamaron 28 - 300 f3.5/6.3 lens. At 500$, it gives me, as an amateur, a good all-round lens.\nI did not go for the eye-controll version, but I might just try to go back therre tomorrow and exchange it (it seems that you ppl exschange cameras so easily :P) I've also bought a couple of filters (A1 instead of a UV - don't know if that was good or bad, as it warms tones just a little bit) and a circular polarizer.\nNow all I would like is to foot the bill of a 17mm or the likes, as well as maybe get the standard ~50mm/1.4 lens\nSome things I have noticed already, without seeing any pictures yet:\nWhen I use the automatic mode, it pops up the blitz to stop backlight - when I am targetting a paraglider half a mile away - the N-70 did not do this. I guess the N-70 is better at knowing the range to target.. Also, the N-70 will not pop up the flash in auto mode, it will indicate that it requires the flash. the Elon II will pop up the flash whenever it deems flashing appropriate (you can close it again, and it won't use it - but the pop-up engine makes a little noise.\nOther than that it seems fine. It has fewer preset 'modes' for taking special kinds of pictures (portraits/sport/macro etc..) than the N-70, but as far as I can tell, these are only specific combinations of shutter speed and aperture, so you would want to setthese yourself anyways.\nThe multiple frame forward is slower than on the N-70, but It will still eat your film pretty quickly.\nIt seemed to me that the N-70 was better at adjusting the focus automatically when the distance shifted greatly - but I haven't double-checked this yet (same lenses though).\nWhy do Cannon have the AF/MF setting on the lens and not on the camera? Other than that, I'll have to check out the USM lenses, since you guys speak the world of them. I would love to have MF/AF at the same time. This does not work with my Tamron lens.\nWell, tomorrow I'll get all my pictures, so that'll be exciting :)\nAlex Yap , October 01, 1999; 02:17 A.M.\nI just got my EOS 55/Elan IIE QD back from the shops. The main control dial broke. Yup on a Elan IIE not A2E. It happened halfway through a shoot during one of the local festivities, the only mode that works was Manual. Best test of experiences ever. And when the results came back from the lab, it was AOK :) Other than this malfunction, I like everybit of my EOS. Ergnomics with this SLR is fantastic and I find it easier to use than my EOS 10.\nKevin Han , October 13, 1999; 05:09 A.M.\nI have used my EOS50 for about a year. Now it's malfunctioning. There's this burning smell emmited from the built-in flash section. The \"no battery\" symbol blinks everytime I expose the first frame, indicating that something's wrong (according to the manual). The LCD simply fades off at times. Know what? The built in flash has even fired a few times when still closed! Once I couldn't off the camera. Not when put to L. Had to take the batteries out and \"reboot\" it. Oh man. I'm taking this back to Canon. I would never send something so messed up to other service centers.\nryan allen , October 18, 1999; 03:58 P.M.\nI've owned my elan IIe for more than a year now and I am still very happy with its performance. This camera has EVERYTHING a photographer needs....... except for 1 thing. In aperature priority mode (AV) and shutter priority mode (tv), you are stuck with having your flash sync permanently set at SLOW SYNC. Therefore, without a tripod you must use either program mode or portrait mode to take shots indoors(which I take many of). There is a custom function (#9 i think) though which allows the user to set the shutter speed at 125 in AV mode. But if I wanted to do that I could just go manual and set it to that speed much faster than going through the custom function list. So much for that useless custom function, duh for Canon engineers). Anyway because I would like more control over my indoors shots, I always use the metered manual of the camera. The Nikon F70 on the other hand does allow the user to select between slow sync and normal sync but I believe that's the only advantage that camera has over the elanII. Does anyone have a way to beat this drawback? I've been looking all over the internet to find an answer but it looks like I'm the only one that's bothered by this. Hopefully an engineer at Canon will read this and change the useless custom function #9 into allowing the user to choose between slow and normal sync. Don't get me wrong though. The Elan IIe is no doubt the best camera in the world for its price and features.\nP.S.I didn't really comment on the camera cuz it looks like you all know how great it is already.\nPratik Bhattacharya , October 26, 1999; 08:42 A.M.\nEOS 50E is definitely an excellent body. It is very competitively priced for what it is. The eye-control is godsend. I use it all the time. 50E is a type A camera and hence is compatible with the EX flashes.\nEOS 50E does lack spot meter, interchangeable viewfinder, 21 point evaluative metering among other things. But I don't really miss them as I do not use the partial meter anyway. I trust the evaluative metering with exosure compensation. The metering is fine IMO. And my 50E does not underexpose. Flash exposure with my 550EX is spotless.\nThings that I really miss are faster frame advance and exposure in 1/3 stops. If I can live with these two, I probably will never buy a better body.\nA first class camera to enter the Canon system.\n--Pratik\nInge Stubdal , October 30, 1999; 06:54 P.M.\nI am back - after having used my EOS Elan II (EOS 50) since late september '99.\nI think it's a great camera - for my little experience with such cameras. -And I've spent entirely too much for a lowly amateur!\nI have probably done things no self-conscious photo.net photographer would do - I bought the following lenses with or shortly after getting the camera:\nTamron 28 - 300mm 3.5/6.3f Quantarray 18-35mm Quantarray 50mm/Macro 2.8f\nIt has been a fun re-introduction to photography for me.\nThere is one thing I am wondering about though - and would greatly enjoy if someone could enlighten me:\nThe built-in AF assist beam - it only seems to work in the 'green-zone' mode - and I really don't use that mode at all.\nIn other modes it doesn't seem to kick in - and whatever I do with CF 7 - it doesn't change things.\nThis is a little problem - as the camera doesn't seem to do AF correctly in low light enviroments without the AF assist beam.\nIf anyone knows a way around this, I would be greatful!!\nplease E-mail me: inge@worshipper.com\n-Inge\nAndrzej Krytenko , November 12, 1999; 04:46 A.M.\nI have been using EOS 50E for about 1 year. There are two things I'd like to say about that:\n1. I bought it in Germany, so it was shiped with german manual. In spite of my weak german language knowledge I learned to use all its functions in no more than two hours.\n2. Taking photos with EOS 50E is pleasure. Sometimes I think I'm getting too lazy, especialy when I remain my prevoius full manual Zenit camera. Some pictures are underexposed but it's not difficult to correct that. (Besides I have a feeling that more prints are ruined because of bad processing in photolabs than not proper exposing.)\nActualy EOS 50E makes the job that modern SLR should do and the rest is the matter of used lenses and films.\nRegards.\nWee Keng_Hor\n, November 28, 1999; 09:57 A.M.\nThe all black Elan II has been around shortly after the initial Elan II launch. I've 2 Elan IIE (or 55, the Japanese version), one is the orginal black/silver and the other the all black.\nI'm so used to the Elan II that I actually returned the EOS 5 in exchange for the all black Elan 55. I couldn't stand the slow EC and disabling the EC function when I turn the camera vertically. Also, the EOS 5 command dial isn't smooth which could spoil any moment.\nKurt Maurer , December 25, 1999; 11:36 P.M.\nHi. I've found most comments in this section to be helpful. I have the Elan IIE and love it. Remember comparing this camera to highend stuff like the A2 of even the N90 isn't really fair. It falls into the same category as say the N70 or even the N60. This is a great camera for the money. Opt for the 28-105USM. The N70 lacks DOF and multiple exposure. The interface is more criptic and the camera is heavier (N70). Some diehard Nikon fans call that an advantage (a heavier camera). After a day of trucking it around Disney World what will you call it? Hands down the Canon can't be beat in it's midprice range.\nJohn Gallardo , December 28, 1999; 04:02 A.M.\nI just recieved an Elan II for christmas. I absolutely love it. Took it hiking with me and it was great, lightweight and easy to use quickly. This is my first SLR, and I found it really easy to use... I've graduated from the PIC modes (portrait, landscape, etc) and find myself using the programmed and DEP mode mostly. Something that I don't think has been mentioned, the DEP mode is great... I found it invaluable when I was hiking, in order to get certain shots to come out just right. It is a perfect tool for composing a shot.\nThe one thing that I don't like so much about it, is the flash metering. I was playing around with it and I don't find it too reliable (this is with the on-camera flash, not with an EX). I noticed that in Programmed mode it almost always just went to the largest aperature and gave it a 1/60th shutter speed, even with the lens off. And in aperature or shutter priority (and of course, manual) the meter just seems to ignore the fact that the flash is there, so you have to basically calculate the exposure by hand. I guess this would be fixed with a 380 EX flash and E-TTL flash metering... but the on-camera flash is pretty weak still. Aside from that, I have no complaints... great camera, love it lots!\nMichael Konrad , December 31, 1999; 05:25 A.M.\nI think there is no more to say for the moment.\nI wish everyone a happy new century.\nAnd dont forget: every day is filled with new experiences !\nDerrell Wilson , January 28, 2000; 04:00 P.M.\nI just bought a IIE with the 28-105 USM from B&H last week. I also have a Mark I 1.8 50mm on the way from an ebay auction. So far, I've been pleased with the camera. ECF works amazingly well. After only a few calibrations, it's working like a charm.\nOne thing I wanted to add is that I think the camera balance is better with the BP-50 battery pack added than without. It distributes the weight of heavier lenses across the camera body.\nI have noticed that my camera sometimes locks up, and the battery light starts flashing. I'm not sure if this is because of low batteries (although they are new LR6 batteries) or if it might be a problem with the camera. I haven't used the camera with 2CR5s, so it may just be a problem with AAs.\nAnyway, I'd say it's a great camera!\nVinicius Matangrano , January 30, 2000; 06:07 P.M.\nTo John Gallardo (and other Elan II recent users): please refer to http://www.advanix.com/~photo/bobatkins/info/faq30/flashfaq.htm. I guess it will help you a lot.\nKevin Han , February 13, 2000; 01:53 A.M.\nMy EOS50E is 14 months old. It is a good camera. It really is. But too bad is wasn't built though. Tomorrow will be the third time I send it for service. First it was the smell problem. Turned out there was something wrong with the shutter. Then the film cover latch broke. That took Canon more than a month. Now, the shutter release is faulty. What's a gun if you can't fire it in time. This is hard. I can't wait to get this solved.\nGerman Gomez , February 25, 2000; 07:12 P.M.\nI've bought this camera today, it's my first camera (yeah!) and well it's so easy to use that a totally novice like me could learn the basics in less than an hour. I have no previous experience with SLR cameras (in fact I discover this page searching for help on them) although they always fascinated me. I friend has an old one he used to take photos of night sky with long exposures and a hand-made equatorial mount with electronic motor controlled with a computer. I help him with the design and construction of it, and I would like to know what kind of electronic shooter the Elan II (EOS 50?) has. It's just a switch or has some kind of electronics on it? I've take a look at the \"official\" one and it seems quite simple although the minijack has three bornes which puzzles me. If you have any info on it please mail me, I would like to build the same device my friend has to use it with my Elan II. Also I would like what do you think of Trantor 28-200 (f3.8-5.6), it's the lens I bought with the camera, the shopper told me that it is has a very good value/cost ratio, but as I've already said I'm totally new to this, and I have little money to expend on it (mainly because I'm not confidence enough to expend more money). Thanks and congratulations for your page, it's very informative (wish I've found it before buying my camera :-)\n- german\nVinicius Matangrano , February 27, 2000; 10:07 P.M.\nGerman: the minijack has one contact for \"ground\", another one that corresponds to \"partially depress\" the shutter button and the last one that corresponds to \"fully depress\" the shutter button. They appear in this order in the plug, from sleeve to tip. You can check it by yourself testing a RS60-E3 Remote Switch (I recommend that you buy one, it's a very useful AND cheap accessory).\nTim Norford , March 06, 2000; 06:34 A.M.\nI purchased this camera after reading the comments on Photo.net. I do however have a problem for which I would be most grateful for any input.\nI find both lenses I'm using (Canon EF 28-105 and EF 50mm MK I) regularly have AF problems. Both zoom in and out trying to focus and then stop, out of focus. This doesn't happen all the time but often enough to become irritating. The focus point is correctly selected and I'm not too near the subject. Seems to happen more often indoors.\nI saw Jan Kozak had similar problems and mailed him, it seems he ended up giving the camera to his son :-( So is this really a problem with all Elan IIe's ? Am I expecting too much ? Does this sound like a faulty camera or do others experience this ? Any suggestions ?\nThanks\nAngel Hernandez , March 06, 2000; 01:01 P.M.\nTim,\nI only had focusing problems with the Elan in two scenarios. The first is if I had the camera in AI Servo AF mode instead of One-shot AF. Servo never seemed to work well for me. The next time I had trouble, was when I was shooting in low light with a long zoom. Make sure that if your shooting in low light, that you don't block the AF Auxiliary light. It can be easy to do if you leave a lens shade attached.\nAlso, if this is happening with only two lenses, it's probably not the camera. Try attaching an L series lens, and if you're not blocking the auxiliary light in low-light conditions, and you are focusing on areas of adequate contrast, and you're still having the same problem, well then your camera probably isn't working correctly.\nDesmond Robinson , March 06, 2000; 06:25 P.M.\nDoes anyone know where I can get the all black Elan2e ? They only have it in Europe(France). Does anyone know what stores carry this grey market camera. It's called the EOS 55e (noir[black]). None of the New York places seem to have it. Canon admits that it does exist, but can't tell me where I can get one w/ out traveling to France. I hate the new all silver cameras(Elan 2,Rebel 2000). The all black Elan2 looks ten times better than the silver one we are all used to.\nDan Myung , April 04, 2000; 01:50 A.M.\nGreetings,\nI've owned my Elan II for over three years now - and I absolutely love it. It's gone through extreme elements, cluttered camera bags and dustly conditions without a single problem. I was torn between the N70 and the Elan originally - while I found the N70 to have a more \"solid\" feel, and a quieter mirror flip, I found that the interface on the Elan II (with all its dials and stuff) required less thinking and fumbling around to use (and hence allow me to focus on shooting). I haven't had any issues with its plastics being not durable enough for me - for the stuff I did, and the abuse I gave it - it works fine. My complaints? Well - the flash system is pretty lame - with my Sunpak pz4000 setup or with my 220ex (a pretty useless flash) i've seen exposures come out much worse than an N70 and its built in flash. Buying it originally with a piece of junk Tokina 28-300 lens (i'm happy with my 28-105 USM now). I wish its mirror slap and film advance were as quiet as the A2. And the BP50 doesn't have its own main dial and FE/focus point buttons! The Elan lets me shoot without thinking about using my equipment. I guess that's my two cents on why I like my Elan. My only recommendation for anybody looking to buy a canera is try whatever they are looking for out - hold it, shoot with it - and (excuse the lame qualitative term) see what \"feels\" right for you.\nGreg Martin , April 07, 2000; 09:41 P.M.\nI've had my Elan II for almost a year and a half now, and I've been very pleased with it. I've used it mostly in Texas, in very dusty conditions, and I've never had any problems with it functioning properly. I've been toying around with getting the BP-50 (the vertical grip thing) for a while, but I set CF04 for autofocus on the AE lock button, and I think the only button the grip gives me is the shutter release. Is it worth it for vertical handling?\nI recently got the 200/2.8L II, and the 1.4x and 2x extenders, and this thing seems to overpower the body (I'm almost afraid of breaking the body when I put the 200/2.8L on it). Would the grip help this, by adding weight?\nI've read here and there about underexposure problems with the Elan II. Is this widespread, or just a problem with a few bodies? I haven't noticed it much, but until recently, I shot more print film than slide film, and I seriously doubt my skill at recognising a well-exposed negative. I'm considering getting another body, in addition to this one, partly because it's nice to have two different films loaded and available, and partly because I'd like a backup. I'm thinking of either the A2 (but would rather wait for the update to the A2, if there is one), or the EOS-3. I did do the right thing, and spent my money on glass first (20/2.8 USM, 28/1.8 USM, 50/1.4 USM, 85/1.8 USM, 100/2 USM, 200/2.8L USM), and now I'd like to get a body with a spot meter which will work with the EX flashes (E-TTL), and the EOS-3 fits the bill, but it seems a bit pricey for a body. Is there going to be a replacement for the A2 any time soon?\nAt any rate, I've run hundreds of rolls through my Elan II, and am really pleased with it.\ntoan Nguyen , April 26, 2000; 04:35 P.M.\nI used to own an ElanIIE. While every positive comments above regarding this camera is true, I traded mine in for an A2 after a year. My reasons for the A2 were: 1) 3.5% spot metering vs. 9.5%; 2) 1/200 Sync speed vs 1/125; 3) 5 focusing points vs. 3 4) much much quieter film advance 5)more useful vertical grip. Don't get me wrong. I still like the ElanIIE very much. As a matter of fact, I am shopping for a used one for backup.\nSanjeevan Bala , May 02, 2000; 04:07 P.M.\nI am a complete beginner and have just purchased my first SLR after years of the point and shoot. I contemplated the following models and came up with the Elan II.\nMinolta XTSI (No Depth of Field feature) Canon Eos 5 (A2)\nI spent hours at B&H in NYC and played with the A2 and Elan II. I opted for an Elan II because:\n1) it was lighter and was smaller to hold (I have small hands) 2) As a beginner in all this I wanted a body that would allow me to grow with the camera for some time before having to invest in another body.\nI did not opt for the Elan II E since I felt the eye focus system was an overkill for me personally. I also read mixed reviews on how effective this feature really is.\nI considered the Sigma series of lenses but in the end went for the starter kit canon lens (28-80 USM). I'm hoping to take photos this week around the city and start playing with all the manual settings.\nI would also perhaps recommend the magic lantern book for the camera - as mentioned elsewhere on this site - it has good details on some of the features that the camera manual does not cover as clearly.\nEric Shen , May 04, 2000; 08:23 P.M.\nI just bought a Canon Elan IIe after using a Canon FT-QL for quite a while. What a change! I found out that I was loosing a lot of shots focusing the camera, so after much research, decided to purchase the Elan IIe. This is one great camera, it fits like a glove in my hands, and all of the controls are within my reach. Even thought I wear glasses, the eye controlled focus works really well, even after only one calibration. But there is still one thing that I have not got to work on this camera: the eye controlled Depth of Field Preview. The instruction manual says to look at the top left corner of the frame after the focusing point lights up. I do not see or hear the aperture stopping down when i do this, and I also don't see the little rectangle in the top left corner light up red. Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?\nGeorge J.Q.Zhang , May 06, 2000; 07:16 A.M.\nAs Bob Atkin mentioned about under exposure problem of EOS50E, I found that most people would notice more of this issue when shooting Velvia like I do. However, after a strict period of shooting Velvia with this body, I noticed 1/3 stop under exposure problem on other film like Elite 100 as well which I had used to test this new system. Hope this helps people who just bought or is buying into this body.\nDave Cooper , May 22, 2000; 05:08 P.M.\nEric,\nTo get the DOF preview to work, I think you must set the camera to \"one shot\" mode. Plus you have to look at the box in the corner during the first few seconds after focusing. Hope this helps.\nDave\nSamir Koirala , July 23, 2000; 03:56 P.M.\nAfter gleaning a lot of useful information from photo.net over the years, I decided to put in my two cents here. I've had an Elan IIE as my only camera for over 4 years, and have gotten to know its strengths and faults very well. First of all, its layout and handling is exemplary, perhaps one of the best of any camera ever. The controls quickly become second nature. On many occasions I have gotten a shot I might otherwise have missed because all essential controls (especially focus-point selection, AE lock, exposure compensation, and flash exposure lock with the EX series flashes) could be operated instantly with one hand without taking my eyes off the viewfinder. Second, it's durable enough for rough amateur use. Mine has gotten knocked around quite a bit during multiple trips through Nepal and through the western US. Nothing extreme, but plenty of desert heat and sand, jungle humidity, freezing weather and the occasional drizzle. Third, it's very versatile. It's a camera whose capabilities one can grow into, and which is unlikely to ever be limiting for most users. I can't think of any other camera in which you get so much for your money. I use the depth of field, bulb with remote control RC-1, and film leader out functions all the time. Only minor gripes about the Elan IIE: the evaluative meter isn't always reliable in tricky lighting, but the partial meter solves that problem. The built-in flash disappointed me often (and mysteriously died 2 years ago), but the FEL function with the 380EX gives me very precise and predictable results. The eye-control focus is a fun toy to wow friends and family, but I hardly ever use it. And that's it. Sorry about the length of this review. Hundreds of rolls of film have gone through my camera, and it has given me pictures as I envisioned them with great ease. To me that's praise enough.\nPaul Gittins , July 31, 2000; 05:22 A.M.\nExcellent reviews all round - I am glad now that I took the plunge this weekend and picked up this fine camera. Being used to an EOS300 (Rebel) and an old 1000, this is a real step forward. I got the hang of the eye control straight away (I think), and can't wait for the first chance to use the camera in anger....\nI picked it up for \u00a3240 ($400) second hand - it's the QD version, and got a 12 month warranty as well - a fair price.\nIf you are UK based, then I can't recommend MXV highly enough - http://www.mxv.co.uk/ - they are professional, friendly and very, very helpful, if something is a lemon, they will tell you - and if don't live in Sussex (myself included) then they will ship it out to you for about \u00a37 on approval...\nAnyway, back to the useful piece of information. I was thinking about splashing out on the remote control, mainly because I want to be in more of my shots and I take ages to get in place. I had picked up an Ixus in tax-free shopping a few months ago, which comes with a small remote (RC-5). I took a wild guess that Canon would only use one protocol for remote controls, and I was right - it works... handy as Canon's web site (UK, anyway) doesn't even say which remote should be used.\nThanks to all those who have fed back advice and comments on this camera, you have steered an enthusiastic amateur to spend even more money...\nTodd Phipps , August 24, 2000; 10:24 P.M.\nI just picked up a used Elan IIe with a new 28-135IS...this is a fun rig! I was originally going to buy a new Elan II but the store got a used IIe in so I got that instead. I find I like the eye-control a lot more than I thought I would, especially the DOF preview activated by looking at the little parallelogram in the corner of the screen...too cool! Now that the Elan 7 and 7e are out, there should be some good close-out deals happening on the II's...if you don't need the very latest thing, these are a killer camera.\nDerek Johnson , October 07, 2000; 11:16 A.M.\nI purchased an Elan II about two years ago now. I really liked the pictures it produced with the 28 to 80 standard lens. This may sound weird but I have had a few shots where I felt it actually over-exposed the shot. (I read all the comments about under-exposure)\nI decided to try some different lenses, first I tried the Tamron 28 to 300mm. The vingneting on this lens was so bad, I took a picture of a plane in the sky and it was aweful, totally dark in the corners and you could see a round dark halo. I also found there was lots of distortion in the corners at the wider angles. I suppose if you put the hood on ALL the time it might be ok. I took the lens back.\nI also tried the 70-200 L / 2.8, this lens takes great pictures and the optics are fantastic but who the hell wants to lug around such a tank? Unless your a professional I wouldn't recommend it, just because it's too heavy. The weight probably helps to take great free standing pictures though. The price tag was unreal also, WOW!.\nThen I tried cannons 24 to 85mm USM, I liked it. The pictures were pretty good, there was of course some distortion at the wide end 24mm but all around a useful lens for travel.\nAfter reading many many reviews of lenses, and looking at optical graphs I realized that I wanted a fixed lens. Although you give up alot in terms of quick composition and lens versitility, the pictures I have taken with the new 50 /1.4 USM have been stunning. Extremly clear and simple, so I went with this lens. I also bought a 100 to 300 USM and I am really happy with this lens also.\nAs for the Cannon Elan II body, it is my first SLR and I enjoy it a lot. I find the manual is a bit of a joke the way they describe the metering modes. It doesn't tell you much, I generally use evalutative. When there are weird shadows and bright spots (tricky metering), I switch it to partial mode and this yeilds pretty good results generally.\nI recently used my friends 380EZ flash, and it took great pictures. I have found it's not often you get back a roll and all the pictures are pretty descent, this body / lens combination seems to do the trick.\nthose are my two bits\nAllan Tan , November 02, 2000; 10:24 A.M.\nMy first SLR cmera was a Canon 5000 which I purchased many years ago. I took some pictures with it and was not very satisfied with the results, preferring the output from a P&S camera.\nMy interest was rekindled recently when I purchased a digital camera which comes with some manual controls. I played with the shutter and aperture controls and got to understand photography better.\nI went back to my old Canon 5000 and realised that the camera was very limited in its functions. I then decided to purchase another SLR and after doing extensive homework in the internet, I decided to purchase a Canon EOS 50E (instead of waiting for the EOS 30)over its Nikon equivalent (budget being an important critera).\nAfter my first few rolls of film, I was very satisfied with the prints taken with my 28 - 105 USM lens (acting on the advice of many photo.net users). These pictures were certainly better than my P&S cameras and slighter sharper than my 3.3 megapixel camera. The eye control works great and is more functional than gimmicky. The egonormics of the camera is excellent and I have nothing but praise for this camera. The weight of the camera is nicely balanced, giving you a solid feel. All the advance features are there - other than spot metering and maybe 7 point focusing. Now I go everywhere with this camera, and also my digital camera - which sports a Zeiss lens.\nI would strongly recomment this camera to any serious amateur like myself who wants to learn, explore and enjoy photography.\nAndy Grafton , December 13, 2000; 08:28 A.M.\nI've owned the Eos 50e with the QD thingummy, battery pack and 28-105 USMII lens for about 2 years. It has been knocking around Africa and Europe with me and lives in a Pelican case when not being used. I must congratulate the components on being a lot more rugged than they look and feel, because they have sustained severe abuse and keep working. In addition to the usual dust, rain, vibrations and soforth the camera has been dropped, hard, a couple of times, had a heavy oak table collapse onto it and was thrown out of a car window into a sand dune before being rolled over as the vehicle rolled down the dune (had to dig to find camera). The nett effect of this is that the housing is much worse for wear, flash mount is mangled and QD thing has stopped working (no loss). After the sand incident, the camera needed a clean and the ultrasonic motor needed replacing because we took pictures with the lens jammed full of sand. Still takes beautiful pictures, and everything works. All in all I have been pleasantly surprised. The battery pack is a godsend if (like me) you are disorganised and end up running out of batteries somewhere where the only thing available is AA zinc-carbon.\nAndy Grafton\nNick Roberts , December 29, 2000; 12:22 A.M.\nI use this camera along with several other EOS models - 5,10,100,600. It's the one I take when I only take one. It's that good. But I HATE the battery pack - to me, the handling is much worse with it fitted, and the cost of 2CR5s is now so low that there's no saving. Especially as the camera seems to use far more batteries using the pack than normal. And I've now got a rechargeable 2CR5 system to cover for emergencies.\ntammi tran , January 23, 2001; 11:40 A.M.\nI have used this camera during the past 8 months and I absolutely love it. It's lite enough to be carried anywhere. This camera with the 28-105 lens is a perfect combination. The only thing I don't like about it is the silver metal. Couple weeks ago, I also got the original Elan. This Elan is extremely quiet. It's even quieter than my husband's A2. Both the Elans are fantastic. I have heard that the new Elan 7 is even quieter. I haven't tried it out yet. Anyway, I think any one of the 3 Elans would be more than enough for a beginner. Save the money for the lenses.\nKrzysztof Jakub Dolegowski , January 28, 2001; 03:12 P.M.\nI use EOS 50E since 1998. I found it is a good camera overall but I would like to put 2 complaints about it. 1. My camera tends to underexpose in some lighting conditions, especially in low light or backlight, when using matrix metering. I use slides and sometimes I just change film speed from 100 to 64 to have better results. What a shame! 2. I use BP 50 for better handling with big lenses like 80-200L I found it very helpful. But... In my opinion, it is no good to use it with AA batteries. Every time I go out in autumn or winter my battery indicator gets crazy. When I am out, it shows no power, when I get indoors it is full. I never know if my batteries are full or empty. It is just not reliable, especially in stressfull reportage work. Now I put my lithium battery into BP 50 (you can switch an inside adaptor to make it), and have good handling and sure power!\nTravis Deane , February 28, 2001; 12:15 A.M.\nYOU CAN USE INFARED FILM The following is a quote from the EOS 50/Elan II user guide by Hove Foto Book series ISBN 1 87403 159 2 (Page 32)\n\"Your camera instruction book states that infared film cannot be used in the EOS 50/E ELAN II/E. This is because the camera's ultra-quiet film winding mechanism uses an infared system to count the spockets as the film travels through the counter. This can fog infrared film. However, the fogging is limited to the bottom 15% of the frame, an it may be much less with some films. Therefore, so long as you allow for this, you can use infrared film in your EOS 50/E - ELAN II/E.\"\nScott Weaver , May 19, 2001; 02:18 P.M.\nI've used this camera for the last 3 years on a daily basis shooting for 3 magazine publications. And a few weddings. This equipment has been subject to all environments and hasn't let me down once. It has been exposed to more than it was designed for and it continues to get the job done right. As enticing as the 1V brochure is I can't justify the added cost of this 'pro' body over the Elan 2E. Frame speed of the 1V would be the only benefit that I see. Speed is not important though in my current assignments. Excellent body and since Canon has replaced it with the 7E, the used price for the 2E I expect will remain high.\nJoel Alves , September 21, 2001; 07:37 P.M.\nCANON EOS 50e\nPro:\n* Eye DOF preview (GREAT TOOL when well used) * MLU prefire * Evaluative flash metering (E-TTL ) with high speed flash sync (via pulses, up to 1/4000) * 2nd curtain sync. * Silent work by Quiet Whisper Drive Film Transport System (more than EOS3) * Excellent price / performance ratio. * Partial metering linked to each AF sensors * ECF jobs great!! * Very good Handling with BP-50 * CF02: Film leader position after rewind (in or out) * Auto bracketing * Flash exposure lock * Flash exposure compensation\nContra:\n*AE lock and DOFP are in the same buttom...

One of the most important advancements has been the advent of affordable, photo-quality inkjet printers. They have brought the color and black and white darkroom \u201cout of the dark\u201d and into just about any room in an office, home or school. I\u2019ve been using and recommending printers to amateur and professional photographers for more than 15 years, and I\u2019ve owned or used at least 50 inkjet printers, ranging from printers that max out at 4 inches in width, to 50-inch-wide models.\nFor this two-part article, I\u2019ve put together a list of topics I often cover with my students and clients when they ask me advice on which printer to buy. Part I focuses on printers that can accept paper and other media up to 13 inches in width, and Part II will cover printers that can accept media over 13 inches wide and up to 44 inches in width. Note: when the term \u201cletter-size\u201d is used throughout the article, it means that the maximum width of paper that can be fed is 8.5 inches in width. However, unlike most laser printers, you can print much longer lengths\u2014in some cases 40 inches or more.\nMany inkjet printers allow you to print on a range of printing substrates, including canvas, watercolor and ultra-heavyweight glossy papers, and that\u2019s unmatched in the world of digital lab photo printing. Also, digital photo processes cannot match the longevity and color gamut of many inkjet paper and ink combinations. Other advantages to owning a printer are the ability to test different papers and the ability to get instant feedback, whether you make your own final portfolio or exhibition prints, or whether you send your final prints out to another company.\nI\u2019d be remiss not to state that there are thousands of photo labs across the globe that can produce continuous-tone prints on photo paper, sometimes at a price less than the combined cost of high quality inkjet ink and paper. Many companies now offer high-quality inkjet printing similar to traditional labs. With that in mind, you should ask yourself if it makes sense to buy an inkjet printer. If not, it\u2019s probably best to leave the work to others and instead spend the free time taking pictures.\nTo help illustrate my points throughout this article, I will mention specific printers that can print on paper, and in many cases other materials, up to 13 inches in width. Due to the sheer number of printers on the market, I can only mention a few, so this should not be seen as a roundup of all photo-quality printers on the market. Reading reviews and doing your own testing are the best ways to find the right printer. So with that, let\u2019s begin!\n1. Costs\nCosts to own and run a printer can add up, and with just about any printer, there are three important considerations:\ncost of the printer\ncost of the ink\ncost of the paper or other materials that you plan to put through the printer\nAlso consider the inventory costs of any materials (ink, paper, etc) that you would like to keep on a shelf. Costs can range from free with the purchase of a computer (printers are a popular \u201cbundled\u201d item), to about $850 for a higher-end pigment ink printer like the 13-inch-wide Epson Stylus Photo R3000 , ( compare prices ). I will go into more detail about ink costs in Number 6 below because it is a very important part of the overall costs of running any printer.\n2. Warranties and Customer Service\nEvery company has different warranties and different ways of supporting their printers. I would look for printers with a one year parts and labor warranty (including free door-to-door shipping and return of the broken printer), which is common. If you think you\u2019ll need phone or e-mail support, you can post questions on forums like Photo.net prior to your purchase to get people\u2019s opinions of how their customer support issues were handled by specific companies. Depending on the cost of the printer and how much you plan to use the printer, you might consider an extended manufacturer warranty or third-party warranty offered by the retailer or another company. Some photo-quality printers (especially 8.5\u00d711-inch models) cost about the same as a full set of inks. If that\u2019s the case, it probably would not make sense to pay for a warranty.\n3. Print Quality and Print Speed\nCanon9500mark2\nFinding the right balance between print quality and speed is important when selecting a printer. If a photo-quality 8\u00d710-inch print takes 10-15 minutes to print, that will put a big damper on productivity. Fortunately, there has been a lot of competition between manufacturers, resulting in significantly faster print speeds than in the past, while still retaining outstanding print quality. My recommendation is to ignore the \u201c10 pages per minute\u201d ad copy and instead focus on the print speeds that produce photo-quality output.\nepsonR2880\nThough you may be tempted to judge printers against each other by looking at their print speeds at their best print quality settings, it makes sense to judge them based on the highest speeds possible that produce the quality you need. For example, the 13-inch-wide Canon Pixma Pro9500 MkII , ( compare prices ) and the 13-inch-wide Epson Stylus Photo R2880 , ( compare prices ) (both pigment ink printers) make outstanding photo-quality prints at quality settings lower than their highest settings. That can really make a difference, sometimes shaving the printing time in half or a quarter while preserving image quality.\nEpsonRollR1900\nThe highest quality setting is sometimes necessary to eliminate visible dots (especially when printing on glossy or semi-gloss papers). An example of this is the Epson Stylus Photo R1900 , ( compare prices ). I recommend using the highest quality setting with this printer. Even so, a 13\u00d719 print at the highest quality setting will only take about five minutes to print.\nSome printers also have a \u201cHigh Speed\u201d checkbox (faster print speeds) or a \u201cMore Passes\u201d check box (slower print speeds). Experiment by printing a test image to see how much these options add to the overall quality vs. how they impact overall speed.\nMany print drivers have a \u201chigh speed\u201d checkbox, as shown in this screen shot of the Epson 1400 Mac OSX driver.\nA few helpful links:\nDownload a zip file containing an excellent group of test images that fits on a letter-size sheet: drycreekphoto.com/tools/test_images/DCP-TestImage-Small.zip\nVisit a page with a smaller file (about 4 inches by 4 inches) containing a group of test images that will allow you to print at least four-up on a letter-size sheet: andrewdarlow.com/calib/ctest_adobergb.jpg . (To download it, just drag it to your desktop or right click and save it to your computer. If the print quality meets your needs at a faster setting, choose the faster option.)\nThe time savings can really add up when you are printing multiple 13\u00d719-inch prints. If a pigment-based inkset is not critical, the 13-inch wide Canon Pixma Pro9000 MkII , ( compare prices ), is a speed demon. Expect vibrant, photo-quality 13\u00d719 prints to be ready in under three minutes at Standard Quality and in about five minutes at High Quality (its highest setting).\n4. Pigment vs. Dye ink (and Print Permanence in general)\nThe question of whether one should buy a pigment- or dye-based inkjet printer is one of the most important decisions to make in one\u2019s quest for an ideal printer. In the past, inkjet printers that used dye-based inks had a clear advantage in overall color gamut (number of colors that can be printed on a specific paper or other material) and in \u201csmoothness\u201d with regard to the way the ink sat on the paper surface (especially with glossy or semi-gloss papers). However, things have changed, and many of today\u2019s high-end pigment-ink-based inkjet printers produce smooth prints rivaling any dye-based printer. Many pigment-based printers also have a very large color gamut, with excellent waterfastness and very good longevity when paired with a wide range of glossy and matte papers. The primary negative features of most dye-based printers were, and still are in many cases, the following: a faster overall rate of print fading compared with pigment inks, a color shift on some papers after a few hours or days (especially when compared with pigment inks), or a color and/or density shift when prints are exposed to ozone or pollutants in the air. Dye-based prints also tend to run or smudge more than pigment-based inks when they come in contact with moisture, but new ink and paper formulations are proving to be resistant to water.\nImprovements in ink technology as well as clear \u201cgloss optimizers\u201d or \u201cgloss equalizers\u201d on printers like the 13-inch-wide Epson Stylus Photo R1900 , ( compare prices ) and the Kodak ESP line of single- and multi-function printers have reduced the gloss differential and bronzing issues that were common with many pigment-based printers. Gloss differential is an uneven look across the surface of a print (especially around areas such as people\u2019s heads), and is most often seen in dark and light areas of pigment-based prints on glossy papers. Bronzing is an effect that makes medium to dark tones look bronze in color when viewed at certain angles, and it\u2019s most often seen on glossy or semi-gloss papers. One advantage I still see with some dye-based printers is that their print heads tend to clog less, reducing the frequency of print head cleanings. In general, I prefer pigment-based ink printers for my own work because of the strengths listed above, but it\u2019s important to find the product that\u2019s right for you based on your needs.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the combination of a printer\u2019s inks and paper (or other material) are what determine the overall look and feel, as well as the waterfastness and potential longevity of a specific print. There are some great (and free) sources for getting a sense of how different papers fare when matched with specific printers. At the top of my list are the following two websites: wilhelm-research.com and Aardenburg-Imaging.com . Both offer a wealth of data, and Wilhelm-research.com also includes the following data points for its paper and ink tests: \u201cResistance to High Humidity\u201d and \u201cResistance to Water.\u201d Different companies will state that their printer and ink combinations will last a certain number of years before fading, but every company tends to use a different set of criteria when presenting those numbers. Referring to the information in the websites above helps to cut through the haze by allowing you to compare between printer and ink combinations that have been tested under the same conditions.\nInkjetBronzing\nCanon, Epson and Kodak are three manufacturers currently producing most of the photo-quality pigment-based 8.5- and 13-inch-wide printers on the market. HP produces a large number of high quality dye-based printers, as well as some that combine pigment and dye-based inks, including the 13-inch-wide HP Photosmart B8550 Printer , ( compare prices ). Epson\u2019s Claria inkset is one example of a dye-based product that in many ways performs more like a pigment ink than a traditional dye-based ink. Similarly, Brother\u2019s Innobella dye-based inks have tested very well by Wilhelm-research.com , with estimated longevity on specific papers exceeding 100 years when displayed under glass or UV acrylic. Another important item to note is in almost all cases, dye-based inks will print better on uncoated papers not specially coated for inkjet printing. That makes them ideal for notecards, bookmarks and similar products, which can be a profitable niche for photographers. There are many scored blank greeting cards available on the market for prices considerably less than inkjet-compatible cards. That being said, it will be much easier to match the color and contrast you see on your screen if you use inkjet-compatible cards and paper. A few of the sources I\u2019ve used and recommend for inkjet-compatible notecards are Moab Paper , Museo Fine Art and Red River Paper .\nOn the topic of Claria dye-based inks, Epson printers that use Claria inks have received excellent water-resistance and estimated permanence ratings by wilhelm-research.com (80-100+ years before noticeable fading or color shift) when paired with various paper types and when protected by glass or UV acrylic. Here\u2019s a tip for getting even more from the published results on both Wilhem-research.com and Aardenburg-imaging.com : even if your exact printer model is not listed, if you can find a printer that uses the same inkset, you can expect similar results. For example, you can see estimated permanence data for most Claria ink printers by searching for the Epson Stylus Photo 1400 Claria ink printer on Wilhelm-research.com, or visit this link to display the results: wilhelm-research.com/epson/SP1400.html . The Kodak ESP line of pigment ink printers is another good example. Kodak frequently updates that line of printers, but the inks have stayed consistent for most, if not all of the ESP printers. A few Kodak ESP printers are also rated on Wilhelm-research.com .\nPAGE 1 | 2 | Next >>\nAbout the Author\nAndrew Darlow is a photographer, author and digital imaging consultant based in the New York City area.

This <em>should</em> be especially true <em>for</em> photographers who have <em>a</em> 7D or above.", "explanation": null, "document": "Dual DIGIC 5+ processors\nFirst Impressions\nMy initial thought when holding the 1D X was that it felt really great. To me, Canon has always been better at ergonomics than their competitors and this camera improves on that mark. All of the buttons are right where I want them and there is a naturalness to how the camera seems to operate in hand. This should be especially true for photographers who have a 7D or above.\nThe images that I took in the camera looked brilliant but because this was a pre-production behind the scenes kinda thing there are no image files to be shared. No biggie. You'll see plenty of those when the camera gets closer to release and I'm willing to bet that all of you pixel peepers will be plenty amazed enough. Low light and high ISO images were luscious. This camera is fast. It responds fast. The auto focus seemed fast. Speed shooters will be happy with what Canon has done here.\n18MP?\nThere are tons of spec pages and press releases online where you can get to the hyper technical stuff about this camera but I wanted to go over some of the things that Canon has done with the EOS-1D X that some photographers might gloss over when looking at those technical specs. It's the little things that count sometimes.\nThe first thing, and really not that little at all, is the 18MP spec. Is Canon throwing down the gauntlet in the megapixel race? I believe they are and I think that their work here is saying that photographers will be able to recognize that more megapixels doesn't mean a better camera. Bigger megapixels and faster processing does.\nThis is a three step move. Less megapixels, bigger megapixels, and faster processing equal better low light performance with little compromise on speed.\nThey're able to do this by using better circuitry in the camera to create a cleaner signal before the image hits the processors. Chuck got really technical and excited when he went over this. This is a pretty big advancement that means Canon is able to push the speed up while not creating more noise.\nBasically, Canon went after higher image quality with high speed. Sports shooters who recently made the switch from Canon to Nikon may soon regret that move.\nImproved Menu System\nWhen it comes to user interface Canon has kept a familiar menu system for a seamless move for their photographers but, of course, have added a few changes that will likely be welcome amongst said photographers.\nThe menu system has a new built in \"user manual\" type of sub-folder system that has explanations of some of the various new functions. Much better than carrying around a user manual in your bag. I didn't ask Chuck but I'm really hoping to see this implemented further down Canon's lineup.\nOne of the coolest menu/button changes was the \"q\" button which activates a quick menu (seen in the above photo) on the back LCD that basically shows the same information you'd find on the top display. This is a small but handy feature for photographers using tripods and monopods where their camera is set a little high and they may not have easy access to the top display. It makes navigating and changing the most important and most used settings fast and simple.\nOther Improvements\nAnother good change is the implementation of a dual compact flash card system. I never really understood why Canon had a CF and an SD card slot for redundancy but I know several people who will be happy with dual CF card slots. I think most pros prefer CF cards to SD cards because they are physically bigger, they are faster, and tougher.\nFor the video photographers Canon has implemented new HD video formats and compression. Lot's of technical stuff going on here but the thing to note is that you're supposed to be able to get just under 30 minutes of video recording and the bigger sensor should translate to better quality video.\nConclusions\nThere's so much more to this camera than I was able to wrap my head around in 20 minutes of playing and conversation and we'll all have to wait for the camera to get released and we get some more reviews out before we can make a full conclusion.\nI did walk away with the sense that Canon did a great job of combining speed, image quality, and a highly customizable menu system. This allows the Canon EOS-1D X to respond to the way that photographers think, acting as a more natural extension of the photographer's eye, brain, and vision.\nThe Canon EOS-1D X Digital SLR camera is scheduled for March 2012 availability and will be sold in a body-only configuration at an estimated retail price of $6,800.00\nTagged with:\n"}, {"score": 245.18396, "uuid": "cc216789-dc40-5a64-aff2-8e4e9d66d626", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1604wb-49-16856", "target_hostname": "www.slrgear.com", "target_uri": "http://www.slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/176/cat/30", "page_rank": 1.1749033e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Sigma Lens: Primes - Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM", "snippet": "Basically <em>a</em> good general purpose fast lens (which can also be used <em>for</em> <em>portrait</em> but <em>for</em> this <em>I</em> usually <em>prefer</em> the 50 1.4).

The current copy has served me now for a year or more, and has served me well, once I learned the lens and that took some time.\nLet's begin with the contruction of the lens. I like the included lens hood, the basic solid contruction of the lens, focus distance window (though would like to have 3m or 4m marked between 2m and infinity and a IR focus spot), metal mount and focus ring. What is not good, in my copy of the lens, is the ugly sound it makes when focusing when tilted about 20 or more degrees up or down. When the lens is level, focusing is silent.\nAbout focusing - this lens can be problematic, especially if your camera has as bad AF-system as for example Canon 350d (Rebel XT) has. I do actually have this camera and this copy of the lens focuses quite a bit better than what I would expect, pretty much every picture is in focus. Lucky me, I didn't even have to send the lens+camera for calibration.\nImage quality:\nI'll begin with field curvature. This lens has plenty of it - the edges are focused closer than the center, quite a bit closer, so if you plan to take group pictures, you may need to stop down a bit more than you'd like to. This also contributes somewhat to the test results you'll find in the net - shooting a test chart at close distance will produce worse results than shooting real life objects. The field curvature does provide an advantage too: focus and recompose works really well with this lens!\nSharpness is stunning in the center area (maybe 85% of the image) even wide open. Contrast is good wide open. At f2 contrast turns excellent and sharpness improves slightly in the center (not much room there for improvement, at least using 8M pixel camera). Stopping down more doesn't really do much to center sharpness or contrast, at least not on a 350d, except beyond f11 when sharpness starts going down, though remaining perfectly usable even at the minimum aperture of f16.\nEdge and corner sharpness has always been a matter of controversy with the Sigma 30. Pixel peepers complain how the corners never get as sharp as the center, while actual photographers seem to enjoy shooting with the lens regardless. What is the truth? I will tell you\nFirst of all, there is the issue of field curvature I mentioned earlier. Second, I simply do not understand what is so important in the corners of the image when one is shooting wide open? Is one shooting landscapes at f1.4? The areas where interest lies in the images are sharp with this lens wide open. The corners at f1.4? Yes, they stink, and are absolutely useless, but really, who cares?\nAnyhow, corners do get better at smaller apertures. Now, there is one more thing about the edges and corners - at close to medium distances they are far better than near the horizon for example. In my opinion, this is not a big deal, as when I shoot landscape, the corners either have some foreground object, or clouds/sky, in either case the lens performs well at approperiate apertures - something like f9 to f10 seems to be the optimum for landscape shooting. The only minor problem is. that even with small apertures, the extreme left and right edge do remain rather average at long distance, perfectly all right, but not great like the center area.\nBarrell distortion is rather heavy for a prime, though it seems to vary vis-\u00e0-vis focusing distance - the closer you focus, the more barrell distortion you should expect. In my landscape shots I've not seen any distortions ever, not once, but occasionally shooting something much closer does induce quite a bit of this flaw. Pixel peepers may find shooting brick walls to be another rewarding source of complaint about this lens.\nFlare is very well under control, especially considering that it is a f1.4 lens, even in contra light situations. Sun in the image should not be a problem.\nChromatic aberrations are something you need to take care in post processing as you will lose some sharpness otherwise. Both red/cyan and blue/yellow may need fixing in post processing.\nBokeh - usually smooth and creamy, even at medium apertures. However, some kind of backgrounds, like patch of leaves against the sky, may cause non-pleasing triangular highlights. Usually not a problem, but some might find it irritating - I am sure there are plenty of examples of this in the net for you to see.\nVignetting, according to all the test sites, is heavy, though I've not found this to be the case in real life phography. There is some vignetting at the wider apertures, but nothing really worry about.\nIn summary, Sigma 30/1.4 is a rewarding lens, a great tool for a photographer who is interested in a lens that functions well in practical circumstances, in the field. It has it's own character which should be understood - understading the basics of photography does the trick: when shooting landscapes, you use a small aperture, when shooting people, a larger ones. Pixel peepers will find the fluffy clouds in the corners to be hopelessly soft when they shoot landscapes at f1.4, but no photographer will notice this and this lens is built for the real photographers.\nlextalionis\n"}, {"score": 245.08272, "uuid": "be1db792-2e4e-5e5e-9184-750158785ace", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1604wb-49-16855", "target_hostname": "www.slrgear.com", "target_uri": "http://www.slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/176", "page_rank": 1.2302676e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Sigma Lens: Primes - Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM", "snippet": "Basically <em>a</em> good general purpose fast lens (which can also be used <em>for</em> <em>portrait</em> but <em>for</em> this <em>I</em> usually <em>prefer</em> the 50 1.4).

You often see posts online from people agonizing over whether they should buy the Canon 30D or the Nikon D200 or the Sony Alpha or whatever, but I think they\u0092re missing the point.

(Sony support the lens format developed by Minolta for their film cameras) Nikon have dropped nearly all their film-related cameras and products. Of course, you can still buy tons of incredibly good second hand Nikon cameras and lenses, so this may not be a huge issue for the time being.\nDo you want to be able to use both manual-focus and autofocus lenses on the same camera? If so, many modern Nikon cameras (though not their cheaper models) fit the bill. Canon\u0092s old manual-focus system (eg: the FD-mount series of cameras) is not compatible with its autofocus system (the EOS series of cameras).\nDo you want to buy affordable fast and quiet lenses with ultrasonic motors or image stabilization? If so, Canon is your better choice. Nikon sell lenses containing such technology but only really expensive ones. Sony take a different approach and include image stabilization in the camera body rather than the lens.\nDo you have specialized requirements such as the need for interchangeable finders or fully compatible macro bellows or high-capacity film backs? If so, older Nikon cameras are probably a better choice.\nDo you want a really lightweight camera? Canon\u0092s low-end SLR gear is some of the lightest around.\nDo you have a good friend or relative with lots of camera equipment? If so, and they\u0092re willing to lend you it from time to time, you should probably get the same system that they use. They can also be a valuable resource when you have questions and problems.\nDo you want to start out with cheaper products and slowly build up the system with time? If so, Canon\u0092s a good choice since they sell cheap, midrange and expensive gear that\u0092s all compatible.\nDo you want to be able to rent professional-level equipment from a pro store on occasion? If so, Canon and Nikon are your best choices. I\u2019ve never heard of a store renting out gear made by Sony, Pentax, Olympus, and other smaller players in the SLR market.\nAnd of course there are many other things to consider. If you\u0092re interested to know some of the reasons that I personally chose the Canon EOS system, have a look at my article on the topic.\nReally, though, it comes down to personal choice. Make a list of the type of features you need to suit your photographic requirements and work out a basic budget. Go to a camera store. Check out the various cameras and lenses that fit that budget and decide if they feel right for you. Play with the camera controls - do they make sense to you? Does the camera grip feel comfortable? Does the maker offer the equipment you want at prices you can afford?\nWhat does \u0093EOS\u0094 mean?\nCanon\u0092s line of autofocus-capable SLR cameras is sold under the name EOS. This stands for \u0093electro-optical system\u0094 but is also meant to be a reference to Eos, a Greek goddess of the dawn. Some people pronounce it like the goddess (ee-oss) and others as separate letters (ee-oh-ess).\nNote also that the company itself is Canon with one N - not with two Ns, like the weapon. In its very early days the firm was named Kwanon, after an older spelling of the Buddhist goddess of mercy Kannon or Guanyin. However the company soon changed to Canon (a general law or principle).\nWhat does \u0093EF\u0094 mean?\nLenses built by Canon for use with their EOS series of cameras are technically known as EF-series lenses. This acronym stands for \u0093electrofocus.\u0094 Older Canon lenses which are not marked EF, such as FD and FL series lenses, are not compatible with EOS cameras.\nCompatibility is very straightforward - if it\u0092s an EOS camera then an EF lens will fit. However, there is one complication. In 2004 Canon introduced a new EF lens mount variant for certain digital EOS cameras only. This variant is known as EF-S . An EF-S mount camera can accept both EF and EF-S lenses, but all other EOS cameras take only EF lenses. Newer consumer and midrange EOS digital cameras can use both EF and EF-S lenses.\nThere are four other minor points of note here. Mainly of interest to completists, but there we go.\nFirst, Canon sell expensive specialized TS-E and MP-E lenses which, while technically not EF lenses since they lack autofocus motors, are nonetheless designed for EOS cameras.\nSecond, while Canon autofocussing lenses are technically known as EF you will sometimes see them referred to as \u0093Canon autofocus\u0094 lenses. Third-party lensmakers may or may not use the EF specification - they might simply refer to their lenses as being \u0093For Canon EOS\u0094 or \u0093Canon autofocus compatible.\u0094\nThird, Canon briefly sold a camera with an EF lens mount which lacked autofocus circuitry. This camera, the EF-M, could accept all EF lenses but you had to focus them manually.\nFinally, just to confuse things further, in 1973 Canon released a manual-focus camera which was called the Canon EF. It predates the EOS system by 14 years and it cannot use EF lenses.\nWhat does \u0093SLR\u0094 mean?\nAll Canon EOS cameras are SLRs, which stands for \u0093single lens reflex.\u0094 Very simply an SLR is a camera in which there is only one lens, which is used for both picture-taking and viewfinding. When you peer through the viewfinder at the back of the camera you\u0092re looking directly through the main picture-taking lens, so you can see pretty well exactly what\u0092s going to be in the final picture. There isn\u0092t a separate viewfinder lens on the front of the camera like on a point and shoot camera.\nThe word \u0093reflex\u0094 in there refers to a mirror used to reflect light from the lens up into the viewfinder. SLRs also have glass pentaprisms or pentamirrors on the top, which explains the protruding section on top of the camera.\nWhat is the history of EOS cameras?\nWhile today Canon and Nikon are considered the big two Japanese 35mm SLR manufacturers, and thus the world, this was by no means always the case. German camera makers dominated the global camera market for the first half of the previous century, with many local players selling products successfully in generally less prestigious markets. Then, in the 1950s, Nikon became the 35mm frontrunner with a host of smaller firms - Pentax, Minolta, Canon, Olympus, Miranda, Ricoh, etc - following on behind. Canon made some breakthroughs with their F1 and A1 cameras in the 1970s, but by the 1980s they were definitely lagging and Minolta (now sadly gone from the camera market) were making considerable inroads.\nCanon\u0092s first step to pull itself ahead in the SLR market came with 1986\u0092s innovative T90 , a manual-focus camera designed in collaboration with the noted German industrial designer Luigi Colani. The T90\u0092s curved organic shape, heavy reliance upon computer automation and intuitive user interface set the direction for the entire Japanese SLR industry for the next 10-15 years.\nThe company realized, however, that the future of photography lay in autofocus. Their early experiments - such as the T80, which shipped with somewhat clumsy autofocus lenses adapted to the FD manual-focus lens mount - weren\u0092t particularly successful, so Canon took the risky and unusual step of abandoning their FD mount altogether. In 1987 they released the first cameras and lenses of the EOS system.\nEOS cameras were utterly incompatible with Canon\u0092s previous products; a move which obviously alienated legions of Canon FD owners. The risk was calculated, however. EOS cameras with their EF lenses did not rely on any mechanical linkages between body and lens. Unlike all other camera makers Canon chose to house both the autofocus motor and the aperture diaphragm motor in the lens barrel itself.\nThis gamble paid off when Canon were the first maker to release lenses containing fast and silent focussing ultrasonic autofocus motors. Canon\u0092s comprehensive line of USM lenses, along with the professional-quality EOS 1 and 1N camera bodies, helped Canon firmly establish themselves as a strong favourite of professionals. Massive sales of their low-end EOS cameras also allowed the company to enter markets in which Nikon, with a traditional emphasis on mid to high-end cameras, could not compete.\nThe EOS lineup branched out to encompass digital image sensors in the mid 1990s. First Canon teamed up with Kodak to release a number of EOS 1 series pro bodies combined with large digital add-on gear. Then, in October 2000 Canon introduced the D30, its first fully homegrown digital SLR camera. Canon now sell a wide range of digital EOS SLRs, covering the familiar consumer/advanced amateur/pro ranges, and are the largest DSLR maker in the world, with Nikon very close behind.\nWhat is 35mm film?\nMost Canon EOS film cameras were built around 35mm film, which is photographic roll film exactly 35mm (about 1.4 inches) in width. The film is punched with sprocket holes on either side, so the useable image area of 35mm film is 24mm by 36mm in size.* The film is wound onto spools and the spools sealed up inside metal (occasionally plastic) lightproof canisters. Typically there are either 24 or 36 fullsize still frames (pictures) on a roll of 35mm film.\n35mm film, occasionally referred to as 135 film after the original Kodak product code number, is really the only major film format commonly used today for still photography. It\u0092s considered a small format since the negatives are fairly small in size. Other formats seen in years gone by include APS (a moribund consumer film format - see below), 110 (now-obsolete Instamatic film cartridges popular in the 1970s), medium format (6 cm wide film used by portrait and landscape photographers; the second-most popular format to 35mm today) and large format (big sheets of film in varying sizes, used by some artists).\n* Technical note - the 24mm x 36mm area assumes three things. First, that the useable width of the film excludes the sprocket hole area. Second, that you\u0092re using a 2:3 aspect ratio of height to width. And third, that the width of the film is used for the shorter of the two dimensions. Basically every 35mm film camera sold today uses this image area standard defined by the original Leica cameras of the 1930s, though in the past cameras were made which used smaller film areas by using the width of the film for the longer of the two dimensions. Such \u0093halfsize\u0094 film cameras, including the Olympus Pen and Canon Demi, were around mainly in the 1960s and could pack twice as many photos onto a roll, albeit at lower image quality. And in fact motion picture cameras, which first used the 35mm film standard, actually use what is considered a \u0093halfsize\u0094 frame format by still photo standards. But enough trivia.\nShould I get an APS film camera?\nOnly if you\u2019re an antique collector.\nAPS - Advanced Photo System - will probably be the last film format ever invented. It was released in 1996 by Kodak and a consortium of major manufacturers, including Fuji, Agfa, Konica, Nikon, Canon, Minolta and Pentax. It packed a number of technological advancements, such as the ability to record shooting data to film using a magnetic recording layer on the film surface. More importantly, the cartridges were slightly smaller than 35mm canisters, thus permitting the creation of tiny and cute little cameras. The system was also designed to be as idiot-proof as possible, with simple drop-in film loading. APS cartridges were fully sealed and the film was never removed all the way, so users never handled the negatives.\nUnfortunately, APS was doomed from the start because of its inherent weaknesses. First, the size of its negatives was smaller than that of 35mm film. Thus the image quality was, all things being equal, lower. If you were making small (4\"x6\" or so) prints then this difference didn\u0092t much matter. But what if you get that amazing photo that you want to enlarge? If you shot it with APS then it\u0092d look rather grainy blown up, which would be really disappointing. Second, it cost more to process and print APS film than 35mm film. So you paid more for lower quality - not much of a win. And third, APS sales were soon to be completely wiped out by digital.\nThis question is relevant to an EOS FAQ because, in addition to a number of currently available APS point and shoot cameras, Canon also made two EOS cameras which could use APS film - the EOS IX (and the ECF-equipped IX E in Japan) and the less expensive EOS IX 7 (international) / IX Lite (North America) / IX 50 (Japan). By all accounts they were quite decent APS cameras and were fully compatible with all EOS lenses and accessories. Note, however, that you do get a focal length multiplier effect when you use EOS lenses with these APS cameras.\nShould I buy a film camera or a digital camera?\nWhen I first wrote this FAQ back in 2001-2002, film had not yet been dealt the crushing body blow from digital that it has now received. But now, in 2010, it\u2019s pretty clear that film is dead as a viable imaging medium for most purposes. That may make a lot of film lovers deeply unhappy, but it\u2019s basically pretty unassailable.\nNow, obviously film isn't going to disappear utterly. Just as vinyl records are still used for specialized purposes today (namely DJing), film isn\u0092t going to vanish off the face of the Earth. However it will become increasingly expensive and uncommon and eventually only some artists and hobbyists will continue to use the antique chemical processes. For many years the massive amounts of consumer film processing have subsidized professional and artistic use, but with the former gone the latter is basically economically unviable.\nIt\u2019s a shame, as there was a certain magic in the ritual of shooting film and getting it processed and printed. Slides always looked so beautiful. But digital is cheaper, offers higher quality in most cases, and is vastly more convenient. So we\u2019ve reached the end of an era.\nCost.\nFilm has low startup costs (film cameras are dirt cheap these days) but high consumable costs (developing and printing film is increasingly expensive). By contrast digital has high startup costs (digital SLRs with interchangeable lenses cost much more than good film cameras, plus you really need to buy a decent personal computer if you haven\u0092t got one already) and lower consumable costs (if you don\u0092t print your pictures you only need to buy storage media, and you can selectively print out only the photos you want).\nQuality.\nFilm has long been superior to digital, but this is no longer necessarily the case. High quality digital cameras can produce sharp grainless images that exceed shots taken with 35mm film. Purists will sniff and say that digital film has an artificial look that film lacks, just as LP aficionados dislike CDs for the same reason. But for most of us digital has reached the point where we can\u0092t tell the difference. Sure, medium format film still looks great, but who can afford to use it these days?\nConvenience.\nDigital wins this hands down in most cases. Digital cameras have preview screens so you can have a rough idea of whether or not your picture turned out a second after you\u0092ve taken it. Digital images are available immediately - there\u0092s no need to take the film to a lab. Digital images can be emailed around the world or put onto a Web page in seconds, without the need for scanning. Naughty home photos can be taken without the embarrassment of lab technicians looking at your stuff and posting them to the Internet. And so on.\nFreedom and experimentation.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of digital is the sense of freedom it can give to photography. Shooting in digital is essentially free once you\u0092ve bought the camera, and large-capacity memory cards capable of storing hundreds of shots are readily available. So you can just go out there and shoot shoot shoot, trying every new thing that strikes your fancy, without worrying about developing costs or having to carry dozens of rolls of film with you.\nSome may argue that this leads to a certain sloppiness - photographers had to be incredibly careful about what pictures they took when taking a photo meant exposing a huge glass plate or a frame of a roll of 6 exposure film that cost a typical month\u0092s salary. Which is true, but nobody\u0092s arguing that digital is the ideal medium for slow, carefully-composed landscape shots here. The requirements for, say, candid photography are quite different.\nSpecialized issues.\nThere are many other complex issues which may or may not factor into your decision making. For example, most affordable digital cameras today have image chips smaller than the image area of 35mm film. This means that wide-angle lenses behave like less wide lenses, which could be a problem if you do a lot of wide angle photography and haven\u2019t invested in EF-S type lenses. On longer trips, digital cameras require more support infrastructure than you might initially think. You need power to recharge batteries, you need to carry portable laptop computers or picture wallets, etc, which can be a problem when travelling, especially in more remote regions. A traditional all-mechanical film camera might still be usable even without battery power.\nWhy aren\u0092t cameras and lenses from different manufacturers interchangeable?\nEach camera maker wants to lock you into their system. They don\u0092t want to see sales lost to people buying other makers\u0092 products. So they design their own lens mount systems which other makers don\u0092t or can\u0092t use. This also lets the manufacturer unilaterally alter the lens mount design to add new features without the need to consult with a committee or other makers.\nThis is why a Nikon F lens cannot fit a Canon EOS camera. And why a Pentax K lens can\u0092t fit a Sony SLR camera body. Of course, some third party makers build lenses which fit different camera systems, but they do so only by producing different versions of each lens for each camera system.\nIn the 1960s and 70s many makers used 42mm screwmount lenses of the type popularized by the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic camera. Back then lenses lacked complex computerized autofocus systems and the like, so it was comparatively easy to make them. That\u0092s probably the closest the world has ever come to a universal lens mount system. Interestingly, the dream of a universal lens mount is not completely dead - in 2002 Olympus and Kodak collaborated on the creation of a new standard for interchangeable lens digital cameras, which they call Four Thirds. So far Olympus, Kodak, Fuji, Panasonic, Leica, Sanyo and Sigma have agreed to make and sell products which adhere to this standard. Notably absent from this list are Canon, Nikon, Pentax and Sony.\nNow, naturally things aren\u0092t quite as cut and dried as all that, since lens adapters do exist. Such adapters are machined metal rings which allow lenses for one camera system to fit onto a body of another camera system. Unfortunately such adapters only permit non-EF lenses to be physically attached to EOS bodies - they don\u0092t let autofocus and auto-aperture mechanisms work, for example. For more information on these and other drawbacks of lens adapters please consult my article on the subject .\nI have an EOS film camera and accessories. Can I use this stuff with an EOS digital camera?\nThat depends. Most things will work, some things won\u0092t, and some things will work but in a slightly different fashion.\nLenses.\nAll Canon EF lenses will work with any Canon EOS digital camera. However, if you have an EOS digital camera with a subframe image sensor (ie: its image sensor is smaller than a frame of 35mm film) then pictures you take with that camera and lens will look cropped compared to the pictures you take with the same lens on a film camera body. For details have a look at the section on the cropping factor.\nIt\u0092s hit and miss whether your non-Canon ( third party ) EF lenses will work with your EOS digital camera, however. For example, older Sigma lenses will not work on newer EOS film or digital camera bodies, even though they work fine on older EOS film bodies. This is because their electronics are not compatible. Most Tokina and Tamron lenses should be fine, but there\u0092s no guarantee.\nFlash.\nAll Canon Speedlite flash units of the EX variety (eg: 430EX II, 380EX) will work fine with an EOS digital camera. However, if the flash unit\u0092s name ends with EZ or E then it will not work in a useful fashion on an EOS digital camera since it will not meter automatically. Third party flash units are a toss-up. Most are TTL only and thus won\u2019t work on an EOS digital camera. However, if your third party flash supports E-TTL flash metering then it should work, but again there are no guarantees.\nFilters.\nFilters can be used if they fit the lens in question. If the filter is too big for your lens you can adapt it using a step-up ring to make it fit. But if the filter is too small then obviously it isn\u0092t going to be of much use on a larger lens.\nMiscellaneous accessories.\nSome accessories will work and some won\u0092t. For example, let\u0092s say you have an RS60-E3 shutter release for your EOS 50 camera. It\u0092ll work fine on your EOS 550D camera since they use the same connectors. The Off-Camera Shoe Cord (OCSC) is another compatible accessory and will work fine with a digital camera, letting you attach a flash unit to your camera.\nOther accessories won\u0092t be compatible. For example, if you have an RS-60T3 switch for your old EOS RT camera it won\u0092t work on any modern EOS film or digital camera since the T3 connector is no longer used by Canon. Another accessory that won\u0092t work is the TTL Hot Shoe Adapter 3, since it requires TTL flash and EOS digital cameras support only E-TTL flash.\nI have a non-EOS digital camera. Can I use its accessories with an EOS digital camera?\nAs above, that depends. Only it depends more. Some things may be interchangeable; many things may not.\nMemory cards.\nEOS cameras use either CompactFlash (CF) or Secure Digital (SD) cards, depending on the model. A few models can use both. So if your old digital camera uses cards that match the new camera you\u0092re all set. All other cards - Memory Stick, SmartMedia, and so on - will not be usable on an EOS camera.\nLenses.\nLenses are probably not interchangeable. At best you may be able to adapt the lens for another camera through the use of an adapter ring, but if you did so you would lose autofocus focus abilities. This sort of lens adapting is possible, for example, with Nikon F lenses, is awkward for Pentax K lenses, and impossible for Four Thirds lenses. So it depends. For more information on adapting lenses to EOS cameras, take a look at my article on the subject .\nFilters.\nSame as in the previous section - if they\u0092ll fit then they\u0092ll work.\nMiscellaneous accessories.\nAgain, it all depends. A simple USB A to mini B cable is going to work with any digital EOS camera that uses standard USB, but a proprietary data cable (such as the ones Nikon build for their cameras which use Nikon-specific connectors) will not be useful. Some Pentax cameras use the same type of 2.5mm connector for wired remote shutter release cables as low-end EOS cameras. And so on. Generally it\u0092s best to assume that most accessories won\u0092t work. But there\u0092s only one way to find out, and that\u0092s to try them!\nWhich is a better investment? A camera or a lens?\nFrankly, neither. To me, cameras and lenses and other photographic equipment are tools to accomplish a job: that of taking great photographs. And Canon EOS gear is just commodity equipment - albeit pretty good commodity equipment - to that end. It\u0092s not like buying classic Leica camera gear or other stuff sold these days in the collectors\u0092 marketplace as if they were paintings or stamps.\nHaving said that, it\u0092s clear today that lenses are your best bet for useful EOS photographic equipment which holds up its monetary value over time. Film camera bodies have plunged in price now that digital rules the world. A top of the line film camera, worth as much as a good personal computer just a few years ago, is now traded on the used market for the cost of a good point and shoot.\nCamera body pricing has had to change economic paradigms. Digital cameras now follow the computer equipment model in depreciating rapidly the moment they\u0092re purchased. But EOS lenses continue to be resold at decent prices. An L class lens isn\u0092t going to be worth more today than when it was bought, but neither will it plunge rapidly in value if it\u0092s in decent condition.\nSo, given this fact of the new digital economy, if you\u0092re concerned about money you\u0092re best off buying an expensive lens and attaching it to a cheap camera rather than the other way around.\nAnd not entirely coincidentally, this approach will also result in better photographs. Good optics are still good optics, but digital cameras are improving rapidly year by year. Witness all the people adapting classic German lenses from the 1950s or Japanese lenses from the 1960s and using them with the latest digital bodies - the glass is as good as it always was, and often competes with the best glass made today. It may just be less convenient, since newer lenses sport technological features such as autofocus and image stabilization.\nWhere can I get a manual for my camera?\nIf you bought a used camera sans manual or if you simply lost yours you have a number of choices.\nLook on Canon\u0092s Web sites.\nCanon post electronic (PDF) versions of their new camera manuals online, which is great news. All their digital cameras, for example, have online manuals available. Unfortunately they haven\u0092t posted manuals for all their older products.\nCall Canon for older cameras.\nCanon will happily sell you another manual for a modest fee. Just phone the Canon office for your country and someone should be able to help you. Note that they may only be able to offer you a photocopy of the manual for older discontinued products. Calling Canon is definitely your best bet for finding manuals in languages other than English.\nCheck out the unofficial manuals.\nAt least two Web sites offer original unofficial manuals for certain EOS camera models for free download. One, PhotoNotes.org , is the site you\u0092re looking at now. The other is EOSdoc.com .\nContact a used camera shop.\nMany camera shops which specialize in used equipment also sell whatever camera manuals that wind up in their inventory. Two such shops with online presences include Craig Camera (which actually specializes in rare and obscure camera manuals) and KEH .\nBuy a third-party book.\nYou can buy supplemental user manuals from camera shops published by third parties. (ie: not Canon) The names these books are sold under include Hove and Magic Lantern. These third party books are intended to be good companions to the original manual. Unfortunately they are of varying quality - some offer useful detailed information and others, even from the same publisher, are filled with generic fluff. You might want to see if your local camera shop carries the book you\u0092re interested in before buying it.\nLook on eBay and other auction sites.\nThere seems to be a small cottage industry in scanning camera manuals and selling CD-ROMs to users. Technically this is, of course, a blatant violation of Canon\u0092s copyrights, but Canon apparently don\u0092t care and haven\u0092t taken legal action against these folks, so it\u0092s pretty easy to find such manuals on auction sites. Sometimes people will auction off genuine Canon manuals as well.\nExperiment.\nThe tough way to go. Who needs a manual anyway? Most of Canon\u0092s equipment is reasonably easy to figure out, so just play with your camera until it seems to make sense.\nWhat is a third party product?\nA manufacturer of lenses, add-on devices such as flash units and so on that sells products designed for another camera system. For example, Tamron, Tokina and Sigma all manufacture third-party lenses designed to work with cameras made by Nikon, Canon, Sony and Pentax. According to this model the manufacturer of the camera system is the first party, the consumer (end user, or you) is the second party, and the manufacturer of the add-on accessories is the third party.\nWhat is a grey market product?\nAny merchandise which was not imported into a country by the manufacturer\u0092s authorized agent. Some camera retailers, for example, go to Japan and buy camera gear there and import it into the country themselves. This activity is legal but not usually sanctioned by the manufacturer. Since \u0093grey market\u0094 sounds rather sinister some shops prefer calling the practice \u0093direct import.\u0094\nThere are three issues with this. First, some manufacturers don\u0092t respect warranties on products bought grey market. In the case of Canon it depends if you have a film camera or a digital camera. In the case of film, Canon seem to honour international warranties, though usually only at service depots. Sadly with the advent of digital Canon have reversed this policy and restrict warranty service to the region of purchase. (eg: a camera bought in NYC can be serviced in Toronto, but not in Berlin) This is really frustrating for travellers and other professionals who may find themselves for some time outside their home region. Grey market products made by other makers may only be serviced by the importer/retailer itself, and the quality and convenience of this service will of course vary. Second, some people may be concerned that a grey market product may be of lower quality than an officially imported one. This fear is normally unfounded. Grey market product may have different names and may have slightly different feature sets, but in the case of photographic gear they\u0092re usually all off the same assembly line, though sometimes different labels are slapped on at the end. Third, the product may not include manuals or software in a language you can understand - check to see first.\nFor more information on grey market products please check out my PhotoNotes Dictionary definition of the term.\nWhere should I buy my camera?\nCamera shopping can be a pretty treacherous endeavour. Cameras are high-priced commodity items, so there can be a lot of sketchiness about the whole camera retail market. Here are your basic shopping options, though.\nMail order. This is often the cheapest option, though the risks are obvious. First, you can\u0092t inspect the merchandise before buying, second, there are risks of shipment damage and third, returns and repairs can be a nuisance with some mail order outlets. You also don\u0092t have the opportunity to meet salespeople in person and evaluate their honesty and reliability.\nSmall local camera shops. Such shops tend not to have the best prices owing to their high overhead costs and usually have small product inventories for the same reason, but small shops can also have very knowledgeable longtime camera salespeople. Not always, of course - sometimes they hire bored teenagers or surly wannabe photographers, like anywhere else. But good local shops can be a terrific resource. Plus by shopping at a local store you\u0092re putting money back into the local community.\nBig mall/main street camera shop chains or department stores. Prices are usually okay, salespeople are usually uninformed and unhelpful. Return policies are usually reasonable, though.\nOnline auction sites. These can be cheap, but to say fraud is a serious problem on such sites (especially with reasonably expensive products like cameras) is an understatement. I have another article on this subject, if you\u0092re interested.\nPawn shops often carry camera gear, though usually old junk that nobody wants. Remember that pawn shops offer a very limited return to the seller, so a) you probably won\u0092t find much highly marketable EOS gear and b) much of the stuff in the store is probably stolen.\nAnother point to be aware of is that a disturbing number of camera shops in general are manipulative and dishonest operations. It\u0092s not just big energy, telecom and investment companies which hold the monopoly on corruption. The most common tactic is the old standby, bait and switch. Typical scenarios might go like this:\n\u0093Hello. I\u0092m interested in the EOS 5D mark II you have advertised in the paper.\u0094\n\u0093Sorry, sir. We just sold our last one. But I don\u0092t recommend it anyway as it\u0092s made in China. For a few dollars more, however, we\u0092ll be happy to sell you the higher-quality made in Japan version of the EOS 5D mark II!\u0094\nor:\n\u0093Hi. Do you have the used Rebel T1i you have advertised?\u0094\n\u0093We do, ma\u0092am, but you don\u0092t want it anyway as it\u0092s got a plastic lens mount that breaks. You should buy a brand new EOS 50D instead - it\u0092s got a solid steel lens mount!\u0094\nLuckily you know that all EOS 5D mark II bodies are made in Japan, that Digital Rebels never had plastic lens mounts and that plastic lens mounts aren\u0092t easily broken anyway, so you wouldn\u0092t fall prey to such scams. But this sort of thing is amazingly common, as is the trick of saying, \u0093if you buy X we\u0092ll give you Y for free!\u0094 when accessory Y is always included with item X anyway. These scams can be pretty outrageous, like shops advertising a lens for a certain price then, when a customer asks to buy one, saying that the advertised price is for the \u0093plastic\u0094 version of the lens rather than the \u0093glass\u0094 version, which costs more. Or bizarre barefaced lies, such as claiming that the camera they sell won\u0092t work without an additional \u0093processor\u0094 at extra cost.\nEven if they\u0092re not this outrageously dishonest, salespeople can be aggressive and pushy, especially if they\u0092re trying to get you to buy something that earns them higher commission points (kickbacks) from the manufacturer regardless of whether or not it\u0092s actually the most appropriate product to meet your needs. Or they may insist on selling you a pile of overpriced accessories as a condition of selling you a camera or whatever at a reasonably low price. Or they may charge you unbelievably high shipping costs or put all kinds of unreasonable conditions for returning merchandise. PC World magazine have an interesting article detailing some of these horror stories, pointing out the huge number of scam retailers based in New York City, in case you\u0092d like to learn more.\nHaving said all this, an honest and reliable salesperson can be a real pleasure to deal with. There was a local store I often frequented for just that reason. Their prices were higher than discount mail-order shops, but the sensible advice and patience of one of their salespeople made it worth it. I often saw people waiting around the counter just to deal with him rather than anyone else in the shop - I wonder if the store manager had any clue what a valuable asset he was.\nHere are some other suggestions for buying camera gear.\nResearch carefully. Check around for average prices before buying - prices can vary wildly, especially when it comes to used gear.\nDon\u0092t buy the first thing you see. Salespeople will push you to buy immediately, but remember that camera equipment is just commodity stuff. One camera model is identical to another; there\u0092s nothing special about it. If it turns out you missed a slightly good deal, oh well. Another one will be around the corner soon.\nIf the salesperson is rude, aggressive, bored or completely clueless don\u0092t buy from them. They don\u0092t deserve your money and besides, bad attitude does not augur well when it comes to negotiating returns and repairs.\nBuy with a credit card. If there\u0092s a problem you can dispute the charge with your credit company. If you pay with cash you may not have the same sort of leverage.\nConsult the \u0093 Neighbor to Neighbor \u0094 section of Photo.net. This area is a place where people post their opinions of camera dealers around the world, and is a pretty valuable way to find the more honest and reliable camera shops out there. And of course if you\u0092ve had a particularly good or particularly bad experience with a shop be sure to post your views so others can take heed!\nBe wary of prices that are too good to be true. They probably are. Sometimes you\u0092ll be lucky - I once bought a used EOS lens from a store that obviously had no idea that it was worth twice what they were charging - but it\u0092s wise to be cautious.\nIn terms of North American mail order, US outlets B&H and Adorama in New York (about the only NYC-based firms without an evil reputation) and KEH in Atlanta have all established good reputations for fair pricing and honesty. I don\u0092t endorse them as such, but I can\u0092t complain about the service I\u0092ve received from them - your proverbial mileage may, of course, vary.\nB&H generally have the best prices for new gear but don\u0092t have the biggest inventory of used EOS gear. Note that both B&H and Adorama are Jewish-owned businesses and thus observe Jewish religious events and not most Christian ones. So they\u0092re closed on Saturdays but open on Sundays. And when they say \u0093we\u0092re closed for the holidays\u0094 they mean Passover, Yom Kippur, Succos and so on. Check their Web sites for specific dates if you need to order something time-critical and you aren\u0092t familiar with the Jewish calendar.\nKEH are the place to buy used EOS equipment on the Internet - their prices aren\u0092t the lowest, but they accurately describe the condition of their gear in my experience. They also have a pretty good inventory of EOS gear and have a decent returns policy. I bought a lens off them recently that was defective, and they paid for the return shipping, which was more than reasonable. So, although their prices are higher than a typical auction win, I think of any additional cost as something of an insurance policy. KEH\u0092s new equipment prices, on the other hand, are a bit high.\nWhat should I look out for when shopping for second-hand equipment?\nSo. What about previously owned gear? Well, the attraction is obvious - you should pay a lower price than for brand new. Like a car, camera equipment depreciates in value the minute it leaves the shop, so why not get somebody else to take that financial hit? Or maybe you want to buy a useful product that the manufacturer has discontinued. Of course, buying second-hand is also riskier. You have to be more aware and more prudent if you want to avoid ending up with a useless broken piece of junk.\nI\u0092ve bought a lot of second-hand equipment over the years, and here are some suggestions.\nBe conservative about where you buy. If you feel any doubt about a seller, trust your instincts. You owe the seller nothing, just as they don\u0092t owe you. A local camera shop visited by locals is probably going to be somewhat more sound than a guy selling stuff out of the back of a van.\nThe premium you pay from buying from a reputable used camera shop may be worth the lower risk, or it may not. Only you can decide how risk-averse you in when it comes to financial transactions.\nFind out a fair price beforehand for the product. Don\u0092t spend more for a used product than you can pay new, for example. This may sound stupid but I spent some time once checking the winning bid prices for various auctions of used products that were still available on the marketplace. Many went for over the new price. Crazy.\nDo your research and ask detailed questions about the equipment. Make sure the seller provides useful information. If they can\u0092t answer your questions then they probably never used the product and so are less likely to know much about its condition.\nAsk the seller for a history of the product. Why are they selling it?\nBe wary of auction sites or used gear postings when online. Look into insurance options or buying in person. I\u0092m not saying they\u0092re always a bad idea, but fraud is rampant online because it\u0092s so easy to commit. Have a look at my related article on buying from auction sites .\nExamine the gear before buying if you can. Quite often the physical state of the machine reflects how it was treated, and gear is less likely to fail if it was lightly used or well maintained.\nLook carefully for subtle signs of impact damage - a camera that was dropped isn\u0092t going to work as well. General scuffs and marks aren\u0092t a big deal except cosmetically, but dents and cracks may be.\nPop in a working battery, make sure the various controls work, that the shutter operates normally.\nCheck shutters for rips, black stick oil, creases or other problems. A tiny bit of wear on an older camera is fine, but shutters are fairly expensive to replace.\nCheck lenses for fungus - spider-like growths on the lens interior. You can\u0092t get rid of the stuff - it\u0092s there forever, and it may get worse. Rotate the focus and zoom rings. Do they move smoothly? Do they catch or bind? Do they make ghastly scraping noises?\nLook for tide marks (lines left by drying liquid) and never buy anything that has been subject to liquid damage, since the risks are high. Rust or green copper corrosion are bad signs.\nLook inside all battery compartments for signs of corrosion. Remove the lens and take a look in the mirror box.\nAsk what comes with the gear. Do you get a manual? Any other stuff?\nAre there identifying marks on the gear? Is there a driver\u0092s licence number engraved on it? If so, does the seller have an explanation? If not, it may be hot (stolen) property.\nDoes the seller seem unusually eager to sell or ready to dump the gear at a low low price? Do you feel like the seller is pressuring you hard? If so, once again, it may well be stolen.\nFinally, don\u0092t fantasize about how your life will be so much better if you buy this thing you\u0092re looking at. Consider less fun scenarios. What will you do if you get swindled and sold some broken piece of junk? Remember that, at the end of the proverbial day, a piece of camera equipment is a generic commodity. It isn\u0092t some one-off fine piece of art or something. There\u0092ll be another lens or camera or whatever around the corner.\nWhat does (some photography term) mean?\nThe field of photography is indeed filled with strange and arcane buzzwords. For that reason I\u0092ve written a huge online dictionary which lists the vast majority of photographic terms you may encounter.\n- NK Guy, PhotoNotes.org .\nDisclaimer and copyright:\nThis document is copyright \u00a9 2002-2012 NK Guy, PhotoNotes.org.

It has always seemed to me to be a repudiation of one of the intrinsic properties of our medium, its reproducibility.\nIt also seemed unnecessary, as most photographs are produced as actual photographic prints in relatively limited numbers - few photographers sell more than a few copies of any image as actual photographic prints, although they may get reproduced in thousands or even millions in newspapers, magazines, books or images on screen. Paradoxically while limited editions have been seen and marketed as a way to artificially produce scarcity, in many cases they will actually have resulted in more prints of an image being made.\nOver the years many photographers have indulged in dubious practices on limited editions in various ways. Often an edition is not actually printed, but prints are actually made to demand, and may differ significantly from each other. Others have produced several limited editions from the same original - a practice that would be acceptable if made clear at the time that the first was being marketed, but perhaps not if decided on at a later date.\nOf course there are positive aspects of limited editions. Some photographers like them because they feel they enable them to put a finish to older work and allow them to concentrate on new projects. Others see them as a useful marketing tool to make a living, and I\u2019ve nothing against photographers making a living, although there are photographers who have managed it without limited editions.\nThe recent sale record-breaking sale of new prints of old work by William Eggleston has raised some interesting questions, not least about limited editions, with one major collector of his work who owns a number of his limited edition dye-transfer prints suing over the new limited edition of these same photographs. The details of the case so far are well covered in the three links from PDN Online that I won\u2019t go into them further. It\u2019s also interesting to read about them and the possible museum in Eggleston\u2019s home town MemphisNewsPaper .\nBut this case also raises interesting questions about the photographic obsession with \u2018vintage prints\u2019, with the new large \u2018pigment prints\u2019 selling for an order of magnitude more than the orginal dye transfer edition. Possibly because they are better prints (though I\u2019ve not had the chance to compare) and almost certainly because they are larger.\nThe new Eggleston prints are inkjet prints, or as the galleries prefer to call them \u2018digital pigment prints.\u2019\u00a0 I don\u2019t know on what paper, printer or inks these were made, but they are basically similar to those many of us can produce on our own printers, except for the size of 44\u2033 x 60.\nCraig J Sterling on Beyond the F-Stop comments \u201cthe digital print, in my opinion, has finally been legitimized \u2026 yes!\u201d\u00a0 Looking around the giant dealer trade show in Paris eighteen months ago I\u2019d certainly come to the same opinion, although as with these prints the labels went to great lengths not to include \u2018I\u2019 word; \u201cinkjet\u201d is still taboo in the trade. Sterling has also written about Limited Edition Prints, and includes the idea that it only became possible to produce true editions of photographs with the advent of digital - in the darkroom every print is an individual performance.\nAlthough I rather doubt if the case against Eggleston will be successful (but I\u2019m not a lawyer) it may perhaps serve to make photographers rather more careful particularly in those US states that have laws about editioning of art works. But what I would really like to see is more photographers adopting a democratic rather than an elitist stance towards selling photographs.\nEggleston\u2019s work doesn\u2019t need to be printed huge, and I\u2019ve often thought that much if not all of it works better in books than on the exhibition wall (and the same is true of most photographs.)\u00a0 You can buy a copy of his \u2018The Democratic Forest\u2019, arguably his best book, for around \u00a330 if you shop around, which gets you not just one but a sequence of 150 of his images for something like $578,460 less than that single large image of a tricycle. I know which makes more sense.\nArthur Tress On The Street\nWednesday, April 11th, 2012\nDiscoveries in street photography aren\u2019t always what they are hyped up to be, but Arthur Tress\u2019s rediscovery of some of his early work holds more promise than most. Tress took around 900 photos during a short stay in San Francisco in the summer of 1964, and stored the prints that be made from them in a community darkroom there wrapped up in a parcel at his sister\u2019s house when he went off to work elsewhere.\nForty-five years later in 2009 he came across them again and decided they were interesting, and took them to show curator James Ganz at the de Young Museum.\nThe show Arthur Tress: San Francisco 1964 opened there on 3 March and runs until 3 June 2012, and there is just a little more information in the press release . If you - like me - can\u2019t get to San Francisco, the best place to see them is on Tress\u2019s own web site . Of course his later and better known work is also worth a long look. Accompanying the show is a book of the same title , and also worth reading is an interview with him by Jim Kasson from 2002 on the web site of The Center for Photographic Art in Carmel. Although I wrote about Tress\u2019s work on several occasions on another site I\u2019m surprised to find that this seems to be his first mention here on >Re:PHOTO.\nThe Listening Eye\nTuesday, April 10th, 2012\nThere is a very nice essay on the work of Vanessa Winship on The Great Leap Sideways blog, along with a gallery of her work: The Listening Eye: the work of Vanessa Winship .\nA site new to me, TGLS is edited by Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa and describes itself thus:\n\u201c The Great Leap Sideways is a gallery space primarily, but not exclusively, dedicated to showcasing photography. The site comprises small and extended surveys of work by contemporary photographers alongside extended interviews, features, videos and extracts from texts that illuminate the practise of photography and its wider context.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth taking a look at the Archive on the site too, which has some interesting features and interviews, though sometimes with a rather different outlook to mine, although it does feature several other photographers whose work I\u2019ve mentioned here or elsewhere in the past as well as Winship.\nJustice For Trayvon\nTuesday, April 10th, 2012\nLike most people - or rather everyone I\u2019ve talked to about it - I was appalled at the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a teenager going home from his local shop after buying a soft drink and some sweets, shot by a white man who claimed he felt threatened by this young black in a hoodie, apparently sufficient justification to get away with murder under Florida law.\nAlthough this was clearly a crime committed because the victim was black, it surprised me that the protest at the US Embassy did not attract much wider support from the left in the UK. Not only were the great majority of those at the protest black, but even most of the photographers I met there were. The SWP had as almost always produced a placard - this one reading \u2018No Justice No Peace\u2018 and a few members were present with a bookstall but otherwise there was relatively little evidence of solidarity.\nTrayvon was killed in Florida, but the racism which led to his death is active here, and as recent events have brought again to public attention, very much present in our police force. As I noted in my post Protest for Trayvon Martin on Demotix and My London Diary, the speakers at the event were introduced by \u201cMerlin Emmanuel, brother of Smiley Culture, killed by police in his own kitchen, and speakers included Marcia, the brother of Sean Rigg, murdered in Brixton Police Station.\u201d\nThe picture above is not the most flattering I\u2019ve taken of Marcia Rigg on the various occasions I\u2019ve met her since her brother\u2019s murder, but the angle and framing were carefully chosen to include the American eagle and flag flying on top of the embassy building. And it was intended not to flatter but to show something of her righteous anger at both the killing of her brother and the deception and lies the family have met with from police, IPCC and CPS in trying to find the truth of what happened in Brixton Police Station and to get justice.\nFlags very seldom fly out straight in London\u2019s unpredictable breezes and it took quite a few attempts to get this how I wanted it, working at around 90mm equivalent using the 18-105mm on the D300 in very overcast light. A little flash helped to keep a sensible tonality in her face, though I had to bring it out more in post-processing - adding a little brightness and contrast in some areas and burning down the flare from the brighter sky on her forehead. The sky and the flag also needed burning in.\nThe picture was taken nominally at ISO1250 but with one stop of underexposure - so really ISO 600 - and stopped down to f ll to get the background fairly sharp, and this gave me a shutter speed of 1/320. Both my Nikon flashes are waiting for me to take them in to see if they can be fixed, and this was taken using a cheap Nissin unit, which I don\u2019t find gives as reliable exposure. Looking at the results from this and the other events during the day made me order a Nikon SB700. It seemed a bargain (though I think six times what I paid for the Nissin) compared to the larger, heavier, considerably more expensive and only slightly more powerful SB910.\nPeople had been asked to come to the protest wearing hoodies and to bring packets of the sweets Trayvon had bought - Skittles - and bottles of the soft drink, and there were many opportunities to take people posing with these. I don\u2019t like posed pictures, but I did take rather a lot of them at this event, and a few made it to the web pages at Protest for Trayvon Martin on My London Diary.\u00a0 The one above at least shows a certain spontaneity, as well as featuring the two joint chairs of BARAC, Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, Lee Jasper and Zita Holbourne.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"score": 228.47928, "uuid": "bbe68e7d-f19d-5615-99e6-2dd9d3a775fd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1507wb-21-10848", "target_hostname": "re-photo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://re-photo.co.uk/index.php", "page_rank": 1.1713873e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "&gt;Re: PHOTO", "snippet": "One of the first <em>cameras</em> <em>I</em> owned when <em>I</em> started out seriously in photography was <em>a</em> rough Russian copy of <em>a</em> screw fit <em>Leica</em>, and perhaps the way it most faithfully aped the original was the inaccuracy of its viewfinder.", "explanation": null, "document": "Limited Editions?\nApril 11th, 2012\nI\u2019ve never been in favour of \u2018limited editions\u2019 of photographs.

Tress took around 900 photos during a short stay in San Francisco in the summer of 1964, and stored the prints that be made from them in a community darkroom there wrapped up in a parcel at his sister\u2019s house when he went off to work elsewhere.\nForty-five years later in 2009 he came across them again and decided they were interesting, and took them to show curator James Ganz at the de Young Museum.\nThe show Arthur Tress: San Francisco 1964 opened there on 3 March and runs until 3 June 2012, and there is just a little more information in the press release . If you - like me - can\u2019t get to San Francisco, the best place to see them is on Tress\u2019s own web site . Of course his later and better known work is also worth a long look.

Accompanying the show is a book of the same title , and also worth reading is an interview with him by Jim Kasson from 2002 on the web site of The Center for Photographic Art in Carmel.

Not only were the great majority of those at the protest black, but even most of the photographers I met there were. The SWP had as almost always produced a placard - this one reading \u2018No Justice No Peace\u2018 and a few members were present with a bookstall but otherwise there was relatively little evidence of solidarity.\nTrayvon was killed in Florida, but the racism which led to his death is active here, and as recent events have brought again to public attention, very much present in our police force. As I noted in my post Protest for Trayvon Martin on Demotix and My London Diary, the speakers at the event were introduced by \u201cMerlin Emmanuel, brother of Smiley Culture, killed by police in his own kitchen, and speakers included Marcia, the brother of Sean Rigg, murdered in Brixton Police Station.\u201d\nThe picture above is not the most flattering I\u2019ve taken of Marcia Rigg on the various occasions I\u2019ve met her since her brother\u2019s murder, but the angle and framing were carefully chosen to include the American eagle and flag flying on top of the embassy building. And it was intended not to flatter but to show something of her righteous anger at both the killing of her brother and the deception and lies the family have met with from police, IPCC and CPS in trying to find the truth of what happened in Brixton Police Station and to get justice.\nFlags very seldom fly out straight in London\u2019s unpredictable breezes and it took quite a few attempts to get this how I wanted it, working at around 90mm equivalent using the 18-105mm on the D300 in very overcast light. A little flash helped to keep a sensible tonality in her face, though I had to bring it out more in post-processing - adding a little brightness and contrast in some areas and burning down the flare from the brighter sky on her forehead. The sky and the flag also needed burning in.\nThe picture was taken nominally at ISO1250 but with one stop of underexposure - so really ISO 600 - and stopped down to f ll to get the background fairly sharp, and this gave me a shutter speed of 1/320. Both my Nikon flashes are waiting for me to take them in to see if they can be fixed, and this was taken using a cheap Nissin unit, which I don\u2019t find gives as reliable exposure. Looking at the results from this and the other events during the day made me order a Nikon SB700. It seemed a bargain (though I think six times what I paid for the Nissin) compared to the larger, heavier, considerably more expensive and only slightly more powerful SB910.\nPeople had been asked to come to the protest wearing hoodies and to bring packets of the sweets Trayvon had bought - Skittles - and bottles of the soft drink, and there were many opportunities to take people posing with these. I don\u2019t like posed pictures, but I did take rather a lot of them at this event, and a few made it to the web pages at Protest for Trayvon Martin on My London Diary.\u00a0 The one above at least shows a certain spontaneity, as well as featuring the two joint chairs of BARAC, Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, Lee Jasper and Zita Holbourne.\n________________________________________________________\n"}, {"score": 228.21605, "uuid": "27f0cce4-829d-5680-bf3b-de19ebba9757", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1016wb-89-17629", "target_hostname": "www.photoassistant.net", "target_uri": "http://www.photoassistant.net/blog/post/2011/06/06/Imagined-Family-Heirlooms-An-Archive-of-Inherited-Fictions.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1774579e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "1ProPhoto.Com | Imagined Family Heirlooms: An Archive of Inherited", "snippet": "&lt;&lt; Henri Cartier-Bresson \u2013 Life Is Once Forever | Creative Collision: The Industry\u2019s Direction &gt;&gt; Imagined Family Heirlooms: An Archive of Inherited Fictions <em>I</em> have been creating <em>a</em> massive archive of <em>portraits</em> with the tintype process <em>for</em> <em>over</em> 7 years.", "explanation": null, "document": "by JamesNYC 6. June 2011 08:52\nWHAT I DO\nI have been creating a massive archive of portraits with the tintype process for over 7 years. I use antique brass lenses, wooden view cameras and chemistry I mix according to traditional recipes. Recently, I have begun bringing these images into large-scale installations alongside found antique letters, photographs and textiles, and simulat\ufeff\ufeffed \"heirlooms\" that I make using other historic photographic processes including cyanotype and van dyke brown photograms. With these objects I create fictional heirloom collections for fictional families and individuals.\nMY CURRENT PROJECT\nI construct installations that are \"curated\" from my growing archive of real and imagined heirlooms, hanging them the same way family photos are displayed on household walls. I have installed several different slices of the collection in university and commercial galleries, but I am now building installations that exceed these previous incarnations in scope and size. I bring objects together from a wide range of places and times, sometimes even my own family, but no real family is represented by the installations. They are potential but imaginary heirloom collections, fragments of other collections that have been forgotten in boxes or abandoned to thrift stores. When combined with my own work, each of these objects is put into a new context, a new history, even as the individual object still evokes the unique past it has been separated from.\nThe project draws attention to the rootless nature of contemporary identities. We all assemble and create our identities from fragments of the past. Some of us carefully reconstruct genealogies and can name the individuals in family photographs back multiple generations, while others see only strangers in old albums and shoeboxes. Some of us choose one ancestor or one ethnic affiliation to identify with over another, while others of us find new, future lines of identity in the images we collect of our children. Through the images we hold on to, we all seek to forge identities, to assimilate into traditions and put our lives into historical contexts.\nWhen looking at my installations, viewers might wonder: Are these people related? What stories bring these objects and faces together? Why have these particular objects been framed and not others? What stories, known only to the collector who left them behind, would be communicated by these objects if we just had enough information? These objects are both mysterious and familiar, just as are, paradoxically, images of our own ancestors. I am very interested in the fictional quality of identity-formation. Specifically, I am interested in examining the role that photography has played since its invention in shaping our sense of identity and belonging.\n"}], [{"score": 227.44589, "uuid": "ee25b648-dc04-556a-9e6d-0acfbce01e58", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1507wb-94-21506", "target_hostname": "re-photo.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://re-photo.co.uk/wp-admin/Defend%20Jobs,%20Services%20and%20Education", "page_rank": 1.1720501e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "&gt;Re: PHOTO", "snippet": "One of the first <em>cameras</em> <em>I</em> owned when <em>I</em> started out seriously in photography was <em>a</em> rough Russian copy of <em>a</em> screw fit <em>Leica</em>, and perhaps the way it most faithfully aped the original was the inaccuracy of its viewfinder.", "explanation": null, "document": "Limited Editions?\nApril 11th, 2012\nI\u2019ve never been in favour of \u2018limited editions\u2019 of photographs. It has always seemed to me to be a repudiation of one of the intrinsic properties of our medium, its reproducibility.\nIt also seemed unnecessary, as most photographs are produced as actual photographic prints in relatively limited numbers - few photographers sell more than a few copies of any image as actual photographic prints, although they may get reproduced in thousands or even millions in newspapers, magazines, books or images on screen. Paradoxically while limited editions have been seen and marketed as a way to artificially produce scarcity, in many cases they will actually have resulted in more prints of an image being made.\nOver the years many photographers have indulged in dubious practices on limited editions in various ways. Often an edition is not actually printed, but prints are actually made to demand, and may differ significantly from each other. Others have produced several limited editions from the same original - a practice that would be acceptable if made clear at the time that the first was being marketed, but perhaps not if decided on at a later date.\nOf course there are positive aspects of limited editions. Some photographers like them because they feel they enable them to put a finish to older work and allow them to concentrate on new projects. Others see them as a useful marketing tool to make a living, and I\u2019ve nothing against photographers making a living, although there are photographers who have managed it without limited editions.\nThe recent sale record-breaking sale of new prints of old work by William Eggleston has raised some interesting questions, not least about limited editions, with one major collector of his work who owns a number of his limited edition dye-transfer prints suing over the new limited edition of these same photographs. The details of the case so far are well covered in the three links from PDN Online that I won\u2019t go into them further. It\u2019s also interesting to read about them and the possible museum in Eggleston\u2019s home town MemphisNewsPaper .\nBut this case also raises interesting questions about the photographic obsession with \u2018vintage prints\u2019, with the new large \u2018pigment prints\u2019 selling for an order of magnitude more than the orginal dye transfer edition. Possibly because they are better prints (though I\u2019ve not had the chance to compare) and almost certainly because they are larger.\nThe new Eggleston prints are inkjet prints, or as the galleries prefer to call them \u2018digital pigment prints.\u2019\u00a0 I don\u2019t know on what paper, printer or inks these were made, but they are basically similar to those many of us can produce on our own printers, except for the size of 44\u2033 x 60.\nCraig J Sterling on Beyond the F-Stop comments \u201cthe digital print, in my opinion, has finally been legitimized \u2026 yes!\u201d\u00a0 Looking around the giant dealer trade show in Paris eighteen months ago I\u2019d certainly come to the same opinion, although as with these prints the labels went to great lengths not to include \u2018I\u2019 word; \u201cinkjet\u201d is still taboo in the trade. Sterling has also written about Limited Edition Prints, and includes the idea that it only became possible to produce true editions of photographs with the advent of digital - in the darkroom every print is an individual performance.\nAlthough I rather doubt if the case against Eggleston will be successful (but I\u2019m not a lawyer) it may perhaps serve to make photographers rather more careful particularly in those US states that have laws about editioning of art works. But what I would really like to see is more photographers adopting a democratic rather than an elitist stance towards selling photographs.\nEggleston\u2019s work doesn\u2019t need to be printed huge, and I\u2019ve often thought that much if not all of it works better in books than on the exhibition wall (and the same is true of most photographs.)\u00a0 You can buy a copy of his \u2018The Democratic Forest\u2019, arguably his best book, for around \u00a330 if you shop around, which gets you not just one but a sequence of 150 of his images for something like $578,460 less than that single large image of a tricycle.

Tress took around 900 photos during a short stay in San Francisco in the summer of 1964, and stored the prints that be made from them in a community darkroom there wrapped up in a parcel at his sister\u2019s house when he went off to work elsewhere.\nForty-five years later in 2009 he came across them again and decided they were interesting, and took them to show curator James Ganz at the de Young Museum.\nThe show Arthur Tress: San Francisco 1964 opened there on 3 March and runs until 3 June 2012, and there is just a little more information in the press release . If you - like me - can\u2019t get to San Francisco, the best place to see them is on Tress\u2019s own web site . Of course his later and better known work is also worth a long look. Accompanying the show is a book of the same title , and also worth reading is an interview with him by Jim Kasson from 2002 on the web site of The Center for Photographic Art in Carmel.

The site comprises small and extended surveys of work by contemporary photographers alongside extended interviews, features, videos and extracts from texts that illuminate the practise of photography and its wider context.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth taking a look at the Archive on the site too, which has some interesting features and interviews, though sometimes with a rather different outlook to mine, although it does feature several other photographers whose work I\u2019ve mentioned here or elsewhere in the past as well as Winship.\nJustice For Trayvon\nApril 10th, 2012\nLike most people - or rather everyone I\u2019ve talked to about it - I was appalled at the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a teenager going home from his local shop after buying a soft drink and some sweets, shot by a white man who claimed he felt threatened by this young black in a hoodie, apparently sufficient justification to get away with murder under Florida law.\nAlthough this was clearly a crime committed because the victim was black, it surprised me that the protest at the US Embassy did not attract much wider support from the left in the UK. Not only were the great majority of those at the protest black, but even most of the photographers I met there were. The SWP had as almost always produced a placard - this one reading \u2018No Justice No Peace\u2018 and a few members were present with a bookstall but otherwise there was relatively little evidence of solidarity.\nTrayvon was killed in Florida, but the racism which led to his death is active here, and as recent events have brought again to public attention, very much present in our police force. As I noted in my post Protest for Trayvon Martin on Demotix and My London Diary, the speakers at the event were introduced by \u201cMerlin Emmanuel, brother of Smiley Culture, killed by police in his own kitchen, and speakers included Marcia, the brother of Sean Rigg, murdered in Brixton Police Station.\u201d\nThe picture above is not the most flattering I\u2019ve taken of Marcia Rigg on the various occasions I\u2019ve met her since her brother\u2019s murder, but the angle and framing were carefully chosen to include the American eagle and flag flying on top of the embassy building. And it was intended not to flatter but to show something of her righteous anger at both the killing of her brother and the deception and lies the family have met with from police, IPCC and CPS in trying to find the truth of what happened in Brixton Police Station and to get justice.\nFlags very seldom fly out straight in London\u2019s unpredictable breezes and it took quite a few attempts to get this how I wanted it, working at around 90mm equivalent using the 18-105mm on the D300 in very overcast light. A little flash helped to keep a sensible tonality in her face, though I had to bring it out more in post-processing - adding a little brightness and contrast in some areas and burning down the flare from the brighter sky on her forehead. The sky and the flag also needed burning in.\nThe picture was taken nominally at ISO1250 but with one stop of underexposure - so really ISO 600 - and stopped down to f ll to get the background fairly sharp, and this gave me a shutter speed of 1/320. Both my Nikon flashes are waiting for me to take them in to see if they can be fixed, and this was taken using a cheap Nissin unit, which I don\u2019t find gives as reliable exposure. Looking at the results from this and the other events during the day made me order a Nikon SB700.

It has always seemed to me to be a repudiation of one of the intrinsic properties of our medium, its reproducibility.\nIt also seemed unnecessary, as most photographs are produced as actual photographic prints in relatively limited numbers - few photographers sell more than a few copies of any image as actual photographic prints, although they may get reproduced in thousands or even millions in newspapers, magazines, books or images on screen. Paradoxically while limited editions have been seen and marketed as a way to artificially produce scarcity, in many cases they will actually have resulted in more prints of an image being made.\nOver the years many photographers have indulged in dubious practices on limited editions in various ways. Often an edition is not actually printed, but prints are actually made to demand, and may differ significantly from each other. Others have produced several limited editions from the same original - a practice that would be acceptable if made clear at the time that the first was being marketed, but perhaps not if decided on at a later date.\nOf course there are positive aspects of limited editions. Some photographers like them because they feel they enable them to put a finish to older work and allow them to concentrate on new projects. Others see them as a useful marketing tool to make a living, and I\u2019ve nothing against photographers making a living, although there are photographers who have managed it without limited editions.\nThe recent sale record-breaking sale of new prints of old work by William Eggleston has raised some interesting questions, not least about limited editions, with one major collector of his work who owns a number of his limited edition dye-transfer prints suing over the new limited edition of these same photographs. The details of the case so far are well covered in the three links from PDN Online that I won\u2019t go into them further. It\u2019s also interesting to read about them and the possible museum in Eggleston\u2019s home town MemphisNewsPaper .\nBut this case also raises interesting questions about the photographic obsession with \u2018vintage prints\u2019, with the new large \u2018pigment prints\u2019 selling for an order of magnitude more than the orginal dye transfer edition. Possibly because they are better prints (though I\u2019ve not had the chance to compare) and almost certainly because they are larger.\nThe new Eggleston prints are inkjet prints, or as the galleries prefer to call them \u2018digital pigment prints.\u2019\u00a0 I don\u2019t know on what paper, printer or inks these were made, but they are basically similar to those many of us can produce on our own printers, except for the size of 44\u2033 x 60.\nCraig J Sterling on Beyond the F-Stop comments \u201cthe digital print, in my opinion, has finally been legitimized \u2026 yes!\u201d\u00a0 Looking around the giant dealer trade show in Paris eighteen months ago I\u2019d certainly come to the same opinion, although as with these prints the labels went to great lengths not to include \u2018I\u2019 word; \u201cinkjet\u201d is still taboo in the trade. Sterling has also written about Limited Edition Prints, and includes the idea that it only became possible to produce true editions of photographs with the advent of digital - in the darkroom every print is an individual performance.\nAlthough I rather doubt if the case against Eggleston will be successful (but I\u2019m not a lawyer) it may perhaps serve to make photographers rather more careful particularly in those US states that have laws about editioning of art works. But what I would really like to see is more photographers adopting a democratic rather than an elitist stance towards selling photographs.\nEggleston\u2019s work doesn\u2019t need to be printed huge, and I\u2019ve often thought that much if not all of it works better in books than on the exhibition wall (and the same is true of most photographs.)\u00a0 You can buy a copy of his \u2018The Democratic Forest\u2019, arguably his best book, for around \u00a330 if you shop around, which gets you not just one but a sequence of 150 of his images for something like $578,460 less than that single large image of a tricycle. I know which makes more sense.\nArthur Tress On The Street\nApril 11th, 2012\nDiscoveries in street photography aren\u2019t always what they are hyped up to be, but Arthur Tress\u2019s rediscovery of some of his early work holds more promise than most. Tress took around 900 photos during a short stay in San Francisco in the summer of 1964, and stored the prints that be made from them in a community darkroom there wrapped up in a parcel at his sister\u2019s house when he went off to work elsewhere.\nForty-five years later in 2009 he came across them again and decided they were interesting, and took them to show curator James Ganz at the de Young Museum.\nThe show Arthur Tress: San Francisco 1964 opened there on 3 March and runs until 3 June 2012, and there is just a little more information in the press release . If you - like me - can\u2019t get to San Francisco, the best place to see them is on Tress\u2019s own web site . Of course his later and better known work is also worth a long look. Accompanying the show is a book of the same title , and also worth reading is an interview with him by Jim Kasson from 2002 on the web site of The Center for Photographic Art in Carmel. Although I wrote about Tress\u2019s work on several occasions on another site I\u2019m surprised to find that this seems to be his first mention here on >Re:PHOTO.\nThe Listening Eye\nApril 10th, 2012\nThere is a very nice essay on the work of Vanessa Winship on The Great Leap Sideways blog, along with a gallery of her work: The Listening Eye: the work of Vanessa Winship .\nA site new to me, TGLS is edited by Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa and describes itself thus:\n\u201c The Great Leap Sideways is a gallery space primarily, but not exclusively, dedicated to showcasing photography. The site comprises small and extended surveys of work by contemporary photographers alongside extended interviews, features, videos and extracts from texts that illuminate the practise of photography and its wider context.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth taking a look at the Archive on the site too, which has some interesting features and interviews, though sometimes with a rather different outlook to mine, although it does feature several other photographers whose work I\u2019ve mentioned here or elsewhere in the past as well as Winship.\nJustice For Trayvon\nApril 10th, 2012\nLike most people - or rather everyone I\u2019ve talked to about it - I was appalled at the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a teenager going home from his local shop after buying a soft drink and some sweets, shot by a white man who claimed he felt threatened by this young black in a hoodie, apparently sufficient justification to get away with murder under Florida law.\nAlthough this was clearly a crime committed because the victim was black, it surprised me that the protest at the US Embassy did not attract much wider support from the left in the UK. Not only were the great majority of those at the protest black, but even most of the photographers I met there were. The SWP had as almost always produced a placard - this one reading \u2018No Justice No Peace\u2018 and a few members were present with a bookstall but otherwise there was relatively little evidence of solidarity.\nTrayvon was killed in Florida, but the racism which led to his death is active here, and as recent events have brought again to public attention, very much present in our police force. As I noted in my post Protest for Trayvon Martin on Demotix and My London Diary, the speakers at the event were introduced by \u201cMerlin Emmanuel, brother of Smiley Culture, killed by police in his own kitchen, and speakers included Marcia, the brother of Sean Rigg, murdered in Brixton Police Station.\u201d\nThe picture above is not the most flattering I\u2019ve taken of Marcia Rigg on the various occasions I\u2019ve met her since her brother\u2019s murder, but the angle and framing were carefully chosen to include the American eagle and flag flying on top of the embassy building.

They are simply not needed anymore.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nEmploying some of the technology and features developed for the pricey EOS 7D, the new EOS 60D is lighter, more compact and more affordable. It fills the gap between that semi-pro camera and the entry-level EOS models, clearly targeting the serious hobbyist. In addition to some new functions, this DSLR is the first in the EOS series with two entirely new features: a fully articulated LCD screen and image modification features in Playback mode.\nOther benefits include Canon's latest DIGIC 4 processor for superb quality and 5.3 frame per second Burst mode, the latest 63-zone metering sensor, full HD 1920x1080 movie mode with overrides and an AF module with nine cross-hatched focus detection points for maximum reliability. Note too that this is only the second EOS model with \"integrated Speedlite transmitter.\" Because the built-in flash can trigger a wireless off-camera EX-series Speedlite, there's no need to buy extra accessories.\nDesign and Features\nThe EOS 60D is not built with a magnesium-alloy body like the EOS 7D. Instead, it's made of a polycarbonate resin and glass fibre over an aluminium chassis with a stainless steel lens mount. The camera \u2014 with its large, comfortable handgrip \u2014 is certainly not tiny and it's not a featherweight; it feels as solid as any competing model. The body sports several external controls \u2014 though fewer than average \u2014 including a rear quick control dial that's also a four-way controller. I missed the more convenient \"joystick\" available with some EOS cameras but eventually became comfortable with the new type of control.\nOther controls provide only a single function, a benefit over some other DSLRs. The Q button provides quick access to 16 functions, minimizing the need to use the full Menu. In Creative Auto and Scene modes only, the EOS 60D offers two new features for novices. These include nine Ambience presets (such as Vivid, Soft, Warm, Monochrome). These are similar to the familiar Picture Styles available in other modes but produce a stronger effect. Options are also available for setting White Balance in a simplified manner: for daylight, shade, cloudy and sunset conditions.\nAnyone who is not a Photoshop expert will appreciate the image enhancing tools in Playback mode. Creative Filters allow for enhancing a photo with any of five options: Grainy B/W, Soft focus (both with intensity level control), Toy camera effect and Miniature effect. The modified image is saved as a new JPEG to the memory card and another filter can then be applied, if desired. The EOS 60D also allows for converting a RAW file to JPEG with control over parameters such as the Picture Style, brightness, WB, Noise Reduction and Auto Lighting Optimizer.\nPull the 3\" LCD away from the body and you'll note that it's fully articulated. This allows for placing the screen at any desired angle, ideal in Live View or Movie mode for shooting with the camera at waist level, at ground level or held above the heads in a crowd. The 1.04 million dot resolution provides a very finely detailed and bright display; dual anti-reflection coating minimizes glare, a useful feature on sunny days. If you prefer to use the viewfinder, you'll find that it's quite bright and adequately large.\nEvaluation: Frankly, the EOS 60D is not exactly simple to use considering its 11 Menu pages and 20 custom functions with 59 options. But the wealth of advanced and simpler options should make it particularly attractive to families with novices and experienced shooters. And most of the default settings are very suitable for many types of photography.\nExperienced photographers will want to try some of the advanced features, including depth of field preview, two dynamic range expansion functions, automatic correction of lens peripheral illumination (vignetting) and the Dual Axis Electronic Level gauge. The latter provides a display that makes it easy to prevent crooked photos. Note too that copyright information can be permanently added to images using an alphanumeric \"keyboard.\"\nWhen the optical viewfinder is used, autofocus is quick. After shooting several races, including cyclists, go-karts and horses, I checked all the photos made with a 70-200mm f/4L IS USM lens. Roughly 70% \u00a0were sharply focused in spite of the fast erratic motion of the competitors.\nLive and Movie Modes\nLive View is particularly convenient thanks to the articulated ultra high resolution LCD screen with high sharpness and accurate colours. The preview image brightness is also quite accurate when the Exposure Simulation option is set. With most DSLRs, data is displayed in a bar at the bottom of the screen where it's easy to see. The EOS 60D overlays data on the preview image instead; this allows the camera to fill the entire LCD with the display. You can choose the amount of information \u2014 including the electronic level feature \u2014 to be overlaid by pressing the DISP button.\nIn Live View, Quick AF provides phase-detection AF that takes under a second. As with any DSLR, however, there's a lot of distracting noise from the reflex mirror and display blackout during autofocus. Switch to Live AF \u2014 with Face Detection AF or with Quiet mode \u2014 and the camera will use contrast-detection AF. While autofocus is slower in this second mode (about 1.5 seconds) the LCD screen does not black out during focusing.\nSet the Mode dial to Movie and press the Record button while in Live View to shoot 1080p videos or excellent 720p movies. Before shooting a clip, you can pre-set a desired Picture style and its overrides, the ISO, WB and exposure compensation. During actual recording the AE Lock feature can be used as desired. If the camera is set for Manual mode, the aperture and shutter speed can be changed while filming; naturally, any change to either aspect will affect the brightness of the video clip.\nContrast detection autofocus is available, but the slow AF in Movie mode can be problematic producing a jerky effect. It's better to pre-focus before recording and then use manual focusing if necessary. Frankly, it's not always easy to judge focus accuracy on the LCD screen. In my view, video capture is most practical in situations where frequent focus adjustment is not necessary. It would work well especially when the camera is on a tripod during a party or a stage performance.\nEvaluation: The AVI Motion (MOV format) clips can be edited with affordable software such as iMovie, QuickTime Pro or Adobe Elements 8 or 9 Premiere. For the absolutely best video quality use 1080p mode, but it's also very good at 720p but with occasional jagged lines. The built-in mic provides acceptable sound quality with nearby subjects, but serious video shooters will use an optional external stereo mic.\nVideo capture with a DSLR \u2014 even if equipped with an articulated LCD \u2014 is not perfect in every aspect. Autofocus is balky and the clip length is limited, to 12 minutes or 4GB with the EOS 60D. A dedicated camcorder is preferable in some aspects, but very few can compete with this DSLR in terms of very clean, richly detailed videos. While movies can be viewed on a computer monitor \u2014 using the Canon software \u2014 connect the camera to an HD TV for superb display quality. For the best results buy a Type C (Mini HDMI to HDMI) cable to get the most stunning display that your HD TV can provide.\nSpeed and Quality\nThe EOS 60D is very fast in conventional operation. It starts up in a half second, fires up to 58 JPEGs or 16 RAW photos at 5.3 shots per second and processes them quickly. Even while it's writing data to the memory card, extra shots can be taken especially when using a fast Class 6 or Class 10 card. The camera employs 14-bit processing for more tonal values and more accurate colours than you'd get with a 12-bit processor. It also allows for ISO levels as high as 12,800, although the extended ISO option must be enabled in the menu.\nMy JPEGs taken at more typical ISO levels look great, even in Standard Picture Style without overrides. Colour rendition is quite accurate; saturation is quite high and a bit excessive in the red spectrum. Exposures were often close to ideal, but occasionally +2/3 compensation was required for a light-toned scene. The default sharpening level is a bit low in Standard style but can be boosted in-camera, or preferably later using software. The resolution provided by RAW captures (converted to TIFF with the Canon software) is even more impressive.\nMy best JPEGs made at ISO 100 to 400 are perfectly clean and silky smooth, suitable for prints larger than 13x19\" after a bit of sharpening in Photoshop. The RAW captures were even better exhibiting maximum resolution. Since no kit lens provides optimal image quality, it's worth using superior lenses if you intend to make (or order) oversized prints.\nDigital noise is noticeable at ISO 800, but this level is still fine for all-purpose use. In spite of the very small size of the 18 million individual pixels, ISO 1600 quality is highly acceptable, suitable for very nice in 11x15\" prints. By ISO 3200 there's a loss of color saturation, some visible mottled color specks and a bit of smudging of fine details. Even so, my photos \u2014 especially RAW captures \u2014 are suitable for good letter-size glossies. Digital noise \u2014 and blurring of fine detail due to Noise Reduction \u2014 becomes problematic at higher ISO's, but my ISO 6400 shots still made for decent 5x7\" prints.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhen compared to the 15.1 megapixel EOS 50D that it replaced, the new EOS 60D is more suitable for serious photographers because of its additional features, higher resolution and the articulated LCD. It's also preferable to the 18 megapixel EOS T2i in terms of feature set, build quality and faster continuous burst speed. All in all, the EOS 60D offers the best value for serious shooters in the Canon DSLR line. If you're considering an upgrade, you should be impressed with its versatility, speed, convenience of operation and image quality under most types of conditions.\n...................................\nAverage Selling Price: $1100 body only, USA; $1200 in Canada. In some countries, the camera can be purchased in a kit with an EF-S 18-135mm lens or with the more versatile EF-S 18-200mm lens.\nFor the full Specifications, visit the Canon Web site http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d\nTagged with:\n"}, {"score": 220.28456, "uuid": "8f6b8b06-4e7e-529f-8188-da1128fc2a83", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900wb-56-03148", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/one-of-my-posts-is-in-the-running-for-blog-post-of-the-month", "page_rank": 1.2154373e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "One of my posts is in the running <em>for</em> the SFDB Post of the Month | Pixiq", "snippet": "Recorded Cop o <em>Should</em> This Miami Cop Have Allowed <em>A</em> Woman To Use His Car As <em>A</em> Lounge Chair?", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nFor the fourth time since the South Florida Daily Blog launched its monthly Post of the Month contest in February, Photography is Not a Crime is in the running.\nNow it\u2019s up to you to vote for me or vote for another post if you prefer (of course I would prefer you vote for me).\nIn this month\u2019s contest, my blog post titled The People Have Spoken is competing against four other blog posts from the South Florida blogosphere.\nMy nominated post contains photos and commentary from the Miami-Dade Democratic Party celebration on the night Barack Obama was elected president.\nOf the previous three contests I was nominated for, I\u2019ve won two, including the very first SFDB Post of the Month contest.\nJune 2008 - March on the Mayors protest proceeds through downpour\nI also came in second in an extremely close contest in Cuba, Castro, Colombia and my Caucasian Dad , which was actually posted on my other blog, Magic City Mania, but I consider that an extension of this blog.

Of course by young'uns I'm referring to people who were born after Polaroid... >:)\nBrian Sweeney , November 07, 2008; 03:47 P.M.\nFilm is just more fun and digital is too much like work.\nFilm needs to place itself in the \"fun Column\" and the \"artist column\". Even the \"Image connoisseur \" column. We'll see how Ektar 100 sales go.\nHIE was mostly used for scientific/technical work. Silicon CCD's are better \"IR Detectors\" than film, so the scientific/technical community was an early adopter of digital. My first IR DSLR camera is from 1992. With most of the buyers gone, I'm not surprised that it was discontinued. Saddened yes, surprised- no.\nStephen Rosenbach , November 07, 2008; 04:05 P.M.\nExcellent, Josh!\nI too switched completely from film to digital, about 5-1/2 years ago. I too thought that I'd continue to shoot some film, but not a frame has been exposed in all that time.\nYour column might just nudge me to dust off some of my film cameras. My favorite is a 1964 Kiev 4a - I sorta thought I should use it every May Day ;-) I also have several Chinese (Commie) TLRs and a Pentacon 6 SLR.\nThis article by Ken Rockwell on how he uses film cameras is also very interesting: http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/free-digital-camera.htm\nBTW, I really like your \"gold Leica\"... a customized FED? ;-)\nJustin Ribeiro , November 07, 2008; 04:07 P.M.\n\"...film industry is healthy is ignorant or not paying attention.\"\nWhile the market for film is contracting, that doesn't mean it isn't healthy. Kodak recently announced new Ektar 100 35mm and Vision3 500T color negative film in Super 8 format. In the last two years, they've also revamped Porta and T-MAX 400 among others. In a recent article in Amateur Photographer it was stated that \"Kodak says sales of sheet film are particularly healthy\" and that \"certain black & white films are bucking the downward trend in demand among professional photographers in Western Europe and the US.\"\nIlford has also made similar statements in regards to their black and white film lines, going so far as to state in a press release last year that \"today's marketplace that has enabled black-and-white photography and its associated products and services to carve a defined niche for itself.\" They've even started a special initiative in support of ultra large format (ULF) photographers this year, and stated \"we will continue to champion [film] and do all we can to ensure photographers can buy the products they need. The special ULF two month ordering window is just the latest evidence of this.\"\nKodak, Fujifilm, and Ilford all agree that the market for film is declining (they've each said so either in annual reports, press releases, or interviews if you look around). Fujifilm stated in an a 2007 annual report that \"sales of color films declined\" but that \"on a more positive note...Fujifilm increased its market share thanks to the success of a sales strategy that seeks to take advantage of the exit from the market of competing companies.\" Ilford stated in a press release that, \"most photographic film, paper and chemistry manufacturers have been involved in the black-and-white sector at one time or another, but many dropped out as the popular market declined, leaving ILFORD PHOTO as the world's leading manufacturer of this genre.\"\nPeople tend to focus on the fact that there are less choices from the larger players, but firms like Foma, Adox, and manufacturers in China still offer choice in black and white.\nNiche markets can be profitable when pursued correctly, and that's what film has become. The business case is there to continue to make film in a niche market setting, otherwise no film would be manufactured.\nCiting Polaroid isn't a great example; they didn't stop making film because of a contracting market, they stopped making film because their business operations were poorly managed. Polaroid was in trouble long before digital; the lengthy legal battle with Kodak, that hostile takeover they fended off in 1988, and sales were stagnate as early as 1990. Their attempts to diversify their products lines were poorly conceived; their move away from core strengths in instant imaging and research and development was the choice that sealed their fate.\nI'd venture to say that film is not in it's swan song based on the evidence, but rather has shifted from a mainstream consumer market that has declined to a specialized niche market that is stable and quite possibly increasing in the case of black and white films.\nRonald Thain , November 07, 2008; 04:15 P.M.\nThe beauty about using film, for me, is that it is a physical recording medium. When you look at a photograph shot on film you see a physical object, in the way that a painting or a drawing is a physical entity, separate from the original subject. An all electronically produced photograph is, in a way, more like looking through a window \u2013 unless it has been processed or enhanced in some way, of course \u2013 because there is no intermediate material between the original and the final print or monitor screenshot. This gives it an immediacy that is in itself a remarkable thing, but it often lacks the sense of being \"an altogether new object, complete and self-contained\", to quote Aaron Siskind's words, in respect of his own photographs (although, here, it has to be said, he isn't making a film/digital comparison). In many cases it is the qualities of this intermediate medium that gives a particular character to the film image. When I am looking at a photograph directly recorded on a physical medium, I feel that I am viewing something actual, produced in a chemical reaction by the light rays reflected from the subject and, the older the photograph, the more poignant the emotional response I feel \u2013 in a sense it is like holding something of the original event in your hand. In this respect I am sure you will find a wealth of material even from 35mm SLR and point-and-shoot cameras, particularly the exquisite \u2013 and largely hand built \u2013 examples from the 1960s and 70s, so I hope you won't exclude them completely.\nPhil DeRosier , November 07, 2008; 04:33 P.M.\nYeah ... film *was* more fun. I can't give any decent example as to why, but it was.\nMost non-pros taking pictures prefer digital because they simply can't \"see\" or interpret the light source, and digital immediately allows correction for that user shortcoming (in most cases).\nBut what 'da heck: film *will* be gone in a few short years, and I will miss it.\nandy game , November 07, 2008; 04:38 P.M.\nI\u00b4m looking forward to this column...nice to see some new interest in film. I must be one of the few people who have never owned a digital camera. Until 10 years ago I shot lots of 35mm SLR, medium and large format cameras (all film), then I downsized to just a little Olympus XA. A couple of years ago I wanted to build up an SLR system again, but couldn\u00b4t afford to buy new digital, and picked up some great bargains in Caon FD instead. All those specialized lenses and camera bodies I\u00b4d lusted after 30 years ago were now less than 20% of the original cost and I could finally afford to buy them. I\u00b4ve been having a field day! And I just love the feel of solid, metal, cameras, with their watch-like mechanics.\nJosh Root\n, November 07, 2008; 04:53 P.M.\nI do want to reiterate my statement that I think film will be around for a long time. Justin made some excellent points that make me wish I had expanded on my statement. I agree completely that I think some of the \"big\" players may go away and be replaced by smaller companies. And in fact, we may even see the return of something like Kodak HIE or polaroid if someone can get them to license it (which they should if they aren't going to make it themselves) and a small company can figure out how to make money selling it.\nBut I do still maintain that the film industry, as it stands, is not very healthy. After a few more years of shakeouts and whatnot, I think some smaller companies will have taken over (or smaller versions of big companies). Once that happens and the market has contracted as far as it is going to, I think it will be fair to call it \"healthy\" again. Though obviously much smaller than it was previously.\nPaul McCarthy , November 07, 2008; 05:02 P.M.\nMy approach to the digital/analogue argument in photography is simple. Having grown up with analogue I now use it for black and white only. For colour I use digital. If some fiend robbed me and left me only one of my numerous cameras, I would hope it was one of the film variety. Each medium has great aspects to it and some not so great. Taking the trouble to learn a few basic principles of photography would seem to be more fundamental an issue that the sort of camera used and it is a bit of a shame that none of the user manuals seem to cover this topic. Has it become too easy and if so which is 'easier' digital or analogue (I don't have any answers by the way, only what everone else has - opinions and what are they ever worth?). Some of my best analogue pictures were accidental in so far as the result was inexplicably better than I would have predicted, so no matter how hard I try, I still have a great deal to learn. If honesty was the human default condition instead of an optional extra, I think we would hear a lot of professionals and other 'experts' saying similar things, maybe. Happy snapping.\nGary Watson\n, November 07, 2008; 05:22 P.M.\nAmen, Brother Root. For me, sticking with film was easy. It's abundant and affordable. There's a superb (young) mom&pop pro lab that's busy(i.e., healthy)just 15 minutes away. My photo group holds semi-annual \"Jurassic Nites\" with 6x6 and 6x7 slide shows just because it's fun. The not-so-sweet irony is that film's never been better. I won't comment on doctrinal issues beyond saying the \"herd of independent minds\" factor has made many unduly smug about ditching film. Looking forward to future instalments.\nTom Hamp , November 07, 2008; 05:33 P.M.\nGreat article, and well timed as well...\nI have just purchased a Contax G2 outfit...for the purpose of using it for \"point and shoot\" photography in B&W.\nThe initial spur for this purchase was a disappointment with the Canon G7's ergonomics, despite many upgrades. While this camera, and its successors, can give wonderful images, I find the rangefinder cameras (hand-held) to be far superior. And I cannot afford, or justify, the expense of a Leica M7/8 system.\nHowever, for me, the use of film goes beyond the ergonomics of the camera. It is about 'intention'.\nI _purposefully_ load the Contax with Ilford HP5+. I _purposefully_ compose, and filter for, the image for B&W. I _purposefully_ train my eye to see again in B&W.\nAnd I think this will change my vision.\nI was much disappointed to hear in a podcast by well-respected photographers that they felt that, if in an afternoon of shooting, they did not return with 1200 images, they were 'not shooting enough'.\nWhile this might be good for the professional, I doubt that these images were 'seen'. I consider these individuals to be simply 'curators of their images' rather than photographers. Previsualization is completely out the window. Everything is done in 'post'.\nFilm imposes limitations on the photographer that, from the point of view of cost, intention and final image, causes him/her to pause, reflect, and consider...is the image worth capturing? In the digital world, I find the image is always 'worth capturing' as the cost is nothing.\nCheers, Tom\nKeith Nichols , November 07, 2008; 05:53 P.M.\nFilm and associated materials may be readily available in some places, but my experience with film over the past few years has been to see my nearby color lab go out of business for lack of film shooters. And the lab on the other side of town, which gradually inherited all the film processing, soon reduced the number of runs per day for lack of interest. And the shop that supplied film and equipment to the pros in town stopped stocking film and darkroom supplies -- in fact during the last year or so I bought its last 14 rolls of Fuji Provia and its only light meter. This merchant was not averse to film, but his customers all grew up with or switched to digital. Film will probably survive, but as a niche in the art form that used to have no niches, but only film as its medium.\nBrad Cloven , November 07, 2008; 07:03 P.M.\nI've worked on the computer 40 hours a week for 25 years. The last thing I want to do with my hobby is sit in front of a computer for my free time.\nI fly fish with old English reels.\nI grow heirloom tomatoes.\nI photograph with an F3HP and now an Agfa Billy Record ('52 German fold-out 120 format 6X9).\nI'm sure digital will exceed film some day soon (that Agfa is a 100 MP capture system!), but it won't be as fun for me. I'll stick with film until it or I am dead.\nImage Attachment: fileHM0XSq.jpg\nRuss Rosener , November 07, 2008; 07:06 P.M.\nGreat column! Cool idea. Film is Fun, that's the bottom line. Nothing against digital, but film is the core of learning photography and will be for some time to come. We don't shoot it because it's easy or cheap, but because it's a passion, like oil painting or intaglio printmaking.\nAnalog Rocks.\nAl V , November 07, 2008; 07:06 P.M.\nThe contracting market sure didn't help. I was citing Polaroid because they don't make film any more... do they? If they are I hope they start up again with the Captiva film!\nSam Coyle , November 07, 2008; 07:36 P.M.\nI have so many film cameras that I have to stop to count. Regarding, 35mm or 120 film cameras, is either film in more jeopardy than the other? I too shoot Nikon Digital but prefer film under certain conditions. Thanks for the article and information!\nJim Simmons , November 07, 2008; 07:37 P.M.\nI shoot architectural photography professionally. I highly recommend to my conservation-oriented clients that I shoot film for them, as they do not want to be in the \"business\" of copying CDs every five or so years, hoping that the CDs have not done any deteriorating in the meantime. A museum client might have proper procedures for that, but a church client wanting a lasting record of a 1913 building they are replacing will not remember to do that copying. But they will have the film in their vault of collectibles for the next 200 years, and that black and white silver-based film will still be good. Film will continue to have important professional uses.\nTim Flynn , November 07, 2008; 07:53 P.M.\nI still use film, lots of it too... and I do use 35mm slr's, 3 of them, as well as a 6 x 6 bronica. Then too, I have a point and shoot digital. Like you said, use what you want - but I LIKE film. I like developing my own b&w and I like making my own prints. I'm nowhere near as good at any of it as other people are but I like what I have. I don't have the money to go digital and that is part of what keeps me in film, then on the other hand, since everyone is going digital, I have been able to pick up some good film stuff for very low prices. When digital does get affordable for me, I'm sure I will get one - each kind of camera has an effective place and time. The digital time delay does make a difference for some things I shoot, at the same time, the \"knowing right away\" if I got the shot has it's benefits too. Like everything in photograhy, if you want one thing, you usually have to give up some other aspect to get that (shutter speed vs f/stop). Film and digital are similar in my mind. Then too, I work with computers all day and don't want a hobby that requires me to use the computer to have fun. A good option that I like a lot is to shoot film, develop it myself, take the uncut film to my camera store and have them scan the negs onto disk. I can still use the computer to upload the scans but can also make my own prints. When computers get better and the updates are worth it, I might have the negs scanned again, but for now, I use both film and the point-and-shoot digital. The combination serves me well. I will be reading your articles... By the way, thanks to photo net, I was able to \"fix\" a problem I started having with film - turns out my chemicals went south but because of the forums here, I was able to narrow down, then pinpoint and fix the problem. Saved me three rolls of film.\nAndy Collins\n, November 07, 2008; 08:27 P.M.\nI thoroughly enjoy using my Canon digital gear, but I enjoy using all sorts of film gear, both for frivolous shooting and for serious shooting. Film has a look to me that's different from digital, not better or worse, just different, and I like both and fully intend to use both for the foreseeable future. This will be a great column!\nJustin Ribeiro , November 07, 2008; 08:59 P.M.\nI agree with you Josh; film we be around for a long time. If there is a market willing to buy at a price profitable for firms, then product will be produced for sale. Film is no exception to this rule.\nThe licensing of film technology could in fact happen. The fact that no one has licensed Polaroids film technology (in particular Type 55 which has been rumored to have been profitable) just proves how poorly Polaroid was managed. Had they continued to find ways to reduce raw materiel and production costs, I suspect that someone would have licensed. At this point, I'd venture to guess that a) Polaroid is asking too much or b) the cost to produce outweighs the value of the existing or potentially new niche market. The fact that Fujifilm could also enter the US market with their instant products (a lot of their black and white instant film is not available here) is probably another factor.\nIn the end, we agree that the mainstream film market is not healthy; film use by the general public will not increase. The niche market for film seems to be doing the opposite, and that's a good thing for those interested in film.\nI meant no malice in my original comment; I was strictly presenting a case in which the often doom-and-gloom story of film vanishing is unlikely to happen from a business approach. I'm glad that you're writing this new column and wish you the best of luck!\nCheers, Justin\n, November 07, 2008; 09:24 P.M.\nHi Josh,\nWould agree with what Jim Simmons above has stated in regards to the longevity of film if properly kept. I was sent a questionier from Kodak not long ago to fill in and was advised that 60% of pros in Europe still prefer film to digital. No doubt it is becoming a niche market and I don't see anything wrong with that as I feel that in many ways most pros try to offer a different take to their respective clients hence offering a quazi niche service per say. In regards to the 400 CN....I always keep a few rolls of 120 handy. Have used it as my prefer B&W stock, 2nd only to Tmax 100 which I develop my self. I find the grain acceptable when enlarging to A3 and have used it mainly for portraiture. In regards to the Holga...haven't had the pleasure as yet...perhaps may get one for Xmas this year.\nArtur\nHenning Serger , November 08, 2008; 04:29 A.M.\nDuring the last two years (from Photokina 2006 to photokina 2008) more new or improved films were introduced as in (most) similar time frames in the past (and some older films are back on the market, too):\nKodak: Portra 160 NC-2, Portra 160 VC-2, Portra 400 NC-2, Portra 400 VC-2, Portra 800 version 3, Gold 200 new, Ultra Max 400 new, Portra 400 NC-3, Portra 400 VC-3, TMY-2, Ektar 100.\nFuji: Fujichrome Provia 400X, Fujichrome 64 T Type II, Superia 200, Fujicolor 100. Velvia 50 II.\nMaco/Rollei-Film: Rollei Ortho 25, Rollei Pan 25, Rollei RSD, Rollei Digibase CN 200, Rollei Infrared 400, Rollei ATP 1.1, Superpan 200, Retro 80S, Retro 400S, CR 200, Supergraphic ATO 2.1. Next year a new infrared film without anti halation layer will be introduced, similar to the old Maco IR \"Aura\".\nIlford: Resurrection of SFX 200.\nFotokemika: Resurrection of IR 820.\nThe quality of films is getting better and better. If you consider inflation, films are cheaper than 10 or 20 years before. The variety of films is great, so much alternatives (much more than in the digital sector concerning sensors). If I look at the slide film programme of Fuji for example, there are much more different films than in the early eighties, when I started using slide film. I am enjoying film, and I will use it till the end of my life. Much more fun and satisfaction than digital.\nLarry Dressler\n, November 08, 2008; 06:26 A.M.\nAs a 100% film photographer who processes 95% of his own film I think I will stick around I have never heard a Swan sing before but I do know what a goose honk sounds like. *g*\nLarry\nRobert Schneider , November 08, 2008; 01:33 P.M.\nI was shooting 95 percent digital until I started up my photoblog. I made the decision to base my blogging (and personal photography) on toy cameras, vintage cameras, and film. I soon realized why I always had more fun shooting film than I did shooting digital -- variety (gear and emulsions), anticipation (waiting to see what, if anything, comes out), physical archivability, not having to \"process\" tens or hundreds of images that I don't want/need, and some indefinable warmth or roundness that film has that digital thus far lacks. I sold my DSLRs and have not missed them.\nAs far as I'm concerned, we are living in the Golden Age of film photography. Outstanding and fascinating gear of all types can be had for pennies on the dollar, film technology has never been better, and for the most part what's been lost can still found with some digging (I've been stockpiling Verichrome Pan and miscellaneous Polaroid emulsions at every opportunity).\nI too have an outstanding pro lab nearby that has diversified enough to stay profitable while still offering dip & dunk E6, C41, and b&w. They will gladly cross-process anything I hand them, soup 127 rolls, and they always return my 620 spools.\nIf I shot sports, news, or other deadline work, I'd keep a DSLR around. But for portraits, weddings, and personal photography I am happy to wait and see what comes back from the lab.\nGary Meader , November 08, 2008; 02:09 P.M.\nThe rant I start my digital classes with goes something like this: Digital makes it too easy to 'delete ' a photo that's not up to snuff in our eyes. So I'm concerned that if we're not judicious in the use of that button, in 10-20 years we may look around to find a huge gap in our photographic history. Not to mention the case of trashing every image of uncle Bob, hoping always to get a better one. Well, uncle Bob just stepped in front of the bus, and it's impossible to describe to the kids what your brother looked like. You need to show them. So, at least film images are physical, if imperfect. And if film is indeed going away, isn't that all the more reason to capture these physical images on film, since digital will always be there tomorrow? My two cents. Good on ya Josh.\nBruce Curtis , November 08, 2008; 02:29 P.M.\nJust a bit of info to help fellow photographers to find a good selection of film sizes and other supplies, is a very friendly company located in California that you can order from over the phone or internet.

Tannahill , November 09, 2008; 03:37 A.M.\nI love shooting film, especially fuji and Kodak slide film but just try to get it processed today. I used to have 5 labs within 15 min. of my house in Orange County Ca. that could process the film in 3 hours or less. Now I believe there is only one lab left and it takes a week to get the film back if by some miracle they manage not to lose it. :-(\njohn robison , November 09, 2008; 09:26 A.M.\nJust in the last 3 months I have started using a digital SLR. It's odd, but after the first month I stopped chimping as I quickly found out the screen is just too small to see much. For now I've only shot jpeg but it's sure great to get 350 shots on a card. Photography is only a hobby so I find that I still carry and shoot with my film gear. I've owned Olympus stuff, OM, Pen F, Pen vf, for 35 years and selected an E-300 because...well, it was cheap and could use my OM Zuikos with an adapter. All that said, this digital is the only Olympus I've owned that has no personalty. It's a black box, it takes pictures, and that's it. Realistically, when it quits it's just another disposable electronic gadget. Perhaps I miss that most in modern cameras. No matter their proficiency, they will nevermore be something worth keeping past their use by date.\nLouis Meluso\n, November 09, 2008; 08:07 P.M.\nI happily shoot both. You can be sure I'll be visiting Filmtown time and again. Good idea, Josh!\nOscar H. , November 09, 2008; 11:05 P.M.\nHowdy filmfolks! Great to hear all the different takes on film usage. I finally took the digital dive six years after making my first digital exposure with by best friend's Olympus E-10. Shot a custom Superman-themed bike in my living room. Lit for film, fired up the Elinchroms, slaped on a matte box (remember these?) and viola! I was hooked! I went and got the current Elements 2 and was able to come up with an outstanding image. The client was happy and I was too in that the immediacy of digital was what won me over. I now own a crew of Pentax K10D's and DA* lenses. Don't need the five grand Canons or Nikons. The Pentaxes do what I need them to do and and not when the weather dictates. I enjoy using them. But, I love film and what it does for me. I'll scout locations and experiment using Digital. Digital has saved me dough and time for the sole reason in that I stage and light for film. My plan has always been to do all at the shooting stage, getting it right in the camera. The last thing I want to do is to spend time on the computer fixing crap I could have done before firing the shutter. For my personal work film is the music for me. Film has class for me. Film has style for me. Digital has inspired me even more than ever in using film. Using film has also separated me from everyone else using Digital exclusively. There's something to be said about this old boy re-shooting on film after Digital. Long live my RB's, F2's, F3's and P67's!! As long as film is being produced I will continue using it. Digital and Film complement eachother. Just remember when video was to be the death of film, imagine a megamillion dollar motion picture being shot on a Panaflex with a CCD video assist to the director's monitor yards away from the camera. Then realize the film gets edited on a Mac loaded with Final Cut. They work hand in hand.\nJanne Moren , November 09, 2008; 11:58 P.M.\nI started out with digital. I had never once used film; the hassle of buying and developing film was a reason I was never interested in photography until inexpensive digital cameras came around. I've been a happy user of compact cameras, then a digital SLR.\nLast winter I did start to get curious about film, though. I'd been encountering film images that really impressed me for a while, in exhibitions and on the net. They - mostly medium format and large format images - had a completely different \"look\"; a presence and emotional impact far different from what I'd seen from digital cameras or from the 35mm snapshots I remember from my childhood. So I dipped a toe into the water and got myself a second-hand Yashica Mat.\nThat toe dip has turned into a full-body swim, as I now use a couple of older film cameras alongside with - and as much as - my digital gear. I've started to develop myself too, not because of a lack of places to do so here, but simply because it adds to the fun for me. In a slippery slope now more resembling an icy cliff I'm now considering upgrading my film gear to something more serious; a Mamiya 7 or possibly a Fuji rangefinder are possibilities, and I'd consider a Pentax 67ii if it wasn't so dependent on a tripod.\nAnyway, I think it's wrong to see the whole film market as one homogeneous whole. Polaroid film didn't have a chance, as its one major benefit - instant results - is also offered by digital but without the cost, quality issues and dubious longevity.\nSlide film is probably in a somewhat precarious situation as well. It shares a good deal of market overlap with digital, giving clear, saturated images but a somewhat limited dynamic range and abrupt cutoff. It's different, but among existing films the least different from digital and thus the one most in direct competition.\nNegative film, and negative black and white especially, is a medium very different from and complementary to digital. It has dramatically higher dynamic range and is by far the cheapest, most convenient option if you need really high resolution imagery. It's also cheaper to manufacture, use and process than the other film media. Negative film is likely to be around more or less indefinitely.\nAndre Easter , November 10, 2008; 07:29 A.M.\nIt may just be an \"Andy thing\" but like Andy Game (above) I have never owned a digicam and see no reason why I ever will. As long as Ilford stays in business I will continue to feed my FM2, my Rolleiflex and my Crown Graphic with the real stuff. Like a certain Canadian large-format dealer says:\"no batteries, no modes, no 18-month product life, no continuous upgrades.\" I can live with that.\nKozma Prutkoff , November 10, 2008; 02:07 P.M.\nFilm is going to be OK, the problem is the processing. Even that is not going to die, the good local minilabs will suffer, but in my area Costco is doing fine. As long as they are not messing up with my film I will continue. I know a guy who went to extreme and he is going to buy a used minilab for his own and install it in his basement.

Slide film is unique, and it is impossible to get the qualities of slide film with digital technique. The color brillance, color reproduction, resolution and three dimensionality of slide film are exceptinal and unique, when you are looking through a slide loupe or when you are projecting with a good projector lens. You can't get that with a digital file on a computer monitor or with a beamer. The color spaces of these mediums are physically limited. And the resolution of slide film is much, much higher than all you can achieve with a monitor or a beamer. I have projected extremely high resolution patterns of more than 100 lp/mm with my projector onto the screen. With very good projection lenses you can get outstanding results. Even with the most expensive beamers you can achieve only a very small fraction of this resolution. And you don't have the exceptional color brillance of slides.\nJonathan Dalton , November 13, 2008; 08:44 P.M.\nToo bad this has turned into such a pissfest between digital users over whether or not film is dying. I hope it isn't, it probably is, but what I'm more concerned with is acquiring more film gear almost every week not to mention all kinds of expired films, for dirt cheap or free. This is the golden age of film because everyone can use it.\nPatrick Mont , November 14, 2008; 10:29 P.M.\nI am happy that this was started. I love my film camera!!

However, I do prefer the older film cameras; \"Look, mom, no batteries!\" With an older film camera I can go out and not have to worry about carrying spare batteries along. I like to think of Film cameras as being \"green technology.\" Film cameras have a different \"feel.\" Prints made from negatives have a different \"feel.\" There is that moment of \"revelation\" you hang up the wet negative or wet print to dry. When all has gone well, I feel like the darkroom is the \"holy of holies\" in my temple.\nJames Morrison , November 26, 2008; 12:49 P.M.\nWhat I like about charcoal drawings:\nThey're art. You get one where the artist was really good and you get not only the image but also the feeling about it. There's a portion of the artist left in the image, the way he felt about what he was doing at the time.\nWhat I don't like about charcoal drawings:\nI can't do it. I am totally talentless. If I tried I would get a bad picture after hours of effort and no one is going to give me back that time.\nThe solutions to my dislikes: photography. But then there's choices -- should I go digital? use film? both?\nIf you know what you want and you know what the result is going to look like and you are confident and you received good results using that technique, use it.\nNo one is taking away charcoal, paper, or anything else. Digital will evolve itself being replaced by somethings else. There is no contest but for the artist himself as to what medium to use.\nI got to this thread by looking up information on Agfa Scala negatives ... go figure ...\nPaul A. - Los Angeles, CA. , November 29, 2008; 01:30 P.M.\nHowever diminished, film, and handcrafted photographs will be around long into the future. 150 yrs ago photogaphers were lugging their full-plate cameras around and, in my mind, digital is the first true revolutionary change to the medium.\nJust because you see a gorgeous young spice babe, does this mean the old wife gets the boot? Well, let me think about this!\nPeter Anson , December 11, 2008; 07:11 A.M.\nTwenty years ago in my profession, (musician) all the talk was that the era of tape was over. All recording would be digital. Today, both mediums are in use. Tape is hugely expensive and requires constant maintenance and hours and hours used up waiting, but it has its own inimitable sound. Digital is cheaper is much faster. The point I'm making is that film and digital can happily coexist. I still use my F65 and an old Praktica as well as a K100D and PS.I'm sorry that quality tape and machinery is only for the big players.but maybe I'm not. Come to think of it, with the time I save in a digital studio, it gives me more time for photography.\nJeff Henderson , December 29, 2008; 12:46 P.M.\nI for one love the \"look\" of film and am excited that I may one day soon be able to afford a Hassy so I can shoot square format and get that film \"look\" that I like.

Going to pick up the prints with my wife was wonderful, we grabbed them and quickly sat at the nearest bench to see how they were. My daughter (18 months old) spent more time walking around with the little photo album with the pictures in, than she did with any of the toys she received. She just kept looking through, naming everyone and I can thoroughly say that the experience of film is much more than snapping pictures, much more than photography in fact.\nPaul Gresham , January 05, 2009; 11:08 A.M.\n@Stephen Rosenbach - \"Chinese (Commie)\".

The lack of instant feedback, however, makes it much harder to refine images based on initial feedback or to fine-tune complex lighting solutions. Some formats (such as 4x5) are cheaper with film than with digital, though the same disadvantages of shooting \"blind\" exist. So film would likely remain in use by niche shooters or traditionalists, same as etching remains in use despite computer alternatives.\nBill Acito , February 06, 2009; 04:17 P.M.\n\"This article by Ken Rockwell on how he uses film cameras is also very interesting: http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/free-digital-camera.htm\"\nAs someone who has been doing this for the last year or two, I should note that my local Costco discounted the Fuji 400 6-packs in the last couple of weeks on close-out to US $5.97.

Just like analoque vinyl records vis-a-vis digital CD's/MP3's in musicville, film will continue to be around and have it's own profitable little niche & stable flock of followers vis-a-vis the digital hordes in photoland. Is digital the new king when ease of use or market share or future potential is concerned? Sure. Can it beat properly shot & projected slide film? Never ;-)\nAnyways, happy shooting everyone, be it film OR digital. And remember, whether you drop a digital or an analogue SLR on yer foot, yer toe will hurt like hell either way... Great column idea, btw. Feel right at home with me Contax RX's & Zeiss bunch! Can we now please move on and discuss all that great & quirky analogue gear?

What struck me in reading the posts is that to some degree or another everyone has made images with both film and digital. Also, the posters own more than one \"image maker\". Point and shoot? Sure, the Instamatic went to the back of the drawer years ago and the digital is light years better for that function, but most of us know what tools work best for what image making situation. Those who commented about film are correct, what is available now is so much better than even ten years ago. I really appreciate the skill of those who are really good with digital but I also appreciate those special individuals out on the extreme analog fringe in the \"Brownie\" group who still slit and shoot 116 size film in box cameras.\nWilliam (Bill) Crabill , April 02, 2009; 05:31 P.M.\nWell, my film days aren't over, I've a substantial selection of films in my freezer & local developing available. I'll provide 'ya with one of those intrinsic plus's when shooting film. I own & shoot Nikon gear. My Digital body is currently a D80, tho I've shot with other Nikons, Canons & several Olympus models I have yet to get that 'Feel' that a fine mechanical film body such as my FM, FE2's or F3hp film bodies posess. That 'Feel\" brings out my creative juices which I just don't get when shooting digital. Although you can do much with digital processing directly from your camera's memory card, I have no problem having my film developed & the results provided on a photo CD which I can then use in my 'puter for post-processing.\nVikki Goodman , April 02, 2009; 06:15 P.M.\nWhat an interesting article...I'm glad I found it and have enjoyed reading all the comments and everyones views. I am a film photographer. I do have a small digital point and shoot that I use for birthday parties, etc. But when I'm shooting a wedding or any other event for hire, I am most comfortable with my Canon SLR's. My son, an avid digital photographer, shoots weddings, etc. with me. I think they both work well. He takes waaaaaaaaaay more shots than I do and he doesn't come up with any more saleable photos than I do. It just takes more time to filter through to find the good ones.\nI truly believe that digital and film photography are two different art forms. As far as fine art photos, film photographers have the challenges of cropping, composition, lighting, DOF, etc. as they shoot the image. Digital photographers shoot lots of frames and then find the one they like or do all their composition on the computer. Neither is better, just different techniques. Personally, I think the digital photos are tooo perfect. Perfect photos are rarely my favorite..but then that is just my opinion. I get a \"feeling\" from photos shot with film that I don't get from digital prints. But, before all the digital photographers start throwing things at me...that is just my opinion..nothing personal!\nVic Reynolds , April 04, 2009; 01:52 A.M.\nOld Tavern Sign taken with Argus C4\nI shoot both digital and film, but I'm finding flim to be more creative. I've shot flim from 110 instamatics up to 4x5.\nToday I shoot with a 1950s Argus C4 rangefinder with Kodak 400CN, and it's great. Plus I still have labs near me-both consumer and pro. I also want to put a darkroom in my basement since I know how to print black and white.\nPlus it's still amazing to see old negatives from the 1980s still in good (printing) condition. I can put them under an enlarger (or to the local lab) and still generate images. What's going to happen when digital media changes from DVD/blu-ray?\nTrue, in the end it's a personal choice for the photographer what media he/she uses. But more and more I'm shooting film.\nArkadiy Chernov , May 06, 2009; 12:07 P.M.\nWell...here go my 2 cents for the column =)\nAlthough I'm still damn young to reach your level guys..but the fact is that I started shooting around 5 years ago, worked as an assistant for an advertising photographer in Argentina, and I was lucky that I caught the last good moments of film era. We were using Agfa 120 slide film (if im not mistaken), and the Hasselblad 500 series. The whole approach was different to what I ended up seeing afterwards. We did polaroids first, and bracket the hell out of a particular scene. The end result would be scanned by a third party lab, and photoshopped by us or a third party designer. I still remember one time when we actually had to re-do a shoot because of a messed up lighting.\nAnd..a year after that...Canon 5D came up to our hands. And I still remember that we were doing around 2000 shots per session (and that was a simple one), in contrast to 10 film loads used on a film shooting (that would be around 120 pics rite there). Efficient AF would save lots of time, and obviously the instant results were just amazing. The use of a handheld lightmeter became almost obsolete (dont get me wrong, we still used it a lot, just weren't as paranoid as before).\nAnd the subsequent shooting they were all digital. Just all digital. Digital forgives SO MUCH...what before one had to study and practice a lot, get an eye sharpened for a particular situation, for digital, a trained eye would become just a time saver and not a major factor for a great final product.\nDigital also hit the industry in a way, that now out of the blue...ANYONE with some extra time and little artistic skill can be a pro photographer. That led to an already competitive business to a scale where it is extremely hard to get into business and even harder to stay in one. A guy with a D700 and an off-camera flash system, can easily get a simple outdoor book shooting done, with almost same quality as an old pro, except that the young guy would charge 100 or 200 bucks for that, instead of much higher price that a good pro would charge. Result...old pros out of business. (I'm just describing a situation that I witnessed a couple years ago in Argentina while I was still assisting)\nBut the whole point of these upcoming column, is...FILM! So..now...what's good about it??\nLet's see...\nIMHO, education. Get people started in photography, strictly on film. That's how I started and from what I feel, it developed a strong composition skill, \"think before you shoot\" attitude, proper exposure skills (although, proper may vary), and overall a trained eye and natural instinct. Obviously after that, a natural transition to digital can be done, and from my own experience, things would come much more easier when it comes to massive and quality shooting =)\nAnd..last but not least. I use film as a backup when traveling It happened, and not once, (call me dumb, lol), I ran out of batteries, and I was in the middle of nowhere, (Patagonia, Arg...as a wild example). And had to grab my Pentax K1000 with Velvia 50 loaded in. And another use, i still remember how my digital Pentax started to run erratically when it got wet, I had to pull out my film body...\nSo that was just my humble view of the whole film situation for now guys..\nOpen for discussion!\nMark Jacobs , May 06, 2009; 03:26 P.M.\nI began using film well into the digital \"revolution\" and I love it, especially black and white and the whole darkroom thing.

The few companies with the right technical expertise were eventually identified, but it was extremely difficult to be taken seriously. The experience felt like working at a call center, making unsolicited calls for storm windows.

April 2011 03:19\nPulitzer Prize-winning photographer Brian Lanker passed away yesterday in Eugene Or. after a battle with pancreatic Cancer.\nI had the privilege of working with Brian Lanker many years ago as a young photo assistant in Boston.\nHe had come to Boston to photograph former White House butler Eugene Allen who served for 34 years under 8 Presidents, from Truman to Reagan. At the time Brian's regular first assistant was Ray Ng.\nThough I only worked with Brian and Ray on this one shoot it was one of those experiences that turns out to be a great personal and professional learning experience; and one of the many reasons why I have in my writings and workshops encouraged photo assistants to diversify and work with as many different types of photographers as they possibly can.\nBrian was the first photographer I'd worked with that actually did any research about his subjects.\nPreviously photographers I'd worked with just showed up to a location or met their subject at a studio took their photographs with little to no conversation or interaction with the subject and walked away with \"So-So\" images..\nI was to learn that Brian had read Mr. Allen's entire memoir during his travel time during the previous 36 hours.\nThis preparation allowed Brian the opportunity to relate to and interact with his subject, and discuss Mr. Allen's book and have him discuss some of his first hand experiences a great many of which never made it into Mr. Allen's book. (The only other time I would see this level of personal preparation would be a few years later when I worked with Mark Seliger.)\nThis behind the scenes information, the conversations, and life experience are what really made those early days of photo assisting great.\nWorking with Brian also taught me about Lighting.\nIt was this first time I'd worked with someone that didn't setup a dozen soft boxes and then wrestle with trying to control the light that would inevitably be bouncing all over the place. It is my recollection that Brian worked in a 'Subtractive process' rather than an additive process. Too often photographers will just add another light.\nBrian on this shoot used Dynalites with grid sets and Cine foil. This made more work for the assistants because we were constantly adjusting the lights to hit the moving subject as Brian wanted; but it also gave Brian the ultimate control over his lighting and how the lighting would interact with his subject.\nCredit - NPPA\nBrian Lanker won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Photography for \" Moment Of Life ,\" a small black-and-white photography essay that captured Lynda [then Coburn] giving birth via the Lamaze method, which was a newsworthy development in the early 1970s.

A second look showed that the grass in front of them was sharp. I was a victim of the dreaded Sigma front focus.\nMercifully I had a canon 50D, and a full +20 of microfocus adjustment solved the problem, although I could have done with a bit more.\nMy new 7D with +20 seems better. When I focus on a tree the front leaves are perfect as before, but the back leaves are better. A bit of back focus? If so I like it. You may be focusing on the front of a duck, but you are hoping that all of it will be sharp, and even on a duck the range of perfect focus is a few cm. On a dragonfly it is a fraction of a mm. Sigh.\nThe 7D autofocus can get confused. When moving from focusing on a dragonfly to a distant shot of a swan it just gave up! This is when the full time manual autofocus comes in. The shift from macro to teli is best done by hand. One quick turn and then let the autofocus take over. It's very fast if it doesn't have to travel far.\nI love this lens.

A second look showed that the grass in front of them was sharp. I was a victim of the dreaded Sigma front focus.\nMercifully I had a canon 50D, and a full +20 of microfocus adjustment solved the problem, although I could have done with a bit more.\nMy new 7D with +20 seems better. When I focus on a tree the front leaves are perfect as before, but the back leaves are better. A bit of back focus? If so I like it. You may be focusing on the front of a duck, but you are hoping that all of it will be sharp, and even on a duck the range of perfect focus is a few cm. On a dragonfly it is a fraction of a mm. Sigh.\nThe 7D autofocus can get confused. When moving from focusing on a dragonfly to a distant shot of a swan it just gave up! This is when the full time manual autofocus comes in. The shift from macro to teli is best done by hand. One quick turn and then let the autofocus take over. It's very fast if it doesn't have to travel far.\nI love this lens.

B&W has been the aesthetic (and practical) choice of many street (as opposed to reportage) photographers, because especially in a street setting with random colors everywhere, B&W clarifies the intent of the image. This is not to say powerful color street photography is not possible. There are many who practice it-but the novice reading these pages might do well to give B&W a try as well.\n, November 24, 2000; 07:00 P.M.\n\"careful use of on-camera flash\"? Excuse me, but the flash is extremely visible in the photogrpah.\nSamuel Dilworth\n, November 25, 2000; 06:33 P.M.\nThe flash light is reflected in two of the windows - the upper window of the door in the left, and the one above the [right hand side] girl's head. It is also reflected in the man's spectacle frames, in his watch's strap and bracelet, and on his shoe. The man in the foreground is significantly more exposed than the two women, and is rather flat due to the shadow less nature of on-camera flash. There is considerable glare on both the doorframe and the post supporting the rear window. I don't think flash was appropriate here; it was certainly not used carefully.\nWhen I saw \"Street Photography\" I jumped for the link immediately. I was rather disappointed, like others, that there are no black and white photographs. B&W, to me, epitomizes street photography. I could only spot one photograph (the first one, girl on steps) in which the subject was actually the person for that person\u0092s own intrinsic worth - a street portrait, if you know what I mean. Preferably candid. The one of the girl on the steps is good, although the sunglasses detract from it. Eyes always hold expression. Of course, asking the girl to take the glasses off may not have went down well. Posed street photographs can be good, but I have yet to see one that doesn\u0092t appear obviously posed. Pics of many different people, in different countries, all chatting on phones, are interesting for documentation, but to list them as teaching examples on \"street photography\"? The Venice Beach photo is interesting, in a different way. There is nothing candid about it - six people are staring directly at the camera lens. Nevertheless, it has got tremendous detail, and showcases a wide variety of human beings, young and old, male and female, black and white, fit and fat, introspective and out-going, and even a good ole dog (looking rather bored with it all). Colour was appropriate here. Well done with this one!\nAndrew Grant , November 26, 2000; 08:04 P.M.\nIf flash had not been used in that photo, the interior of the coffee shop would probably have been underexposed. Maybe a bounce flash should have been used.\nGeorge Bielinski , November 26, 2000; 09:33 P.M.\nActually, myself I like the way the flash is visible in that photograph: the flash reflection makes you aware of the photographer's existence there (then you have the media exec, two women, the dogfight and the photographer taking the picture). IMHO it makes the photograph a little more interesting.\nMichael Yacavone , November 28, 2000; 01:24 P.M.\nHey, if you want B&W, can't you just use the \"Desaturate\" command in Photoshop? It's a digital image at this point....\nSamuel Dilworth\n, November 28, 2000; 08:31 P.M.\nMy dear friend Michael, those photographs were *taken* in colour. The photographer knew this, and composed accordingly. You cannot simply desaturate a colour image in Photoshop and get a decent B&W image. The *style* of your photography, at camera level, must change in B&W. Try using \"Desaturate\" in Photoshop, with the images on this page, to see what I mean. A good colour image will nearly always be poor in B&W (and vice-versa, if you go to the bother of colouring it).\nColin James , November 29, 2000; 09:48 A.M.\n\"Smile! You're on Candid Canon!\"\nIf you're ten feet away from your \"victim\" while carrying an 80-200 2.8 lens, would you characterize that as \"shyness\" or \"cowardice?\" One can make a lot of successful arguments against PhilG's photography, but he's certainly not timid. Telephoto lenses serve very well to isolate subjects, and to preserve candidness - which many people feel (differently from you) is the essence of \"street photography.\" I use all focal lengths in its pursuit.\nFor what it's worth, I also agree that traditional street photography is done with B&W film, and that \"desaturating\" a color shot doesn't really substitute. All of the really good ultra-high speed films best suited for stealthy shooting are B&W anyhow.\nGeorge D. Gianni , November 30, 2000; 02:36 P.M.\nStreet photography? I am certainly not a specialist in classifying photography but I can hardly imagine that most of the above pictures would fall into this category. Whether they are taken with a 24, 35, 50 or 85 mm lens on a colour or B+W film with or without flash is irrelevant, as long as they express something about the subject. And street photography tells a lot about the photographer and his interaction with the subjects.\nWhat I can see in most of these pictures is a mocking attitude of a selfish photographer who was very very remote from his victims (not only physically) and sometimes felt uneasy. The Tsukiji Market picture could have been taken by a vegetarian who hates fish. The fruit lady in Costa Rica would possibly not like her picture taken like this from behind. And the young lady on the steps has no more expression than the plurality of dogs in most of the pictures. Strangely enough, sometimes I felt these photos demonstrate \"Dogs in Street Photography\" instead of individuals in daily life.\nBUT: I do like three of the pictures, actually Phil at his best. The nuns and monks along with that American (?) tourist with a funny hat behind the lady with a cell phone in Jerusalem, the twin newspapers in Tokyo subway and, best of all, the man reading newspaper in Dublin. If this one were in black and white, we would have missed the colour of his tie!\nt. bomba , December 02, 2000; 05:09 P.M.\nI'd like to add that I too take a lot of random photos on a daily basis. I started with Canon EOS cameras then switched to the Canon Digital Powershot 20 and now also use the Canon G1 with telephoto lens. Digital makes it so much cheaper and incites me to more experimentation. I mount the G1 on my car window mount from Bogen and use the remote to shoot while I'm driving. The car in essence is the viewfinder and I find myself circling the block or making uturns for better light or shooting angles. (No accidents or near misses yet!) The remote allows me to zoom and shift shooting modes and the G1 accepts the EOS external flashes! Give it a try! It also works in a daypack or briefcase.\nMike Morgan , December 03, 2000; 10:50 P.M.\nThis is turning into an interesting discussion. I can see both sides. I remember before I got into photography a young lady \"mugged\" me with her camera. I was fishing for musky, and looked the part. She was trying to be a street photographer, trying to take a candid shot, and I caught her. I scolded her, too, and when she defended herself with, \"well, you're in a public place\", I really scolded her. But now that I have picked up an interest in photography, and have looked at images, I like seeing candid shots of people. And I like it when the people don't seem to notice the camera (hence the word candid, I guess). Not that a candid shot requires anonymity, but many of the best street shots I have seen appeared to be taken candidly and anonymously. Just my opinion, which has changed over the years. Getting to know your subject first sometimes helps, but sometimes random shots of strangers yeilds good results, too.\nEfrain Sain , December 04, 2000; 10:53 P.M.\nFor another perspective on street photography (actually subway photog.) see http://www.davebeckerman.com/ and click on the article \"Photography on the subway.\" I like his writing and love his photos.\nIn addition, Jeff Spirer, a regular of this phot.net community, has some excellent stuff at www.spirer.com.\nNo offense to Phil, but the work of those guys is what I think of when I think of street photography. As mentioned by others, I favor the B&W aesthetic for this type of photography.\njoe bob , December 29, 2000; 06:37 P.M.\nThis is not a perfect fix for color pictures...but if you change it to grayscale or desaturate it then go to brightness and contrast you can make the shadows and what not more prominet so it looks more like a B&W.\nGerry Walden , December 31, 2000; 12:30 P.M.\nThere is a great deal more to 'street photography' than merely photographing in the street. These images miss the mark for me I am afraid.\ndoug kim , February 19, 2001; 01:38 A.M.\nWhile I respect Trevor Hare's opinion, I could not disagree more with him. Cartier-Bresson was known to have covered up his Leica when on the street to hide his intentions from his subjects. Andres Kertesz, whom Cartier-Bresson said that we all indebted to for pioneering street photography, sought to capture life at its most candid on the streets and cafes of Paris. Garry Winnograd also had the ability to take someone's picture without them noticing though he was more or less right on top of them. Read the intro to his book if you don't believe me.\nI would have loved to have befriended and talked to all the people that I have taken pictures of or wanted to take picutres of. But all of my photos would have turned into snapshots: people conscious of the camera and probably smiling into the lens.\nThe potential for street photography to be rude and exploitative is monstrous and this is something that I struggle with everytime I step outside. This is where I agree with Trevor. But every situation is different and there are times where I have refused to expose any film because it did not feel right and I have subsequently missed incredible opportunities. There cannot be any edict dictating what is right or wrong. These decisions are up to each photographer to make according to their own system of values.\nAnd I am thankful that Phil has created this page for us though in the end, it is very disappointing. Are there no street photographers on staff at photo.net?\nJeff Warner , March 08, 2001; 01:09 A.M.\nAh, the essence of Street Photography:\n\"This photo illustrates the advantages of the Canon 35-350L lens (a $2000 photojournalist's toy). I took it from the passenger seat of a car stopped at a red light.\"\nUsing only the equipment you can find on the street... ; )\nIan Cruikshank , April 05, 2001; 02:49 P.M.\nTrevor Hare talks about \"gaining a bit of empathy before shooting your victims\", and accuses Phil of \"hit-and-run\" photography. I wonder if he would consider Cartier-Bresson a hit-and-run photographer. HCB never tried to interact with his subjects or \"get to know them\". He didn't bother considering whether they would \"like\" the way he chose to photograph them. Based on the historical record, I'd say he pretty much INVENTED Street Photography. HCB devoted most of his effort to blending in, like a \"fly on the wall\", so he could get pictures of people WITHOUT DISTURBING THEM. I think being inconspicuous and unobtrusive is the most important thing in street photography. You must travel fast and light: no photo vest, no camera bag, one small camera and a small prime lens or two, no flash. If you really want to emulate the greats (Cartier-Bresson, Robert Frank, Winogrand, Evans), use a meterless camera and learn to evaluate the light yourself.\nMikhail Arkhipov , April 30, 2001; 02:27 A.M.\nWhy exactly street photography must be black-and-white, taken with wide-angle lens close to the subject? What a religious approach. This page contains great pictures and I specifically like that they are in color and are DIFFERENT from what I've seen. I am glad that it is not yet another traditional BW street photo gallery.\nGordon Lewis , May 08, 2001; 02:39 P.M.\nFWIW, the reason Henri Cartier-Bresson doesn't want his image widely published is because he wants to be able to photograph people anonymously. If everyone knew what he looked like it would give new meaning to the phrase \"celebrity photographer.\" You may think he's being overly sensitive, but imagine if Henri's face was as familiar as Ansel Adams'. He'd be constantly distracted by people wanting to shoot the breeze or asking for autographs. Henri just wants to shoot a few frames and continue on his way -- the same opportunity he affords his subjects.\nLeslie Koller , May 28, 2001; 09:37 A.M.\n>>This photo illustrates the advantages of the Canon 35-350L lens (a $2000 photojournalist's toy). I took it from the passenger seat of a car stopped at a red light. The rain lead to highly saturated colors. Canon EOS AF\nI had to buy my 35-350 lens. Some people get all the luck. What did the driver think?\nVery well done article, but I too would have liked B&W.\nAnanda Chaudhuri , June 27, 2001; 03:44 P.M.\nI live in New York City, and do street photography. I have nothing against colour but it can distract the viewer from the \"decisive moment\" that the photographer wanted to capture. Besides for me B&W is an advantage since I do my own printing and can make disturbing objects in the backgound less obstrusive.\nThe choice of lens does not signify anything except for the fact that it is only an instrument to capture the moment, if using a tele lens has better chance of capturing the moment isolated from the background and if it improves the chance of being unnoticed then so be it...I use a 70-300 and a 17-35 and shoot from a distance or from close range...but it is true that a street photographer cannot afford to be shy or be afraid to confront or pacify his subject in situations. In one situation a man in New York city in a fit of rage asked me for the roll of film...I told him to get lost and so he did while making threats of calling the police.\nI like to capture fleeting moments, candid portraits and this does not give me an option to introduce myself to my subjects with my visiting card before I take the shot...I believe that empathy for the subject - if important to the photographer - should show in his/her work...morality is a subjective issue, not an absolute one...I am not the one who can figure out whats on a person's mind if and as he knows that he is being photographed...did he like being photographed? Did he dislike but was too polite or shy to tell me that he didn't want to be photographed? Well...as long as I do not know, I assume implicit permission from my subject. If I wanted to find out explicitly I would be talking and not capturing the moments that I wanted to capture. I wonder what would Elliot Erwit do if he was required to obtain permission before he took the wonderful pictures showing the moods and moments of dogs.[this is not no imply that dogs are same or differnt from human beings as photographic subjects ;-) ]. As Elli Wallach said in the movie 'The Good Bad and the Ugly' - \"When you shoot, you shoot, dont talk\"...it was shooting of a different kind though but its principle applies to street photography as well.\nBut it is also true that the photographer can introduce himself to his subjects and win their trust and take pictures over weeks and months...this improves the chances of better framing, lighting and yet capturing the candid mood and the moment since the photographer is not viewed as an alien any more and can work at close range without worried about being spotted.Often I visit a place where I am familiar face now, at least to quite a few, and returning with gift prints helps to build a friendship. I can take pictures with the candid mood working at close range...sometimes point blank with a wide lens But that is fundamentally different from the pictures you take as you walk down the street while trying to keep yourself inconspicous.\nMany beginner photographers think that people dont like to be photographed and this may be true in many places but from my experience in taking people shots in streets of Tokyo, New York and Calcutta, I can say that it is not generally true...many do like to be photographed, many dont even know if they are being photographed and most apparently dont care even if they know. There are a few who are paranoid about being photographed and certainly I am not going to let the moment pass by making such an assumption. If someone finds out - as sometime someone always does since not everybody can blend in like a fly on the wall - and expresses dissent, I shall respect that. Although, in some situations I have also asked permission before shooting.\nThe street is a public place and the photographer has as much right as the artist with a sketch book making sketches of people. The problem is that the barrel of the lens pointing at someone could have a different psychological effect than the brief glances of the sketch artist.\nStreet photography is not about photographing poverty, squalor or misery, it is not about photographing homeless people on the streets, it can show humorous, funny, sad, joyful etc moments.\nIf the street photographer is a \"mugger\" as is suggested in one of the previous comments then HCB is the greatest \"mugger\" known so far and I would dream about being a \"mugger\" like him and of course never be able to achieve that dream. A true street photographer's natural instinct is to shoot first and to worry later.\nJuan Buhler , July 25, 2001; 04:39 A.M.\n> FWIW, the reason Henri Cartier-Bresson doesn't want his image widely\n> published is because he wants to be able to photograph people\n> anonymously. If everyone knew what he looked like it would give new\n> meaning to the phrase \"celebrity photographer.\"\nCartier Bresson is 92 years old. AFAIK, he hasn't been taking pictures for quite a few years, dedicated instead to painting.\nAs for street photography, I'm no expert, but none of the images in this page do much for me. An image doesn't just work because it is a candid picture of a stranger in the street. It needs interesting expressions, or action, or striking composition. Here is how I feel about this issue, with some examples of pictures that didn't make it into my galleries.\nI'm a beginner at this, and suffer horribly when trying to get close to people and photograph them. But that's part of what makes it interesting. A long telephoto would take the fun out of it.\nRichard Dean Williams , August 04, 2001; 06:22 P.M.\nThis is my first visit to photo.net and so far I like it. Everyone will see a picture or body of work differently, and have various interpretations of said work, and it is good that we can express our comments openly. However, I believe comments of Amanda Chadheri were to the point and exactly on target. I agree 100%. All this about getting to know the subject, etc., cannot apply at all times, as many great photographs would be missed. If you fully believe that you have to get to know the person, try street photography in the arab world, where they still believe the lens on a camera is the evil eye and will capture/steal their soul. I broke into street photography in Morocco, and it wasn't easy. Also, why is it called street photography? Why not just people photography, or moment photography, because that is what it truly is.\nJoe Photo , August 12, 2001; 12:22 P.M.\nI doubt that HCB had to worry about getting a model release for his photos. I like the shot of the lady on the stairs. It makes me wonder what she's waiting for. Who is she going to share that quart with? Did you have to approach her for a release? All of these questions make it an interesting photo to me. I've taken quite a few similar shots but never approached the subject so are they doomed to the albums I keep them in?\nJames Gleeson , August 20, 2001; 06:23 P.M.\nI don't know if you would consider this the same as 'street photography', but there's some excellent [what I would call] 'urban' photography at http://www.urban75.org/photos/, ranging from New York to Birmingham, England. They're mostly devoid of people but are still very evocative - almost as if the absent commuters, pedestrians, workers and residents leave a mark on the street even when they're not there.\nEric Riutort , December 02, 2001; 01:19 P.M.\nAn interesting discussion. Its all subjective - either you like the work or you don't. I've photographed both candid and interactive shots of people from Brazil to India to China. Sometimes candid is appropriate, sometimes its not. But if you don't shoot, you won't have a photo. It looks like what everyone is discussing is the definition of street photography - my question is, is there one and does it matter?\nThe links that other comments recommended are great!\nBrian Sharkey , January 11, 2002; 11:16 P.M.\nA comment on Trevor Hare's November 29, 2000 entry: He says: \"Sorry but I do not feel this page demonstrates street photography. The images mostly look as if taken with telephoto lenses. (Shyness or cowardice?)...\" He prefers to use \"a Normal lenses so the photographer had to interact with his fellow humans...\"\nOn the contrary, interacting with the subject can often disrupt the candidness of the shot. Real life changes abruptly when the subject is acutely aware that he is being photographed.\nTrevor adds: \"Also when photographing poverty try and preserve the subjects dignity...\". I agree totally, and to do just that, a distant shot often seems more appropriate to me. How can a down and out person's dignity be preserved when a photographer is in his face saying, in effect, \"let me take your picture because you are so deprived.\"? Cowardice to take a shot from a distance? I think it can be a sign of true respect. ---B\nBelinda Tan , January 16, 2002; 04:22 A.M.\nSome of the best street/candid photography shots can be seen from \"Life\" magazine.. Here, I like the shot \"Canal Street Manhattan 1995\".\nRay Cerx , April 11, 2002; 10:18 P.M.\nI find it very interesting that more hasn't been said about people and their right not to be photographed. I consider myself a very serious amateur. I enjoy photographing just about everything and have had a considerable amount of formal art training at the University of South Florida as well as technical photography training at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. The moral and legal issues of photographing people against their wishes intrigues me.\nIt is my personal opinion that everyone (excluding people who knowing place themselves in the public eye) has the right to determine how and when their image is used. The justification that an image is art or that the image could not have been captured in any other way should not be the justification for a photographer to use another person\u0092s image. It is a matter of integrity and I feel that anyone who violates this rule affects the integrity of every photographer.\nBabatunde Martins , May 18, 2002; 11:59 A.M.\nHmm. I have come to the conclusion that street photography is my favorite outlet for my lust for photography. When I first came to photo.nt this was the first post I read as the \"street photography\" title caught my eye. I believe that the idea of street photography is simple in that you are out to capture fleeting moments that describe an environment or people interacting and the medium in which you do this I think matters not. I first started my street photography using a 28-135mm IS lense on a CanonA2(eos5) body. This was fine as I was free and clear to frame almost anything that I wanted to at almost any distance(that 135mm would alow). I also had my hassleblad camera out on sunny days shooting street stuff and that was actually twice as much fun though I would sometimes become the subject rather that what was infront of my lense (hehe) I then picked up a nikon f3 and a 24 mm lense. Ahhhhhh. I found myself getting much closer(sometimes 3 feet) to my subjects but the outcome is amazing. I like both colour and blacknwhite film but I do feel that B&W film alows more focus on composition as to not have the colours govern the images. I have colour and black and white images in my folders here on photo.net if anyone is interested. http://www.photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=170873 http://www.photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=171338 feel free to contact me or tell me of more street photography sites too , I would love to see more !\nImage Attachment: BabatundeMartins.jpg\nSimon Shapiro , July 23, 2002; 09:51 A.M.\nThis article and the one on Winogrand prompts me to put down a question that has been at the back of mind which I find relavant. Perhaps others have a view to contribute.\nAt the most basic level the question is \"So I love taking pictures. Walking around I often find I see things as a sequence of pictures. If you capture all these images, what do you do with them?\"\nI feel Winogrand must have had similar feelings. Hence, a million pictures later and a third of them unedited. There must be something pyschological about capturing the image. But what do you do with them afterwards?\nDoes anyone have the same feelings or have some other insight into this matter?\nBabatunde Martins , August 02, 2002; 07:19 A.M.\nAs to what I do with all my street photos. I just have lots of negatives archived in folders. I dont print everything. Much of what I have on photo.net is scanned negatives. I sometimes will see someone I have taken a photo of in passing and give them a card to contact me, I give them a print as my own payment back to them (thats nothing for I have taken there image and If I show anyone and its anygood, thats promotion leading to more money for me so why not?) I have heard street photography described as \"the stolen art\" This is why I tend not to take pictures of the deprived for I see little point in exploiting. And when I have, I give them money, a lunch or a dinner for the guy laying in the street drooling/ starving /drunk, that someone photographs then posts here for self agrandisement gets none of that glory if hes half smiling or not.\nthomas scott , November 24, 2002; 06:59 P.M.\nIt seems a more apropos name for this subsection would be \"guerilla photography\" since the nature of the subject matter is almost a mystery until it's encountered. Furthermore, I understand the other readers who note that the flash is present in the picture. My concern is based on this. How can you truly catch people unawares using a flash in public? Don't they notice things like that? And do you have to get releases from them if you decide to exhibit or sell their likenesses?\nBabatunde Martins , April 15, 2003; 12:27 P.M.\nIn the end using flash or not will only make an impact on your standing once you have taken the photo. Using the flash will obviously draw attention altering the living aspect of any images past the first click. Not using flash may give you more chances at capturing the slice of life without the blast intrusion of flash. It all depends on how you wish to be in your environment. Do you want to document or become a part of it? It will show in the images. Personally I think that street photography turns quickly into outdoor studio candid portrature when flash is introduced.\n, May 07, 2003; 05:46 P.M.\n> Maybe this is why Bill Brandt is a legend and Phil isnt\nThis sounded like a very cynical comment itself. Legend or not, from what I know is, despite your disagreement with Phil, I won't be into photography today, if it wasn't for Phil. So, please give him a credit.

One of the Marxist axioms was that \u0093quantity will convert itself into quality\u0094. After 50 years of social experimentation the communism fell miserably.

The photographer knew this, and composed accordingly. You cannot simply desaturate a colour image in Photoshop and get a decent B&W image. The *style* of your photography, at camera level, must change in B&W. Try using \"Desaturate\" in Photoshop, with the images on this page, to see what I mean. A good colour image will nearly always be poor in B&W (and vice-versa, if you go to the bother of colouring it). UNQUOTE\nIn my world, a good image should work in both Colour & B&W, i.e. desaturate and it's still a good image.

This is an example of what future street photographers should not do. Perry's pathetic tactics illustrate what is wrong with street photography. I am a social worker who serves the homeless mentally ill in Detroit. I also do street photography with this population. I approach them respectfully and I intend to use their images for their benefit in the form of advocacy. Peep show voyeurs like Perry do not respect people. I'm not surprised that some one might be offended when he is shooting from a car window like a nature photographer taking a picture of a bison. Photography can be used to acheive wonderful objectives and also can serve to make some morally crippled individual feel good about himself/herself. The way Perry and many others approach photography makes the camera a barrier between people rather than a bridge. People do have a right not to be photographed. It doesn't matter if they are in a public place or not. If they do not consent to the photograph, your are shamefully violating their privacy. Some people might be surprised to find out that when you approach a person like a human being they usually consent to being photographed. Perry likes the seemier side of life. Perry likes the dirty underworld. The lower socio-economic classes are so heavily photographed because the upper classes have denied them the basic human tenets of individualism, privacy and autonomy. They are, to Perrys of the world, helpless fish in the barrell waiting to be 'shot'. It should be noted that the more priviledged classes have never been photographed in the way that the poor have because they have the financial and social means to remain hidden. Access to their world is exclusive. Access to the poor is viewed as a right to Perry, not a priviledge to be granted by the subject. Perry should know that these poor people are fathers, cousins, uncles, friends, co-workers and neighbors to some one. People in their lives care about them. People who know them care about them. If you want to photograph some one get to know them, even if for 10 minutes. Ask them their name, what they like to do, and so one. You know what is really sad? Many of the people I have met as a social worker and as a street photographer are more ethical and respectful that the disgusting Perrys of the world. They are often victims of circumstance, crime, systemic prejudices, unemployment, mental illness, substance abuse, and a crumbling social welfare system. They try hard to keep their head up and keep trying despite the odds. They hope, pray and beg for a better future. They try, fail, and then try again.

The first is that you would turn to immature name calling to express your frustration towards people you disagree with. This demonstrates that you are not capable of engaging other adults in a mature manner. I will, despite my reservations, attempt to approach you in such a manner. The second reason I am embarrassed for you is that you did not understand the basic concept I clearly raised in my previous comment. In no part of my comment did I mention legal barriers for photographing people. I wrote explicity and solely on the ethics of photographing people. Kindly read my comment again so you can better understand where I am coming from. There is no constitutional ammendment requiring we say \"God Bless You\" when someone sneezes but we do it anyway, don't we? Likewise, there are no laws preventing someone from calling a non-aggressive stranger an \"idiot\" but we don't do it.

I am a bit surprised nobody mentioned Digicams with swivel LCD viewfinders - Canon Gs and the likes. They make nearly perfect weapons for street shooting. You just keep your camera at the waist level and frame your shot without even looking in your subjects direction.

This is a non distorting fish-eye that allows me to get in close---up close and personal - for real! - If I shoot even three feet away from the subject, the punch is gone. Standing about 12 inches from this London lady added to the personal contact feeling for both of us. She enjoyed the attention and conversation as much as me. I did ask first if I may shoot. I usually do. I usually get a yes. Her sincerity and comfort was easy to capture this way. But, would have never been possible with a long lens. I suggest a short lens and a large smile to shoot with on the street whenever possible. I would also recommend aiming for cohesive messages if only simple ones to illustrate emotions or a state of being like; joy, despair, courage, love, humor, etc. See: blind leading the blind, for example. I find that a smile and a clear heart goes a long way to get invitations into other peoples lives. Even if only for a few moments in the continuing 'special world' of travel.\n- Cheers and good luck on the street -\n, October 29, 2004; 06:12 A.M.\nLondon street person\nHere is a sample of the close-up London Lady. Taken with 12mm lens in London August 2004. - Lee Mclaughlin\nkaren brookes , December 01, 2004; 12:57 A.M.\nI have read all the comments re - street photography. Some were quite harsh, while others were encouraging. I guess all though, like my own, are just each individual's opinion whether right or wrong. People have a right to their opinion, and in the same respect people have a right to privacy. While some may consider street photography voyeuristic or intrusive, others just enjoy capturing everyday life and that may include people on the street. I can see why some people feel uncomfortable taking a stranger's photo without permission, in case the stranger actually does mind. But sometimes talking to people beforehand, removes the natural behaviour of the person. When someone knows that you are taking their picture, they tend to play up to the camera or at least not act naturally. It can change the whole expression of someone and the way they behave and in doing so, changes the whole mood of the photo. Talking to the person and asking permission, may also stop them doing whatever it was you wanted to capture in the first place. I've always thought of photography as capturing that one moment in time, that will never be repeated exactly the same way. To capture every emotion and essence of the scene as naturally and as realistically as possible. In some cases you don't have an opportunity to approach people, they may be on the move or doing something that doesn't exactly need your input. (For example the dog fight outside the shop door in the photo above, they may not have been in the mood to discuss your photography options!) Rightly or wrongly, that's my opinion. If you are doing something in public, then you reasonably suspect that you are in full view of everyone around you, and that may mean having your photo taken. (Granted you may not want it caught on film forever for all and sundry.) Anyway, I guess I agree with both sides, it's a difficult argument between capturing a moment in time exactly as it naturally progresses and the ethical dilemma associated with doing something without a person's expressed consent. A photo taken in the moment allows others to see us as we really are and if we stopped to ask for permission, then maybe such emotive photo's as 'Arnaud Blanchard's' in the link below, would be lost and we would never have an opportunity to see the variety of life.\n, December 30, 2004; 11:54 A.M.\nTo preface, I'm no expert, nor do I do this for a living. I'm just a hobbiest. :)\nI would have to say that I have shot both candids as well as post-introduction photos of people going about their lives. I'm usually fairly close, and I'd say the subject usually notices me after a couple of shots about 50% of the time. Greater than 95% of the time when I drop the camera and give them a big smile, they smile back. I shoot everything from folks begging on the street, to well-to do commuters. My intent is not to exploit them, but rather to capture a slice of life as I see it. I neither seek out poor areas or rich ones to shoot - I shoot my surroundings. Under no circumstances do I continue shooting if I get a negative response (the subject holds a hand up or gives an unfriendly gesture or acts defensive) - however this rarely happens. Most often it is simple curiosity as to what I might be interested in shooting.\nIt is darn near impossible to get a proper \"slice of life\" candid shot with a subject who knows you're there. They might stiffen up, stop, smile and/or look at the camera. Their entire demeanor can change. While sometimes this works for the shot, sometimes it does not.\nIntroducing politics into this argument is unnecessary. Whether rich or poor - they are in public. Does this mean you should act like a papperazzi (sp) and get in their face no matter their reaction? Certainly not. It does mean that if you see that someone isn't enjoying the attention, you apologize and move on. It is fallacy to suggest that one must sit and ponder for days on the lives of those around them. I'm not concerned about whether they are \"struggling against a crumbling socio-economic system\" or whatever. That isn't what photography is about (unless you're a political photo-journalist ;) ). To me photography is about creating images that remind me of where I have been, where the world is/has been, and - decades down the road - what life was like at that time. What you might encounter in a day to day existance.\nThe ethics, I think, lie in your intent (are you Jerry Springer or someone who is interested in capturing images of the times and places in which you live and play - I wish I had such images from when my great-grandmothers and fathers were living), and in your actions post-shot if they notice you. Naturally I'm not going to offer to pull the film out of the camera and trash it, but neither will I continue shooting near someone who is uncomfortable with it. To walk down the street introducing myself to everyone that might fall under the lens is a waste of everyone's time - mine and theirs. Naturally, if I see a shot that I think might warrant more than a quick composition and shot, I might stop and ask the subjects if they would mind if I shot a few images. To those that abhor a candid shot in a public place - tell me you haven't ever taken a photograph that had people in it that you hadn't talked to first to make sure it is ok - not even at a local attraction or monument.\nThe answer - it lies in the middle. I don't believe you should stand on a city street for an hour trying to get a shot that doesn't have anyone in it that you might think was traumatized in the past or dumped on by an evil rich society - nor do I think you should continue to shoot if someone expresses a dislike. Just be polite and keep a friendly smile on your face and you'll do fine. :)\n, April 08, 2005; 03:13 P.M.\nStreet from Prague\nGoldmakers street (hope translation is correct), Prague, 1984\nGolden times of black and white photography, at least in Romania, where the film was developed.\nRichard Abrams , April 17, 2005; 11:50 A.M.\nI'm a new member who was excited to run across this site entirely by accident, and immediately subscribed.\njay rafiq , June 21, 2005; 06:05 A.M.\njay rafiq , June 21, 2005; 06:07 A.M.\nHaving read through this article, and after looking at some of the recent work in the street gallery, I have realised that I have long been a great fan of this genre, without knowing that it existed in its own right.

If the person in a photograph is showing their face and someone can recognize it, you MUST have a model release from that person if you wnt to have the image PUBLISHED. If the image is PUBLISHED with out a model release, the subject can sue the publication (which in turn will pass the liability on to the photographer). If the images will not be published, no problem unless you are photographing in restricted areas (some subways, buildings and France as mentioned). Somehow, this only seems to matter if the image is making money.\nMichael J Hoffman , January 06, 2006; 05:19 A.M.\nJohn Gallagher wrote:\n\"It should be noted that the more priviledged classes have never been photographed in the way that the poor have because they have the financial and social means to remain hidden.

I thought this was the worst possible method as it allows absolutely NO control over the RGB information. Arguably there are several ways to do this properly. However I choose to use the channels mixer as you can very accurately adjust the tones in the RGB space and control the B&W tonal quality. Try it.. you'll see. Therefore if you have an image that is just shot for colour (as one put it here) you can get quite acceptable B&W images from it.\nWilliam Fong , November 20, 2006; 02:38 A.M.\nIf people have the right to NOT be photographed in a public place, does a person also have the right for a certain gender, race, etc. to not look at them?

They don't trust what the photograph will be used for. David Beckerman follows a man for a few blocks (www.davebeckerman.com/Gallery-People/source/mouthwash.htm) waiting for him to spit something out of his mouth -- presumably the man doesn't know he's being followed, but lets think after hearing the shutter he knows. Would I (you) mind being that man? Probably not if you also knew it was David Beckerman and therefore believing the photograph would be used in an appropriate way. But what if it wasn't? What if it ended up being put about with demeaning captions or in a context that made you look like an total idiot. Analogous to a journalist reporting something about you in the newspaper that is totally wrong or out of context. People are right to be suspicious of use. I think the best comments in this thread have to do with showing respect, being serious about your craft, and actually *liking* humans.\nEric Wienke , June 03, 2007; 05:17 P.M.\nWhat makes street photography different from other forms is that it relies more on moments. Fleeting moments in time, that will never happen just like this again, captured for eternity. That, for me, is the key difference to studio, landscape/architecture, or portrait photography. So the most important element of a good street shot is the interestingness of the moment. Good technique, equipment, composition all can help to make it more interesting, but there has to be something worth looking at in the first place.\nThere are too many mundane every day shots that people capture beautifully and put out there for everybody else to look at, calling it street photography. Maybe it is, but is it really interesting out of context? Out of every hundred shots I take, about 20 have acceptable focus, lighting and composition, and out of those 20, maybe two or three are actually interesting enough to stand on their own. Lee McLaughlin's \"blind leading the blind\", linked to on this page, is one of those shots that I think is fascinating. Most of the photos in the article aren't.\nWhat makes a great shot? A great shot is one of those extremely rare moments when everything falls together and the photograph tells a story (without a crutch like title or annotation), AND the story is interesting and thought-provoking. Of course it helps if it's also technically perfect and well composed. If a moment doesn't awe you without the camera, then the best a camera can do is make it a bit more interesting to look at through various techniques, but it can't do anything about the moment itself. Now think about how often you run into moments in everyday life that make you go \"wow\". Even for the most astute observer there aren't that many.\nThe question about morality is completely out of place for street photography. The more interesting a person is, the more interesting the photo will be. It doesn't matter if the person in question is underpriviliged, because a good picture stands the test of time, and in 50 years when the person isn't even alive anymore and nobody has any idea who he was, it will still be interesting. That doesn't mean a picture of a bum lying on park bench is a good target - it's not a special moment because if you live in a big city there are millions of those moments. An old lady begging on a street corner by itself isn't terribly interesting, but if you happen to catch her arguing with a well dressed executive losing his composure you may have a powerful picture.\nI'm thankful for street photography, because it taught me one of the most valuable lessons in life: whereever you are, at any time have your eyes wide open and soak in your surrounding, because special moments worth remembering are rare and they come and pass very quickly. It doesn't matter if I have my camera with me. I'm a much more conscious observer than I used to be, and it makes me appreciate just being alive.\nLincoln Westermann , June 09, 2007; 02:53 A.M.\nI am very glad to have looked at this section under \"learning.\" I am inspired and this helps me realize that nobody will hunt me down for taking a picture of them. Also I like the hip shot idea, and my camera has a flip screen so discretion is especially easy. Most of my discreet shots are on the bus and are kind of boring, but then I've only taken something like 3. Also once I was taking a picture of an ad on the bus and the person under it was smiling after I took the camera down and I realized she was smiling for the camera, I didn't take her picture though, but that shows that some people are open to having their picture taken. So, thank you all for your comments and I am now inspired to go downtown and shoot some street photos, and I'll remember to change my camera to B&W mode :). Again thanks for everything.\nJohn Douglas\n, July 14, 2007; 12:22 P.M.\nIn response to the questions about street photography and model releases, the general rule in the US is that you can photograph anyone in a public place and either hang the photo in an exhibition or publish it in a manner that earns you money *** EXCEPT *** you cannot use it in a manner that explicitly or implicitly endorses any product. That caveat is a big one if you want to sell your photos because stock photos are usually used in ads by the purchaser.\nAlso, this is the general US rule, not the rule elsewhere. Particularly in Europe, as I understand it, countries often have laws giving individuals rights in their images, regardless of where the images are captured. Which raises a question about posting an image on the Internet that you have taken without a release, which winds up being viewed in, say, France. I've no clue what happens then, and it's possible that no one does.\nAnyone have any light to shed?\nRichard Nielsen , August 07, 2007; 07:29 P.M.\nChristian Harberts wrote that:\n\"In France, Article 9 of the Civil Code expressely forbids taking pictures of persons in public places, without his or her prior written consent.\"\nI'm sorry Christian you are wrong.

The same holds true for private property. If it's just being sold as art then there is no need for any kind of release. It has gotten to the point of the ridiculous though here in NYC, with many owners of landmark properties trying to extract every last cent out of photographers. The Supreme Court has basically settled the matter with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame vs. Gentile though. After Gentile the property owners stopped trying to sue everyone who took a picture which included their bogus 'trademarked' building. Still, even the possibility of legal problems will cause an ad agency to kill a project outright. -\nFirass Al Jundi , September 17, 2007; 12:42 P.M.\nI found this article very disappointing. It doesn't say a thing about street photography, and it gives very poor examples.\nStreet photography started in one way or another in the 1880's or so, by Eugene Atget. He went about documenting Parisian cities and streets, and occasionally he would add the aware bystander who would just pose very still for the picture.\nLater on in the 20th century, Subjektif (Dutch origin) photography started on the rise. This style of photography is an upfront and in-your-face, where the photographer would not be afraid to approach the subject, but he would always try to stay anonymous, so as to catch the subject unaware in his natural environment.\nCartier-Bresson helped develop and popularize this genre of photography, with his \"decisive moment\", but it wasn't until the publication of Robert Frank's The Americans in '58 that street photography took off. That one piece of work intrigued many an artist, including Diane Arbus, Garry Winnograd, Joel Mayerwitz, and Lee Friedlander, among others.\nCartier-Bresson was one of its more well-known ambassadors.\nStreet photography went on to become a social commentary tool. A lot of photographers would use this to capture what they thought and their critique of the environment around them. Friedlander would always capture humourous, witty events. Mayerwitz always worked with what he called \"content without context\". Arbus always worked with what she thought was a \"dystopia\".\nUnlike journalism, street photography is YOUR take on YOUR surroundings, as opposed to photos for a specific subject (the news article). Sebastio Salgado would go on to use street photography for his work on the goldminers of Brazil.\nStreet photography popularized the use of range-finders, those magical cameras perfected by Leica. The advantage of these, is that they were small (compared to what was available at that time. Don't forget, before that people used to work with medium format and 4x6 film, as well as SpeedGraphics and TLRs). These master photographers were human light metres, and would be able to judge just by looking at the subject what the exposure was, and how far they are, helping them pre-focus their lens for the shot.\nAs for the comments on here, if you want to be a purist street photographer, then go buy a range-finder, shoot in black and white, and don't use a light metre.\nTHAT is the true definition of photography. And it gives such an incredible feeling of satisfaction.\nFor a whole year I did street photography using zoom lenses. And I wasn't satisfied with my work. My instructor said the same thing. When you use a zoom lens, you are too far away from the subject, and you just capture a snapshot. Even if you isolate them in the photo, it is still a snapshot, as you only capture them in ISOLATION. Most street photographs are of a person in their surroundings in a dynamic situation.\nHere is a piece on Street photography, called \"Street Photography for the Purist\", written by event photographer Christ Weeks on his deviantART page.\nhttp://cweeks.deviantart.com/art/Street-Photography-38038974\nSee, the issue is that people go out and start taking photos, and call themself photographers. I find that very insulting. Its not just the push of a button.\nWe are not papparazzi and we should not intrude on peoples lives, but that doesn't mean we can't take pictures of them. If they don't agree, nod apologetically, say you're sorry, and run off. Or act like a tourist and pretend not to understand what you are being told. =P\nStreet photography is something anyone can do, but very few can become masters at. We shouldn't celebrate whenever a person takes a picture of something outdoors.\nThis reminds me of something else. Does it have to be outdoors? Can it be indoors?\nThats something for you to ponder.\nCan someone tell me how I can attach images? I'd like to show some pictures done by Friedlander.\nS Demetre , September 21, 2007; 02:23 P.M.\nI have a question which is of great concern to me: so far in this exchange, we have been talking about a common environment (for the most part) for street photography - the streets of developed western cities - with their corresponding implications for the technique and parameters of the street photographer. What happens to these techniques and parameters, however, when the environment is radically different, such as the environment of a country emerging from conflict, or staggering from extreme poverty. How should techniques be adapted when, say, the person holding the camera becomes an object of instant attention/attraction because of the large, expensive DSLR he/she is holding? or when the photographer is walking in communities so hard hit by conflict, poverty and social dislocation that many of the people barely have clothes on their backs (E. Congo). I ask this question seriously.\nBen Ho , September 25, 2007; 04:03 P.M.\nThe more I read about Street Photography, the more I want to get into the thick of it. I makes me want to do two things, get a 17-40mm zoom and learn more about composition. The more examples of Street Photography I see, the more I realized that my flawed idea of composition was opening up to f/2.8 to isolate the subject and snapping away. I know that I'm going to take hundreds of lousy pictures before I have any that are remotely presentable, but it will be fun along the way!\nJohn Oram , September 26, 2007; 11:54 A.M.\nS.Demetre raises some pertinent questions and prompts others. Good street photography often hinges on the spontaneous and unobtrusive capture of the decisive moment and for me this can best be achieved without directly engaging the attention of the subject and makes effective use of the telephoto lense. Undoubtedly there may be particular difficulties in doing this in the context of third/fourth world communities for cultural reasons. However, even in contemporary western societies that are becoming increasingly self-conscious of the surveillance of communities by civil and political agencies and the deep anxieties surrounding child protection such forms photography is increasingly difficult, provocative and occasionally hazardous. Moreover, how do we avoid appearing to exploit the difficulties and suffering of others for the sake of the photographers \"art\"? One partial and not entirely satisfactory solution is the very small unobtrusive digital compact ? myself I use the smallest Leica C Lux. The downside is that such dissembling only makes the photographers behaviour even more prone to suspicion and is ethically ambiguous. Finally, it would be interesting to hear more specifics about what are seen as the \"techniques and parameters\" of street photography..\nJohn Oram , September 26, 2007; 11:55 A.M.\nS.Demetre raises some pertinent questions and prompts others.

However, When I found Philip Greenspun's work - and photo.net -a few years ago I was again inspired to continue with my photo efforts on the street. The work here and the diversity of talent and input has been an amazing boost for me. I believe that the spontaneity and surprise of street photography is the most exciting. Akin to wild-life shooting. One needs cunning, and a ready, well tuned skill-set to achieve the best captures. Street photography is challenging both creatively and technically. Meeting this challenge keeps me growing. This is a motivation and muse for me. I am just beginning to feel as though I can capture something great at this point. (When opportunity meets preparedness) But, I also know I must keep my brain nimble, and my gear ready as I roam the streets. A heartfelt thank you to Phillip and the others on photo.net for these years of encouragement and support. I could go on, but the streets are calling to me and I have a new 70-200 f2.8 IS Canon lens to aim at the parade of possibilities here in San Francisco today. Happy hunting to all.\nSamuel Fry , January 09, 2008; 12:46 P.M.\nRay Cerx writes, in his April 11th, 2002 post:\n'It is my personal opinion that everyone (excluding people who knowing place themselves in the public eye) has the right to determine how and when their image is used. The justification that an image is art or that the image could not have been captured in any other way should not be the justification for a photographer to use another person&#8217;s image. It is a matter of integrity and I feel that anyone who violates this rule affects the integrity of every photographer.'\nI just wanted to point out that each and every one of us walks into the public eye 'knowingly' or not, the very moment we leave our front doors. It makes no difference whether you choose it or not. It's part of the world we live in. I have no moral problem with photographing people without their knowledge. There isn't a moral question to be answered here. It isn't a question of ownership. I do not think I 'own' my image. My image can be done with whatever it is done with. It is a photograph after all. Every time I go outside I am being photographed without my knowledge by all kinds of survailance systems. I would rather be photographed without my knowledge by a photographer. If somebody catches me in the act and expresses that they are unhappy about it I will respect it and I won't photograph that person. But in the end it isn't a question of morals, and if it is a question of rights then the photographer has every right to go out there and capture the images he sees in the city.\nThat is all I wanted to say.\nMark O. , March 02, 2008; 10:40 P.M.\nI would agree with some that the photos displayed here are not the greatest street photos I have ever seen, but no one should ever be put down for doing something different. I hate this mentality that one must always use a fast prime and Tri-X. Those are from the days when primes WERE better and color developing was out of reach for most people, including professionals. Many famous street photographers use Nikon and Canons not Leicas, with zooms to boot. For example, Dennis Stock is in the Magnum Stories book holding a silver Canon Rebel. David Alan Harvey frequently uses a D200 for his NatGeo work. The fact that many famous \"street\" images are shot on B&W using Leicas is merely a by-product of the times. I would hate some newcomer to photography to think that one day they will try some street photography, but first they will have to ditch the D50 (or Rebel, or point & shoot, or whatever) and 18-55mm lens they got from Mom for Xmas, not realizing that they have a far more flexible and somewhat more useable camera than many of the greats had.\nRegarding people's \"rights\" to photograph strangers I am at peace with it. What I am photographing in a public place is really no one's business but my own, including the person(s) who may enter my viewfinder momentarily. This is one of the benefits of living in a \"free\" society. I can easily accept that one day I may be in someone else's Flickr page or photo album and it doesn't bother me in the least. Who cares?\njohn cowie\n, August 24, 2008; 11:50 P.M.\nBoy do I love these criticisms. What does it matter what lens was used or if its b/w or color? The final image is what counts. Sounds like alot of wannabe photographers who read to much Modern Photography. [I know its out of print].\nAngela Smith , August 31, 2008; 12:22 A.M.\nI love street photography. Too many pictures loose there realism from over posing or editing.

Just now uploaded my quota of 5 images and they are all street shots taken with a 35mm lens - comments would be wonderful... see them here: http://photo.net/photos/AntSmith\njames perry , November 20, 2008; 01:53 P.M.\nIf I took photos of people in public and wanted to use them on my website, can I. For example if I were to take of photo of people playing volleyball at a public beach and I used the photo as part of my travel sports site. How about if a couple were getting married at a public location and I noticed them and took a picture, then used the photo as part of my wedding website showing my artistic photography skills, would I be at any high risk of being sued? Just using the photos it to promote my services as a photographer and since the couple was there at a public park, could I have taken the photos?\nHere is what I heard - Nobody's going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers to collect a few hundred in damages. If you use the image and they raise a stink and you don't stop using the image, they will have their lawyer send you a letter to cease and desist. That's required. If you don't desist, then they can try to sue. I guess if the person ever noticed themselves, all they could do is ask me to take it off and if I did take if off the website, nothing much more to be afraid of then, right? Also, The wedding dresses, tuxedos, rings, chairs, tables, tents... are all someone's intellectual property. Are wedding dress designers suing photographers who use images of their dresses on their website? How about the chair or table company? For that matter, architecture is intellectual property. If a photographer takes a photo of a couple and there is a building in the background, the owner of the building could also sue the photographer then right? The copyright office states : Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in fixed form. The copyright in the work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author who created the work. Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can rightfully claim copyright. So therefore \"unless there is an agreement to the contrary, every photographer has copyright and control of the image they take, even if someone already paid them.\" Right? I heard that in ADVERTISING - When people are recognizable in public domain photos, the photos cannot legally be used for commercial purposes. But I also heard that In the U.S., street photographs, taken of people and things visible on the street, in circumstances where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, can be published, displayed, and sold as \"art\" (as distinct from their use for advertising, promotion, or \"commerce\") without obtaining permission of the people photographed. In fact, a New York State Supreme Court judge recently made judgement on a case and said that the photographer's right to artistic expression trumped the subject's privacy rights. New York state right-to-privacy laws prohibit the unauthorized use of a person's likeness for commercial purposes, that is, for advertising or purposes of trade. But they do not apply if the likeness is considered art. I would be just using the photos of a bride and groom or people playing volleyball to show my artistic services as a photographer. What do you think? \"If the law were to forbid artists to exhibit their photographs made in public places without the consent of all who might appear in those photographs, \"then artistic expression in the field of photography would not be protected under the freedom of speech and freedom to perform art would suffer drastically\" right? Most courts have consistently found \"art\" to be constitutionally protected free speech. If I show off my artistic ability is it alright? A profit motive in itself does not necessarily compel a conclusion that art has been used just for trade purposes. Can a photographer therefore be allowed to show one person's existance to another? It doesn't matter if it's a photo of a war, or whatever......it's a function (and personal freedom) of photograhers everywhere to show the world, the existance of the rest of the world, even on their website right?. Can it also be considered news worthy that people get married here at this place for example? I am showing off my art and telling the news of what is happening at this location (freedom of the press). The public areas of the United States.....anyhow.....are for everyone's use..........including photographers. Taking a picture of another person in a public does absolutely nothing to impede that other person of their rights. Stopping the photographer from taking those pictures, impedes their rights of expression....and again, using those pictures in an artistic pursuit, including selling photographs of art work from them, and putting them in a book form is an extension of that pursuit of happiness. Once the photographer takes the picture, it is their picture............not the subjects. People are photographed everyday on buses, at ATM's, at intersections walking into convenience stores, etc... In the book: Legal Handbook for Photographers: The Rights and Liabilities of Making Images\" by Bert Krages. The short answer is you can take anyone's photo in a public place where they are also in public view, and you can publish their photo in a book of street photography without their permission (or post it on your web site). How about all the artistic \u201cstreet photographers out there\u201d? I thought that I could take photos and show off my art work on the web. This is called the \"pursuit of happiness\"..doing something you enjoy doing, that doesn\u2019t harm anybody else..and there is a rather famous document that says you have the right to pursue that in the USA. \"As soon as the shutter clicks....\" copyright belongs to the photographer. These photos would be exhibited on my website for my photo business as examples of my 'art'. Just think at any wedding, you would have to get a \u201cmodel or other release\u201d from the bride and groom, plus each family member or guardian, table makers, chair makers, flower arrangement company, wedding dress maker, church owner, silverware company, any owners of buildings in the background, etc... I could argue that a wedding or volleyball game is publishable in a newspaper as an event that took place. To quote Benjamin Franklin, \"Those who would exchange freedom for security deserve neither'. So here it is again: If I were to take of photo of people playing volleyball at a public beach and I used the photo as part of my travel sports website site. How about if a couple were getting married at a public location and I noticed them and took a picture, then used the photo as part of my wedding website showing my artistic photography skills, would I be at any high risk?\nThanks Jenny email farminsarin8@hotmail.com\nNathan Rupert , November 22, 2008; 11:28 A.M.\nPerry A: \"for those who stick to photographing \"safe\" people, ( and for those knuckelheads who wonder what i mean by \"safe\", i mean your typically white middle class surburbanite)\".\nWould a black middle class suburbanite mug you and beat you up?\nBill Ferensen\n, December 03, 2008; 11:58 A.M.\n\"Garry Winogrand is famous for having exposed three rolls of Kodak TRI-X black and white film on the streets of New York City every day for his entire adult life.\"\nNot true.

I can do all the things recommended and enjoy being a purist with my 50/1.8 and 35/2. I can get the same framing as the legends and yes, it does make you learn. Bresson set his 50mm to focus at 4 meters and his film speed at 125. Then all he had to do was adjust the aperture as the light or scene changed. He found that 4m for the 50 was ideal...close enough to be part of the image, but not so close as to intimidate. At 4m he got the full person in the picture. he also deliberate overexposed by a full stop...it could be corrected in the darkroom, but he also got some light from the shadows.

To create a street photography it includes visionary mind that can create unique composition image.\nTristan Bass-Krueger , January 14, 2011; 05:38 A.M.\nJust got my first camera and started street photography about a week ago. As far as B & W photography, I decided I'm not going to use it. It often looks better, and it does give an image that iconic street photography quality, but I see it--for myself at least-- as a bit of a cop out. It's somehow too incongruous with the 21st century (yes, I know they used to see in color back then too), and if I used it, it'd be too much of an attempt to recreate a distinctive look and feel. From what little I've done so far, color can make a photograph seem much less like a work of photography, but it can also make a photograph more like the world as I see it. But maybe I'll change my mind later on.\nAlso, I'm going to have to get used to angry people. Within the first few days, I had my camera grabbed and some guy yelling that he was going to call the police. You may think I must have done something wrong, but all I did was take a quick shot of a man and woman on a Parisian sidewalk (not like I was up in his face or anything). He didn't even seem like the angry type beforehand, so I was a little surprised.\nA little more predictable, but still annoying, is that cops and officials in positions of authority don't like having their picture taken and think that it is within their right to tell you to erase said picture. I got yelled at by a guard outside the French Congress, who left his post and crossed the street (I must have been a full 40 ft away) to tell me that I should have asked his permission first (he was a human being too dammit!) and that I had to get rid of my picture immediately. He was actually a little abusive, I dare say. Also, a traffic cop and a military guard outside of Sacre Coeur posed the same problems. Ironically, they all think that the law is on their side. Since they represent the law to some extent, there's not much you can do about it. But I think it's different for me because I'm young and people just naturally assume that I'm up to no good.\nReading all the comments here is very informative. I hope to learn much from all of you as I get started! I must say, I'm not a fan of all the pictures in the original post. A lot of them just seem like snapshots taken in the street.\nAndrew Prokos , February 21, 2011; 03:34 P.M.\nOpera Watchers, Times Square NYC\nVery informative coverage of street photography and the problems it entails.

For the sake of Competition a few basic points regarding the \"definition\" of SP brings some clarity. Specially the point so many people make on the Photo.net disccusion above. As I understand it, one important aspect of SP is NOT the relationship of the photographer with his Subject, but the RELATIONSHIP between people and between people and objects and people and their environment and objects to objects (where people are absent) that is crucial.

The wide open apeture is f3 at the long end of the G3 and f2.5 at the long end of the G2. I have the G2 and the 10D slr and get great shots with both.

I think Canon should have kept the G2 as the current model until it was able to have more of an advance like the 5MP G5. With the S50 (which I own and love) out, there really is no reason for a 4MP camera of the size of the G3.\nDavid Vatovec , June 15, 2003; 02:15 P.M.\nI am all over very pleased with the G3 performance - i`m one of those who bought their first digicam (i am an EOS user) The digital EOS bodies are prohibitive in price back here(i`m not a pro).

But the image quality was a big negative surprise for me - especially the chromatic aberration (or color fringing) which i don`t know if it`s lens produced or CCD inherent - that little magenta aureola which encircles subjects photographed against light (my favourite shooting method outdoors), which is visible in your published bird photo (to a minor extent) - that kind of design mistake is unacceptable in even the cheapest film cameras! Another surprise was the shutter lag which is very long compared to my 6 year old EOS 50E or even 20 year old AV-1! However besides this i have no other \"minuses\" to pinpoint. When i was buying a digicam a month ago it seemed the best solution for the money i had (cca 850 EUR from where i am) - and i`m still positive about my decision however i didn`t tried the camera in my typical shooting conditions - do that if you are buying your first digicam (at least you won`t be surprised as i was). So the G3 left me with mixed feelings.\nI have 2 more questions:\n- what is the CCD color capture mode (speaking of RAW files here) 8 bit or 12 bit?\n- how do i make a bigger enlargment then 15x20cm since my local lab uses Fuji Frontiers which accepts only 300 dpi files at the final enlargment - the camera limit resolution seems like said above - do i have to resize the image in PS - or is there any other solution?\nSundeep Arole , June 16, 2003; 12:12 A.M.\nAm I the only one who still likes to shoot by composing through the viewfinder? The G3 has a major design flaw in this regard - the viewfinder is significantly obstructed by the lens! I've read the reviews, and nobody either mentions this at all or otherwise only mentions it in passing like it is no big deal. Not so with me, anyway - as soon as I looked through the viewfinder I knew this model was not for me. I returned the model and decided to purchase the G2 instead.\nStefan Engstr\u00f6m , June 16, 2003; 01:09 A.M.\nThe G3 saves 12 bits per channel for the raw format, good to use if you know you are going to want to squeeze out all the dynamic range you can get from the camera.\nThe lens obstructs the viewfinder field and it gets worse when you put on the lensmate adapters for filters etc, especially the 58 mm one. It also obscures the built-in flash rather badly. www.lensmateonline.com tells you how bad it is depending on what focal length you are using of the zoom lens (it is ok for tele but horrible for wide-angle). I use the adapters myself and they are great, but I find myself using the LCD screen most of the time. That is what you need to do to get accurate framing anyway...\nDavid Vatovec , June 16, 2003; 02:18 A.M.\nHmm, thank you for clearing that Stefan - but where did u find out that is 12 bit? And what should i then do, since the bundled software can convert only to 8 or 16 bit (where does the info for a 16 bit pic come from and why there is no 12 bit save/convert setting?) - at 8 bit the colors are far from remarkable, and i didn`t see much difference in saving at 16 bit - but didn`t make that many pics either. Yes the lens obstruction is an issue if you compose through the viewfinder (which only covers about 83% of the CCD coverage i think) - but i didn`t buy a digital camera for composing through the vievfinder!\nJim Larson , June 16, 2003; 09:26 A.M.\nNice review.\nReading this review, did I not see any comments about the LCD screen, besides the obligatory \"It drains the battery faster\".\nOne of the *biggest* advantages of the \"G\" series is the flip-out, rotary LCD screen. Using the viewfinder may be fine for some, but for others the ability to hold the camera 3 feet over your head and still be able to perfectly compose the shot is awe inspiring!\nIs there any feedback regarding this cameras ability to use hotshoe speedlight flashes? This is another major feature of this camera\nPierre Lachaine\n, June 16, 2003; 09:44 A.M.\nThanks for the review. I considered buying this camera during the Spring of 2003. I had been wanting a \"rangefinder\"-like digital camera to play the same role that my Polaroid cameras always played (SX-70, Spectra 2000), sort of as fun snapshooting supplement to my SLR system. However, I had the use of a Canon S30, S40 and S45 for a short while, with the S45 being virtually a G3 in sheep's clothing, and when I look at the photos posted as part of the review, I see exactly the same, vaguely-definable creamy softness that I saw in pictures I took with the S45. I've seen examples of the same thing made from other makes of 4 megapixel cameras. It's like the picture is very smooth, ie. no grain, but this smoothness is almost an illusion. The resolution just isn't there to take advantage of the lack of grain. I guess smoothness without detail is how I would describe what I see. It will be interesting to see if the G3's successor, the recently-announced G5, will be able to overcome this with its 5 megapixels. So far, I've found that on my computer monitor at least, 2400dpi flatbed scans of my 35mm negatives look much more snappy than the many pics I took with the S45, and the S45 pics look very much like the pics in this review. A few other 4 megapixel cameras I've looked attempt to overcome the resolution limitation by producing punchier colours than the Canons, but the result is a vaguely artificial look instead of the latter's vaguely smooth look. Given that, the quality of the pictures vs the price of these cameras just isn't good enough yet. For people accustomed to good lenses on 35mm SLRs, I suspect 5 megapixels may not be enough either, at least not when coming from the APS-sized CCDs. I do like the look and design of the G3 camera itself though. It reminds me of the compact rangefinders of the 1970s, expect that it is perhaps larger overall. It's larger when seen in person compared to the impression you get from pictures of it.\nStefan Engstr\u00f6m , June 16, 2003; 12:09 P.M.\nRe. the 8/12/16 bit issue - I'm not sure what file formats are able to specify 12 bits, and then what software would be able to use it without converting to 16 bits first anyway... I suppose the 4 bits are just filled in with zeros in the conversion to 16 bit tiffs. How did you compare them? I am limited hardware-wise, but the monitors I have access to are all limited to 8 bit channel depths. The advantage for me is to be able to stretch a colormap without too large increments in the final 8-bit/channel map.\nRe. the flash - the Speedlite 420 I have works really well with the G3, and I really like the colors I get out of that combination when I bounce off of white walls and ceilings.\nImage Attachment: img_1152.jpg\nJosep Jordi , June 16, 2003; 12:20 P.M.\nI just purchased a G3, last week. I already had a Canon A40, and was very happy with it: easy menus, good quality pictures (it was only 2Mpix), although a bit too big to be in a pocket. I find the same characteristics in the G3, as in 1/2 hour I was able to do what I previously did with the A40. Everything from then is new features and good features: very good lens (f2-f3!); I love the swinging screen; good flash possibilities; low consumption of the battery; fast response (compared to the A40). Drawbacks: I don't like the lens cover, it easily falls; only a 32Mb card; (only) 4Mpix.\nRobert Turner , June 16, 2003; 11:15 P.M.\nHow is the \"shutter lag\" of the G3 compared to Powershot point & shoots, and for that matter, to faster digicams such as the 10D? The \"digital delay\" so many cameras exhibit can really ruin otherwise terrific images.\nThanks, Robert\nDennis Fraser-Jones , June 16, 2003; 11:17 P.M.\nJust like to comment on the good review. Regarding the flash: I have just purchased a 220 speedlight & it seems to well suited to the G3. Less redeye, the usual shadow from the bottom right of the frame is eliminated and the AF focus assist is augmented by the one on board the flash. I've tried the larger 550 speedlight from my eos but its much too big & bulky. I haven't noticed the halo (chromatic aberration) effect much but I don't often shoot at max. aperture. Regarding the viewfinder: One of the reasons I bought the G3 was that it had an optical viewfinder (and AF assist& full manual control & raw & etc.), not because I anticipated using it much but in low light or for conserving batteries it is indispensible.\nSteve Hovland , June 16, 2003; 11:41 P.M.\nRegarding the manual focus:\nOn my A70, which may have similar software, you can shift to a central focus spot, partly hold down the shutter button to get focus, and then press the manual focus button to lock the focus.\nRead the manual carefully to see if this option is available for the G3.\nDavid Vatovec , June 17, 2003; 04:28 A.M.\nThis is not manual focus but focus lock! Yes the G3 has it. By the way i just found out that neatimage makes miracles with noisy images - so the 400 ISO setting on the G3 isn`t an issue any more (at least for me). Hey what size of prints did u folks make out of a G3?\nJim Lipsey , June 17, 2003; 11:25 A.M.\nPortrait Photography with G3\nA nice review, but I disagree with the statements regarding portrait photography and the G3. I have gotten very decent portrait photos from my G3, thanks to the built in neutral-density filter, which the review does not mention. The G3's ND filter can be turned on or off and uses an actual filter within the camera body, not a software algorithm. This allows me to zoom in and open up the aperture on a sunny day and get a well-exposed shot with nice softening in the background. Furthermore, the G3 optics exhibit excellent bokeh (rendering of out-of-focus elements). So, with the proper settings, this camera can render very nice portraits.\nSteve Hovland , June 17, 2003; 02:54 P.M.\nFor a focus aid, draw some lines on a business card or 3x5 - horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.\nPlace it in your set where you want the focus point. Zoom in and focus.\nRodger Donaldson , June 17, 2003; 07:45 P.M.\nI'm very fond of my G3 - although a little annoyed that I bought it literally only a fortnight before the G5 was announced - thus far, but I would point out that the bundled 32 MB card is all but worthless, especially shooting RAW. You'll probably want to factor in purchasing a 128 MB card at a minimum; I picked up a 512 MB card, which is good for 120-odd RAW images.\nRuss Rosener , June 18, 2003; 02:37 A.M.\nThe G3 came out in the U.S. last Fall. At the time I was trying to decide between purchasing it for $100.00 more or the older G2. I went with the G2 because I reasoned that the G3 was just an interim model until Canon got the 5 megapixel G camera out the next summer...looks like the G5 is that camera. Am I supposed to believe that Canon did not already know they would have a 5 MP camera out a few months later? No doubt the G3 is a good camera, but it's amazing to me that a major camera company would so blatantly market such an obvious example of \"Planned Obsolescence\". As always, \"Caveat Emptor\".\nEdward Lake , June 18, 2003; 02:00 P.M.\nI recently received a G3 as a gift. I've only used it for about 3 days now, but I have some comments to make regarding some of the things other people have said about it. I find it to be somewhat small. I compared it to my Nikon SP and it's about a half-inch narrower and about a quarter-inch shorter. However, it's much lighter! I have large hands and it's about the smallest of the digital cameras I can hold with some comfort. Most are much too small for me.\nAlso, some people made comments about being able to see the lens in the optical viewfinder. This is common to older rangefinder cameras where the lenses were fairly large, especially the interchangeable cameras. It doesn't bother me any. The only things Canon could do would be to make the camera larger or the lens smaller.\nJohn McCormack , June 19, 2003; 11:03 A.M.\nGreat review overall. Can the administrator please add a link to the photo.net digital reviews page and pull down menus so others can access the review more easily (I just happened to stumble onto it.)? If this has already been done, forgive my ignorance.\nDon Douglas , June 20, 2003; 06:38 P.M.\n\"Depth of field has nothing to do with format size.\" Actually, given the same angle of view, depth of field has everything to do with format size. Shorter lenses have more depth of field, longer lenses have less. It takes longer lenses to produce the same angle of view on larger formats. The very short lenses used on small-chip digital cameras produce endless depth of field, even when you don\u00b4t want it. It would take an extreme telephoto, one that could not be considered a \"portrait lens,\" to produce any kind of blurred bokeh behind your subject.\nJim Lipsey , June 21, 2003; 12:11 A.M.\nDon, thanks for your comment. From a technical perspective I agree that format size has a direct influence on depth of field. However, your statement that \"It would take an extreme telephoto, one that could not be considered a \"portrait lens,\" to produce any kind of blurred bokeh behind your subject\" simply does not gel with my experience with this camera.\nFor a better example than the one I posted above, please take a look at this image taken with my G3 at full telephoto and f4 (1200x1600, 350kB). Other than a little bit of cropping, no image manipulation has been done. I think the blurring of the background, which is only at a medium distance, is well achieved. I also think the bokeh that is displayed is quite good, at least from my understanding of the term derived from Ken Rockwell's explanation .\nDerick Hirasawa , July 14, 2003; 12:04 P.M.\nThe G5 has just come out in Canada and I've had mine for 7 days. Unsuprisingly I haven't been able to take better portraits than my 100mm/f2.0 and Elan IIe loaded with Fuji NPH 400 film. But this is my first digital camera so I suspect it's me not the camera.\nAurimas Adomavicius , July 21, 2003; 11:47 A.M.\nre the response time from press of button to shutter release :\nIt's practically instantanious when you pre-focus. Hold down the button half way, let it focus, then push down all the way and it's a part of a second.\nHendrik Vandermeulen , August 22, 2003; 01:10 P.M.\nI notice that a lot of reviews about the G3 camera complain about a loose lens cap. My opinion is that if the cap would be tighter, and one would start the camera with the cap on, the camera could be damaged by pushing the lens against the cap. As it is, the lens can push the cap off when left on by mistake, and no damage is done.I wonder if this was designed by Canon this way ??\nManoj Puthenveedu , September 04, 2003; 02:33 P.M.\nThanks for the review, it removed some persistent misgivings I had about having spent the extra bucks to get the G3 over the G2. I think better ergonomics and the 4x zoom justify it.\nMy main concern with the G3 is regarding the autofocus in low light. My G3 finds it very difficult to focus in low indoor lighting, even with the AF beam turned on. Is this a problem with all G3s, or did I get a lemon? Thanks!\n, September 17, 2003; 01:11 A.M.\nBumblebee Wings. Copyright (c) 2003 Pradeep Satyaprakash\nI've thought long and hard about the G3 and it seems like it is an ideal camera for so many purposes, including learning about photography. I have spent time getting well acquainted with the camera and have found it to be a very capable photographic tool. Despite its flaws and other hangups, I think the G3 will become a classic much like some of those ancient Canonet Rangefinders cameras are today.\nOne idea I found in dealing with the digital lag problem aside from holding the shutter button half way is to use the custom function mode. You can set a custom function mode where the f-stop and shooting mode are set to aperture priority. You have to set the focus to a manual hyperfocal point. Then with this, you can take a picture freely and the camera only has to do work to calculate shutter speed, which is fast. I've found this to be a good way to photograph fast moving things like dogs, children, and hummingbirds. The depth of field you set with using the custom function should cover a good range. I got this idea from an article I read by Marc Jutras on his site:\nhttp://www.marcjutras.com/ehyperfocal.html\nThanks,\nBen FrantzDale , October 13, 2003; 08:20 A.M.\nLike many I had some problems with the lens cap falling off. This was easily fixed with a piece of foam poster-mounting tape. Just cut a little pice of it and peel off the backing from one side and stick it to the inside rim of the lens cap. Problem solved.\nRick Gerbehy , October 30, 2003; 09:55 A.M.\n...great review and good follow up comments....I'm fairly new to digital and I have only used about half of the G3 features. I needed to get a digital with flash capabilities.....I used a Fuji 4700.... a great little camera ...but not inside or in a dark room.....now for the NY Yankee comment.......ain't it just a pity that the rest of the country gets to hate those devilish Yankees each year as they watch the playoffs and series....at least you get to watch them at home ....while us Yankee fans have to suffer through the cold and crowds at the House that Ruth Built each Fall!!!!!!\nMalcolm Ruthven , November 02, 2003; 10:37 A.M.\nI recently replaced my G2 with a G3. I haven't seen these G3 improvements over the G2 mentioned here.\n- Use of the Neutral Density filter for flash fill in bright sunlight. Since you're limited to a max shutter speed of 1/250 (and the smallest lens opening is f8), you might need the ND filter for proper exposure. Also good for flash shots at very close distances.\n- 1/1250 shutter speed available with all lens settings vs 1/500 on the G2.\n- Wireless remote can be set for no delay. Minimum two-second delay on G2.\n- Manual focus forced to infinity works fine. On G2 it didn't give as sharp pix as using autofocus on a distant object. This may be a sample-to-sample issue, but there were several G2 users on the dpreview.com forum who felt the same about the G2.\nRodolfo Barba , November 09, 2003; 10:56 P.M.\nVery good review. My first digital camera is this Canon G3. Another uncommented feature is the possibility to get very nice shots just only using the moonlight in manual mode. The camera works very fine at 15 sec of exposure and 400 ASA mode. For astrophotography, it is possible to get very nice pictures of constellations and the Milky Way.As an example is shown: the southern sky, with the sillouette of dome telescopes at La Silla Observatory (Chile). The only caveat is the commatic shape of the stars close to the upper t corners. Also, it is very funny the intervalometer mode, because it is possible to do a movie of cloud developments, among other many things.\nImage Attachment: 134_3486.jpg\nJoe Scott , November 27, 2003; 12:06 A.M.\nI see a lot of people wondering what CF card to get for this camera. Basically the answer is the fastest you can afford. I have several CF card so I will give you a rough estimate of the performance difference on my G3 w/firmware 1.0.2.0\nThese test are for the Superfine Large JPEG setting:\nHP F1230-80001 (SanDisk OEM SDCFB-4 c97) 10 blinks of the green LED to save.\nNikon EC-8CF (SanDisk OEM SDCFB-8 c98) 10 blinks of the green LED to save.\nSanDisk SDCFB-64 c99 10 blinks of the green LED to save.\nCanon FC-32M (SanDisk OEM SDCFB-32 c02) 5 blinks of the green LED to save.\nAnd now for the CF that everyone has been drooling over:\nSanDisk SDCFX-1024-786 (Extreme BB0308WI) 2 blinks of the LED to save.\nThe Extreme can save a RAW file in 5 blinks of the green LED.\nThe main reason for this performance difference is that CF cards have the controller on the card instead of in the camera. So as storage technology improves your camera will not be left in the dust. A problem for non-CF card based cameras; since the controller for other media is built into the camera, making new technology unattainable after the camera is built.\nSome tests of continous mode with the SanDisk Extreme before buffer ran out show:\n11 frames of Superfine Large JPEG no flash normal speed (7 seconds)\n10 frames of Superfine Large JPEG no flash high speed (5 seconds)\n14 frames of Superfine Large JPEG with flash normal speed (19 seconds)\n5 frames of RAW no flash normal speed (6 seconds)\n4 frames of RAW no flash high speed (4 seconds)\nGary Miller\n, December 12, 2003; 04:45 P.M.\nGreat review and terrific comments. Overlooked however, is one of the greatest teaching tools in photography. When you switch to the B&W mode, the LCD viewfinder shows you how things will look in B&W. This is a concept that can take some photographers a long time to learn and this great little camera does it in an instant.\nIgor Titoff , April 11, 2004; 11:08 P.M.\nI own this camera and I love it. However, it has some weaknesses that can be really annoying. The biggest ones (in order of annoyance) are:\n- Shutter lag (I have missed a lot of keepers because of it);\n- Poor autofocus in low light (even the expensive ST-E2 transmitter doesn't help. Same goes for the 420EX & 550 EX flashes, which is sad);\n- Fully manual flash output in \"M\" mode instead of E-TTL or, even better, a choice between either (that really gets in the way of creative wireless multi-flash photography: you can't set a wireless ratio with the ST-E2 in \"M\" mode);\n- Chromatic aberration (purple fringing) when shooting wide open;\n- Lens cap comes off too easily;\n- The camera can be started with the slightest touch, which means that, if it starts in shooting mode, the lens begins to come out, and that gets annoying at times, especially if it happens when loading the G3 into a tight pocket or camera bag;\n- High noise at ISO 400 (I guess it's universal with digicams);\n- Barrel distortion at the wide angle setting (again, I guess it's very common, and I shouldn't really complain about this one).\nOther than what is mentioned above, it is an excellent camera capable of cranking out very high-quality 8x10s of any subject matter, even highly detailed landscapes, especially at lower ISO settings. It's got a very sharp lens and is light enough to carry around. Plus, it's so loaded with advanced features, it can be used professionally (no kidding). In many ways, it's more advanced than the Digital Rebel. I'll tell you even more: I am going to hold on to it till it dies. 'nuff said.\nImage Attachment: CRW_4621_RJ.JPG\nAurimas Adomavicius , May 14, 2004; 11:43 A.M.\nI wouldn't even compare it with the digital rebel. A whole different sensor, which is closer to 35mm and the noise levels are uncomparable. Shooting at night / low light situations is VASTLY SUPERIOR with the rebel.\nNo reason to compare a prosumer digicam, with an entry level DSLR\nManoj Puthenveedu , May 17, 2004; 11:55 A.M.\nSome suggestions to improve some of the common gripes on the G3, am not sure to what extent you will be satisfied with them.\nShutter/focus lag: As mentioned above, configuring C1 and C2 in the 'snap' mode (MF at hyperfocal, choose your aperture) for outdoor and indoor (+/- flash) gets rid of the autofocus delay. I dont think the intrinsic shutter lag (eg, shown by the A80) is that long on the G3.\nLens cap falling off: I think it was designed so that the lens will not hit the cap and injure itself ;) if the camera is turned on with the cap on. I currently have a lensmate 52mm adapter with a UV filter which I leave on all the time. So no more lens caps to worry about. Note, this blocks the internal flash quite noticeably.\nFor me, unlike for the strange man :) above, the IR focus-assist on the 420EX has improved the AF at low light, though not dramatically. But I have not done any objective tests with and without it. Surprisingly, the Canons are thought to be among the best performers in low-light AF, according to reviews on the web.\nWith closed apertures at ISO 50 and using the timer/remote, the night shots come out very well, with practically no noise. The longest exposure it can do is 15 sec though. True, the G3 does not give the SLR responses of the Digital Rebel, but I do think it offers much more manual control over combinations that the Rebel. The EOS10D might be well worth the extra money.\nJim Lipsey , May 25, 2004; 02:17 P.M.\nManoj, I'm afraid you are mistaken. The IR assist from the 420ex is not used by the G3. I believe this is because the G3 has insufficient IR sensing capability. This is a frequent complaint about an otherwise great accessory for the G3.\nManoj Puthenveedu , June 03, 2004; 01:35 A.M.\nThank you, Jim, you are absolutely correct. Now that I have played with it more, I realize I was mistaken, I do NOT see any improvement in the AF with the Speedlite. Any suggestions are to how to improve the low light AF will be greatly appreciated.\nNanci Protin , September 27, 2005; 09:54 A.M.\nI like it besides the lag and the cap.

Or, at least it would be funny if you\u2019d ever been to Bakersfield.\nI\u2019ve been to both: Canberra many times and Bakersfield just once, in the late eighties, during my mid-life crisis, driving from San Francisco to Las Vegas via Death Valley with a girlfriend little more than half my age. It\u2019s probably true that Canberra has nothing in common with Bakersfield. Certainly, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards never wrote a song that mentioned Australia\u2019s capital city:\nI was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield\nListening to gospel music on the colored radio station\nAnd the preacher said, \u201cYou know you always have the\nLord by your side\u201d\nAnd I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran\nTwenty red lights in his honor\nThank you Jesus, thank you Lord.\nFar Away Eyes (from Some Girls )\nI always loved that song, though not because of the reference to Bakersfield. One of my happiest memories of being married is driving with my wife through Alabama on a Sunday afternoon in the early eighties, listening to gospel music on the colored radio station. We were looking for the crossroads store at Sprott. We turned a corner and there it was, still recognizable from the photographs Walker Evans made there in the summer of 1936. Many of the photographs he took in Alabama for the Farm Security Administration were reproduced at the beginning of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men , the book that he and James Agee produced when Fortune declined to publish their collaboration as a magazine article.\nAll over Alabama, the lamps are out. Every leaf drenches the touch; the spider\u2019s net is heavy. The roads lie there, with nothing to use them. The fields lie there, with nothing at work in them, neither man nor beast. The plow handles are wet, and the rails and the frogplates and the weeds between the ties: and not even the hurryings and hoarse sorrows of a distant train, on other roads, is heard. The little towns, the county seats, house by house white-painted and elaborately sawn among their heavy and dark-lighted leaves, in the spaced protections of their mineral light they stand so prim, so voided, so undefended upon starlight, that it is inconceivable to despise or to scorn a white man, an owner of land; even in Birmingham, mile on mile, save for the sudden frightful streaming, almost instantly diminished and silent, of a closed black car, and save stone lonesome sinister heelbeats, that show never a face and enter, soon, a frame door flush with the pavement, and ascend the immediate lightless staircase, mile on mile, stone, stone, smooth charted streams of stone, the streets under their lifted lamps lie void before eternity.\nWe traveled through the South, visiting most of the places Walker Evans photographed as well as many of the towns where Robert Frank had taken pictures for The Americans . I just found our itinerary folded in the back of the copy of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men that I carried with me. I realize it\u2019s time to read this extraordinary book again. In his preface to the Aperture monograph on Walker Evans, Lloyd Fonvielle wrote:\nThe text is an extended meditation on morality, perception, the limits of language, and the deceptions of art, all unified by elaborate descriptions of rural poverty executed with surgical precision and lyric genius. It contains the best of Agee\u2019s magnificent prose, as well as jarring passages of adolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and pretension. The result is a work of maddening, frightful inspiration, a masterpiece by any standards but a masterpiece that parades its flaws with poignant, nearly tragic recklessness.\n\u201cadolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and pretension\u201d\u2014sounds just like a weblog. For all of its supposed faults, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men remains one of my favorite books. I\u2019m glad to have been reminded of it.\nMonday 22 April 2002\nI always wanted to be a writer\nLooking at Jeff Ward\u2019s photographs at Visible Darkness over the past few months, I often used to wonder why he stopped making those beautiful, mysterious, intelligent pictures. Today Jeff\u2019s reminiscence of transforming himself from a photographer to a writer unleashed a torrent of memories. Jeff gets the sounds of camera shutters just right: \u201cthe near-silent fftt of a Leica or Rollei to the loud WHAP of a Mamiya RB-67\u201d and the CLUNK of the Nikon F series. For a long time, I used Nikon F models for exactly the same reason as Jeff: the viewfinder showed 100% of the frame. Then I settled on the Hasselblad. The viewfinder showed a fraction less but I loved the square frame, the 2\u00bc negative, the solid THWUMP of the shutter and mirror, and\u2014above all\u2014the sense of control. Again Jeff nails it:\nThe real stuff happens at the edges, and I wanted control. Control, control, control \u2026 the world must be ordered, there must be some sense behind it all. Standing in the empty concrete and brown spaces of Southern California, I tried to make it work. To find in those rectilinear spaces something that I felt was inside myself. What I found out was\u2014 the harder you look, the less likely you are to find it. I suppose what I wanted most of all was mystery, and mystery just won\u2019t come when called. Year after year of trying to make sense, when really all I needed to do was let go and let sense and mystery find me.\n\u201cYear after year of trying to make sense\u2026\u201d For the nearly twenty years that I was a photographer, I was never bored for an instant. Photography was endlessly fascinating: the perfect amalgam of art and science. I enjoyed sloshing around with chemicals, the solitude of the darkroom, the beauty and precision of expensive cameras, the physicality of taking pictures (requiring a kind of athletic grace more akin to sports than making art). Like Jeff, I was captivated by the intellectual challenge of transforming chaotic three-dimensional space into a cohesive flat plane.\nI loved the fact that it was difficult and I could do it. Most of all I loved the idea that pictures could touch people\u2019s hearts and change their lives.\nIn 1987 I bought a Macintosh. I had commenced photographing in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Children\u2019s Hospital in Sydney and thought a computer might bring some order to my unwieldy project. Which it did. I showed the pictures\u2014the best work I had ever done\u2014at Watters Gallery in August 1987 to general, though not universal, acclaim. Some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that I had exploited vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.\nThis was not true. I never photographed without permission and was acutely sensitive to every agonizing nuance. The only couple to ask that their baby not be included later changed their minds as their child hovered on the brink of death. For many parents, I had created a record of their child\u2019s struggle towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby\u2019s brief existence.\nThen I stopped photographing.\nIt was not a sudden decision but rather a feeling that built up over the course of a year. Perhaps I had come up hard against the midlife crisis and this activity that had absorbed most of my waking attention gradually became meaningless to me. I certainly did other midlife crisis kinds of things: quitting my teaching job at the university art school, drinking too much, going out with girls half my age.\nMaybe my disaffection sprang from a conviction that television had rendered photography almost irrelevant, a process only hastened by its elevation to the status of an Art. Or I was appalled by the corrosive influence that \u201ctheory\u201d had begun to exert on practice, as an opportunistic postmodernism analyzed pictures to within an inch of their lives before abandoning them in the cul-de-sac of political correctness.\nI know I yearned for those photographic values which started with Walker Evans and finished with Robert Frank and had fallen into disrepute. Possibly I accepted the fact that I\u2019d done the best I was capable of and it was better to walk away and begin anew.\nMost probably I had exhausted my reserves of love and compassion.\nDesperately needing a new obsession, I attended an Apple conference in early 1989 where I saw the beginnings of what would become \u201cmultimedia.\u201d I realized that this new medium combined three of my passions: images, writing, and movies. Multimedia metamorphosed into CD-ROM and then the Web. I learned to write and kept practising.\nAt the same time I discovered multimedia I fell ardently in love with a Japanese woman, a love affair that\u2014although it lasted less than a year\u2014rekindled a fascination for Japanese language and culture that had waxed and waned through all my time as a photographer. A few years ago I visited Nagasaki. Walking through the Peace Park, which contains an astonishing array of kitsch sculpture, I saw a gigantic statue of a Japanese woman looking lovingly at a dove perched near her shoulder. When I looked more closely, I realized she bore an uncanny resemblance to Ayako .\nJeff Ward learned to write because he wanted to talk online about the pictures he was making. I learned to write in order to fill the void that opened up when I stopped making pictures. Jeff never wanted to be a writer. I realized\u00a0recently that I always did. Now we\u2019re a couple of ex-photographers who spend most of our time writing (though we both include photographs in our weblogs). Jeff thinks \u201cwords are easier!\u201d I\u2019m not so sure.\nTuesday 07 May 2002\nThe unbearable sweetness of friendship\nTonight at the video store, where I\u2019d gone to pick up Philip Kaufman\u2019s movie of Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, the rental clerk asked me if I had a reward card (Rent Five, Get One Free). I found it, along with two photo booth pictures that I\u2019d put there for safe keeping, then promptly forgotten.\nThe photographs had been sandwiched between pages 200 and 201 of the copy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being that I bought from Gould\u2019s bookstore six weeks ago. In Chapter 9 of Part Five (which ends on page 200) and Chapter 10 (which begins on page 201), Kundera attempts to explain the reasons for Tomas\u2019s compulsive womanizing. Chapter 10 opens:\nMen who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two categories. Some seek their own subjective and unchanging dream of a woman in all women. Others are prompted by a desire to possess the endless variety of the objective female world.\nThe obsession of the former is lyrical: what they seek in women is themselves, their ideal, and since an ideal is by definition something that can never be found, they are disappointed again and again. The disappointment that propels them from woman to woman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic excuse, so that many sentimental women are touched by their unbridled philandering.\nThe obsession of the latter is epic, and women see nothing the least bit touching in it: the man projects no subjective ideal on women, and since everything interests him, nothing can disappoint him. This inability to be disappointed has something scandalous about it. The obsession of the epic womanizer strikes people as lacking in redemption (redemption by disappointment).\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that my copy of Kundera\u2019s novel originally belonged to one or other of the young women. In the book, Sabina (Tomas\u2019s mistress) encourages Tereza (his wife) to become a photographer, lending her \u201cthree or four monographs of famous photographers\u201d and explaining \u201cwhat made each of the photographs interesting.\u201d\n[Tereza] felt a rush of admiration for Sabina, and because Sabina treated her as a friend it was an admiration free of fear and suspicion and quickly turned into friendship.\nWhat makes the photo booth pictures (formally) interesting is that they are framed as mirror images, except that the women have changed places so that each appears in the foreground of one photo and the background of another. The real interest is, however, in the pair rather than the single images; in the juxtaposition of two portraits of two women, happily mugging for a camera without an operator, as it records a tiny sliver of \u201cthe endless variety of the objective female world.\u201d\nSaturday 13 July 2002\nBetter than a show\nIt\u2019s been a photographic trip down memory lane at Visible Darkness . Jeff Ward\u2019s own gallery series\u2014 Social Studies in Southern California Bars 1989-93 \u2014is simply remarkable. Forget the thumbnail sketches, choose either the 800x600 or 1024x768 show, sit back, and let the images wash over you. So much hope, longing, sadness, optimism, and desperation packed into every frame. And pay attention to the edges of the frame, there\u2019s so much going on.\nJeff\u2019s scattered other pictures though his blog over the past week: his own ( Brak\u2019n\u2019Tune, Bakersfield, California 1990ish and California City, California, 1989 ) plus images by Lee Friedlander ( Boston 1985 ), Bill Owens ( \u201cWe\u2019d rather play games than watch TV\u201d\u2014Suburbia 1973 ), and Lewis Baltz (from New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California ). The Baltz photograph brought back the fondest memories. He was the first to teach me how, by carefully balancing interior and exterior illumination, you could totally flatten three-dimensional space.\nI know just what Jeff means when he writes about how, even though he stopped photographing some years ago, photography \u201cnever really lets you go.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been composing all manner of texts, excepting fiction. I approached photography much the same way, experimenting with everything except fabricated tableaus. Eventually, I\u2019d like to be bimedial. That\u2019s part of what this website has been about. Experimenting with combinations of words and images, just trying to see what I can make work. It think there is a synergy between text and image that is rarely explored, let alone exploited to full advantage.\nBeing bimedial. What a marvellous ambition. Sign me up, Mr Ward.\n"}, {"score": 211.51907, "uuid": "f1efcc3d-551a-53a2-a93f-7dee79719da9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1906wb-51-11928", "target_hostname": "www.photographytalk.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photographytalk.com/photography-articles/1647-food-photography-tips-and-tricks-the-pros-use", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Food Photography: Tips and Tricks the Pros Use", "snippet": "<em>For</em> example, <em>I</em> toss herbs onto an entr\u00e9e to add zest or include colorful fruit to achieve <em>a</em> more vibrant shot.

Ricoh have created a truly innovative modular system, where you swap both the lens and the image sensor at the same time, not just the lens as with a conventional DSLR camera. The GXR is also smaller than either a DSLR or the recent Micro Four Thirds cameras from Panasonic and Olympus. Can Ricoh succeed with their GXR interchangeable camera unit system? Read the World's first in-depth review to find out...\nIt\u2019s not every day that a brand new photographic system is unveiled, but that\u2019s exactly what Ricoh have delivered in the form of the new GXR camera. The Ricoh GXR is the World\u2019s first \u201cinterchangeable unit camera system\u201d. Digital SLR\u2019s allow you to change the lens on the front of the camera - the GXR allows you to change the lens and the image sensor, which are combined into a single interchangeable unit. There are two such units available on launch - the S10, which features a 24-72mm zoom lens and 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch CCD sensor, and the A12, which combines a 50mm macro lens and a 12.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor. Each unit simply slides into and out of the front of the GXR, with virtually all of the features of the camera body available for either unit. Ricoh are claiming that this new approach allows them to offer the best combinations of image quality and portability - one of the GXR\u2019s key selling points is its diminutive size, being much smaller than a traditional DSLR and even tinier than the Panasonic GF1 and Olympus E-P1/E-P2 Micro Four Thirds cameras. Compared to Ricoh\u2019s popular range of compacts, the GXR is bigger and heavier, but not by too much. The innovative Ricoh GXR does carry a rather substantial price premium, costing \u00a3419/\u20ac459/$550 for the body, \u00a3600/\u20ac670/$550 for the A12/50mm unit, and \u00a3330/\u20ac370/$440 for the S10/24-72mm unit.\nEase of Use\nThe Ricoh GXR is launching with two interchangeable camera units, the S10 / 24-72mm / 10 megapixel unit and the A12 / 50mm / 12 megapixel unit, both of which were supplied to us by Ricoh UK, along with the VF-2 external viewfinder and the clever LC-2 self-retaining lenscap (which only fits the S10 unit). We did briefly consider splitting this review into two separate articles, one for each camera unit, as the combined nature of the lens and image sensor makes the GXR seem like a different camera when each one is fitted, if not from a handling point-of-view then certainly from a image quality perspective. But there's enough common ground when either is fitted to merit a combined review.\nThe GXR will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has used a recent Ricoh compact before, as it inherits the design approach and many of the features from the GR and GX series cameras. For everyone else, the GXR is simply a joy to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.\nThe Ricoh GXR is a wide and fairly slim camera that is a little big bigger than the palm of my average sized hands, measuring 113.9 mm (W) x 70.2 mm (H) x 77.1 mm (D) with the S10 unit fitted, and weighing around 263g without a unit fitted and 423g with the S10 (although still not including the the battery or memory card). The GXR is bigger and heavier than the GR Digital III, but not by as much as you'd first imagine, and it's a little smaller and lighter than the Panasonic GF1, the previous holder of the \"World's smallest and lightest interchangeable lens camera\" title.\nUtilising a magnesium alloy body, the GXR is an extremely well-built camera, continuing the long-established Ricoh tradition of producing serious photographic tools. It has an under-stated, all-black appearance which lends it a professional feel. There's a large rubberized handgrip on the front that allows you to get a good grip and a small area of the same material acting as a thumb rest on the rear of the body. The all-metal tripod mount is the final give-away sign that this is intended to be a serious product, although the design of the interchangeable unit camera system means that it's not in-line either with the lens or the centre of the body.\nFront\nRear\nAs mentioned above, there are only two camera unit options available when the GXR launches towards the end of this month (with more promised by Ricoh for 2010), and we'll briefly consider each one here. You can also judge their image quality for yourself on Page 2 and see full-size samples (RAW and JPG) from each one on Page 3.\nThe S10 incorporates a 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch image sensor and a 24-72mm, 3x zoom lens. This combination is strikingly similar to the now discontinued Ricoh GX100 compact, which had the same size sensor and the same zoom range, with the latest GX200 model increasing the megapixel count to 12. Even the maximum aperture range - f/2.5-4.4 - is identical! Disregarding any differences in image quality, it seems to us that the S10 is almost exactly replicating one of Ricoh's existing compacts in the GXR format, albeit in a larger size and perhaps more importantly with a much bigger price-tag.\nMore interesting is the A12 unit, which has a 12.3 APS-C image sensor and a 50mm f/2.5 fixed-focal macro lens. This is a unique offering in the Ricoh range, and is notably the first ever Ricoh camera to feature the same-sized sensor that the majority of DSLRs use. When the GXR is fitted with this unit, it's automatically in the same league as a DSLR or the other compact cameras that have an APS-C sensor, the Sigma DP1 and DP2. The Panasonic GF1 and Olympus E-P1 / E-P2 cameras all use the smaller Four Thirds sensor size, so in theory the GXR with the A12 unit should deliver better image quality. The choice of the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that out-of-focus bokeh look.\nIn all this discussion about the benefits of particular lens and sensor combinations, it quickly becomes apparent that Ricoh are playing something of a guessing game with their camera unit offerings, hoping that they've hit upon the best solutions for the majority of photographers. That ultimately means that some photographers are going to be left out, as Ricoh obviously can't make every combination available. With a conventional DSLR, it's inherently much easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the GXR system, at least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the particular combinations on offer.\nPersonally speaking, I would have preferred to see the S10 use an APS-C sensor rather than the tiny 1/1.7-inch sensor - if I'm going to use a larger camera than Ricoh's existing compacts, then I'd prefer a bigger sensor with all the image quality benefits that it hopefully provides. With regards to the A12 unit, the 50mm lens is a little too limiting in its outlook - ultimately I'd like the 24-72mm lens with the APS-C sensor. As Ricoh release more units, this kind of dilemma may become less prevalent, but there's no disputing that this is an inherent limitation of their new system that DSLRs don't suffer from in quite the same way.\nS10 Camera Unit\nA12 Camera Unit\nOne other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that Ricoh is promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor. With a traditional DSLR, changing the lens exposes the image sensor, with dust inevitably finding its way onto it. Most DSLRs now employ some kind of built-in dust reduction / shake system to try and automatically remove the dust from the sensor, although you invariably need to clean it using a third-party solution or have it cleaned periodically by the manufacturer. With the GXR, the closed nature of the system promises to keep the image sensor dust-free, and I we certainly couldn't detect any in the images that we shot. On the flip side, though, dust can also get in via the lens barrel, particularly of a zoom lens, so it will be interesting to see if long-term users report problems, especially as there's obviously no way to clean the sensor yourself, or any automatic dust-reduction system built into the GXR body.\nReturning to the camera body, there are four external controls which form the creative heart of the GXR. Located on the top right of the camera (viewed from the rear) are the Mode dial and what Ricoh refer to as the Up-down dial, and on the back is the Adj. dial. These controls allow you to choose which shooting mode you want to use, with a choice of full auto, program shift, aperture-priority, shutter-priority and full manual, and to control the settings of the particular mode that you have picked.\nFor example, in Manual mode, by default the Up-down dial sets the aperture and the Adj. button sets the shutter speed, providing quick and intuitive access. Furthermore, pressing the Adj. dial allows you to quickly adjust 5 different settings that are commonly used. Press it in to alter White Balance, ISO Speed, Quality, Image Settings and the AF Target, which allows you to shift the target for AF or AE or both without having to move the camera. Even better, the Adj. menu is customisable - you can choose what the first four settings do, allowing you to control exactly what you want quick access to.\nA new addition to the GXR is the Direct button, positioned to the far left above the LCD screen. When pressed a graphical representation of most of the key settings is displayed on the LCD, very similar to the system that many DSLRs offer. You can use the navigation pad to move through the settings and change them, and the current shooting mode, aperture, shutter speed, flash setting, battery life and exposure compensation are also shown. This is a great feature the helps bridge the gap between compact and DSLR cameras.\nContinuing the customisation theme, you can configure the GXR and save the current settings as one of three My Settings modes, which are accessible by setting the Mode dial to either the MY1, MY2 or MY3 option. This allows you to configure the GXR for different uses and allows quick access to each configuration (the camera remembers the settings when it's turned off). The two Function (Fn) buttons on the rear of the camera can also be customised to suit your particular needs. Finally, the GXR uses an up/down rocker switch on the back of the camera for operating the zoom when used with an applicable camera unit (and image magnification during playback), although disappointingly it can't be re-configured when used with the A12 / 50mm unit. The navigation pad on the rear offers Fn1 and Fn2 settings, both of which can be re-configured to (by default they change the focus type and the manual flash amount) and pressing up and down increases and decreases exposure compensation. The GXR is easily one of the most customisable compact cameras that we've ever reviewed.\nFront\nDirect Menu\nThe Ricoh GXR's 3 inch, 920K LCD screen is the same as the one used by the Ricoh CX1 and GR Digital III. Both text and images really come alive on a simply breath-taking display that's the best of any camera that we've ever reviewed, including those with comparable 920K dot screens. The high resolution LCD provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% sRGB coverage for more accurate color reproduction.\nIf you don't like composing your photos by holding the camera at arms length and looking at the LCD screen, there's also another way of framing your shots. You can additionally buy the completely removable optical viewfinder, the new VF-2. This slots into the hot-shoe on top of the camera, allowing you to hold the camera up to your eye and instantly giving the GXR the feel of a single-lens reflex camera. It's physically bigger and brighter than the VF-1 model supplied with Ricoh's compacts, making accurate manual focusing much easier to judge. Compared to the direct competition, it's better than the Panasonic GF1's viewfinder, but not quite as good as the Olympus E-P2's.\nAs the Ricoh GXR offers a full range of advanced exposure controls, it's quite complex in terms of its design. There are over 20 external controls, leaving just enough room for that gorgeous 3 inch LCD screen. Further appealing to the avid photographer in you, the Ricoh GXR has a range of focusing and metering modes that should cover most situations. On the focusing side, the multi AF system has 9 separate auto focus points, and there's also Spot AF, Manual focus, Snap mode (can be changed to focus at either 1m, 2.5m, 5m or Infinity) and Infinity.\nThe Full Press Snap option allows you to take a photo at one of the Snap mode distances with a full press of the shutter button. This means that you can use both the camera's auto-focus system by half-pressing the shutter button, and over-ride it to instantly shoot at at a pre-determined distance without having to wait for the camera to focus. Completing the GXR's extensive range of focusing options is Pre-AF. This accelerates the already snappy focusing time by following the subject's movement before the shutter release button is pressed half way (only works when the focus is set to Multi AF or Spot AF). In terms of metering, the multi metering mode is 256 segment, and there's also center weighted average and spot metering.\nMulti-pattern auto white balance is a useful setting for scenes with mixed lighting - daylight and flash, or fluorescent and daylight, for example. Instead of just taking an average reading from the whole scene, which inevitably gets the white balance wrong for the secondary light source, the GXR breaks the image down into small areas and analyzes and sets the white balance for each one. In practice it produces a subtle but noticeable effect that is particularly useful for capturing more natural portraits when using flash. Also very useful is the ability to change the power of the built-in flash which can be set at 12 levels from full flash to 1/64, enabling you to balance the intensity for both the subject and background.\nVF-2 Electronic Viewfinder\nS10 and A12 Camera Units\nThere's the usual choice of Fine and Normal JPEGs, but Ricoh have also wisely provided a RAW mode setting. Even better, the RAW format that they have chosen is not a proprietary one, but Adobe's DNG format, which means that the Ricoh GXR's files are instantly available in any RAW software that supports DNG (virtually every one). This is an excellent move by Ricoh, with no waiting required for third-party software vendors like Adobe, Phase One DxO to play catch-up.\nThe electronic leveler is a neat feature that helps to ensure level shots while viewing through the LCD monitor, both in landscape and portrait mode. You can view the horizontal indicator on the LCD monitor to ensure that shots are aligned horizontally. If you're using the external viewfinder, or can't see the LCD screen in very bright sunlight, then the camera can also be set to make a sound to indicate a level horizon. It doesn't sound like a big deal in theory, but in practice it really helps to make all those wide-angle shots perfectly level.\nThe main menu system on the Ricoh GXR is straight-forward to use and is accessed by pressing the Menu/OK button in the middle of the navigation pad. There are three main menus, Shooting, Key Custom Options and Setup. Quite a lot of the camera's main options, such as image size, sharpness, metering mode and continuous mode, are accessed here, so the Shooting Settings menu has 23 options spread over 3 screens, the Key Custom Options menu has 16 options, and the Setup menu has 34 options. Due to the high-resolution LCD screen and restricting the number of on-screen choices to 10, the various options and icons are clear and legible.\nIf you have never used a digital camera before, or you're upgrading from a more basic model, reading the comprehensive and easy-to-follow manual before you start is a must. Thankfully Ricoh have chosen to supply it in printed format, rather than as a PDF on a CD, so you can also carry it with you for easy reference in the field.\nMemory Card Slot\nBattery Compartment\nRicoh are well known for delivering responsive cameras, and the GXR certainly continues that tradition. The start-up time from turning the Ricoh GXR on to being ready to take a photo is responsive at around 1.5 seconds. Focusing with the 24-72mm camera unit is quick in good light, taking less than 0.5 seconds, and the camera happily achieves focus most of the time indoors or in low-light situations. The 50mm unit is a little slower, with a distinct pause as it physically moves in and out before locking onto the subject, and it often failed to focus at all on low-contrast subjects. This is perfectly acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less suitable for street photographer where every second counts. Thankfully Ricoh have included a manual focusing ring on this camera unit, which speeds up operation if you're used to focusing in this way. You can also manually over-ride the auto-focus system by using this focus ring.\nIt takes about 0.5 second to store a JPEG image, allowing you to keep shooting as they are being recorded onto the memory card, and there is virtually no LCD blackout between each image. Shooting in RAW mode is also very quick, with the GXR only taking around 1 second to store a RAW image, and you can also take another shot while it's being written to memory. In the fastest Continuous mode the camera takes 3 frames per second with the 50mm unit but only 1.6 fps with the 24-72mm unit, both rates for an unlimited number of JPEG or RAW images, which doesn't compare particularly well to even entry-level DSLRs.\nOnce you have captured a photo, the GXR has an above average range of options when it comes to playing, reviewing and managing your images. You can instantly scroll through the images that you have taken, view thumbnails (81 onscreen at once!), zoom in and out up to 16x magnification, view slideshows with audio, set the print order, delete, protect, trim and resize an image. Level Compensation allows you to correct the contrast and tone of an image after it has been taken, and White Balance Compensation the white balance. The Skew Correction function alters any photo that was taken at an angle so it appears as if it were taken directly in front of you. The new Flag Function Setting option allows you to choose up to 20 images that can then be quickly played back by selecting the Flag Function Display option, useful for showing off key images.\nImages are automatically rotated during playback to fit the current orientation of the camera. Pushing the Adjust dial instantly displays the image at a previously defined magnification (by default 9.8x), handy for quickly checking focus. The Display button toggles detailed settings information about each picture on and off, such as the ISO rating and aperture / shutter speed, and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback. The White Saturation display mode during image playback indicates over-exposed highlights by flashing those areas on and off. When taking a photo, pressing the Display button toggles between the detailed information, the histogram and gridlines to aid composition.\nIn summary the Ricoh GXR is a remarkably intuitive and customisable camera, especially considering that it's a first-generation product in a completely new photographic system.\n"}, {"score": 207.07509, "uuid": "b3067c22-a6a8-555a-8036-c6ec400288c5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-87-30280", "target_hostname": "theonlinephotographer.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/shooting-techniques/", "page_rank": 4.207022e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "The Online Photographer: Shooting techniques", "snippet": "<em>I</em> make <em>a</em> lot of <em>photographs</em>, ad hoc, at night by just finding <em>a</em> flat surface that <em>I</em> can prop the <em>camera</em> on.

Whether you want to make 7x17\" platinum prints or hipstamatic iPhone JPEGs, black-and-white conversions from digicam files or color neg in a TLR, 5-foot-wide prints from a medium-format digital back or blurb books of your Canon CMOS sensor files...whatever turns you on, lights your fire, floats your boat, whatever fulfills or gratifies you\u2014fine.\nWhich picture's by Martin Schoeller and which by Jill Greenberg? Exactly.\nMost people pick their techniques because they love them. Whatever it is, something about it does something for them. It's how they want their work to look. It's what they want to look at.\nAnd then, whatever technique they've chosen, all their pictures are made with that technique. So technique ceases to be an issue. They've gotten past it.\nConsistency is memorable, variety is not\nSure, you can think of exceptions, photographers for whom this is not true. Some people engage sequentially with many techniques. Some people make \"sea changes\" at some point in their careers and change their technique from one to a different one (the advent of digital has forced/inspired such a change in a lot of people, including, for example, Charles Cramer, and Ctein). And it takes some people a while to \"settle down\"\u2014their early technique is tentative, exploratory, and only later morphs into a stable final form. We tinker, God knows: new lens here, new RAW converter there. Some take detours (Ralph Gibson made a couple of books of color photography, that I know of\u2014and who can forget Kertesz's funhouse mirror pictures?) only to return again to their main way of working.\nMaybe it's just an old art-dawg* prejudice, but when I was coming up we thought that the people who had to master lots of techniques were pros, because pros have to provide what clients want\u2014and that's why pro work is supremely competent but seldom memorable. (And when pro work is memorable, it's usually because the professional has dedicated a portion of his or her activity to working like an artist. For example, Avedon's 8x10 portraits.)\nNo rules\nBut a consistent or \"signature\" technique can be a strong component of public identity for an artist, and most of the great photographers just had the one technique they liked best, and with which they are most closely identified. All of Edward Curtis's mature pictures were done using the same technique. If I asked you to describe what a characteristic Helmut Newton photograph looks like from a technical standpoint, you could do it. All of Edward Weston's mature work looks similar technically. You can't miss a John Gossage and you can't mistake a Martin Paar for a Martin Schoeller, or a Bruce Barnbaum for a Mark Klett.\nI don't want to make too much of this. It's just one way of thinking about technique and you, of course, are free to go down any path of your choosing. I'm speaking descriptively, not prescriptively. But I will say that when most amateurs assume they have to master all techniques to be a master of technique, they're imitating professionals, not art photographers. Art photographers are more often deep masters of the particular technique they've chosen, and they let the rest go.\nTo be a good photographer technically, you don't need to be a jack of every random ratty way of working with every kind of equipment under the sun. You don't need but one\u2014one good one you like and that suits your taste and what you're doing. And from there, it's on to the real work of hunting down the pictures and saying what you want to say.\nMike\n*I.e., art student.\nP.S.

The first five or six years I was trying to get a handle on my instrument, the six-string acoustic guitar, and I believed that I needed to learn and master all these different styles of music and technique, but it really isn't necessary unless you aspire to be a professional studio musician who can step into any situation and be competent, just like a professional photographer (as you mentioned).\n\"The first time I listened to Nick Drake I knew that I had found my niche, so I immediately went to work trying to become proficient at fingerstyle playing incorporating basslines, melodies, and chords basically played simultaneously, to become a self-contained one-man band. And what rings absolutely true for me is your assertion that once technique is in place that's when the hard work begins, so to speak. That's when the time to begin creating music begins, writing songs, creating albums. There's no more agonizing whether I should work on my scales so I can shred an electric guitar, or improving my proficiency playing with a pick. When the technique becomes second nature and completely embraced you put your effort into creating art (hopefully), expressing yourself musically, and not really searching out technique.\"\nFeatured [partial] Comment by Luc N.: \"Having such a strong recognizable 'signature' may be a double-edged sword in the magazine world. It surely can make your work memorable, but it can also make it too memorable when it comes to style. Which means that a particular technique translated into a style/signature will have a shelf life that may be shortened by ADs and other art buyers when they get tired of recognizing from 15 feet away who shot the picture gracing the cover of a magazine.\"\nMike replies: That's true enough. Wasn't it Skunk Baxter (a studio guitarist who played on many Steely Dan albums among other things) who outlined the four stages of a studio musician's career? 1. \"Who's Skunk Baxter?\" 2. \"Get me Skunk Baxter!\" 3. \"Get me a young Skunk Baxter!\" 4. \"Who's Skunk Baxter?\"\nBut bear in mind when I say \"consistency is memorable, variety is not\" I'm only talking about technique. Photographers as disparate as Eugene Atget and Elliott Erwitt used the same technique for most of their working lives, but their work is diverse and creative.\nBy the way, apropos those names: This post got top ranking on Reddit's photo section this morning...\n...And several commenters there accused me of \"name dropping.\" False ack! Name dropping is when you inject names into discussions or conversations to brag about who you know. I don't know Elliott Erwitt (or Eugene Atget), or Martin Schoeller or anyone else I mentioned. I'm merely using those photographers as examples to help get my point across. That's not name dropping.\nAlthough mentioning Reddit might be!\nFeatured Comment by Jonathan Castner: \"Photographic technique is merely the ability to do something, be it produce perfect star trails, black line light a piece of glassware or photograph a seared scallop with almost no depth of field. Style is how an artist takes the various techniques that they have learned and puts them together into a distinct representation of their personal vision of the subject, project or their world.\n\"I think that a lot of people confuse technique with style. There are a lot of known photographers these days who are known for their use of technique as style. The much ballyhooed Dave Hill comes to mind with his hard-lit, undersaturated, highpass filtered composites. Mr. Hill does not do anything that resembles 'straight' photography where the image that comes from the camera is what he presents to the client. Much of what makes Dave Hill, uh, Dave Hill is what he does with the elements that comes from his camera\u2014he is far more illustrator than photographer which is fine.\n\"Richard Avedon had loads of technique but didn't make his physical ability to manipulate his tools very obvious. What you had at the end of his life was a huge variety of work that still had his way of seeing be it fashion shot with a Hasselblad or highly composed portraits done on an 8x10. For a master like him technique was just a method of getting what he wanted and was never obviously present. What was obvious was the artist.\n\"As for Helmut Newton yes you can describe his black and white, hard light\u2014often to the side, stark but romantic look but that doesn\u2019t describe his style and way of producing the characteristic kinkyness of his work. His approach was not technique dependent as much of his work was done with ambient and even soft light but retained the vision of the man.\n\"I could tell the Jill Greenberg shot from the Martin Scheoller image easily as both of them are part of the new technique-based photography where they find not a technique but a singular look and the only thing that really changes is the face the lens is pointing at. Martin shoots most of his stuff on 8x10 or larger with two strip lights at 45 degrees to the front of the subject as key lights with minimal to no post production. Jill Greenberg shoots on digital medium format with hard edge lights and a beauty dish as a main and then does extensive post production. What they have in common is that all their shots look the same as their last shoot. They produce photos without almost any variety to how they look.\u00a0 It is as if this look that they have produced is all that they know how to do and my oh my am I bored of their work. As artist they show no personal growth. Heck even Joey L. realized that he can\u2019t just be a younger Dave Hill clone and had to get away from all the illustrative stuff and bravo for him.\n\"But still this all reminds me of a song by Paul Simon, 'One Trick Pony':\nHe's a one trick pony\nOne trick is all that horse can do\nHe does one trick only\nIt's the principal source of his revenue....\"\nFeatured Comment by Rob Atkins: \"Reminds me of a comment made by the composer Philip Glass.

I have reinvented myself many a time and will do so again. What sux is when the generalists get much of the work and are often hired to do my look.\"\nMike replies: Jill, you'll laugh (or groan) at this: years ago, mainly for fun, I was doing \"senior portraits\" of my high school students, charging only $100 for a portrait just to cover my expenses. My style was very distinctive, owing in part to the wonderful light from huge, deep skylights in the art room. The kids liked my portraits and my services were much in demand.\nOne girl, the daughter of a famous and rich national celebrity, wanted me to do her portrait too, because I was doing portraits for all her friends, but her mother, who only bought the best of the best of everything, absolutely refused to have her daughter's senior portrait done by a guy who only charged $100! The mother insisted on hiring the most fashionable portrait photographer in Gerogetown at the time.\nBefore the girl's sitting, she came by my office asking to borrow a bunch of my portraits so she could ask her photographer to duplicate my style! I gave them to her. A week later, she brought in her finished portrait, which successfully mimicked the kind of work I did. The cost: $1200, or twelve times what I would have charged. (In the mid-'80s, that was at the high end of the local D.C. market for a portrait.) When I asked her if she liked it, she said, \"I do. It's almost as good as one of yours!\"\nPosted at 06:26 AM in Shooting techniques | Permalink | Comments (52)\nTuesday, 21 December 2010\nPost-Eclipse Report\nBy Ctein\nThe gods must've been feeling really kindly towards me last night. Instead of the expected solid overcast mixed with rain, there were alternating spells of rain showers, clouds, crystal-clear sky, and fog. Consequently, to my surprise and delight, the eclipse was visible from my house at several times during the evening, although the majority of the time the moon was not visible or was heavily veiled by clouds or fog.\nWhen it was clear, it was gorgeous, with the moon hanging above Orion. The view was even better through our 10-inch Dobsonian telescope; with the 38mm eyepiece we had a field of view several degrees wide, and the full moon simply looked spectacular. Again, to my surprise and delight, totality was even more beautiful than I expected; the moon was so dark that the background of stars was clearly visible in the eyepiece. Normally one doesn't notice any stars near the moon because it is so bright. In this case, it looked like a movie matte painting, with the glittery background.\nI decided to attempt some direct projection photography. That's when one uses the telescope as a large reflecting lens, with no eyepiece or camera lens involved, just projecting the reflected image onto the sensor of the camera. In effect, the telescope simply becomes a 1200 mm \u0192/4.7 lens. And, compared to many camera lenses, it's a pretty inexpensive hunk o' glass; a scope like ours costs only $500.\nI simply pressed the Olympus Pen body up against the end of the tube that would normally hold the eyepiece, focused the tube in and out until the image on the LCD looked sharp, and clicked away. Autoexposure mode worked fine.\nStill more surprise and delight: the photographs came out much, much better than I expected, especially seeing as I had never tried this before. Even some of the ones at full totality, with awkwardly long exposures, were decent. A wonderful bonus on top of seeing a great eclipse.\nFun, fun, fun!\nTotality is still almost an hour off, and the umbra has bitten only a small piece off of the moon. It's not actually black, although it appears almost so in this photograph. ISO 100, 1/320th sec. (as usual you can click on these images to open larger versions).\nA full hour into totality, with only 10 min. left, but the skies didn't clear before this point. Note the few stars visible in the background; many, many more were visible to the eye. ISO 800, 0.8 sec (As I wrote yesterday, totalities are dark.)\nTotality ended about 5 min. ago, and the moon has a lovely silvery rim that contrasts with the coppery light of the umbra. This is probably the prettiest photograph I got. ISO 800, 1/4 sec.\nTen minutes later, and totality is well over. With a long exposure like this the color in the shadow still comes through, but the sunlit portion of the moon is blown out. This is one of those cases where the human eye's adaptability puts photographic systems to shame. The brightness range in the scene is just barely within what the camera could record, so it's probably up around nine stops. But, to my eye the sunlit portion doesn't look very much brighter than the shadowed portion; it is still a delicate-looking scene. ISO 400, 1/4 sec.\nCtein\nSend this post to a friend\nPlease help support TOP by patronizing our sponsors B&H Photo and Amazon\nNote: Links in this post may be to our affiliates; sales through affiliate links may benefit this site.

Though it's not at all obvious that I will get to do so. We've been getting pretty steady rain and while I can see the sun at the moment, it's the first time all day, and tonight is predicted to be 70% chance of showers and 90% cloud cover. I am keeping my fingers crossed but not exactly getting my hopes up.\nBut if your weather is predicted to be better, go for it.\nDon't know if you'll be using film or digital camera, so I'll talk generally.\nThe full Moon is normally quite bright. At ISO 400, a good exposure is around\u00a0 \u0192/8\u00a0 at 1/500th\u00a0 second. But it gets a lot darker during an eclipse. Even during the early phases of a partial lunar eclipse, you'll want to be going to exposures around 1/125th\u00a0 second. By the time the moon is mostly covered, it will be more like \u0192/4 at 1/60th second. Full totality is really, really dark, much darker than it looks to the eye. It varies wildly depending upon the atmospheric conditions on earth, but you're going to be talking about exposure times anywhere between 1 and 20 seconds at \u0192/4 at ISO 400. If you've got a digital camera, this is a good time to crank it up to 1600; at least then you have a plausible chance of getting something with exposures no longer than 1 second.\nYou will either need a tripod or something you can brace the camera on. I make a lot of photographs, ad hoc, at night by just finding a flat surface that I can prop the camera on. If you're worried about jiggling the camera when you press the shutter for the exposure, use the self timer setting. Then you press the button, step back, and after a couple seconds it makes the exposure. Handy simple tricks.\nObviously, make lots and lots and lots of exposures. And bracket like crazy. Film is cheap. Electrons are cheaper.\nIf you have a zoom lens on your camera, make a bunch of photographs at the normal setting for the lens; the moon will be a very small disk, but you'll have a much higher percentage of reasonably sharp photographs. But also make a bunch zooming the lens out to its maximum telephoto setting. Much harder to get sharp photographs that way, but the moon will be much bigger and you'll probably be able to see some detail in the surface.\nFor more, see this article by Chris Lane from the archives.\nTotality will last 72 minutes beginning at 2:41 a.m. EST (on Dec. 21st) or 11:41 p.m. PST (on Dec. 20).

The reason is that I consistently and persistently \"see,\" in my mind, the studio around the shot.\nThat is, when I see this , I also \"see\" this . Maybe not specifically, but generically. I can't help it; I've spent too much time in studios, seen too many lighting setups. My brain always fills in around the shot. I've actually struggled to get back to being able to \"see\" just what's in the shot and no more, but it hasn't been much use\u2014I can't not imagine the studio, the lights, the camera, the people, the ever-present cabling, etc. The pictures, of course, depend for their success on being separated cleanly from of the context of the larger reality, but I imagine the context, too. Just because it's out of the picture isn't enough to make it invisible to me.\nMike\nNote: Sorry to have to say this out loud, but I hasten to add that I'm not critiquing the linked illustrations in any way, shape, or form.

Ctein's purpose in these columns is a) to help people who are trying this as well as b) to perhaps persuade them not to try. And, as you might understand, sometimes reading about even difficult and non-optimal technique can be interesting for its own sake. \u2014MJ\nBy Ctein\nTwo weeks back I wrote about the gradual demise of dedicated film scanners and how that might make it increasingly difficult if not impossible to conveniently scan film photographs for digital printing in the future. Many readers expressed interest in the idea of using a good digital camera in lieu of a dedicated film scanner; a few had even tried.\nDoing this really well requires knowledge and skill. If you don't care about doing it really well, and many of you don't (for good reasons, I do understand) then don't even bother. A flatbed scanner, even one a generation old, is going to do this better and a lot more conveniently. Mail-order outfits that charge circa a dollar a scan will easily beat your thrown-together rig.\nNow, on to camera and lens resolution concerns.\nThe actual resolution of a digital camera is only about half that of the pixel count. For example, a 24-megapixel camera will produce approximately 2800 x 4200 pixels worth of resolution (assuming a 2:3 format, just for the sake of conversation). Thirty-five millimeter film is about an inch wide [film width, not frame width, ignoring perforations \u2014Ed.], so you ought to be able to get 2400 PPI worth of \"scan\" resolution out of that, if you're doing everything right. Many people find that quite satisfactory. I don't, but I'm not normal people. If you pride yourself on the sharpness of your film originals and have spent good money for really good glass, you may find that you won't be either.\nFor larger film formats, a single camera exposure isn't likely to cut it, regardless of which camera you own. In that case, or if you own a lower pixel count camera, or if you're looking for better than merely adequate quality, you're going to be looking at stitching. Assuming you've properly addressed the alignment and illumination-uniformity issues I raised last column, this will not present a problem.\nNow we come to the matter of the lens. You cannot use just any old lens for this purpose and expect to get good sharpness corner-to-corner. You need a lens that's designed to deliver flat-field coverage with uniformly high image quality at the magnification you need. If you're working copying sheet film with a less-than-full-frame digital camera, the best solution is any top of the line enlarging lens, reverse mounted. Don't know which ones are really the best? Download a copy of my book Post Exposure , which includes my list of the very best enlarging lenses ever made, so good that they're visually flawless. Search the web for a used one; with the collapse of the darkoom business, you can often find some amazing bargains.\nAny of these lenses will work well down to about 1:5 magnification. Below that, things get iffy. 1:1 magnification is really the worst situation to be in; hardly any lenses perform well there unless they've been designed specifically for that magnification. Ken Werner found that of all the general purpose enlarging lenses, the Schneider Componon-S 50mm \u0192/2.8 was the best of the lot at 1:1, but it's still not great. When you're getting down in the low magnification range, you'll get better results with a lens designed for that. That would be the Rodagon D series lenses. The 120mm version is optimized for 1:2 or 1:3 magnification; the 75mm for 1:1.\nThis is TMAX100 film, scanned at 1200, 2400, and 4800 ppi. Observe that the film grain is still visible, although mushy even at 1200 ppi. Just because you can see grain in your scans doesn't mean they're sharp. Click on the image here to see it at 100%; the auto-resizing of TOP's blog\nsoftware masks some of the differences.\nDon't imagine that you can stop your lens way down and get around its deficiencies. This is one of those cases where you really do want to be working near the optimum aperture of your lens or you'll be losing sharpness. Just because you're seeing film grain in your camera-scans doesn't mean you've got a sharp image. Film grain behaves like noise, which means it doesn't average out at low resolutions. It just gets big and mushy and lower in contrast. You can see the film grain of fine-grained film in a 1200 PPI scan; it just looks horrible, like looking at a print made with a really, really cheap enlarging lens, badly focused (see illustration above).\nWell, that's everything I can think of for now. This is what you should be prepared to deal with if you want to do camera-scanning of your film and get results that are much better than you could get with an ordinary flatbed scanner. As I said at the beginning, you may not care about that or need that. That's cool; go live a happy life. But if you want really good quality scans, this is how to do it right.\nCtein\nSend this post to a friend\nPlease help support TOP by patronizing our sponsors B&H Photo and Amazon\nNote: Links in this post may be to our affiliates; sales through affiliate links may benefit this site.

Aren't they supposed to be excellent when it comes to sharpness, contrast and field curvature?\"\nCtein replies: Depends on the lens. Some of them are really excellent\u2014Pierce [Bill Pierce, master printer and former \"Nuts and Bolts\" columnist for the Digital Journalist, known universally to his friends by his surname only \u2014Ed.] reported to me that the classic 55mm Micro-Nikkor made a damned good enlarging lens, in fact.\nBut many aren't. In fact \"macro\" is frequently invoked by lens manufacturers to mean \"Anything we make that'll focus really close.\" Calling a lens a macro doesn't tell you any more about its quality than labeling something an \"enlarging lens.\"\nUnfortunately, while I have tested almost every credible enlarging lens ever made, I have not done the same for macros. So I can't tell you which ones in current production (if any) are really suitable and which aren't.\nFeatured Comment by Pierre Smith: \"I must admit I have tried pushing this to the limit after my Coolscan failed. As a Macro equipment junkie I assembled a Wild camera stand for Microscopes. Leica Visoflex bellows, and 65mm Elmar. The negatives are held in a Pentax filmholder attached to a Zeiss microscope XY drive. Focusing is by a hydraulic Z drive designed for micron focusing movements. I have also used a Zeiss Luminar 65mm, and Schneider 50mm Macro and 80mm Componon lenses. Photoshop is used to stitch 4x10MP files. this resolves grain on Rollei ATP1.1 with very sharp dust particles.\n\"The light source is diffused to minimise scratches. I have posted some results on the Leica forum. No unsharp masking required, and it results in the smooth high resolution I prefer.\"\nFeatured Comment by Barry Wheeler: \"The ASMP website of Digital Photography Best Practices has a nice page on camera scanning and links to a .pdf paper by Peter Krogh with more specific advice. I think it is a good starting point for many photographers. Here at the Library of Congress we've digitized tens of thousands of photographs, including from the original FSA negatives, using Sinar and PhaseOne and Aptus camera backs on a variety of commercial and specialized camera bodies and copy stands. While most individual photographers cannot afford our setup, they can get high quality results using Ctein's approach.\"\n[F.

There's a good reason it's a week late this year.\nI forgot.\nWhen I did remember, I had already done my \"Art of Tea\" column and didn't want to run two off-topic columns in a row, so I put this off another week. Consequently, a somewhat delayed Salubrious Solstice to you all. Now off we go, into the wild blue yonder.\nThe title of this column is a quote from Enrico Fermi, infamously referred to as the \"Fermi Paradox.\" The infamy lies in the fact that it is not anything like a paradox; it is simply a statement of utter ignorance. Why that is so will be the topic of this week's column.\nThe Fermi question concisely goes like this: there are tens of billions of planetary systems in this galaxy alone, thousands of quintillions in the observable universe. Even if only 1% of those develop life, even if only 1% of those life bearing planets develop intelligent life, even if only 1% of those intelligent life forms develop advanced technology, that's a heck of a lot of technologically-advanced, intelligent species out there. Furthermore, based upon the single data sample we have, it takes less than one third the age of the universe to go from a coalescing cloud of gas to an advanced technological intelligence. There's been plenty of time for other intelligences to evolve, several times over, and to advance far beyond us.\nSo far, though, we've seen no broadly-convincing evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence\u2014and it ought to be pretty obvious. Hence the paradox.\nExcept it's not really a paradox. That word assumes we understand the situation well enough to see a logical contradiction. Let me illustrate. If I become reasonably convinced that millions of people every year travel by airplane, but every airport I visit and every airplane I inspect is empty of people, then I've got a logical problem. I understand air travel well enough to know that these two observations\u2014millions of travelers, and empty airports\u2014aren't compatible. Something must be wrong in my assumption.\nBut try this one on: if a god (or gods) exists, she can certainly work miracles. Yet, as I walk through the world, it does not seem to be lousy with self-evident, irrefutable miracles. So, obviously there are no gods.\nWell, anyone above the grade school level can poke holes in that logic. It assumes you actually have some idea of what a god would think, what she would want to do, what would be her motivation for having created the whole shebang in the first place, etc. Most everybody with a lick of sense, whether or not they believe in a god(s), full well understands that there is no possible way they could have any idea how a god would think. You can't disprove the existence of deities by looking at an absence of miracles, because you have no way to conclude that commonplace miracles are an inevitable consequence of godhood.\nThe Fermi question is much more like the second than the first. To assume that advanced technological intelligence leads to either a signal, or interstellar travel, that we would recognize as such (that's important) requires making a huge number of unproven and untested assumptions about the physical universe and about what intelligence wants and does. You can create almost any scenario you want to imagine to explain the lack of observable data and at our current level of knowledge it is just as probable as any other scenario. Anything could be true. No thing in particular is very likely to be.\nThere is one data point we do all know something about: almost everything humans do makes no sense in any abstract, logical way. The overwhelming majority of our time, energy, and resources go into activities that cannot be explained as a consequence of intelligence. They aren't even behaviors that are typical of all species on Earth (although they aren't necessarily unique to ours). We are chock-full of species-specific behaviors that can be explained after the fact but couldn't be predicted purely on the basis of intelligence and certainly weren't inevitable on the basis of biology or evolution. They are just how we work.\nNot every human being is subject to all these impulses. A sufficient majority are, across time and space, that it's pretty safe to say they're characteristic of human beings as a species. Individual exceptions noted: Dear Reader, this is not about you. Let me regale you with a short and highly incomplete list. (I intentionally leave out a couple of very obvious biggies, because I don't need them to make the point; I can do it entirely with \"trivialities.\")\n1) Body ornamentation and decoration. Not limited to such things as jewelry or tattoos; includes hairstyling, makeup, clothes or fashion sense of any sort, whatever. All the stuff that goes into making you decide that you \"look good\" when you face other people.\nImagine how much time and money are expended by every man, woman, and child because they don't feel it is sufficient to simply wash up occasionally and throw on a gunnysack.\n2) Food \"composition,\" for lack of a better term. Cats find food that they can play with appetizing, but they sure don't seem to care much how it looks; we'd rather it sat still but are terribly sensitive to the aesthetics. At the high end we have things like sushi; that the low end we have the wonderful clich\u00e9 movie images of slop being splashed into a tray in a military mess or high school cafeteria line. Makes you lose your appetite just thinking about it, doesn't it?\n3) Acquisitiveness. The packrat instinct. Collecting, acquiring, hoarding of any sort far beyond what one can reasonably use within a reasonable period of time. It may be all those books you don't throw out, even though you're hardly likely to read them again. Or all the music you own, regardless of form and format; videotapes, DVDs, stamps, coins, barbwire, cameras or lenses that you haven't picked up in years but you might, you think. Clothing you never wear, furniture stored in the attic along with an extra set of dishes because, well, you never know. Think of how much smaller (and less expensive!) a living space you could dwell in if you limited your ownership to things you might reasonably need in the foreseeable future.\n4) Pets. 'Nough said?\n5) Real property/territory. Lots of species seem to do just fine without the concept of my/your real estate. Not humans. (Yes, a minority of cultures have explicitly rejected the concept of land ownership but (a) they are not the norm and (b) if the impulse weren't there, there wouldn't be a need to reject it.\n6) Religious impulse. Note that this is not the same as theology. The existence (or not) of gods and the inclination to believe in (or not) gods are entirely separate. Humans are intelligent and humans have religious impulse but we have no special reason to think that one is a consequence of the other. It just is.\nNow tally it all up. How much of your life, of the totality of society, is consumed and defined by satisfying one or more of these species-specific impulses?\nOverwhelmingly, almost every aspect of our lives is driven by this arbitrary set of inclinations that have no connection we understand to technological intelligence. We imagine that the nature and actions of hypothetical advanced civilizations can be rationally discussed and analyzed, yet most of our own is based upon characteristics that have no rationally-predictable basis for existence. They simply are.\nWe think we can even start to talk sensibly about the Fermi question as being a \"paradox?\" We don't know enough to make sense out of ourselves. We certainly don't have clues about anyone else.\nTo paraphrase Pogo, \"We have met the X and he is us.\"\nCtein\nEvery year around this time, TOP columnist Ctein (it's his only name, and is pronounced \"kuh-TINE\") puts the X in Xmas.\nSend this post to a friend\nPlease help support TOP by patronizing our sponsors B&H Photo and Amazon\nNote: Links in this post may be to our affiliates; sales through affiliate links may benefit this site.

Here's an example: There may be a colony of ants living under a rotted tree stump somewhere in the Amazon jungle who consider themselves the master of all they see around them. They have conquered and controlled the world they know. They may even be on a quest to find other 'intelligent' beings like themselves, but so far to no avail. Yet, unbeknownst to them, they share an entire planet with humans, who are thousands of times more intelligent and advanced, who are fully aware that such a thing as ants exist, but who simply don't care enough to ever bother looking for more of them under some random tree stump in some random corner of the world.

To those of you who still like darkroom printing of film, I think that's fine! I'm not dissing what you do, heaven knows, so please don't get defensive. Darkroom printing is great! You just happen to be a minority (much as black-and-white photography is a minority of all photography); the majority of serious photographic printers out there see hybrid as the better way to go.\nThis particular column is for said hybrid printers. If you're either entirely traditional or entirely digital, from camera to print, you can skip this\u2014it's irrelevant to you.\nWorkarounds\nTwo weeks back, I mentioned that my Minolta DiMAGE Multi Pro AF-5000 scanner had died and was in need of electronics servicing. I put out a call to any readers who knew of someone who still serviced this scanner. I came up with no one\u2014neither Precision Cameras nor Mack Cameras, the only two suggestions I got, work on this model, because they don't have a supply of parts for it. This is the first time in my experience that the hydra that is the TOP Readership, with its astonishing collective store of knowledge, was incapable of solving a photographic problem. It is all too possible that there really is no one repairing the scanners any longer, anywhere (if that's not true, please e-mail me: ctein@pobox.com).\nIn the meantime, I was able to circumvent the problem. My scanner had started behaving erratically and then wouldn't boot up at all. After some research I ran across a posting that pointed to a failure in the FireWire interface as the source of the problem. I switched the scanner to SCSI I/O and it booted up just fine. Well, I no longer have any SCSI-interfaced computers. More online research found me a SCSI-FireWire converter/adapter. So far, it's working fine.\nBut what happens when something goes wrong that I can't hack my way around? It is becoming more and more difficult to economically or conveniently get high-quality film scans.\nThis situation is one that I honestly did not expect anywhere near this soon. The wholesale switchover from film photography is a recent phenomenon. It's about a dozen years old for medium and large format film, and less than a decade old for 35mm film. That's not a long time, compared to how long most photographers have been photographing. The majority of important photographs in the world (either to the collective consciousness or the individual photographer) are on film, and the majority of serious photographers' stock is film photographs.\nIt's a legacy problem that the making of new photographs doesn't eliminate. Yet, it has already become just about impossible to do medium format film scans without throwing a great deal of money at the problem or scrounging around for old hardware.\nMinolta is no more and Nikon no longer makes medium format film scanners. The other major photographic manufacturers never did. There is still a high-quality medium format film scanner made: it's from Hasselblad. The low-end model starts at $13,000. Cough. Realistically, getting really good medium format film scans means either spending substantial sums of money with one of the few labs out there that still does scanning, or finding a used medium format scanner, which are in sufficient demand that they now go for about 50% more than they did originally.\nIf your scanner breaks, you will likely be in trouble. If you get a new computer, you'll likely be in trouble. No companies write updated drivers for these old scanners. Why should they care? You're going to have some very interesting problems if you try to run your old scanner under Windows 7 or Mac OS 10.7 (Lion). As in, you're not going to be able to! You'll need legacy hardware and software for that.\nIt is not going to get better. The issue here is not whether you can access an old photograph for secondary or casual use, it's whether serious photographers, who really cared about making good photographs, will have a way to make full use of the quality of those film photographs in the digital realm?\nFlatbeds\nBy and large, flatbed scanners don't take up the slack. Many of them will scan film, but they do it at a much lower level of quality, unless you spend very large sums of money for professional-level units (we're talking about gear that most photographers have never even heard of, with prices that can easily start in the high four figures and go into the mid-fives).\nI've been talking about medium format scanning but it's happening to 35mm, too. It just hasn't yet reached the crisis level. There are a lot fewer 35mm film scanners being made today than there were five years ago. I have a bad feeling that by the end of the decade, they are going to be as hard to find as medium format scanners are now, and they will be just as poorly supported.\nBefore I die (or give up photography) I may no longer have \"access\" to my 30-odd years of film photographs. Until recently I had not even imagined that this could become a possibility.\nIt is not a happy-making thought.\nCtein\nCtein's regular weekly column appears on Wednesdays.

You can only see about half of what I have; the jars are ranked three rows deep. The cardboard and paper packages contain my\npu-erh bings; the rest are various looseleaf teas in airtight jars.\nBy Ctein\nOnce again, we wander far afield from photography. If my off-topic columns are not your cup of...(oh, I can't say it), skip this column and tune in again next week.\nMy off-topic topic is tea. Expect several columns on this, because I'm a real tea geek. No, I'm not an expert, just a geek. I do not have a seriously refined palate and I don't know most of the descriptive vocabulary. I just really, really like my tea, and I insist upon good tea.\nTea's my major extravagance (other than living in the San Francisco Bay Area). I live on the stuff. Don't like coffee (except iced, when it's hot out). I can't abide the taste of alcohol, I don't smoke, and I've not used any drugs except theobromine. I am an effete, intellectual, elitist teetotaler, and I raise my pinky in your direction.\nLipton's, or one of its brethren, packaged in little tissue paper bags, thrown in a cup, boiling water poured over it, and steep until it's dead? That's the tea equivalent the coffee that's been sitting in the pot at your local gas station since ungodly-A.M. in the morning. It's no wonder you have to load it with mega-amounts of lemon or milk and sugar to make it palatable.\nGood tea, properly brewed, is another matter. For a start, \"properly brewed\" generally means no boiling water (unless it's a pu-erh). Pouring boiling water on tea is a lot like making coffee by tossing the grounds in a saucepan of boiling water and cooking it for a while.\nDepending on the tea, the proper brewing temperature may be anywhere between 140 and 190\u00b0F (60\u201390\u00b0C). Not that there's one right way to make tea. In my various books, I've seen brewing instructions for the same delicate green tea that went from 140\u00b0 for 90 seconds up to 165\u00b0 for 3\u20135 min. Still, a far cry from boiling water.\nSpeaking of brewing, here's a handy trick if you're caffeine-sensitive. My housemate, Paula, is very much so, as are several friends. They testify that this works. Take those unbrewed tea leaves and pour hot water on them for 30-45 seconds. Pour off that brew and toss it. Ninety percent of the caffeine goes away in that first infusion.\n(Important: the results may vary considerably with the tea. While I have found this to work reliably, if caffeine is severely contraindicated for you for medical reasons, do not rely on this!)\nMy tea preferences lean towards the Japanese and Chinese teas, mostly greens, wulongs, and pu-erhs. Most of it costs real money. Tea prices have skyrocketed this century. Ten years ago I had an absolute upper limit of $100 a pound for tea. These days I often spend several times that, although I've discovered some wonderful and excellent teas in the $10\u2013$50/lb. range.\nEven at double digits per ounce, tea is still a remarkably cheap beverage. I describe it as an extravagance, but I'd be surprised if I spend over a dollar a day on tea and I drink about a liter a day. I need only a gram or two of high-quality tea in an individual infuser; 20 portions from an ounce is normal. I get anywhere from three to eight infusions from one portion. Compare that to the price of Starbucks, or even your local gas station coffee.\nThis just has to be the world's greatest tea infuser. The owners of Aroma gave me one after making a large purchase at their shop; it changed my life.\nHow do I brew tea? I am like a total fan of the individual PIAO 1 infuser\n. It makes brewing a fresh cuppa easy, no fuss and very little muss, and it's fun to play with. Measure in a teaspoon or so of leaf. Pour in water of the appropriate temperature. Let it steep for the appropriate time. Push the little button on the top and a ball valve at the bottom opens and filtered tea flows into the container. The leaf remains in the top part of the infuser.\nWhere do you get good tea? There are some good mail-order companies, especially ones that specialize in certain types of teas. For general offerings of all varieties and nationalities, I think Uptons is by far the best. Their catalogs are wonderful and informative. That's where I learned the decaffeination trick. You'll also learn what all the terms of art mean (Lipton's famous \"flowery orange pekoe\" is not some fancy varietal, it merely denotes a rather low grade of tea quality).\nUnfortunately, while they're really quality teas, their tasters just don't have the same palette as I do. Consequently, I don't buy a lot from them. The very best thing about Upton is that they have small sampler packs (good for 2\u20133 pots) for just a few dollars apiece, so for not very much money I can try a whole lot of different teas. I regularly get samples from Upton to check out and every so often I hit on a winner, like their gyokuro kenjyo.\nMost of my buying is from local fine tea shops that I visit, using the word \"local\" rather loosely. Here are my personal favorites:\nSan Francisco\u2014 Aroma \u2014Haymen Da Luz and Ying Wu\n"}, {"score": 206.42189, "uuid": "5cc2864b-d5fe-5934-90f2-00821b1cdc32", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-55-24452", "target_hostname": "agency.magnumphotos.com", "target_uri": "http://agency.magnumphotos.com/about/news", "page_rank": 1.9205466e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "News from Magnum | Magnum In Motion", "snippet": "<em>I</em> <em>prefer</em> not to stay in <em>a</em> hotel, because <em>I</em> don\u2019t have <em>a</em> lot of money and because <em>I</em> want to see the way people live in Russia.

I am very grateful for the opportunity and honored to follow in the footsteps of the artists who have previously been given the award,\u201d said Subotzky.\nSubotzky was born in Cape Town, and is currently based in Johannesburg. His work has been exhibited widely in major galleries and museums, and his prints are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the South African National Gallery, Cape Town, the Johannesburg Art Gallery, and FOAM (FotoMuseum Amsterdam).\n\u201cMikhael Subotzky's technical, aesthetic and academic explorations have seen him become one of the world's exciting photographers,\u201d said Brenton Maart, National Arts Festival committee member for Visual Art. \u201cHe uses photography to make images that are both nuanced constructions of colour and light, and also scholarly studies of the peculiarities of South African communities. The young artist establishes the boundaries of his subject matter and, within these confines, delves into fraught and loaded social spaces,\u201d Maart added.\nWhen asked what audiences can expect from Mikhael Subotzky in Grahamstown next year, the response was a mysterious: \u201cA few surprises.\u201d\n> More Information\nThe Magnum Foundation announces 4 scholarships for the 2012 NYU/Magnum Foundation Photography and Human Rights Program.\nThe Magnum Foundation is pleased to announce that 4 scholarships will be available for the 2012 NYU/Magnum Foundation Photography and Human Rights Program.\nThe scholarship funds cover the 6-week program at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, housing, travel, and living expenses, as well as additional cultural activities in New York with the opportunity to meet editors, publishers, and visit some of the most prestigious photography museums and galleries.\nThe four scholarships are open to applicants living and working in, and native to any of the following regions: Latin America, the Caucasus Region, Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, or the Middle East.\nSupport for these scholarships has been generously provided by the Open Society Foundations and Nancy Stephens and Rick Rosenthal of The Rosenthal Family Foundation.\nAbout the Program\nThe Department of Photography & Imaging at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and the Magnum Foundation present programming in photography and human rights for the third summer, spearheaded again by Professor Fred Ritchin of the Department and Susan Meiselas of the Magnum Foundation.\nThe scholarship is aimed at intermediate and advanced international students, including experienced professionals. The six-week program is comprised of four courses and is designed to enable students to explore strategies for creating effective documentary projects in pursuit of human rights. Students will propose multimedia or traditional presentation strategies for their photo essays, which they will develop through two studio courses. A lecture course will provide participants with an opportunity to look at photography's strengths and weaknesses, both real and imagined, in attempting to determine new strategies for its use as both society and technology evolve. The final component is a discussion and writing course correlating with a public guest lecture series featuring speakers from the fields of photojournalism, law, and media. Scholarship fellows will remain in New York for an additional week to meet with local editors, publishers, and other experts in the field and explore museums, galleries, and other cultural resources.\nMore information about the program, including updates, can be found on the NYU website at http://photo.tisch.nyu.edu/object/photomagnum2012.html .\nApplicants must be fluent in the English language.\nAbout the Application Process (Applications Accepted November 29th- December 19th)\nMaterials should include:\n1.

During the \u201cTribute to Photography\u201d night on September 1st Steve McCurry was awarded the prize donated by Leica Camera AG: a Leica M9-P with the engraved name of the award and Steve McCurry\u2019s hand-written signature.\nKarin Rehn-Kaufmann, Director of Leica Gallery Salzburg, presented the award. \u201cSteve McCurry is telling stories with his pictures, moving stories. By this he involves us in the fate of people worldwide. For Steve McCurry the human is the center\u201d, said Karin Rehn-Kaufmann.\nFor more than three decades, the 61 years old McCurry has been on the road, producing sensitive and impassioned documentary photographic works across the globe and has been recognized with numerous accolades for his work. His documentary on the Soviet invasion to Afghanistan won him international fame. He also covered, amongst others, the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and the Yugoslav Wars, and sent reports from Lebanon, Tibet, Yemen, and Cambodia. His iconic photograph of the \u201cAfghan girl\u201d Sharbat Gula, was taken in 1984 near the Nasir Bagh refugee camp and first appeared on the cover of National Geographic. His career was launched when, wearing native clothing, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel-controlled Afghanistan just before the Russian invasion. When he emerged, he had rolls of film sewn into his clothes that contained some of the world's first images of the conflict. His coverage won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad Showing Courage and Enterprise. Since 1986, Steve McCurry has been a member of the renowned photographic agency Magnum.\nDr. Andreas Kaufmann, chairman of the supervisory board of Leica Camera AG, explains why Steve McCurry was chosen as the first awardee of the Leica Hall: the reason is his indefatigable commitment to a kind of reportage photography focussing on the sufferings and inhuman concomitants of acts of war: \u201cMore than almost anyone else, Steve McCurry has recorded the terrible consequences of war and persecution and has thus had decisive influence on our perception of world affairs for decades. For his work, he deserves our thanks and recognition.\u201d\nThe Leica Hall of Fame Award, which has now been awarded for the first time, stands in a tradition of earlier awards initiated by Leica Camera AG to honour outstanding photographers. The prize is awarded to photographers who have rendered outstanding services to the Leica brand and to the genre of photography. The prize shall be awarded sporadically without competition and without the decision of a jury.\nThe Leica M9-P is a particularly robust version of the M9 reportage camera. The specialty of the Leica M9-P: for the sake of inconspicuousness, Leica\u2019s signature feature, the characteristic red point, has been avoided. The camera also features a sturdy sapphire glass display to withstand the harshest working conditions. Many reportage photographers from all over the world use the cameras of Leica\u2019s legendary M range finder camera system but paste the brand logo over to avoid attracting attention during their field work.\n> View a selection of Steve McCurry's iconic photography\nEli Reed to be honored by the 2011 Lucie Awards for Achievement in Documentary Photography\nThe Lucie Foundation has just announced that Magnum Photographer Eli Reed will be honored at the 2011 Lucie Awards for his achievement in documentary photography.

Before I ever got into the position of making photographs for publication, I explored my surroundings through my photography. It has brought me into places both of a physical and spiritual nature.

Through the lenses of their Leicas, they have captured the decisive moments of the 20th century with a unique vision and unparalleled intensity.\nMagnum was established to reflect the independent nature of Magnum photographers as both people and photographers. The idiosyncratic mix of reporter and artist continues to define Magnum, producing work that emphasizes not only what is seen, but also the way one sees it.\nOver the past sixty years, Magnum and Leica have made extensive contributions to the recording of history. Individually, each brand stands alone as a pioneer in its field. Leica has become synonymous with the best tools of the trade, blending hand-crafted quality with a dedication to precision mechanics and producing the best optics the industry has to offer. From the moment Henri Cartier-Bresson picked up his first Leica I, Magnum photographers have pushed the limits of documentary photography, and in turn the limits of their Leica\u2019s, with groundbreaking results.\nIn December 2010, Magnum and Leica, building on their shared history, agreed to collaborate on a series of projects that continue their longstanding dedication to independent documentary photography. Alfred Schopf, CEO Leica Camera AG, and Magnum photographer Jonas Bendiksen, President of Magnum Photos International Inc., signed the project agreement in Solms, Germany.\nBeginning in the Spring of 2011, Leica will sponsor the creation of a series of independently produced multimedia essays by Magnum photographers that will take a deeper look into the stories behind the photographs. The work will highlight the personal journeys and insatiable curiosity of Magnum photographers.\nLeica and Magnum will publish the stories online at www.Leica-camera.com , http://www.lfi-online.de , and www.magnumphotos.com .\nCommenting on the agreement, Magnum President Jonas Bendiksen stated: \"The purpose of Magnum and its member photographers is to continue our long-standing commitment to discovering, witnessing, and communicating visually the sentiments of mankind. With this new agreement, Leica is making an important statement in support of that shared responsibility.\"\nTailoring to the needs of professionals\nIn addition to supporting individual projects, Leica and Magnum will use the production of the new essays as an opportunity to learn from Magnum photographers\u2019 experiences in the field with the latest Leica equipment. Magnum photographers\u2019 input will contribute to Leica\u2019s extensive ongoing user research efforts, with the shared goal of continuing to develop the Leica portfolio and tool-set to serve the needs of photographers world-wide.\nEnglishman George Rodger, another of Magnum's founding photographers, recalled how his colleague Robert Capa, the agency's dynamic leader, envisioned the photographers' role after World War II: \"He recognized the unique quality of miniature cameras, so quick and so quiet to use, and also the unique qualities that we ourselves had acquired during several years of contact with all the emotional excesses that go hand in hand with war. He saw a future for us in this combination of mini cameras and maxi-minds.\"\nStephan Daniel, Leica\u2019s head of product development says: \"The cooperation between Magnum and Leica will help us to create even better tools for professional photographers, both by getting their feedback with actual equipment and by testing future products. Stressing a camera or a lens under harsh circumstances is a welcome and important addition to our internal test procedures, making our products even more perfect for the hard daily work of professionals.\"\nContacts:\n"}, {"score": 205.23619, "uuid": "a2826591-64df-57f4-8ace-6df7fc018407", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-92-24478", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/equipment/canon/300D/", "page_rank": 1.1934409e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Canon EOS Digital Rebel (EOS 300D) Review - photo.net", "snippet": "<em>I</em> myself are thinking about replacing my EOS IX with the 300D, since the IX itself lacks some things the 300D has.

It seems almost indentical to the 10D as it seems to use the same CMOS sensor chip. Here are the specs:\n- CMOS sensor with 6.3 Million pixels at 22,7 mm\u00d7 15,1 mm\n- 7 point AF\n- 35 points for exposure calculation\n- DIGIC processor\n- 2.5 frames/s for 4 frames\n- Shutter speeds of 1/4000 to 30 seconds\n- CF I/II memory cards\n- Plastic body weighting 560 gramms with dimensions 142 mm\u00d7 99 mm\u00d7 73 mm\n- No custom functions (as I understand)\n- Storage by four resolutions and RAW-format\n- ETTL flash\n- Integrated flash with GN 13\n- 95% viewing field\n- USB interface (1.1 or 2.0 not mentioned) and Video out\n- 1.8\" LCD screen with 118,000 pixel\n- Top data-LCD and LCD-screen illuminated\nAnd now for the price: This camera will cost 1,099 euros. So in $$ I think this will be less.\nWhat is more intersesting that there will be new lenses! The so called EF-S lenses with short back technology are similar to the Nikon digital lenses that take use of the smaller sensor. The EF-S 18-55 f/3,5-5,6 will cost 100 euros. Normal EF mount lenses can be used.\nIt seems Canon has made another big deal. Nikon etc. beware!\nStefan\n, August 20, 2003; 07:51 A.M.\nSpecifications of EOS300D on this site: http://213.247.48.188/ProdSpecs_EOS300D.asp\nGerry Szarek , August 20, 2003; 08:28 A.M.\nBig downgrade from the 10D, first plastic body, second NO custom menus. This camera is aimed squarely at the PS crowd. The good news out of this is they are releasing a 100~400 F4 L with IS, assuming it's better optically than the current 100~400 this lens should sell like hot cakes!!!\nIt looks like Nikon/Minolta/Sony are in BIG trouble with this new camera.\nGS\nMark Goldstein , August 20, 2003; 08:29 A.M.\nI have posted all of the EOS 300D news, press release, product shots and an interview with Canon Marketing on my blog:\nMark\nTodd Adams , August 20, 2003; 08:37 A.M.\nI have to disagree with Gerry. This is neither for the point and shoot crowd nor the professionals. I think Canon aimed for a neglected market segment and nailed it perfectly.\nThere are those who've taken a renewed interest in photography as a result of digital technology and they will be willing to spend a bit more for higher quality and more control. That's exactly what the 300D will give them. It's too much of a toy for professionals, and 'too much' period for someone who wants to take snapshots of the kids. But for those in the middle, it's just right, as will be the price.\nkarthik nandyal , August 20, 2003; 09:02 A.M.\nEOS 300D also has a wireless remote control RC5. I am not sure if EOS10D had this option. The only remote that was available on 10D was the \"hard-connected\" cable.\nJim Larson , August 20, 2003; 09:49 A.M.\nClearly the dSLR rebel that has been long rumoured.\nDavid Re , August 20, 2003; 10:03 A.M.\nTwo other quick notes - it's slower (2.5fps) and has a smaller buffer (4 images) than the 10D (3fps, 9 image buffer). For the target audience of the camera, though, I don't think this'll make much difference.\nIt might turn out to be a great lightweight backup to a 10D - or even for a pro-level 1D or 1Ds, depending on your needs. Definitely would be easier to hike with!\nHopefully, Canon will develop the EF-S line of lenses a bit, and give us a true wide angle lens for the 1.6x crop factor cameras - something like an 8-18/2.8 would be really slick :)\nDave\nPaulo Machado , August 20, 2003; 10:52 A.M.\nI do expected a camera like this but a litle better. It seems that canon won't be by this level for the public canon has to achieve - the entusiasts of photography that love to creat with semi-pro equipment.\nI have a great set of canon equipment (eos 30/Elan II, with canon L series lenses)and I\u00b4m not convinced to change for a digital body in plastic!!!. But I have to say the 300D has a great look and specs.\nJoel Becker , August 20, 2003; 11:36 A.M.\nCHEERS to Canon for breaking the $1k barrier. Here we go, folks.\nJEERS to Canon for removing the second command dial. Folks who like A and M modes will find that particularly annoying.\nJEERS to Canon for going with the EF-S small-sensor-only lens. Small-sensor lock-in is a bad idea, as is a 3.5 max aperture lens. According to LetsGoDigital, the lens puts its rear element closter to the sensor than can be done on a full-sized 35mm.\nD L , August 20, 2003; 11:37 A.M.\n$999! Available mid sept. http://www.usa.canon.com/templatedata/pressrelease/20030820_digitalrebel.html\nDmitriy Belenko , August 20, 2003; 12:26 P.M.\n$999 is for the kit. Body only is $899 (which means $799 from some retailers). Boy, do I feel stupid about buying a 10D now!\nKen Dunn , August 20, 2003; 01:05 P.M.\nlooks like the new lens will only work with the digital rebel and not even the 10D if I am reading it right (\"work on no other EOS camera\")\nErb Duchenne , August 20, 2003; 01:21 P.M.\nI think Canon is bang on the buck with the 300D. It's clearly targeted at a huge group of people in my shoes, an amateur enthusiast who's resisting the move to digital because of price.\nI currently have EOS 1000FN, EOS 100 and EOS 300 bodies and of course a range of lenses. My current choices for a digital move is limited to the EOS 10D, which although is relatively cheap, still sports the same price as the top of the range professional film EOS cameras. Although the G5 is cheaper and offers some manual control, it is still more expensive than any one of the cameras I currently own and it can't share any of the lenses. There's also the red eye and chromatic aberration problems to deal with. Moving on to a prosumer digital, really, is a downgrade.\nWith the 300D I can get the cheapest digital SLR yet, I don't have to buy a super expensive wide angle for the 1.6 multiplication, I get 6.3 Megapixels and probably can produce just as good a picture on it as I would on a 10D. I'd be out the door to buy one right now if it were in the shops today.\nWhy anyone would complain it isn't up to specs with the 10D is beyond me. If it were, the 10D would have to have its price reduced drastically and previous 10D and D60 owners will be throwing stones at every Canon representative they find. So will Nikon and all the other camera makers! :P\nForrest Croce , August 20, 2003; 02:17 P.M.\nThe 35 mm film killer.\nAlthough Canon made a \"special\" EF-S lens to \"complement\" this camera, it still takes the full range of 35 mm EF lenses, along with the TS-E and MP-E MF/EF lenses. Wide-angle is a very real issue, but the other side of the coin is that this beast comes with a VERY good 1.6x teleconverter, that's free in money terms, and doesn't rob your lenses of a stop.\nThis is the first and only digital SLR to sell for less than $1,000 ( USD ), and by a wide margain. The point is to kill of 35 mm film. With six million image pixels and a decent low-pass filter, this gives you all the print resolution of anything but Provia 100F, with a lot less noise/grain.\nOf course, there's still medium and large format, and if you're realistic, 35 mm was always the Micky Mouse of film formats. This camera is going to bring digital into a lot more hands, and it's going to make a lot of people better photographers, as they can now experiment, and control the developing of their images.\nJamie W , August 20, 2003; 03:48 P.M.\nHere is the way I see things.\n1D(s) is like the 1v\n10D is the Elan 7\nD300 is rebel\nIt's not a matter of which is better or worse. It's a matter of do you need the improved features enough to fork out the additional cash. From what I can tell (not counting 11mp sensors =) the main differences between Canon's three DSLR are basically the same as in their film counterparts. That is, auto focus speed/tracking, exposure control, motor drive, and build quality. Put the same lens on all of the cameras and set to manual everything and you will get EXACTLY the same quality picture (again discounting 11mp =). The difference is in how well the camera can help you get the picture.\nQiang Lin , August 20, 2003; 03:54 P.M.\nPlease don't judge anything by PLASTIC. This is not the same plastic used in lunch boxes. People use plastic in airplanes, space shuttles. If you don't like plastics, you don't have to, but there is no point to say that something is bad because of using plastic. Canon is a reputable company that builds quality equipments. I don't think their product will break easily. Same applies to Nikon, ... I truely believe this camera has good value, and hope I will have the budget to buy it soon.\nMarcus Christian , August 20, 2003; 05:58 P.M.\nI agree with a few others, I think this camera is spot on. Glad it got a 6mpxl sensor, I was just expecting a 4. It's definitely a Rebel for features which kind of sucks for anyone that has moved onto Elans and beyond, but if like me you'd love to go DSLR but can't afford it then this is $600 closer than before. If you have to have the extra features get a 10D and stop whining.\nAs for the 18-55, making it incompatible with other digitals seems odd. I wonder if shortening the backthrow let them keep the cost down somehow? It is dirt cheap. Now we get to look forward to all the posts about people breaking their other cameras trying to use one they bought on ebay.\nWonder what it will do to D30/D60 prices? I see them taking a rapid nose dive now.\nMark U\n, August 20, 2003; 07:52 P.M.\nApart from the frame rate and buffer, the 300D offers almost exactly the same capability as the 10D - including AF performance - and thus much debate in this forum will be curtailed. The ergonomics are different, to be sure, but it's a winner. What about the \"plastic\" body? There's a warning in the manual (already available online) about not touching the internals if the camera breaks open on being dropped, so it may not be ultimately robust. However, the Rebel/EOS 300 bodies are tougher than many suppose. But the lack of metal does leave it open to electromagnetic fields in both directions - there are also warnings about not using it in an aircraft or hospital, and away from strong fields such as power transmission lines. For digital, metal is about more than robustness.\nJay Dougherty , August 20, 2003; 09:06 P.M.\nSmart move. Not a camera I'd want, but I know many who would.\nMike Burley , August 20, 2003; 11:46 P.M.\nWell good job. I mean that sarcastically, yet a liitle serious. This is a smart move, for canon. THey will make more money from consumers in the amature-electronic-geek category. Every yuppy/student/amature SLR user will buy this. Its WAY better then a power shot or any other digital camera that isn't an SLR. On the other hand, WHY isn't there a new pro DSLR like I thought was coming out today!!!!??? CRAP!!!! I'm waiting to buy a 1D, and thought that a new 1D (maybe 1DX) was coming out. I want the price to drop on the 1D so I can buy it. Shame on canon for not r4eleasing a camera for pros. (OK maybe harsh) ANYONE know when the 1DX or whatever the hell it is, is coming out so I can buy the freakin' 1D? Or expect a price drop? Thanks. PS: Who wants to sell a 1D?\nRiver Side , August 21, 2003; 02:20 A.M.\nExcellent!!!\nThe 10D price HAS to come down.. $1600 is atrocious.. $900 for 98% of the performance means 10D is way overpriced..\nI've love to get my hands on this baby..\nOne thought though.. would this mean Canon wouldn't be revamping it's film SLR\"s.. i was so waiting for a new Elan 7 .. maybe Canon can now surprise us with an under $2000 Film + Digital interchangeable back camera.\n, August 21, 2003; 02:23 A.M.\nHi Bob,\nThanks for the quick comparison to the 10D. Just a small editorial note. You wrote \"Since the mirror is maller than in a full frame DSLr...\". I guess that \"maller\" is supposed to be \"smaller\" and that \"DSLr\" should be \"DSLR\" ?\nHappy shooting , Yakim.\nRichard Thompson , August 21, 2003; 03:31 A.M.\nRiverside - you wont see an interchangable film/digital back for an EOS. The internal design of the film and digital cameras are very different - they have been developed from the ground up (unlike the D30 which they used the base of film eos to start on)\nJenda Knoulich , August 21, 2003; 07:26 A.M.\nMark U, where did you say was the user manual available online?\nRon Chappel , August 21, 2003; 08:09 A.M.\nThe auto compatability with XP and OS-x without drivers is a serious benifit to travelers.Just go into any internet cafe and get pics burnt to CD etc. <br>A good sensible feature\nJamie Walters , August 21, 2003; 08:36 A.M.\nHas anyone else heard anything about Canon releasing a 100-400 f/4 L IS??? I checked the Canon USA website and there is nothing about it.\nThis could be the answer to my needs !!! I hope its true!!!\nOliver S. , August 21, 2003; 09:47 A.M.\nI think someone misread the specs of the 100-400mm on the 300D site. The lens I found is the current Ef 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM. (Btw where are the EF 200-600mm f/4.0 DO IS USM and the EF 500mm f/2.8 DO IS USM that Canon rumoured when the EF 400mm f/4.0 DO IS USM hit the markets?)\nThe 10D price HAS to come down.. $1600 is atrocious.\nTell that to Europeans who have to shell out \u0080 1900 for a 10D. List price is \u0080 2200. Canon Europe exploits us.\nCan be that EF-S lens used on a film camera? Or it won't cover the entire 35mm frame?\nNot only doesn't it cover the entire frame (neither do the DX Nikkors), its rear element is recessed so far that the slightly larger mirror of an 35mm SLR would hit it. (The Nikon 12-24mm f/4.0 DX clears at least some Nikon 35mm SLRs' mirrors. I don't know about the other new DX lenses.)\nWrt the 300D itself, I have mixed feelings: great camera, but the ergonomics... perhaps I can survive without a rear control dial, although my ancient EOS 600 occasionally drives me mad. But I need an AF that has nothing to do with the shutter release--even the EOS 600 has the famous CF4.\nSandeep Gupta , August 21, 2003; 10:40 A.M.\nI am kind of surprised to see Canon come out with a lens that is designed for a specific digital camera. What happened to the 'unsurpassed compatibility' claim ?\nLooks like Canon is trying to follow ideas of some of its competitors instead of being a trend-setter.\nChachi Arcola , August 21, 2003; 11:53 A.M.\nWhen the 10D came out, many speculated/expected that it would come down close to the $1000 range after the first year. I agree that $900 for a 300D vs. $1500 for a 10D is going to make a lot of people go for a 300D. Of course, given that the 10D was really only a D60 \"Mk. II\", it may be within Canon's plan and profit margin to sell lots of 300Ds instead, while it develops the 10D's successor. Given that Canon seems to have abandoned 24x36mm sensors for all but its \"pro\" digital bodies, it could be that the technological improvements in \"semi-pro\" DSLRs has leveled off somewhat, and the only improvements we're likely to see in the near future are in AF algorithms, buffer speeds and FPS. One thing's for sure, if you're hanging on to a D60 or D30 that you've been planning to sell, better unload it quick. You'd be foolish to pay more than $400 for a D30 nowadays.\nErb Duchenne , August 21, 2003; 12:18 P.M.\n\"I am kind of surprised to see Canon come out with a lens that is designed for a specific digital camera. What happened to the 'unsurpassed compatibility' claim ?\"\nI may be inclined to agree with you if I understood what you were getting at. By introducing these new lenses, Canon's compatibility has been surpassed?\n\"Looks like Canon is trying to follow ideas of some of its competitors instead of being a trend-setter.\" Looks like. And they followed ...'s idea by releasing the EOS 300D.\nHey... I'd buy the rebel if it were made of paper and it's price were a coupla' hundred bucks less. I'd just have to take better care of the camera and not get it wet, right? My plastic is drawn. It's just a matter of which shop receives stock first. Ooooh, aren't these exciting times? :D\nMatt Kime , August 21, 2003; 01:16 P.M.\nI think that until full frame 35mm sensors become cheaper, this issue of digital lenses will continue to be an issue. It simply makes sense to use lenses that provide no more coverage than necessary. True, this means you can't interchange lenses with your 35mm equipment, but you're also lugging around a lot less glass.\nMike Burley , August 21, 2003; 03:10 P.M.\nI commented earlier, that I wondered if the 300d would have an effect on the price of the 1D NOT the 10D (like someone mentioned). the 10d is in the same category as the 300d. The 1D is NOWHERE near either.Its a pro sports/PJ camera. So i was wondering if the 300d would indirrectly make the 1D drop in price. Or if anyone knows when the 1DX ( or whatever the name for the replacement 1D is) comes out. I am only waiting another month or so to buy the 1D and dont want to buy it right before a price drop. Any help out there?\nBob Atkins\n, August 21, 2003; 07:17 P.M.\nSmall format lenses make some sense - if you think you'll never use a full frame format camera (film or digital). Otherwise, when you do go full frame you'll have to buy a whole new bag of lenses and either carry two sets of lenses around or attempt to sell the old ones (which could be tricky if an inexpensive full frame body is available).\nFor me it would make sense only if a full frame equivalent wasn't available. If a 10-30mm zoom appeared (16-48mm in 35mm FOV terms) for the 10D (i.e. EF mount and standard backfocus) I'd be interested. Nikon have a 12-24 (I think), so it's time for Canon to go \"one up\" on them!\nBTW in case anyone is just reading the comments, I've updated the original article slightly and added a link to Ritz who are now taking orders for the 300D for mid-September delivery (or at least that's when they hope to start shipping to the first people on their wait list!).\nAdam , , August 21, 2003; 07:20 P.M.\nThis is surprising to me, and I'm sure everyone who was not willing to spend the $$$ to move to digital SLRs yet had a film SLR now has little excuse not to buy one.\nPeople like me who bought a film SLR because they wanted something of high quality yet would last tens of years are now able to buy a digital camera and use the exact same lenses on it. Now I'm really glad I went with Canon, this will be perfect for me. Will (or when will) Nikon follow suit?\nTim Chakravorty , August 21, 2003; 08:39 P.M.\nNikon won't They think they will be able to indefinitely fool people into buying their archaic overpriced D100\nseth hosler , August 21, 2003; 09:56 P.M.\nCongrats to Canon for pulling this off. This ought to be a huge marketing success, whatever flaws the product may have.\nMore strikingly, this shows us just how far behind Minolta is. How can the maker of the best AF 35mm film cameras in the world totally deglect the digital segment? I'm still praying that someday soon there will be a \"Digital 7\" and a \"Digital 9\", using a full-size image sensor that allows me to use my current lenses with the focal lengths unchanged.\nIf anyone can explain to me any physical reson why a full-size sensor cannot be made, I would love to hear from you.\nMike Burley , August 22, 2003; 12:51 A.M.\nyou REALLY think that Minolta has ANY success in the AF department? you havn't used the canon EOS 1V's or eos 3's eye control 45 point AF have you? I'm an ex-minolta user and NEVER looked back. They dont make any pro level cameras to match up to canon's new line of USM & IS lenses and and fastest AF I'v ever used. But thats just my opinion....\ngabriele lopez , August 22, 2003; 04:20 A.M.\nSeth, for what I know there are really big problems when you use current designed wide angles on a full size digi sensor, for the fact that those don't like very much angled light rays...the problem instead don't persist with telephoto lenses. At this point you should re-design many lenses....at this point, I think, is just easy to create lens for that \"little\" sensor, that otherwise is even cheaper to produce and change in case of accidents..\nSorry for your lenses compatibility, but anyway, this one of the total system compatibility is a thing that probably is not destined to last......and I use plenty of Mf lenses, too!!\nI hope I explained something in a not-so-good English.\nCiao!\nD L , August 22, 2003; 05:15 A.M.\nBob, you forgot to add that digital Rebel does not allow user to select AF modes(One shot or AI Servo). It uses AI Focus in creative zones, meaning automatic detection and switching between the two.\nAxel Farr , August 22, 2003; 05:45 A.M.\nNeue Seite 1\nHello Bob,\nthanks to you for your report about the EOS 300D! For completeness you should include some more facts in your report:\nthe EOS 300D seems to be very related to the 300V concerning the layout of the body. If that means that the camera has a metallic lens mount is not yet shure, since all available photos show the body only with a lens mounted. A plastic lens mount might be a severe drawback even for amateurs who want the camera to be used e.g. on a larger and heaviert telephoto lens; but I expect Canon has learned from the success of the EOS 300V that even a low-priced camera can have a solid lens mount without much additional expense.\nthe EOS 300D has some of the EOS 10D's custom functions (CF) implemented into the normal menu settings. There e.g. the use of \"red-eye-reduction\" for the internal flash can be determined as well as the image kind and size. Probably not all settings will be possible, so I do not expect sync on second courtain be available on the 300D.\nthe EF-S 18-55mm 1/3.5-5.6 lens will (in the moment) not fit to any other camera than the EOS 300D. In fact, the lens will not be available other than bundled with the EOS 300D for only 100$ or \u0080 more than the camera allone.\nthe EF-S mount of the lens and camera are designed that way that the back of the lens reaches some 4mm deeper into the camera than with a normal EF mount. To avoid mechanical damage on lens or body when trying to mount an EF-S lens to a camera with an EF mount, the back of the lens is coated with a rubber, which sticks agains a part of the body inside the normal EF body mount (and not the mirror), so the system is idiot-proof\nsince the new EF-S lens will not fit to any existing EF extension tube, Canon announced the availability of new extension tubes with the 300D. The ET 12 II and ET 25 II extension tubes will replace the older tubes, since they allow any EF and EF-S lens to be mounted and also fit to any EOS body (since the rear element of an EF-S lens is inside the tube, no collision with elements of any EOS body is possible)\nCanon also announced a II version of the EF 55-200mm 1/4.5-5.6 USM lens. It differs from the (no longer available) I version by the same rear coating of the lens that is implemented in the EF-S 18-55mm lens in order to ommit ghosting when used with a digital SLR. It is a regular EF lens (the EF-S mount is only useful for short focal lengths) and is meant as an ideal comparision for the 300D set. The I version was once presented together with the EOS IX 7 (IX lite in USA), but was no longer in production since the APS line of EOS bodys was cancelled last year.\nTo me it seems as if Canon has now decided to go into the mass-market of digital SLRs. Until now, no digital SLR is available below 2000$, only pseudo-SLRs like the Minolta DImage series are in that price range (and sell quite good, despite of having problems with image noise since their resolution reached 5MP). Olympus and Kodak are trying to enter the market with the 4/3 system, and it is now the proper time to place a system which is cheap enough even for full-blood amateurs to enter the range of digital imaging with a real SLR. The biggest problem until now was the fact that the use of a D60 or 10D often made it necessary to buy a new, shorter lens with good optical performance. Even the older 20-35mm non-L-lenses did not work so well with the CMOS sensor, and needing to spend additional 1000$ into an EF-L 17-40mm f/4 USM lens made it a lot more expensive to buy an EOS 10D.\nCanon is now on the right way to stand against a completely new digital SLR system like the 4/3 System of Kodak and Olympus, and even Nikon tries the same with its specialized line of digital-suited lenses.\nTo show the dilemma a user of an EOS 10D is in, you can consider the situation that would be if you were restricted to use medium format lenses on your 35mm camera: Every affordable Zoom starts with 45mm, the lens hoods allow far too much light to get into the lens and disturb your image, the flash tries to light a much too large area (Canon's EOS 10D does not take into account that the image circle of the sensor is much smaller than with 35mm and reports a 24mm lens as 24mm to the flash, where a 35mm setting of the flash would by far be enough to cover the imaged area).\nI expect that sales of the 300D will soon surpass the sales of the 10D by a factor of 10. Probably in the beginning of the next year Canon will change the 10D to a version with the EF-S mount and bring out more lenses with a range of 15-80mm (approx. 24 to 135mm on 35mm) for the EF-S mount. The telephoto range will be still completely covered by EF lenses, because a specialized EF-S lens makes only sense for normal and wide range prime and zoom lenses, since they are much cheaper in production when the lens back does not need to be as far away from the sensor as with the original EF mount, and optical quality will be better due to the fact that not the whole 44mm of the 35mm image circle has to be covered.\nGreetings, Axel\nSimon Crosland , August 22, 2003; 06:15 A.M.\nDigital Rebel does not allow user to select AF modes(One shot or AI Servo). It uses AI Focus in creative zones, meaning automatic detection and switching between the two.\nThis is the same as the analogue EOS 300 (Rebel 2000), so is in keeping with Canon's other cameras aimed at this group of users. Whilst it does remove some control from the user, I personally have never had any problems with the AI Focus.\nSimon Crosland , August 22, 2003; 06:23 A.M.\nIf that means that the camera has a metallic lens mount is not yet sure, since all available photos show the body only with a lens mounted.\nThere are photos of the product launch in Japan that show the body on its own. It has a metal lens mount. See for instance PhotographyBLOG and Rob Galbraith's comparison of the 10D and 300D.\nJoao Fonseca , August 22, 2003; 09:19 A.M.\n\"Does Canon have a full-frame consumer digital SLR in the wings?\nNo. The EOS 1Ds has a 35mm sensor but this is a camera which suits the highly specialised requirements of a very select group of professional photographers. The strategy for Canon is to design cameras to suit our customer\u0092s needs. So what does full frame really mean? With 6.3 million pixels, the EOS 300D sensor has a resolution which, in most situations, would meet the needs of many professional photographers. At the same time, this sensor size has allowed us to meet our design objective of putting high-end technology into the hands of the consumer. From a technical perspective, putting a 35mm sensor into the EOS 300D would, in most cases, give no advantage to our customers. Yet in doing so we would force the price well out of our target range.\"\nNo advantage???? What about people (like me) that already own several lenses and are not too happy with the x1.6 factor introduced by the current sensor?\nThis statement is bad news. Canon is probably thinking about starting a new line of lenses (already started with the new zoom sold with this camera) instead of putting an effort in bringing the prices down for the 35mm sensors.\nIf the 300D had a 35mm sensor (and the same price), I would move to digital immediatly. I guess I'll be waiting a few years more...\nRegards, Jo\u00e3o Fonseca\nLuigi Moccia , August 22, 2003; 10:19 A.M.\n1100 euro for a flimsy body, APS size sensor and 6Mpixel? Excellent, technical innovation is in march. I'm happy about that. In five years I'll switch to digital. Before my estimate was ten years. Why? Well, as an hobbyist my yearly expense in film and processing is around 100 - 200 euro. Print cost is another issue. So in 7 - 8 years with this kind of camera I'll start to save money. What a pity that this camera probably it's not going to last this amount of time. And starting from now I can enjoy 10 - 14 - 22 Mpixel, accordingly the film that I use. Without cropping factor. Without spending a fortune for a wideangle or a ultra-wide. Ecc ecc.. Please rich people, go into digital. Please. So I can buy fine used lens for a dime and you can support the R&D expense of the photo-industry to bring in a short time a full-frame sensor in this price range. Please buy it :-)\n, August 22, 2003; 01:15 P.M.\nAxel - Thanks for the very informative update.\nDo you have a reference for the 300D having only an AI AF mode even in the \"creative zone\"? The spec sheet lists one-shot and AI servo modes, though it doesn't explicitly say you can manually select which one is used!\nI'm still not sure why the change in backfocus. It's certainly possible to make a 14mm lens with regular backfocus distance (Canon have one) and Nikon have shown it's possible to make a 12mm lens with regular backfocus with their 12-24 lens.\nIt has to be some sort of economy measure, to keep the price in the cheap consumer zoom down below $100. I don't see Canon developing a line of these lenses and modified bodies to use them. It would make a whole lot more sense to make a 12-24 or 10-30 zoom with regular backfocus distance and just make it a good lens that could sell for, say, $300 and would be likely to be used by D30/60/10D owners. If Canon don't do it, maybe Sigma should step in and do it for them, since they could also make it compatible with the Nikon 1.5x small sensor system and grab two markets at once!\nEric Tischer , August 23, 2003; 03:06 A.M.\nhttp://www.canoneos.com/digitalrebel/download/digitalrebel_bro.pdf\nThere is the PDF of the 300D sales brochure. Specs say it has a PC socket\nI can't wait till Canon releases a 12mm - 35mm EFS, then the \"which is better, 10D or 300D\" debate will be settled! You folks praising the metal body and rear control dial of your 10D will be shopping for a new camera with an efs mount. Sounds like the 1.6x factor is here to stay.\nIm already sold on 300D incase you couldn't tell =)\nErb Duchenne , August 23, 2003; 07:03 A.M.\n\"I'm still not sure why the change in backfocus. It's certainly possible to make a 14mm lens with regular backfocus distance (Canon have one) and Nikon have shown it's possible to make a 12mm lens with regular backfocus with their 12-24 lens...\"\nYes, I think economy is the major factor here. I figure that, like a projector, the closer you move it to the screen (sensor) the smaller the image. Only in this case the smaller the image the wider, because it eliminates the cropping factor. So it's like moving a regular (cheap) 28-90 mm lens closer to the sensor, with only a slight tweak for the right focus.\nIt's possible that the sole purpose of this cheap lens which only works on the Rebel is to offer a cheap lens & body package pallatable to the mass public, where an extra $200 - $300 could make the difference between attracting them or making them wait several more months and perhaps settle on a competitor's product.\nChad Simpson , August 23, 2003; 07:35 A.M.\nDon't jump the gun yet, Eric.\nCanon has a large lead in sensor technology, as evidenced by the absence of full size sensors from other brands. Canon is presently waltzing away with the high-end SLR market, and probably a lot of medium format users too. They would be absolutely silly not to continue to exploit this advantage! But if they don't move, their technology lead will evaporate, and they stand to lose tremendous market share.\nConsider what would happen if Canon can successfully introduce a full-frame DSLR at a pro-sumer price point before anyone else... The potential exists to grab the majority of the serious amateur market, along with scads more pros and medium format users, luring customers away from other brands and turning them into EF lens consumers and repeat customers down the road. The effects of this market shift could last decades.\nIn the meantime, I figure Canon will not want to introduce a bunch of EF-S mount lenses, only to turn around a year or two later and offer affordable full-frame sensor bodies which can't take them. There's a reason the 18-55 only comes bundled with the 300D, and it isn't that the 300D is the only camera it fits. My personal prediction is that the EF-S mount and 1.6x sensors have a future only in the inexpensive consumer SLRs (maybe a short-lived future), while full-frame is phased in to the advanced amateur and pro series which will retain the EF mount. The price of the 1Ds illustrates that the technology barrier is formidable but not insurmountable, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I sit here drooling in anticipation, wallet in hand, just waiting for a 1.0x sensor SLR to arrive at a palatable price!\nLes Ang , August 23, 2003; 10:53 A.M.\nThe EOS 300D does have a metal lens mount. =)\nLes\nSteven Clark , August 23, 2003; 09:14 P.M.\nPersonally I think the EF-S mount is a very good idea, at least as it is used here. As said before the teleconverterish effect of the cropped sensor makes it harder to get the wide angles but that could be fixed. The easiest way of course would have been to build lenses with reduced image circles but the same mount. The resulting lenses however could be mounted to full frame cameras and either produce really bad images: \"Canon sucks! My 8-24mm f4 EF-D produces horrible vigneting on my Elan 7e?\" or make the firmware intentionally incompatible: \"When I mount my 8-24mm EF-D on my Elan7e it locks up with error code XX\". The EF-S mount solves this problem simply by making the crop-factor utterly mechanicly incompatible with full-frame cameras. Also in the process it frees up the potential to use some optical formulas that couldn't otherwise be used on an SLR due to protruding elements, personally I would like to see a 42 f1.7 EF-S for say $70. Of course there are then those who complain about glass investment and compatibility with the rest of the system. If pro EF-S lenses were to be produced this would be a serious problem as you might have a $1k or more lens tied to a single body. I agree, if Canon were to produce lenses like that it would be a very bad idea. On the other hand if Canon keeps entirely to consumer-priced lenses in this category (which seems likelier than not given the evidence of the moment) that simply won't be a very big issue. I'm almost certain most users of the 300d wouldn't have more money in EF-S glass tham the camera cost them, even if they stayed within the bounds of this mount.\nBob Atkins\n, August 24, 2003; 01:45 A.M.\nMy guess is that Canon won't make any more EF-S lenses. There's simply no need to. The EF55-200 they have announced for the 300D is in a standard EF mount and will fit any EOS body. I would imagine that will be the case for all other low end consumer lenses too. Since they now have 18-55 covered they don't need short backfocus for any other lens. The old 22-55 low end consumer zoom sold with APS bodies worked just fine on all EOS bodies and was $100. I presume the only reason that wasn't an 18-55 and this one is is that without the short backfocus they couldn't make it really cheap. They can clearly make really cheap lenses from 22mm on up with standard backfocus and mount, so I assume that's what they'll do since the same lenses can then be sold to Rebel film body owners.\nChachi Arcola , August 25, 2003; 07:51 P.M.\nThis is too tempting. I was planning to wait until Canon had a sub-$1500 1.3x body out there before making the jump, but I never anticipated that I'd be able to get 6.3MP for $900 just six months after the 10D. Of course, it really makes me wonder what else Canon has up their sleeves.\nI'm seriously questioning buying another film body at this point in the game. As it is, my EOS 5, which is a fantastic camera, is probably a steal on the secondary market at about $250 or so.\nChachi Arcola , August 26, 2003; 12:08 P.M.\nVery interesting comments, Axel. <p> Another point in favor of the 300D, and in favor of saving the $600 vs. the 10D, is that with $900 invested, there is much less downside potential than with a 10D. Important given that I would probably turn around and sell the 300D in no more than two years, probably for about $300-$400, is my guess. Just ask anyone who bought a D30 for $3000 a few years back how important re-sale value is.\njerome davin , August 27, 2003; 06:02 P.M.\nWhat is the largest print size you can achieve on photographic paper with the 300D?\nAxel Farr , August 28, 2003; 10:53 A.M.\nTo reply on some questions which occured on my posting:\nThe main reason for Canon to introduce the EF-S mount was certainly the price. You have to imagin the following: Canons consumer lenses are (as the lenses in the same segment of Nikon or Pentax or whomever) not of a quality you expect from an \"L\" class lens. E.g. the EF 28-90mm 1/3.5-5.6 lens is probably capable of resolving some 6Megapixels on 35mm negs, but not more - on the APS-C sensor size this would mean, that it is good enough for 4 MPixels (the quality in the center of a lens is usually better than on the rim). A lens in the non-L-section which is good enough is probably only the EF 28-135mm IS USM lens, but that costs around 700\u0080 here in Germany, the EF 28-90mm costs around 200\u0080 if bought separately and some 120\u0080 together with an EOS 300 or 30.\nThe only real EF lens which is half-way useable and in the appropriate price range was the EF 22-55mm, originally designed for the APS body EOS IX 7 (or IX lite as it was called in the US). This lens is really used by some owners of an EOS D30 or D60, because it is more affordable than an EF 17-35 L lens and offers a wider zoom range than an EF 20-35mm lens. But the 22mm at the short end are some 35mm with a 1.6x format factor, so this lens is more like an 35-80mm lens. And in front of a 6 MPixel sensor it would probably resolve only around 2 to 3 MPixels if not stopped down to at least f/8 or f/11. So Canon had to create a cheap lens, which has at least the resolving power of an EF 28-135mm lens, but does neither need to cover the entire 35mm image circle nor should it fit to existing 35mm bodies (and perhaps not to higher class bodies like the EOS 10D in order not to reduce the market for an EF 17-40mm lens).\nTo avoid professional photographers from buying the EOS 300D, some limitations have been introduced to the body, the same which made me buy an EOS 30 instead of an EOS 300 as my favorite body: You can neither set AF mode nor exposure measurement yourself, the cameras sets it for you. And to make it cheaper, the body is made of plastic instead of metal. To make it even more cheaper, the same imaging components are used as with the 10D.\nBut for those who do not want to wait for Canon to bring out an EOS 30D with an EF-S mount and a lens with a (35mm equiv.) zoom range of 28-105mm and ring-USM, the 300D will probably be the body to buy. I myself are thinking about replacing my EOS IX with the 300D, since the IX itself lacks some things the 300D has. My EOS 30 will not be replaced by any digital body, since I still want to have a camera to photograph on slide film.\nWhat the future of the EF-S mount will be depends a little bit on what is happening now: If the number of sold EOS 10D drops significantly after introduction of the 300D, then Canon will very soon replace the EOS 10D by a Camera with the same capabilities, but with an EF-S mount. If Canon is of the opinion, that prosumers and pros who want a better body than an EOS 300D have to spend some more money into their lenses, they will continue the EOS 10D until it really hurts them too much.\nI suppose the EOS 10D will be replaced in spring 2004. And to those who do not want to carry around a set of EF-S lenses (for the digital body) and a set of EF lenses (for the analog body): Be shure, there will allways be lenses like the EF 17-40mm which fit to both systems, but also be shure that 6 MPixels will not be the last word on an 0.65x sized sensor. And 10 MPixels on such a sensor are difficult to use if you do not have specialized lenses for them. So one direction Canon may enter might be to enhance the resolution for the next series of prosumer-D-SLRs to around 8 or 10 MPixels and to introduce the EF-S mount on them together with lenses of better resolution (like an EF-S 17-85mm 1/3.5-5.6 IS USM or an EF-S 17-45mm 1/2.8 (L?) USM). With digital, once you optimize the lenses you need not neccessarily have full-frame to resolve 10MPixels.\nGreetings, Axel\nbrian jackson , August 28, 2003; 01:05 P.M.\n\"\"Does Canon have a full-frame consumer digital SLR in the wings?\nNo. The EOS 1Ds has a 35mm sensor but this is a camera which suits the highly specialised requirements of a very select group of professional photographers.

Right before Canon announced the 1Ds ('studio'), they were touting the 1D as the \"best field camera\". This is why I'm thinking the next camera will be the 1Df. Semantics, I understand, but at least logical semantics :)\nHoping for 8fps, 8MP, full frame-sensor, same body, orientation sensor (that actually stores the image correctly and not just display the thumbnail in the right direction!) and produce an in-camera JPEG around 3-4megs.\nDon't know if I'll wait and get the new camera or pick up an extra 1D as the prices start to fall. $2200 would be a great price. ;-)>\nFor those of you who are saying you should have waited for the 300D and NOT bought your 10D, what camera were you using before? If you were shooting a Rebel, then you upgraded to a digital Elan. If you were shooting an Elan...you just got rid of your film/development costs. If you were shooting any of the EOS-1 models or EOS-3, then you downgraded.\nJamie, hit it on the head with the digital body -> film body comparison. The 300D(digital rebel) IS NOT going to be the same thing as a 10D, they aren't built the same nor are they targeted at the same customers. Ok, maybe but not really, that's why the 2 different cameras exist: different markets. I would NEVER consider buying a 300D, but might consider a 10D as a backup camera to the 1D, the 300D just wouldn't hold up to the rigors of a location shoot. Whereas I have friends who have film Rebels right now and I've told them to wait for this camera to hit the market. It'll do exactly what they want it to do.\nI think Canon is right on, with 4 different levels of digital cameras. people who need a slow camera to produce huge images, fast rugged camera to produce large images, semi-pro/advanced am/pro backup camera, and the basic SLR.\nfeelin good , August 28, 2003; 05:09 P.M.\nA few considerations from my side: A) Everibody is impressed by the price set by Canon, but the Fuji digital reflex is already available in the US at 999$. B) Between the 899$ of the 300D and the 8000$ (even worse when you consider the european prices), there is a price factor of 9, while in terms of features and funtionality (6.5 mio pixels vs 12; APS like sensor vs Full Frame; 2,5 fps vs 6; plastic vs aluminium) the D1s is surely more performing but far from being 9 times better. Consider Toyota vs Lexus!! C) Taking in consideration what stated before, stay away for a while from the D1s, they will either discount it heavily or introduce soon a performing mode (so to say a EOS 3 alike) D) The law of Moore and the industrial rump up will soon adsorb the price differential between the small abd the full frame sensor. Why Canon embarked in the development of a new optical line? will they repeat the flop of the IXUS SLR? What's the quality of these B class gimmicks?\nFor sure the step made by Canon is the prelude to their decision in stopping soon the production of film camera (tragic moment). For sure they targetted by the 300D the requirents of a market segment, but definitively not evolved users or prosumers. The segment must be smaller than foreseen and they will probably cannibalize some of their own G5 prospects.\nSo far i cannot see a real term of competitiveness allowing Canon to repeat the success of the AE line of the 80's, as underlined by their management last week in London.\nHope to read your opinons.\nCiao\nBob Atkins\n, August 30, 2003; 02:54 A.M.\nThe Fuji S2 retails at $1999 from the major reputable photo stores. You can probably find it for a couple of hundred dollars less, but still more than the 10D.\nI don't think Canon have started a new optical line. I see the 18-55 as a \"one off\" lens simply to have something cheap to sell with the 300D as a kit. I'd be quite surprised to see any more EF-S lenses or EF-S bodies.\nCanon are quite clearly leading the DSLR market. Whether that will change with new offerings from Olympus, Pentax, Nikon and others remains to be seen. My guess is that it won't. I see Canon taking the lion's share of the DSLR market, just as they did with the film market in the 1990s. Nikon will still have a strong presence but the others will be \"also rans\", just like with film. Possibly good or even great camera, but not getting the market share that Canon and Nikon do.\nChristoph Marquardt , August 31, 2003; 03:12 P.M.\nWhatever the pros out there might say.. I'm very happy for this camera to be out soon. Why? Well, I guess I'm exactly the kind of target customer that Canon has been aiming for with the 300D. I'm an ambitioned amateur. I've been doing SLR photography since I was 14. I'm a technical enthusiast. When digital became available I was desperately looking for some kind of digital film / digital back for my film SLR, but all the things that were announced either didn't make it to the marked or turned out to not really be what I expected.\nOne day I bought a cheapo 2.3MP point-and-click camera (well, not too cheapo, but my first step towards digital) .. just for those occasions where you wanna take snapshots.. and even though picture quality, techology was still way below my standards, I was instantly hooked to digital photography. Reason? The simplicity of handling. No film, no development, no having to think about the cost of shooting pics, not having to wait for pics to be developed..\nBeing an audio pro, I'd like to compare this with the development that we've seen in my area of expertise in the 80s. When the CD hit the market in the early/mid 80s, it wasn't perfect, but from my point of view, it had one major advantage over analog: Easy handling.\nFrom an audio point of view, I've looked back to analog quite some times, comparing developments, seeing what had changed.. 'cos when doing the step from analog to digital, you obviously give up a bit of dynamics and resultion at first (in both, audio and photography) and some things need to be looked at from other angles. Recent developments in the audio field managed to make up for a lot of this, and you can now for example put a perceived 19-bit of dynamics on a 16-bit medium (the CD) .. and finally new media have arrived with 24bit/96kHz audio, dynamics and resolution that go far beyond human perception.\nOne thing that I'm more than sure about is that similar developments are bound to follow in photography sooner or later.\nIn the audio field, after overcoming the first obstactles, and after having learned to use the new digital medium in a way that makes sense, I have *never* looked back again, and I have *never* regretted to have taken the step from analog to digital.\nBut back to photography.. to make a long story short, the 300D is spot on for me. It's what I've been waiting for since I first had that 2.3MP digital cam in my hands 3 or 4 years ago.. I've been watching the press, I've been reading announcements, but I've never been able or willing to shed out $2-3k for a DSLR that would staisfy my amateur standards.\nFrom all I've heard and seen so far, I'm positive that the 300D will.\nQuality wise and price wise.\nJust my not-so-pro $.02 ;)\nChristoph from Germany\nSteve Rosenblum , August 31, 2003; 04:38 P.M.\nI am hoping that the 300D will make a good street shooter. I plan to mount a 24/2.8 lens on it (which will give me a 38mm equiv.) and use it for candid photography. The 10D is too big and heavy for this use and other digicams have too long of an autofocus/shutter delay to capture the \"decisive moment\". I think this combination will be small, inobtrusive, and fast enough to finally fill the bill. If it does you are going to see a lot of my rangefinder gear on sale.\nian davies , September 04, 2003; 02:18 P.M.\nSo, as a European reluctant to spend over the odds, (ie: \u00a31000 as opposed to 1000$), is there any reason for me not to get as US version of this camera, as opposed to the European version?\nOr am I getting something extra for my extra ~$450?\nSimon Crosland , September 05, 2003; 10:42 A.M.\n>Or am I getting something extra for my extra ~$450?\nFirst have you checked out the shipping and customs tax that you will pay by importing a US camera? For instance, UK customs will impose 17.5% tax on import.\nAssuming that you have taken that into account, the one thing that you will not have from a US camera is a warranty that is valid in Europe - historically Canon have not honoured US warranties outside the US.\nFinally, have you checked out local prices?

The internal design of the film and digital cameras are very different - they have been developed from the ground up (unlike the D30 which they used the base of film eos to start on)\"\nCheck digital back for Leica R8/R9. I would LOVE to have simillar thing for my EOS3...\nR Cook , October 08, 2003; 03:18 A.M.\nPrices are already coming down .... Just bought the 300D from online dist. , in Brooklyn, NY for 639 USD. That was with the lens, also.\nMarcelo Dapino , April 16, 2004; 03:08 P.M.\nI'll break the ice. I have owned a Digital Rebel since January as a complement to my EOS film bodies (EOS 1n and 3). The quality is excellent so the camera is highly recommended. My main gripe however is that the camera is slow. Everything with this camera is deliberate as it takes several button presses to get settings changed, most notably the selection of AF points which involves pressing a little button and spinning the front dial; the seven points then appear sequentially. On the EOS 1n, I just spin the dial in the back and voila, no button-pressing is involved. The AF speed on the Rebel is adequate, and so is the burst speed. However, the buffer is small if you shoot in RAW mode (which I do). It's quite frustrating that the buffer always seems to fill up in the exact moment when the light or person's expression is just right. All in all however this is a very nice little camera, and a lot of fun to shoot with.\nBas Scheffers , April 16, 2004; 05:18 P.M.\nGood to see a review by someone who actualy knows and practices photography and focusses on how you can get the job done with the DRebel rather than keep hammering on how \"Canon has cripled it to sell more 10Ds\" or the build quality.\nTo comment to the above comment about speed, I have found it to be incredibly important to get fast cards. This will make the camera work much faster. With my 45X Transcend I rarely run into frame rate problems. Granted, it is not film, but it is a lot better than friends' and family's DRebels I have handled with slower cards. You run out of frames very quickly if you re-use your no-brand 3 year old 256MB card!\nMarcelo Dapino , April 16, 2004; 10:02 P.M.\nTo comment on the comment which refers to my original comment (phew!), I use the DR with a new 1GB Lexar 42X card, so card quality is not the problem. Incidentally, my card has Lexar's WA technology, which if I recall correctly is not fully exploited on the DR. Can someone confirm this? I researched this topic a while back and haven't looked at this since.\nBob Atkins\n, April 17, 2004; 12:13 A.M.\nNeither the 10D nor the 300D (Digital Rebel) support WA (write acceleration). In fact I don't think any Canon DSLR supports WA at the moment.\nErb Duchenne , April 19, 2004; 03:31 P.M.\nThe Digital Rebel has been out for over 6 months, but the reviews are just coming in now? What gives?\nAnyway... good read. I've owned a 300D since September last year (2003). It's the bestest best best Rebel yet... and 'no fair!' to those who still keep comparing it to the EOS 1's and EOS 30's. I have a film Rebel too... and compared to that the Digital Rebel stands reaaaaal tall.\nLaura E. Napolitano , April 20, 2004; 05:25 P.M.\nI love it so much...since it's digital I can work with its flaws. I wish there was a b+w mode though, because even a film SLR can offer that! :)\nI also don't like the strap -- it cuts into my little soft neck and the \"Digital EOS\" in large lettering gives me filthy looks and envious stares...not good for a high petty-crime area like NYC. :(\n, April 20, 2004; 05:44 P.M.\nWhat gives?\nWaht gives is I just got my hands on one. I'd be very happy indeed to review any EOS camera on the day it is released. Just buy one and send it to me. Getting review samples out of Canon on any popular new high end item is like pulling teeth. Not easy and not fun. Photo.net is not yet high on their reviewer list for high demand stuff. Photo magazines, pro spokespersons, high profile photographers and dedicated \"gearhead\" sites all come before photo.net.\nBas Scheffers , April 21, 2004; 03:30 A.M.\nLaura, a black and white mode would be the same as using Photoshop to convert to black and white. The only difference being that with PS you can leave your filters at home and use the channel mixer with much higher precision instead!\nStanley Rogouski\n, April 21, 2004; 01:42 P.M.\n\"The Digital Rebel has been out for over 6 months, but the reviews are just coming in now? What gives?\"\nThere were reviews of the Rebel on Photo.net back in September and a very extensive one on dpreview.com at about the same time.\nThe Rebel got reviewed pretty quickly but interestingly enough the big digital photography sites seem to have dropped the ball on the D70 and Mark II. But, then again, how much do reviews really matter? Canon and Nikon pretty much set the standards are where are you going to go if you own Canon or Nikon lenses and their latest offering sucks. What's more, you have to get on a waiting list anyway, so by the time you get to buy a D70 or Mark II you'll know all about it from the web.\nThe reviews seem a bit more useful for high end point and shoots since you may want a compact 8 megapixel even if you own Canon or Nikon lenses and in this case you can pretty much buy any one you want.\nStanley Rogouski\n, April 21, 2004; 01:49 P.M.\n\"Laura, a black and white mode would be the same as using Photoshop to convert to black and white. The only difference being that with PS you can leave your filters at home and use the channel mixer with much higher precision instead!\"\nI've had pretty good luck with Photoshop and black and white. The Rebel's big sensor gives you room to sharpen and add contrast in a way that a fixed lens digicam wouldn't. This is at ISO 400. It prints with almost no degregdation at 8 x 10 and strikes me as being capable of going up to 16 x 20.\nLaura E. Napolitano , April 23, 2004; 07:05 P.M.\nGorgeous shot, Stanley...my comment didn't make sense when I looked back at it now. :) I have had better luck with converting in black and white. Thing is, I like the grayscale mode because it lets me test the potential for a shot...sometimes, something in color won't look so great, but to see a shot in b+w can take a new spin on things...do you know what I'm saying? Like in a sense, the visualization of the potential grayscale image in my mind is much different from the reality of actually photographing a grayscale image.\nStanley Rogouski\n, April 24, 2004; 04:24 P.M.\nA lot of my black and white shots turn into black and white shots because I can't get the white balance right or because of sensor blooming.\nSensor blooming is the one area where I think a film camera beats a Rebel/10D/D70 class camera. However fast your lens is sensor blooming can kill many a good night shot.\nI'm not quite sure if the Rebel/10D can really be used for serious landscape work. I'm sure there are people who use both but I'm wondering if a used Mamiya 645 and a 1500 dollar film scanner would beat the 10/Rebel and EOS lenses for more or less the same price.\nAs far as candid available light photographs go however the Rebel's almost perfect.\nAmir Mohebi , April 26, 2004; 05:31 A.M.\nAlso consider that when you have a small card and on event/location photography, BW mode gives you opportunity to shoot more, because lack of RGB data in Jpegs can make your files a lot smaller. It would make you cure when your remaining shot indicator shows say 9 shots and you want more, and when you change to BW mode, you'll have some nice extra shots available. this problem seems to be of minor issue with todays large capacity cards.\nPaul Heaton , June 15, 2004; 03:13 P.M.\nI do not understand all the hub-bub about canon creating a new series of lenses or \"so much for compatibility\". I purchased the EOS 300D with just the 18-55 lens included in the kit. I already owned a 35mm EOS 630 film camera but had not used it since purchasing my first digital (Olympus 490Z). But I sorely missed the features on my EOS. When I received my new 300D, I popped on my old 35-135 zoom lens, and it worked flawlessly, taking just as good digitals as the EOS 630 did with film, maybe even better. I don't see a problem with the 1.6 conversion, the 18-55 would translate to approximately 28-88 which is a pretty good wide angle to normal shot mode. My 35-135 translates to 56 - 216 which is a pretty good all around zoom range. I keep it on the camera for normal shots, and switch to the 18-55 for group shots or when I am in tight quarters and need the wider angle. I think Canon has kept compatability with their older lenses just fine. This is a great digital.\nBen Plewes , July 08, 2004; 09:12 A.M.\nI'm sure the images produced by this camera are good but god is it ugly! I held one in my local camera shop yesterday. There is no way I could justify spending ?700 on something that feels like a ?130 35mm slr designed for someone who's just starting out. The ergonomics are just awful. It's one big ugly lump of grey plastic! I'd say spend the extra and don't consider anything less than a D70. If you can't afford it stick to film until prices come down further!\nBlake Singleton , July 27, 2004; 08:01 P.M.\nTo comment on the above statement:\nSounds to me like someone was LOOKING for bad things to say about this camera.\nNow, on with the rating:\nI've owned the DRebel for about a month now, and have had no problems with it at all. I am a little agitated that it comes with no B&W mode. Even the $90 1.5MP cameras sold at Wal-Mart have B&W modes. Despite this minor flaw, I have no complaints. My pictures have come out perfect, for the most part. The only problem I've had that I can complain about is I set the processing colors wrong and all of my first weeks worth of pictures came out muted. I've since fixed that, and now I'm on my happy little way.\nTerry Manning , July 28, 2004; 04:36 P.M.\nI am a little distressed that a lack of B/W mode is considered a shortcoming by some respondents when most SERIOUS photographers appreciate being able to convert from color mode themselves, instead of letting the camera do it for them. Just because this camera has a point-and-shoot mode does not mean it is a point-and-shoot camera. I'm certain Canon and the makers of any other digital SLR consider their prospective buyers in deciding the features they make available. If B/W was such an important feature, they'd have included it. As it is, the Digital Rebel is a fine camera. With good glass, it's a great camera.\nOleg Volk , July 29, 2004; 05:25 P.M.\n10D image edited in channel mixer\nI think that capturing in B&W would be a waste of data...but having a B&W LCD mode, perhaps with a few \"filters\" selectable might help some people.\nSteve Foster , August 02, 2004; 11:29 P.M.\n\"If you can't afford it stick to film until prices come down further\"\nThat is a bit unfair and a bit elitist wouldn't you say? My friend bought one a month or so ago and I've had time to play with it. In my opinion it is an excellent value, probably the best out there for a dig slr.\nCompared to, say, a hassy with a digital back your D70 is a piece of junk. Would it be unfair to say that if you can't afford the Hassy then don't waste your money on the D70? Come on now. What kind of glass would be acceptable or should I wait til I can afford fine German glass? Considering the street price of that camera I'm suprised at the features that are in it. Is it perfect? Name one that is. Bottom line, I don't see anything else out there that compares dollar to valuewise.\nThe battery burn is an issue. Leaving the camera on in order to not miss any shots due to bootup time will exhaust the battery in 50 shots or so, with flash. Shooting in manual is a pain til you have your fingers trained. However, skin tones were excellent, color management very good. Resolution is great. Digital has a lot of things going for it in general and can be an excellent learning tool.\nIn the real world, even the cost of the 300 is above many people's means. If all a person can afford is a Holga and a roll of film a week and that gives them enjoyment....what more matters? Can you say you'll get better shots with your D70 than a kid with a Holga? Plastic body? Don't drop it. Ugly? I get around that by not looking in the mirror or at my driver's license.\nGet real. The real bottom line? It ain't the camera that makes the difference.\nWayne West , October 15, 2004; 02:56 A.M.\nI was recently given this camera, and I love it! I also have a 630 and Elan II. I did encounter one weird problem with the Digital. Some of my lenses will not work with it on an inconsistent basis. In all cases these lenses are Sigmas and are probably 10+ years old, which thoroughly predates this generation of digital technology, so I imagine that the camera requests/commands certain things of the lenses that the lens just can't deliver and the camera freaks out. It displays an error message which requires you to turn the camera off and back on to clear.\nI don't know what conditions cause the lens/body to freak out as I haven't yet done a rigerously-parameterized shoot to see what the limits are, just haven't had the interest.\nInterestingly, my other two Canon lenses are equally old and work just fine. That's some great backwards compatibility that Canon has engineered into this baby!\nMy preference would be for a 10D or better, but hey, this does the job and produces fine results.\nr tete , October 20, 2004; 08:30 A.M.\nI've read most of the reviews here, and agree/disagree with loads of people. But there is one thing missing here - no one mentions the-now very common- error 99, that this camera is presenting. Has anyone got any info on it? any experiences you'd like to share? thanks! roger toledo\nGreg Chappell , October 25, 2004; 12:34 A.M.\nThe reason why no comment is made about \"err 99\" should be pretty obvious. While it has happened, it is far from common, relevent to the total number of Digital Rebels/300D's sold world-wide. If every buyer were asked, we would see there are way more users who have experienced no problems whatsoever with their cameras. The ones who do have problems are the ones who we hear from online, not the satisfied ones, of which I am after 10 months and several thousands of images.\nThe total number of bodies sold now has to be in the hundred thousands, probably several hundred thousand. How many people who have cameras working perfectly chime in online about how their cameras work perfectly?? Not too many. Being optimistic, if you could find several hundreds of people complaining about this error message, it would be the preverbial needle in the haystake of total bodies sold.\nMichael Mermagen , October 25, 2004; 05:37 P.M.\nAbout the Error 99 message for many first users: When you receive your Digital Rebel, you are so exited to start taking pictures, so you stick a CF card inside and go out to shoot pictures and you get an error message. It's not until you read the manual and find out that the CF card needs to be formatted by the camera (a simple and brief procedure) in order to function properly. Then, all is well.\nMike\nBoris Kovacic , December 27, 2004; 10:11 A.M.\nMaybe this isn?t a right place but i don?t see any alternative for now. Canon is a great company and their EOS 300D is a nice camera. But is there any chance that you review any of Pentax equipment? Like *istDS, new digital from Pentax that is direct rival to Canon? Or am I only Pentax user on photo.net.\nKashyap Bhatt , February 07, 2007; 07:43 A.M.\nCanon EF 18-55 is available (sold separately) in India at least (as on Feb'07).

Now,I am looking for a used or imperfect body for the lens,for I know it will break again,since I want to be in the mountains again :) Is there any way to find one?

Anyone know about this?\nMichael Oneka , May 19, 2007; 03:13 A.M.\nI have read the comments on the Canon Eos300d error 99. I have owned and very intensively used this camera for close to three years. In the last couple of weeks I have been getting the error 99 message quite frequently. I have checked many websites and found that it seems to be a more widespread problem than may appear at first. Based on the different advise I could find from some of these websites, I have tried changing the lenses, the memory cards, and also cleaned the contact points of the lenses. After each of these attempts the camera works again but I later get the same error. I will definitely have to send the camera for servicing. My point is that this is not an isolated problem. If you still do not have it, chances are that you will get it (hopefully not at a critical moment)!\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

In the case of the Dachau Concentration Camp , this won't result in comforting attractive images.\nBelow is a parking garage in Kyoto . The colors and industrial appearance of the structure are remarkable in the middle of a city known for its ancient temples and gardens. The purpose of the image is to capture the feeling of walking by the structure, not to delight or decorate.\nA supermarket exterior is a subject that will probably never make a wall-worthy image by itself. However, the image below (from the Hawaii flowers collection ) captures the spirit of being in the parking lot at night:\nGive Old Buildings Some Space\nIn general, the older the structure, the more environmental context is required.\nUsing your hands or your mind, crop the preceding images to include just the structures and see if they would still work. Also, compare them to a few modern buildings where hardly any context is required:\n(The Big Boy pictures are also a good example of coming back repeatedly to a building in order to capture it in different lights and weather.)\nFarms are a good example of where the structures don't make any sense removed from their context:\nEven a Bit of Space Helps\nIf you're not capturing an entire village or farm, it still makes sense to think about the space around your subject. Even a little bit of context helps anchor the image. For example, the image at right, from the sunset district of San Francisco , presents a straightforward view of a house. We could use it as a real estate advertisement. The fragment of the house to the left, however, isn't wasted space. It tells us how tightly packed the neighborhood is.\nIn the image below, the sidewalk, the fragment of street, the pedestrian, and the little open market to the left of the shop help establish the Guatemalan context:\nStep Back and Use a Telephoto Lens\nBack up from an work of architecture and use a telephoto lens to compress the perspective. This often brings out an interesting pattern.\nThe images below, from Provincetown, Cape Cod , show the increased abstraction of a telephoto perspective. The picture on the right was taken with a much longer lens than the one on the left.\nInclude the Fence\nA fence can be an important image element. In the left-hand photo below (from Gotland, Sweden ), the fence works with the trees to frame the barn. It helps that the fence is not brightly lit and is a bit out of focus. The viewer's eye will therefore naturally be drawn to the main subject of the photo, i.e., the barn. In the right-hand photo, from Cape Cod , the fence immediately clues a viewer into the exclusive nature of the beach club.\nStraight on Till Morning\nSometimes a direct approach is all that you need:\nWatch the Shadows\nBefore color, Hollywood directors and cinematographers worked carefully to cast interesting shadows into scenes. Here are some examples of images where shadows set the mood.\nWatch the Weather\nTravels with Samantha\n:\nThe sunlight adds punch to the fire hydrant and makes urban life seem more appealing. However, if you were trying to show people details in the buildings, a high overcast day would have been much better. For example, here is an image from Visby, Sweden :\nThe Drama of the Staircase\nIt would seem that staircases are inherently dramatic.\nLead the Eye by Leading the Person\nIf your composition includes a visible footpath into the scene, it should naturally draw the viewer.\nNatural Frames\nIt is a contrived and hackneyed idea, but it does work to use natural frames. If you're working without a tripod, you probably won't be able to stop down the aperture enough to get everything into focus. But it is okay to have a soft frame and a sharp subject.\nPrivate Courtyards\nPublic Squares\nThe left-hand image, from Rome , has a classical composition leading the eye into the center of the frame. But the overview image to its right conveys a truer feeling for the Spanish Steps.\nMichelangelo designed the Campidoglio (left) to be viewed from above. The photo at right is from Burano .\nHere is a Soviet-built memorial to the Second World War in Berlin :\nPeople\nInclude people in an architecture photo if they give unexpected information about how a building is being used.\nDon't Forget the Sculpture\nSwimming Pools\nOccasionally, a swimming pool is a work of art by itself, as in the image at left (Hearst Castle, from the photo.net California guide ). But most of the time, a pool is best used as an abstract element in a composition from above, as at right ( Israel ).\nFountains\nNarrow Streets\nThe narrow streets of Europe are always interesting to American eyes. We're accustomed to structures built on an inhuman scale (cf. the Mall in Washington, D.C.). To get a better-than-average picture of a narrow European street, start by looking for an arch:\nBoth of the above images could have been better. In the left-hand image, the subject (woman on moped) could be more interesting and more engaged either with the camera or another subject. In the right-hand image, some of the black shadow should be cropped out.\nIf you can't find an arch, try filling the foreground with an interesting subject of some sort, e.g., this old Citroen:\nAnother effective technique is to use a long lens to compress the perspective:\n\"Streets flooded. Please advise.\"\n-- Robert Benchley (telegram to his editor upon arrival in Venice )\nBridges\nThe three pictures below show increasingly less literal views of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco . My favorite is the one on the right. It isn't a very good view of the bridge--one can hardly see that there are two towers--but it shows tourists gawking at the bridge's construction and an avid cyclist using the bridge.\nFor the next bridge, the story behind it is more important than the structure. This is the Dike Bridge on Chappaquiddick, a subisland of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts (almost part of Cape Cod ). In 1969, Ted Kennedy drove off the side of this bridge into the water. He abandoned his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, to her death by drowning. Kennedy did not report the incident to the police until the following morning and was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident. The bridge fell into disrepair and was subsequently rebuilt to absurdly heavy duty standards. The photographs below therefore concentrate on the super-strong guard rails and the heavy metal gate that is used to close the bridge every night.\nThe next example is that most tired of photographic subjects: the covered bridge. For starters, here is the Chamber of Commerce view:\nOne approach is to get inside the bridge:\nAnother is to wait for darkness or gloomy weather:\nHere are a couple of early morning Brooklyn Bridge photographs. This is one of the best bridges because of the unusual cabling pattern and also the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline.\nSan Francisco's Bay Bridge is a poor stepchild to the Golden Gate in terms of photographic coverage. However, if you get off in the middle of the bridge, at Treasure Island, and are willing to do a little bit of creative parking, you can get a good picture of the bridge as it is used:\nBelow we return at different times of day and from different vantage points to capture the multiple moods of the Ponte Vecchio, in Florence :\nThe stone bridges of Europe are spectacular:\nBridges, this time from a Helicopter\nA two-seat helicopter can be rented from any flight school for about $250/hour. (See my helicopter training page if you want to add one more challenge to your life, but it is best not to try to fly the helicopter and take the pictures at the same time.)\nDoors and Windows\nDetails\nA good architect is a fanatic for detail and some of the most beautiful parts of a structure are best captured in isolation.\nNight\nA lot of buildings become more interesting at night:\nWith digital cameras, the main problem is noise from the sensor, which is best controlled by using a tripod and keeping the ISO set to 400 or less. In general, physically larger sensors will produce less noise than smaller sensors, which is why digital SLRs perform so much better in low light than point and shoot digicams.\nModern 35mm single-lens reflex cameras have such good metering systems that the suggested exposure for a picture like the ones above is almost always within 1 f-stop of the best exposure. With slide film, it is probably best to take 5 bracketed exposures at 1/2 f-stop intervals. With color negative film, take four pictures: one at 1 f-stop less exposure than recommended, one at the camera's recommended exposure, one 1 f-stop over, and one 2 f-stops over.\nIndustrial\nThe world of industrial architectural is the world of the large but simultaneously extremely detailed. You will want the highest resolution digital camera that you can rent, with the largest physical sensor (see the digital camera chapter of\n"}, {"score": 204.01799, "uuid": "4f4371f9-c605-5d69-bf32-0a42831ffd92", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1414wb-35-22742", "target_hostname": "chrismarquardt.com", "target_uri": "http://chrismarquardt.com/blog.php?categories=photography", "page_rank": 3.9363215e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Blog || Chris Marquardt - Photography, Photo Workshops, Videography", "snippet": "<em>I</em> love good skin tones in <em>portraits</em> and in general when I&#x27;m in photo geek mode (and when I&#x27;m not having an artsy phase), <em>I</em> kinda sorta like the colors of things to be faithfully reproduced in my <em>photographs</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Fri, Nov 18 2011 07:05 | productivity , photography , food for thought , Photoshop , lightroom , industry , infrastructure , illustration , color management\nThe Hoopla\nWith Creative Suite 5.5 Adobe is introducing a new subscription pricing model. For many professionals this is a welcome way to spread out the cost for the software over a year instead of having to do the big upfront payment for the software.\nCustomers can still buy individual products or product suites, but you will now also be able opt for a monthly plan. I will mainly look at what this means for photographers and Photoshop. But just as an example, instead of buying the Design Premium Suite for a retail price of $1899, if you commit for a yearly plan, you'll apparently get it for a \"rental fee\" of $95 per month or $1140 per year. Mind you, this is not a payment plan, so you won't own the software at the end of the year. Adobe is offering upgrade pricing for those who paid for a year though.\nAs mentioned, you can still buy the products, but as I understand it, as opposed to being able to upgrade from older versions (I believe you could skip up to two versions), with the new pricing model you can't skip versions anymore to get upgrade pricing.\nAnd this seems to be the biggest rub for a lot of people. Enough of a rub that Adobe went ahead and closed (and apparently even removed) the comments on the blog entry where they announced the change.\nInternational\nInternational pricing of Adobe products has always been one of my pet peeves. In Germany and other European countries, prices for Adobe products are dramatically higher than the US prices, in some cases we Europeans get to pay more than a 100% premium for the same software.\nBack in 2007 when I interviewed Adobe product manager John Nack I brought it up, but mainly got an evasive answer.\nThis might also explain why a lot of people on this side of the pond appear to use pirated versions of Adobe's products.\nSkipping A Beat\nOver the years a lot of photographers have become Photoshop users. Photoshop isn't the most intuitive product - I usually compare it to a huge toolbox full of tools but without a good instruction manual - but it is very powerful and many photographers have taken the effort to learn its intricacies, to adjust their workflow and to master it to a certain degree.\nAs I said, I'll mainly look at photographers in this article, but this might also be true for small agencies.\nWhile Lightroom has pretty much taken over when it comes to 98% of my pictures, many photographers have spent years and year refining their Photoshop workflows, they have learned tricks and spent time learning from tutorials. The investment not only on the financial side is huge.\nBut for monetary reasons many individuals and agencies have also had to adopt a model where they would skip a version or two before they upgrade to a higher version. This possibility is now pretty much gone, so my guess is that the sentiment of many Photoshop users is that they are now expected to pay double or triple the amount they used to pay in the past.\nWhat's Great\nNot only is Photoshop a powerful tool, it has also created a massive ecosystem of books, trainings, tutorials, video classes and even entire user organizations.\nAside from that ecosystem, let's have a quick look at what makes Photoshop so great.\nThe thing that intimidates new users most is also one of Photoshop's greatest strengths. It is a collection of hundreds of powerful image manipulation and design tools and if you know how to use them, there is almost no limit to what you can do with it.\nLayers, masks and layer modes let you do everything from complicated composites to things as simple as slapping a layer of text to an image. The mix of vectors and pixel graphics and the resulting flexibility is unsurpassed and I love being able to use smart objects to treat pixel graphics almost like vectors.\nProfiles allow for a color-managed workflow in pretty much any color space you like and over the years many specialized tools have found their ways into Photoshop, from handling animations to stitching big panoramas to 3D and perspective work.\nThe plugin model is another part of that ecosystem, with a ton of add-ons available to do virtually anything you can imagine.\nWhat's Troublesome\nBut its strengths can also be seen as weaknesses. Photoshop tries to be everything for everyone and its user base is so diverse that it is hard to find a common thread. Illustrators use it, it has its applications in the pre-press processes, it has even medical uses and of course there are the photographers.\nBecause Photoshop wants to be for everyone, it feels like a big piece of patchwork rather than an integrated application.\nWhat I Use Photoshop For\nThe uses for Photoshop have become less and less over the last years, especially for photographers. One of the main reasons for that change are products like Lightroom or Aperture.\nThere are still a few areas where I tend to resort to Photoshop. These include simple illustrations that use layers and masks, adding text to images, more complex cloning operations, adding transparency and stitching images.\nThat's pretty much it. I do everything else in Lightroom.\nSo, Do We Need Photoshop?\nI can only answer that question for myself, and it's pretty much a resounding no at this time. The few uses that Photoshop still has for me are easily covered in the CS4 version that I still own and there are a lot of great alternatives out there that cover a lot of Photoshop's bases.\nWhat Are The Alternatives?\nOne of the strongest alternatives on the Mac platform at this point is Pixelmator . In its new 2.0 version it supports layers, layer masks, over 100 file formats, plenty of filters, and even some of Photoshop's \"killer features\" such as content-aware fill. For \u20ac23.99 it's a bargain. Is it a full Photoshop replacement? No, but it covers 95% of what I need as a professional. The one item it doesn't have and that's high on my wish list is 16 bit support, but for most of the things I use it, I can live with that. If that's a must for you, I suggest you have a look at PhotoLine . It's not as pretty, runs on Mac and Windows, and it supports 16 bits and more, for a mere \u20ac59.\nAs a Mac user I can cover most of the remaining 5% with the tools that Mac OS X already has on board and I'd be surprised if Windows didn't have similar things on offer. I use the ColorSync Utility to do color space conversions, which includes converting pictures to CMYK, so they are ready for a printing house. Preview, one of the Mac's most underestimated apps, lets me use any ICC profile to soft proof images. And Image Capture ( the second most underestimated OS X app ) serves as a great front-end to any scanner.\nWhen I got my MacBook Air with its 128 GB SSD, I went through a long software list to decide what I needed on the road and what I could go without. Lightroom made it onto that list, Final Cut Pro X did, Scrivener too, and even Apple's 4 GB heavyweight XCode development environment.\nThe one thing that I left off the system was Photoshop.\nThat was half a year ago. So far I haven't really missed it.\nChrisMarquardt\n"}, {"score": 199.42389, "uuid": "23c9b43e-7532-5016-acf8-1cc935f1c249", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1414wb-35-22736", "target_hostname": "chrismarquardt.com", "target_uri": "http://chrismarquardt.com/blog.php?categories=equipment", "page_rank": 2.0940631e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Blog || Chris Marquardt - Photography, Photo Workshops, Videography", "snippet": "<em>I</em> remembered <em>a</em> <em>camera</em> mod <em>I</em> saw <em>a</em> while ago where someone attached <em>a</em> wide angle extender to <em>a</em> <em>camera</em> like this and after some searching <em>I</em> found <em>a</em> magnetic one designed <em>for</em> point-and-shoot still <em>cameras</em> on eBay <em>for</em> EUR 9.99 - and decided to give it <em>a</em> go.", "explanation": null, "document": "Thu, Nov 11 2010 04:40 | equipment , analysis , photography , composition , film , analog , 35mm , light , medium format\nAs my analog journey continues, I get deeper into trying different film combinations and different developments with different cameras - I'm in fact almost turning into a camera and film collector, even though I am making a point to actually use the cameras and not just put them on display to let them collect dust.\nLast weekend while on a large format workshop (I'll talk about this another time) I took pictures using my 35mm Minolta X700 with a 35/1.8 lens on it and a roll of Efke 100 film, which I later pushed to ISO 400 in Rodinal R09 one shot developer. I used this 1+50 recipe for development.\n(click for bigger size and comments)\nThen today I got the package with a Zeiss Ikon Ikonta B ( this is what it looks like , here's a review ) that I got from eBay. It's a 6x6 medium format camera with a folding front, has a 75mm lens and takes 120 roll film. It also has an uncoupled rangefinder built in, which means you'll focus with the range finder, then take that result and dial it in on the lens. A two step process for focussing with a nice built-in error margin. And it doesn't come with a light meter, so you're down to external metering. All this slows down the process quite a bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a different way of working.\nTo me there is quite a different feeling between the results that come out of those two cameras. The 35mm pictures from last weekend give me an upbeat feeling. Even though they are on the darkish side, they feel very open and inviting to me.\nIn contrast the pictures I took today almost freak me out. In a good way. Almost a depressive vibe, which is what I was going for when I took them. That and a bit of luck, as it was the first time I used this camera and the first time I developed this specific film in this specific way.\nThe pictures from both these sessions touch me in different ways, and evoking emotion is one of my main reasons for doing photography. For me a good picture is the one that touches me.\nSo what makes those two photo sessions have such different results?\nLet me try to analyze:\nWeather\nThe weather was almost the same, both times the sky was overcast, but the 35mm pics were all either taken at night, or indoors, so there was definitely a different quality of light by default. Hard to compare from that perspective.\nFilm\nThe 35mm pictures were shot on Efke 100 film at ISO 400, then pushed during development. The Ikonta pictures were shot using Rollei Tonal 100 (an orthopanchromatic film) which is also an ISO 100 film, also pushed to 400 during development. Both films are different animals, and I intentionally did not scan both of them to grayscale, but left the color information intact. You can see the Tonal 100 having a slightly warmish tone which I think helps the vintage nature of the camera I used.\nBoth films also get a bit more grainy due to the push development, but it doesn't show as much in the medium format film due to its much bigger size compared to the 35mm negative.\nFormat & Lens\n6x6 medium format, that's 60x60mm. Compare that to the 24x36mm that a 35mm camera does. 3600 vs. 864 square millimeters.\nLet's try to compare: the 35mm camera's normal focal length would be 43mm, the diagonal of the film. The 35mm lens is therefore slightly wide angle. The normal focal length for a 6x6 camera is about 85mm, so the 75mm are also slightly wide, so in that respect they sort of compare.\nThere is one big difference though: The size of the film has a big influence on depth of field. At the same aperture and distance and comparable focal length, the medium format camera will give you less depth of field, which you can see in the pictures. In order to get the same shallow depth of field with the 35mm camera, you will either have to get closer to the subject, or you have to use a wider open aperture.\nCrop\nThe 35mm format has an aspect ratio of 3:2, the medium format of the Ikonta B is 1:1 - square. The pictures I tend to get out of a square format are often much more closed and less dynamic compared to the more open 3:2 crop. In one of the 35mm images I even used an almost 3:1 ratio.\nComposition\nThe two series are fundamentally different in composition. With the 35mm I used much more close-up action, and the compositions are overall more dynamic. The faucet is dynamic in it's assymetrical nature, the rainy window balances out the light sources, one behind a rainy window and many other blurry ones in the far distance. And the Canadian flag is a very dynamic experiment where I moved the camera while exposing for a second. There is also not much that connects the pictures. (Maybe water could be the connecting element, but then you'd have to soak the Canadian flag, and I like Canada way too much to do that)\nIn contrast the 6x6 pictures from today are all very static. They all share strong verticals and those verticals are dead center. This is something the 6x6 format makes me do. I can't help it. I didn't notice until I returned home and scanned the pictures. Looking at each individually, I think those three pictures are okay. I believe putting them together in a triptych creates something bigger than the sum of the individual pictures.\nVignetting\nAll vignetting that you see is a product of the lenses used. The 35mm lens has some vignetting when shot wide open - and all the shots you see are shot wide open. The Ikonta also does vignetting, even stopped down one or two f-stops. In fact, while the 35mm pictures were shot at f1.8, the Ikonta pictures were all shot at f5.6 - that's a difference of over three stops. And the vignette the Ikonta's lens produces at this aperture is just very silky and smooth and vintage feeling.\nConclusion\nI'm not sure what to draw from this comparison, but I will take a few personal observations away from it:\nThe 35mm format tends to produce more dynamic results, the 6x6 Ikonta ends up with more static pictures\nThe vignette produced by the Ikonta looks great. Must. Use. Ikonta. For. Portrait. Session.\nDue to its warm tone, the Tonal 100 film is a good choice for vintage type results. Its orthochromatic nature helps this feeling too\nBoth the Efke 100 and the Tonal 100 can easily handle push development to ISO 400. The Efke 100 reacts with a bigger contrast boost than the Tonal 100, which is more soft in that respect\nWorking with the 6x6 is much slower (no built-in light meter, two step focusing), and as a result I tend to end up being a bit less experimental than I am with the 35mm\nThis is also helped by the fact that a roll of 120 film on a 6x6 camera yields only 12 pictures, the 35mm film allows for 3 times the exposures\nGrey November weather is great for shooting with the Ikonta, it allows me to be lazy with the light metering, because nothing changes much. The 35mm with its built-in meter is more agile in quickly changing conditions\nThe depth of field on the 6x6 is much more shallow than on the 35mm, which will help isolate subjects even if they are not very close\nThe Zeiss Ikon Ikonta B is a vintage camera with bellows, which makes it much more interesting for passers-by than the much more modern and regular looking Minolta. This can be a great conversation starter, but it can be in your way if you want to inconspicuously take pictures. Street photography with the Ikonta? Probably not.\nDo you have any specific camera/film combinations that help you take pictures of certain moods and with certain characteristics?\nChrisMarquardt\n"}, {"score": 203.4364, "uuid": "1906130d-af52-50f8-bc24-70d1f48f43ec", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-13-18270", "target_hostname": "www.llvj.com", "target_uri": "http://www.llvj.com/reviews/cameras/1d/1d-review.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1843874e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Luminous landscape", "snippet": "The only <em>cameras</em> that come close in this regard is the Rollei 6008i and <em>Leica</em> M6.

The camera was kindly loaned to me by Canon Canada shortly after it first arrived into their hands. (Serial # 2135).\nI have published a more more formal review in the March / April issue of the American magazine Photo Techniques. (\n\u2014 Now online ). Also, anyone looking for detailed specifications and an in-depth technical evaluation can find them at many sites around the Net. I have included several such links at the bottom of this page.\nWhat I hope to provide here is a real-world evaluation of the camera, much as you would do if you had this camera for a few days. In particular I have focused on a side-by-side comparison with the Canon D30, a camera that I am very familiar with. This review and comparison has now been featured in an extensive video segment in Issue #3 of The Luminous Landscape Video Journal .\nOne more thing \u2014 this is a large page with a lot of test and sample images. Therefore on a slow dialup connection it will take some time to load. Persist. It's worthwhile.\nThe Wait\nIt took a long time for the other shoe to drop. The Canon D30 arrived in the Fall of 2000, almost a year after the Nikon D1. It was worth the wait. Image quality from the D30 was superb. It set a new standard for digital SLRs, particularly at its price point. But, the body was not as robust as a pro-level EOS-1V and the autofocus in particular was lacking for many applications. A small three-frame image buffer (RAW files) also made for slow shooting. The Canon faithful waited.\nDetail\nCanon EOS-1D @ ISO 400 with a Canon 100~400mm f/5.6L IS zoom @ 400mm. 1/180 sec @ f/6.3\nNote the low noise in the out-of-focus-background, even at ISO 400. (See below)\nThe Initial Disappointment\nOne year later, in early October, 2001 the long awaited and much rumoured EOS-1D was officially announced.\u00a0 My initial impression at that time was one of disappointment. Two main things came to mind. The first was that the camera uses a CCD imager rather than the CMOS device used by the D30. With the D30 Canon had clearly broken new ground in terms of image quality \u2014 particularly low noise. Everyone therefore had expectations that the 1D would bring this technology to a new level of excellence. Secondly, the 1D only has a 4.1 megapixel chip, not the 6 megapixel imager that everyone was expecting. In fact, there were a number of apparently reliable reports from people who claimed to have actually seen a CMOS chip based 6MP EOS-1D prototype. Where was it? Why had Canon switched to what appeared to many to be a lesser design?\nThe answer, it becomes clear, was that Canon had decided to serve what it perceived to be its most critical professional constituency \u2014 news and sports photographers. They had wanted to design a digital camera that needed no excuses and made no compromises, on the battlefield or in the arena. Ultimate robustness, lightning autofocus and extremely high burst frame rates were the design criteria.\nCanon representatives have made it known that they had been unable to get the very high frame rates (8 FPS) that they wanted from CMOS technology. At least for now. So, they used a CCD design. They also have said that they believe that a 4.1MP imaging chip is sufficient for the needs of photojournalists and sports photographers, (I concur).\nI have no inclination to argue with Canon's decision to pursue this particular market. They presumably understand who they are selling to, and I am quite sure that the factories in Japan will be working overtime for many months producing 1D bodies for the tens of thousands of photojournalists and newspaper and sports photographers around the world who have been eagerly awaiting this camera.\nI'm not one of this group though. I use my Canon 35mm cameras for nature and wildlife photography. There are others who do documentary, fashion, portraits, social events, products, architecture and a wide range of other forms of photography. We all have large investments in Canon lenses and accessories. We all want and need a high resolution, high image quality digital SLR. High frame rates are important, especially when shooting some types of wildlife, but would the image quality be there? So, did Canon deliver with the EOS 1D?\nEnough preamble. Here then are my impressions, and test results \u2014 written here as I made them.\nDay 1 \u2014 December 6\nI had read that the 1V and the 1D's bodies were initially designed at the same time. It shows. I've used a 1V extensively since it was first introduced a couple of years ago. Picking up the 1D is like picking up its twin brother. The film-based 1V is one of the fastest handling, fastest shooting and quickest autofocusing cameras in existence. It's built like the proverbial brick outhouse. The 1V is regarded by many as the current state-of-the-art pro-level SLR. It feels like it was cast from a single block of magnesium alloy and high-quality polycarbonate.\nIn virtually ever handling respects the 1D is a 1V \u2014 which is high praise indeed. In fact it seems even more all-of-a-piece because instead of having a separate removable motor drive the body is one integrated unit. Ergonomically, and in terms of body fit and finish, compared to the EOS D30 the 1V is a Mercedes compared to a Volkswagen.\nThis is a good time to reiterate that while I'll mention certain features and capabilities of the camera as they seem relevant, I don't intend on producing a laundry list of features or an in-depth technical analysis. Others, more qualified and interested in this than I, will do so exhaustively in the days ahead. My intention is to see how the camera handles and how the images it produces compare \u2014 especially to the Canon D30.\nI'm using the D30 as my reference point primarily because I have more than a year's worth of experience with it. I wrote it up extensively when it first came out in October, 2000 and subsequently published a more formal review in Photo Techniques magazine.\nFirst Impressions\nThe camera comes in a slick glossy box, unlike the D30 which ships in a plain cardboard carton apparently made of recycled wallboard. I find attractive packaging appropriate when one spends thousands for a product.\nThe camera kit comes with a single NI-MIH battery pack, a 2-battery charger, and an AC adaptor for studio use.\u00a0 One of the realities of shooting digital is the need to travel with a charger, and the 1D is no different in this regard. That the charger will handle two batteries is a smart design, as I'm sure that every purchaser will buy at least one additional rechargeable battery pack.\nThe charger also acts as a discharger. This is also a smart design addition because Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, like Ni-Cads, suffer from the memory effect \u2014 though not as badly. This can mean that unless such a battery is regularly run dry it will retain a memory of the level at which it was recharged. Recharge at NI-MIH or Ni-Cad battery when it's only partially discharged on a regular basis and the battery will eventually forget how to recharge fully. But by pressing a discharge button on the 1D's charger the battery will be slowly drained and then automatically recharged. Draining a full battery takes 8.5 hours and a full charge takes 100 minutes. It probably isn't vital to do the discharge cycle all that often \u2014 maybe once a month.\nThis of course begs the question \u2014 why didn't Canon use Lithium Ion battery technology? They are more expensive, but lighter in weight and have no memory effect. Part of the reason may be the current demand of high frame-rate shooting. Still, NI-MIH seems like yesterday's technology.\nThe provided software comes on 2 disks \u2014 for both Windows and Macintosh. One disk contains Canon's TWAIN driver plug-in and the other a copy of Photoshop 5.0 LE.\nAt The Zoo\nAfter a couple of hours during the morning reading the manual, loading the provided software onto both my Mac and PC and doing a couple of quick function-test shots, I headed off to the Toronto zoo for some real-world shooting. A gray day in early December in Toronto isn't one of the most exciting venues for doing outdoor photography, but the zoo at least features some interesting and occasionally colourful subjects. I had shot there the year before when I was first testing the D30.\nI wish the camera had been delivered a week earlier. I just returned 2 days before from a 6 day shoot in Bosque del Apache, one of the premier wildlife refuges in the Southwestern USA. I had shot more than 1,000 frames with the D30 and 10 rolls with the 1V, and this would have been an ideal spot to test the 1D. But, things don't always work out as we would wish.\nDetail\nCanon EOS-1D @ ISO 400 with a Canon 100~400mm f/5.6L IS zoom @ 400mm. 1/160 sec @ f/6.3\nThis Sumatran Tiger was one of my first subjects. Because I was shooting with a long lens and because the day was quite overcast I set the ISO to 400. I also set the white balance to \"cloudy\". Similarly, \"Matrix\" was set to Mode 4, which means that the colour space was set to Adobe RGB. (More on this later).\nThis was also the first frame that I loaded and examined when I got back to my office.\u00a0 First impression was one of some considerable surprise. Colour balance was almost perfect and required very little adjustment. More importantly, sharpness was very impressive. Even more importantly noise in the shadows and out-of-focus areas was very low considering that I was shooting at ISO 400.\nUnfortunately the matching frame which I shot with the D30 was not sharp due to camera shake and so a direct comparison with this particular image couldn't be done.\nOf Cabbages & Kings\nCanon 1D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Canon D30\nCanon 50mm f/1.4 lens. 1/200 sec @ f/6.3 ISO 200\nThe above two photographs (and their linked larger versions) are straight from the camera. These were both converted with the same Canon software (the 1D's conversion program also works with D30 RAW images). In these versions neither has had any processing whatsoever \u2014 no Levels or Curves, no Sharpening. I did move the camera when taking the shot so that the .3X image size difference between them was compensated for.\nWhat do you see? I see the legendary colour intensity of the D30 Vs. a much more muted, and possibly more accurate rendition from the 1D. I also see apparently greater shadow detail in the D30 image and better highlight detail from the 1D. (Both exposures were identical, and \"as metered\").\nCanon 1D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Canon D30\nThese two enlarged sections and their linked larger versions have been processed for optimum brightness, contrast and colour balance. They have also been optimally sharpened. (You might have made other balancing and sharpening choices \u2014 these are mine). In Photoshop on my screen, (a calibrated and profiled Apple Cinemadisplay), and on prints, I see greater detail in the 1D image. This is no great surprise given the higher resolution of the 1D. What I still see, even after processing, is that the D30 produces more saturated colours while the 1D's are less saturated but more accurate. If I had to compare them to film I'd describe the D30 as looking like Velvia and the 1D is resembling Fuji Astia in terms of colour saturation. Which do you prefer?\nOne more zoo shot. While it's tempting to want to judge image quality with bright and colourful subjects, sometimes we shoot things as monochromatic as an elephant's ear on a cloudy day. I was curious to see how the two cameras would handle this.\nCanon 1D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Canon D30\nHere we again have \"raw\" uncorrected, unsharpened images. (To prevent this page becoming to large and slow I'm going to only use enlarged versions when seeing detail is needed).\nFirstly, these two images are shown here in proportion to their actual file size. At 240 DPI (the lowest resolution needed for a quality print from an Epson inkjet printer) the D30 file size is 6\" X 9\". The 1D's file size is 6.9 X 10.3\". This is shown above by scaling these proportionally.\nNext, look at the colour rendition. Once again, both cameras were set to \"Cloudy\" colour balance and imported \"As Shot\". I arrive at the same conclusion as with the cabbage photographs above. The 1D's colour rendition is more accurate while the D30 presents a more saturated though less accurate palette.\nCanon 1D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Canon D30\nIn these two frames I've used some automated software to set the White and Black points in an attempt to remove subjectivity. I've also used an automated sharpening program for the same reason. Once again we see somewhat higher resolution from the 1D, though the differences aren't huge.\nDay 2 \u2014 December 7\nProcessing Software\nAn evening of processing 1D and D30 images with Version 4 of Canon's plug-in camera module for Photoshop provided some initial impressions. Converting a RAW 1D 16 bit image and saving it to disk takes 26 seconds on a dual processor 500 Mhz Mac G4. Converting a D30 RAW file on the same machine takes 35 seconds. By way of comparison, processing RAW D30 images with BreezeBrowser , my preferred digital image processing software, takes 32 seconds on a 600Mhz Pentium 3 machine. Canon says that RAW processing has been considerably speed up. To quote from their brochure, \"...newly-developed driver software typically takes only a few seconds to convert each RAW file.\" I don't see it.\nCanon TWAIN / Plug-In \u2014 V4\nI had not spent much time with this plug-in prior to testing the 1D. My first impression is that it isn't as easy to use and as full featured as some third party software. (I have some competence in the area of software design as I was once a software designer, headed up software development at a major publisher, and was CEO of another public software development company.)\nBy way of examples, there is no histogram available within the program. Also, it's only possible to move from one image to another when in thumbnail mode. Looking at the images in a larger size one-at-a-time requires that you go back to thumbnail mode to view the next picture. If you \"Transfer\" a file to Photoshop you have to exit the software to be able to work on the image, and then have to wait a long time to reload all the thumbnails when you want to return to look at additional thumbnails. This can be a very lengthy process if you're working with a large directory of files. The program should be able to start displaying thumbnails immediately while it processing the remainder of the directory, rather than making the user wait for the whole conversion to take place. Having a stand-alone version of the software would allow for a much enhanced workflow.\nCuriously, sometimes the program appears to move and renumber files. I have experienced one instance where I loaded the card to my hard disk and went to look at the last shot that I'd taken. I couldn't find it and figured that somehow it had been eaten. A few minutes later I found it some 15 file positions back. Very disconcerting.\nI could go on, but wont. My suggestion is that Canon hire someone like Chris Breeze to write their processing software.\nBattery Life\nDay two started sunny and so I went out to do some bright light shooting. After about 20 minutes I was surprised to see that the battery indicator was showing very low. I had done 118 frames the day before and 25 frames this morning. 123 frames in all. The camera had been on for 2 hours one day and 30 minutes the next. I'd done very little screen review and had used an IS lens about half the time. The temperature had been about 60 deg F the prior day and about 50 deg F the second. The battery had been discharged and then fully charged before starting the first day's shoot.\nThis is very disappointing battery performance. I shot wildlife last week in southern New Mexico with the D30 and achieved over 500 frames at temperatures around the freezing point, using a double battery set. This is my usual experience with the D30. If this battery life in the 1D is indicative of what one can expect I would suggest carrying at least 2 additional battery packs when doing all-day location work. Such appears to be the penalty of CCD Vs. CMOS battery demand.\nIncidentally, a nice design touch is a safety release on the battery latch. One day this will prevent an expensive battery from landing in the mud during rapid fumble-fingered changing.\nShooting & Features\nCanon EOS-1D @ ISO 200 with a Canon 70~200mm f/2.8L zoom @ 200mm. 1/400 sec @ f/8\nAfter shooting and evaluating many test frames (not included here because of lack of space and time) I became bored. The differences that I was seeing between the 1D and the D30 seemed fairly constant. That is, the colour from the 1D seemed more neutral and less saturated than that from the D30. Better? Worse? That's subjective and changes with the subject matter.\nResolution is definitely higher, but that's to be expected from a bigger chip size with more pixels.\nI was most interested though in simply continuing to use the camera and to becoming really familiar with its features and workflow. As part of my morning's shoot I visited a construction site and the frame above was one of the better ones that resulted. A bit more interesting than pictures of cabbages and elephant's ears.\nBased on yesterday's and today's shooting here are some random observations about design features, ergonomics, likes and dislikes. I won't dwell on features that are the same as the 1V's. It's been around long enough now that anyone interested will be familiar with what it's all about.\nThe 1D ships with a wrist strap as well as a neck strap. Thank you Canon. It's about time.\nAs good as the 1V was, the 1D is if anything even better in terms of fit and finish. The positive latches, rubber gaskets, safety releases and all-around superior quality of construction puts the 1V head and shoulders over virtually any camera I've ever owned or used (and believe me, that's been a lot of cameras). The only cameras that come close in this regard is the Rollei 6008i and Leica M6.\nThe built in audio recording capability is a joy. I know that this has existed on previous Kodak/Canon/Nikon digital SLRs before, but this is my first experience with it. I can't tell you the number of times that I've been shooting on location and wanted to note details about what or where I was shooting, or an image processing reminder which I invariably forget days or weeks later.\nThe way that it's implemented is simple yet effective. Press the Display button to review any frame and then hold down the Mike button for more than 2 seconds. You can record up to 30 seconds of audio and a bar graph on the rear display screen keeps you informed of progress. If you need more time than that, just press and hold the button again.\nWhen you review your files as thumbnails on the computer an icon appears next to the file indicating that there is an associated recording. Click and the audio plays. I've made recordings with it in noisy environments, with the camera down at waist level, and they are clear and intelligible. Nicely done.\nThe way that the camera's digital operations controls are implemented is interesting, and quite different than the way things work on the D30. With the 1D one uses the rear control wheel along with two buttons: one marked Menu and the other Select. Pressing Menu turns on the display and you can then select one of 4 sub-menus by continuing to hold down the button and by turning the wheel. Releasing the button selects that function.\u00a0 Next, pressing the Select button and scrolling the thumb wheel moves the selection to the menu item desired. Again releasing the button selects the item. This continues down through further sub-menu choices.\nIt sounds complicated and awkward, but after a very short while it becomes intuitive and easy to use. I like it. This method seems to be less prone to user error \u2014 which is probably why Canon decided to use it, rather than the D30's free-turning thumb wheel. Menu items are logically grouped together and there's no need to scroll an individual screen to see additional items. Everything appears on one screen at a time. It won't take a new user long to become comfortable with the entire digital control array.\nOne curious omission, which has already been commented on in various forums around the Net, is the lack of a magnified image on the review screen. I use this occasionally, and many D30 users obviously find it useful, because there's been quite a hubbub about its absence on the 1D. A strange omission by Canon.\nISO Bracketing is a novel capability provided by the 1D. To my knowledge this is new to Canon. Whereas we're all familiar with a camera's ability to take 3 bracketed frames with differing exposure settings, by varying either the aperture or the shutter speed, the 1D adds the ability to vary the ISO. This can prove very handy when both aperture and shutter speed need to remain fixed, such as when doing daylight balanced fill-flash work.\nSpeaking of flash, the 1D will sync at 1/500sec when using EX series flash units. This is just great for daylight fill-flash work, so important to certain types of photographers.\nOthers will find the 1/16,000 top-end shutter speed appealing, though I find it hard to imagine when it will be needed by most people. I've never seen anything faster than 1/1000 look much different in terms of stopping motion in real-world shooting situations, though I suppose that being able to shoot in daylight at ISO 3,200 will appeal in some exotic situations.\nAnd, speaking of ISO, you can set a Custom Function so that the ISO speed is visible in the viewfinder while shooting. Very important when shooting in quickly changing light conditions so as to not have the camera set inap[propriately. Anyone who has been shooting a lot of digital for the past year or so will understand how important this can be.\nDay Three\nSome readers of earlier comparisons of the colour rendition difference between the 1D and the D30 have questioned the fact that I'm using Matrix Mode 4 (Adobe RGB) on the 1D and the native quasi-sRGB mode of the D30. They suggest that both cameras should be in sRGB for a fair comparison. Sounds like a reasonable suggestion, but it ain't so. The difference are there regardless. Here's what I wrote in reply to one such comment on Photo Net.\nI think that the colour space issue is a bit of a distraction. When shooting in RAW mode you can assign the colour space either in the camera or in the processing software on the PC. As I've now mentioned in an update to the review, RAW is RAW - all processing happens after the fact, whether done in-camera or on the PC.\nAfter receiving several comments on what you've raised I spent quite some time experimenting with importing both the 1D and the D30 images into different colour spaces, and also exporting the 1D images using various Matrix (colour space) settings. There are indeed visible differences, but they are for the most part minor. It depends very much on the colours contained in the original scene.\nBottom line \u2014 the differences between the colour rendition produced by these two cameras is apparent regardless of colour space. Going from sRGB to Adobe RGB broadens it, but doesn't change it. The expansion is primarily in the greens. In any event it's not a better / worse situation. Just different. Some people that I've shown sample prints to like the neutrality of the 1D images, some like the saturation of the D30 images. That's why Kodak and Fuji make 2 or 3 different types of film of the same ISO, each with a different colour palette. Different strokes, etc.\nObviously this means that Canon users need to now own both a D30 and a 1D. (Irony alert).\nTurn on Time\nLike its analogue brother the 1V, the 1D is lightning fast in all its responses. But, like all digital cameras there is a delay on turn on or on coming back to life after going into sleep mode \u2014 right? Right, but is the 1D ever fast in this regard as well. The D30 takes about 4 seconds to come to life. The 1D is about 1 second \u2014 almost as fast as I can click my stopwatch. First rate professional performance.\nISO Speed & Noise\nOne of the great advantages of shooting digital is that the ISO can be changed to suit the shooting situation \u2014 between frames if needs be, rather than between rolls or camera bodies. The 1D brings this to a new level by permitting ISO bracketing.\nBut, the overriding question is, how good (low) is the noise level of the 1D at various speed settings and how does it compare to the D30, which itself has quite a reputation for clean low-noise images, even to ISO 400?\nNote that the normal ISO setting range on the 1D is from ISO 200 to 1600. There are two additional settings, ISO 100 and ISO 3200, but they are accessed through a Custom Function setting. Of interest as well as that the 1D allows in-between ISO settings such as 250, 320 etc. Very nice for fine tuning.\nThis is the full-frame used in these tests. Below are \"actual pixel\" (100%) enlargements of shots taken at various speeds. The reason that the 1D and D30 frames are of different sizes is due to the different chip sizes. I decided that having both at 100% was more important than matching image sizes.\nThe place to look for noise artifacts is in the dark building at left of frame. In all cases exposure was kept constant at f/11 with the shutter speed varying to compensate for the changing ISO. No processing was applied to any of these images except for a moderate amount of USM. My comments and interpretation is found below these examples. Draw your own conclusions before reading mine.\n1D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D30\n"}, {"score": 202.15219, "uuid": "89dd72e5-7eeb-5fb2-9c6b-f29dea9691be", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-14-14804", "target_hostname": "www.photoclubalpha.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photoclubalpha.com/2011/10/17/the-sony-alpha-77-tomorrow-today/", "page_rank": 1.2495234e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Sony Alpha 77 Photoclubalpha test by David Kilpatrick | Photoclubalpha", "snippet": "Each <em>camera</em> has <em>a</em> different eyepoint \u2013 27mm <em>for</em> the A77 compared to <em>a</em> mere 19mm <em>for</em> the A55 \u2013 but this <em>should</em> not be allowed to influence the stated apparent magnification.", "explanation": null, "document": "Creative Style\nPicture Effect (only active for JPEG-only shooting)\nThe Display button can not be customised and only serves to cycle through Display setups \u2013 but you can customise those, and thus what the button does for you (above, Menu to set which finder display states you wish to cycle through, ticked). The Help (?) button can also not be customised, which if you don\u2019t want potted hints and tips makes it redundant in shooting mode, though it serves as the Trash button when reviewing images. The Playback also can\u2019t be customised, nor can the Menu button (which can return to Last Used or Top by setting a preference), nor the top LCD illuminator button. This one is interesting because it toggles \u2013 the panel light remains on until the camera goes to sleep, or it\u2019s pressed again to turn off.\nIn use, I found there was one button missing which would make a huge difference to this camera. The 12fps ultra high speed shooting mode is only accessible through the mode dial. Because of the way the camera handles bursts of frames and buffering, it would be useful to be able to shoot normally in any mode (single frame, or other continuous speed) and switch to 12fps by holding down or toggling a button (preferably holding down, say, the AF/MF lock reassigned for this purpose).\nHere\u2019s a neat touch \u2013 as long as you have a lens with no MF/AF switch on it, you can set M focus on the body selector, and pressing the AF/MF button will do autofocus for you, letting it go will lock the focus back to manual. That\u2019s another reason to like my 16-80mm CZ on the A77 \u2013 ideal for studio products or architecture, or indeed for landscape. It does not work with the 18-55mm SAM. There is in fact a bit of an overall mess with SAM, SSM, and standard lens focus types including the assignable DMF (direct manual focus) to the AF-A mode. There are some lenses where you are warned never to use body MF setting always only to use the lens switch. What you will find is that some menu items are greyed out, and some buttons don\u2019t work, if a mismatched combination is set.\nLens compatibility\nThe new 16-50mm f/2.8 is enabled for in-camera lens corrections\nThis leads to the general question of lenses and the A77 generation. It seems there\u2019s some additional information chipped into some but not all lenses which enables the Lens Correction function (Vignetting, Chromatic Aberration and Distortion) for in-camera JPEGs. Raw files are unaffected, and I don\u2019t know if this information is used to enable better panoramas but that would be a practical fringe benefit. But since the 18-55mm SAM, 55-200mm mk2 SAM, and 18-250mm (an old design relatively) are in the release firmware along with the 16-50mm SSM maybe there\u2019s no info in the lenses themselves, and future firmware will add more.\nThe oddest incompatibility is the manual\u2019s statement that Front Curtain Shutter should not be set on ON for \u2018Konica Minolta\u2019 lenses (added note \u2013 see Comments at the end of this article, some discussion of this). First of all, the description of Front Curtain Shutter is misleading. When this is set to ON, it means NO front curtain shutter \u2013 electronic gating instead. When it is off, you are using the physical Front Curtain, the blades uncover the sensor to start the exposure. The manual does make it clear that by Front Curtain Shutter Sony means No Front Curtain Shutter.\nBut what is a Konica Minolta lens? There are very few, nearly all were made by Tamron. Konica Minolta never even got round to rebranding the Apo G lenses, they just changed the box and the lens cap and left Minolta as the name on the lens. I have a 28-75mm Konica Minolta, a 17-35mm Konica Minolta and at one point I had an 18-200mm, and of course, the kit 18-70mm and various horrible full frame plastic lenses like the 28-100mm. I think there are 75-300mms in KM guise.\nEverything else prior to Sony was Minolta because KM simply never made any, or if they did, it amounted to no more than a box label change. To confuse things, some of these Konica Minolta like the 18-70mm, 18-200mm and 75-300mm became Sony lenses without a single substantial change. And many Minolta lenses became Sony lenses while retaining a heritage right back to pre-D days or the origins of the AF system itself. The 28mm f/2.8 is the most obvious example, the 50mm f/1.4 another.\nWhy would an electronic front curtain produce overexposure or inconsistent exposure only with Konica Minolta lenses? Given the very fast response time (1/20th of a second) and high speed of the system (1/250th flash sync, 1/8,000th shutter) the only thing I can think of would be the speed of aperture closing action. It is also something which would be invisible in revised lenses; maybe the Sony 18-70mm kit lens actually has aperture blades which close 50 milliseconds sooner than the KM equivalent.\nThis would also mean earlier Minolta lenses, not just KM, might produce overexposure (aperture still not fully closed when exposure commences) or uneven exposure (aperture continues to close down during part of the electronic progressive gate-opening). The same would apply to many third party lenses.\nI\u2019m pretty sure this is why the warning is made, and that singling out Konica Minolta lenses is an error. Any one individual lens may have sluggish diaphragm, indeed a common cause of overexposure in all A-mount lenses is incomplete stop-down. So the advice should be don\u2019t use \u2018Front Curtain Shutter\u2019 set to ON with anything except Sony A-mount lenses \u2013 or test your independent lens before use.\nA warning about not setting Micro AF adjustment with third party lenses is given, as usual. This is because the makers borrow lens identity codes. The Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 Mk1 has the same code as the Minolta/KM 28-80mm kit lens. This issue will also affect the behaviour of the Auto Lens Correction register, which in our body does not have any effect on the CZ 16-80mm for example but does correct the new 16-50mm. I would guess \u2018correctable\u2019 lenses have extra information, older and third party lens won\u2019t. So don\u2019t bank on this function fixing JPEGs from your \u2018heritage\u2019 of early Sony glass!\nSigma has issued a list of lenses which are known to have AF problems with the Alpha 77/65, and will upgrade them free of charge. You can read the list here: http://www.sigma-photo.co.jp/english/news/info_111014.htm . It includes the 18-250mm HSM OS, which we have. Ours does not seem to have any issues at all on our A77 with firmware 1.03. I\u2019ve also tested the 8-16mm and 100-300mm OS, 70mm macro and 70-200mm f/2.8 HSM Macro MkII. These are not in the warning list and all seem to work well, even though they do not work reliably with the Alpha 55.\nThe A77 has Fast/Slow AF options and I\u2019ve used Fast. The accuracy of the AF is much better than any previous Alpha model.\nAutofocus and exposure\nThe 19-sensor, 11-cross AF module is not most densely populated \u2013 the A900 has 10 extra hidden \u2018tracking assist\u2019 line sensors bringing it up the same total (they are there, they just don\u2019t have screen markings) and its central double cross sensor is technically the best type around. But having eleven cross sensors does more good in practice.\nAF has a new mode, Zone. This creates three groups of sensors left centre and right which act like mini wide zones. Wide Area focus can, of course, locate widely spaced details which are concurrently in focus. Zone identifies the zone with the most focused points, then works within this area. It can use information about the change in confirmed focus within one zone to help track the subject into the next zone. It also gets the exposure right more of the time.\nBecause the sensor is feeding image data to an analysing computer, Face Recognition and Object Tracking can be linked to the AF. There must be some theoretical speed penalty \u2013 something must be slowed down by microseconds if you enable these functions. I can\u2019t detect it. The only slowdown is the time you take to press the central controller button to register an subject for tracking. Smile Shutter is also possible. My subjects normally scowl so I don\u2019t use this.\nThe focus point \u2013 here, centre focus spot aimed first at the family and then held using the shutter release to recompose the scene \u2013 helps determine exposure. The 1200-zone metering has correctly placed the baby\u2019s white clothes in the value range 250 to 254 RGB.\nThe most reliable and accurate focusing method remains central single spot focus, or local selectable single spot. Now that all of these are cross-type, there is no compulsion to stick with the centre and recompose, but it\u2019s a habit hard to lose. I have already observed that the metering in spot mode is 16 times more sensitive than spot metering in the 900, and I would guess that when the system biases matrix metering values to the centre focus point, there\u2019s a related gain if not that much. There is a proper near-IR AF illuminator in the camera body \u2013 Minolta tradition lives on! Without flash, it really is possble to focus in the dark and the EVF does a very grainy but usable job as a night vision viewer too. The illuminator also enables focusing on plain surfaces as it projects a pattern.\nThe SLT mirror of the 77 diverts 30% of light to the AF module, but this is actually more than the old semisilvered patch and double mirror system used to let through in SLRs. The AF sensor itself may not be any more sensitive, it\u2019s simply getting a much better image feed. This 30%, by the way, means the light reaching the sensor is reduced not by the 1/3rd to 1/2 a stop sometimes mentioned, but by .6 of a stop or nearly 2/3rds of a stop. 50% would be one stop. (See comments at the end of the article for some more precise figures on the mirror split provided by Dr Daniel Oi).\nMy experience so far with the camera indicates that exposure is very reliable over the entire EV range. I simply leave it on the matrix multi-zone setting. The EVF warns me if it\u2019s going to bias too much to the focus point.\nHigh speed shooting\nThis brings me to the aspect of high speed sequences. No cameras in this class has ever achieved 12fps, let alone at 24 megapixels. In theory you get 13 raw or 11 RAW+JPEG frames before the camera slows down, and it looks as if the buffer must hold about 320MB. The camera does not have a dual processor like the Alpha 900, and it does not benefit from the robust performance of fast CF cards.\nAutofocus is provided in Hi drive mode, along with AE (8fps, accessed via the Drive function button, in any shooting mode). Using this shooting speed you have full control.\nIn Speed Priority AE mode (the 12fps setting on the mode dial) the focus is locked before frame 1 if you have the camera set to Single (S) AF, but in exchange for this, you can set both the ISO and the aperture. You can also set these if you use Manual focus.\nIf you set the focus mode to C (Continuous) then both AE and AF continue during shooting. You can set the ISO, but not the aperture, so the ISO is your only way control the shutter speed. Added note: the Canon 1D X has now bettered this record high speed shooting by providing 14fps. This mode in the Canon locks both AE and Focus with the first frame, locks the mirror up, and you must use Live View on the rear screen to compose the shot. For focus tracking with viewfinder, the 1D X is limited to 12fps.\n12fps is very impressive. It makes a huge difference in action work. I often test sequence shooting on the local races, and I quickly found that even tracking a horse (necessary to keep it in the frame at all for more than one shot at 3fps) certain frame rates just produced two stages in its stride, repeated. The horse was galloping at 2.5 clops per second and I was shooting at 5fps. With 7fps it gets better, 8fps or 10fps still better and with 12 fps you reach the point where four different positions of the legs are recorded.\nAlso, it becomes possible to aim the camera at a fixed spot like a hurdle, and fire, capturing several positions of the horse before it leaves the field of view. It is not as necessary to pan with the subject every time to get more than one shot.\nAnimation of three hand-held frames, cropped from a Sigma 70-200mm shot taken at 70mm, showing how 12fps captures very fast action in relatively small steps. At 5fps, the second frame would have the horse leaving the right-hand edge.\nIn practice, you certainly get your 13 raw or 11 R+J shots at 12fps or the slower AF-capable Hi 8fps setting \u2013 or indeed at the slower 3fps rate. But you don\u2019t get anything like the same continuous shooting capability as past models even if you knock the JPEG size right down. You\u2019ll get around 18 Normal Small JPEGs (6 megapixels, lowest quality) at 10 to 12fps before the rate slows down to an erratic 3fps with occasional half to one second pauses. For raw files, after your 13-ish burst is up, you may get between 0.5 and 1 frame per second with occasional one to two second pauses. With an average SD card (20MB/s write) you will wait 15-20 seconds after the last shot before being able to shoot fast bursts again.\nHere\u2019s another sequence, this time as stills without the annoying animation you can\u2019t turn off\nAnd here, below, is a 100% crop from the original ISO 800 raw file processed using Adobe Camera Raw 6.5 (Sharpness 50, Radius 0.5, Detail 0, Masking 0; Luminance NR 25, Luminance Detail 50, same from Chroma NR)\nSharpness? The 12fps C-AF setting forced the Sigma 70-200mm to be at f/3.5, two thirds of a stop down from full aperture, but also gave a shutter speed of 1/6400th. I could have perhaps picked another detail with slightly more punch, and looking at all the shots, my prefocused point was actually about 1 metre behind the horse (if the AF refocused during this sequence, I can\u2019t see any evidence in the images). The 8fps or Single-Shot AF 12fps settings allow control of aperture, and I know that f/5.6 would have cleaned up. Just remember you are looking at a section of an image something between 6ft and 8ft wide, it\u2019s very easy to view a tiny clip like this as if it was just another digital image.\nI tried one technique, shoot 2, 3, 4, 6 frames with brief pauses \u2013 as if catching different moments of an event, in bursts. Even though I spread the 10fps bursts over a ten second interval, by the time I had totalled 20 raw frames I was down to the single shot per second or worse situation.\nTo follow up, I shot a burst then allowed the buffer to write for about 8 seconds before firing again. I got seven frames at 12fps, which fits in with the card in use taking about 15 seconds to finish writing from a 13-frame burst.\nFor one of the horse racing tests, I shot one burst of frames and as the camera slowed down, two horses fell and two jockeys were injured, one requiring a stretcher. I was unable to get ANY pictures of the incident as it happened, and by the time the Alpha 77 was able to shoot again, the ambulance crew was on the track. Each race gave me just two chances to shoot a burst so I\u2019m afraid that testing every single setting combination on the camera was not possible.\nPanorama speed mystery\nThere\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand about the raw, file and buffer handling of the Alpha 77. Shooting panoramas \u2013 which have to start with exactly the same frame by frame 24 megapixel data readout \u2013 I counted 42 frames apparently firing at something close to the 12fps maximum, then creating a panoramic JPEG, and the finished 6.7MB JPEG file was written to card and the buffer cleared before I had time to see if the light was still on.\nWhat exactly is happening here? How could the processor and the buffer somehow handle the throughput of the wide panorama with at least double the number of continuous burst frames I could get with even the smallest JPEG \u2013 and then do all the computing to assemble the panorama and write it to card, leaving me ready to shoot immediately?\nI ask this because when shooting panoramas with the Alpha 55, my 15MB/s SanDisk Ultra II SD card failed \u2013 it was not fast enough, could not handle the data and became corrupted. Clearly panorama shooting is data intensive one way or another. But in the Alpha 77 it appears to be allocated buffer and processing power which is denied to more useful motordrive sequence shooting.\nMovie shooting does not enjoy the same fast buffer clearing. Shoot any higher quality movie beyond a mere blip on the button, and you can\u2019t fire a still frame for some seconds. With some HD-movie systems, you actually shot a still frame during the movie and lose nothing except a couple of movie frames; with others, you can end the movie by pressing the shutter and capturing a still. In yet other makes, you can shoot a still but lose two seconds during the movie. All these solutions are valuable when still shots could be important. The A77 movie function does not permit any such choice and may block all shooting by occupying the buffer to card writing process for many seconds.\nAnd, in reverse, you can not initiate a movie while the card write light is on. I tried this with one of my horse race test subjects. I decided I would shoot the front runners going over a hurdle, get my 12fps burst, then do a few seconds of movie of the stragglers who reach the spot a few seconds later. Although I could have shot further (faltering) still frames, movie shooting was blocked out with a warning message telling me \u2018Writing to Memory Card \u2013 Unable to Operate\u2019. When raw shooting was set, this lasted many seconds, but interestingly with the small JPEG option only two or three seconds were blocked out.\nAfter my tests of the high speed shooting functions, I conclude that to cover some sports events well you would need a pair of Alpha 77s, or the 77 and some other camera \u2013 and you would need to keep a close eye on the card writing light. As a result of the performance with my SD cards giving write speeds around 20-30MB/s I ordered a SanDisk 45MB/s Extreme Pro, and plan to get a 95MB/s card when they are available.\nAdded after receiving the SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB 45MB/s card: burst shooting is not extended, using raw it varies from capturing 10 to 12 raw frames at maximum rate, sometimes with a single frame jumped (two groups of 5-6 frames) which never happens with my ordinary Transcend 20MB/s card. Buffer to card writing is reduced to around 10 seconds from around 20, but at least with this extra card speed, there is no way to extend the approximate 1 second unbroken raw shooting burst.\nThe Alpha 65 and 77 are the only DSLR/T cameras so far made which use the USH-1 SDXC specifiction to allow writing data at this kind of rate. They are ahead of the card game. But they need to have this capability. Anyone expecting to make full use of the high speed drive functions and best video quality of the 77 with cards like the faithful wallet full of Transcend 16GB Class 10s we have been using will be disappointed.\nThe dedicated Movie mode\nOn the mode dial of the A77 there is a movie position. This does not mean it has changed, like some Canon models, to be incapable of shooting unplanned movie clips \u2013 you can do this at the press of a button, like other Sony models. What the Movie icon means is that you gain access to manual control of ISO, shutter and aperture. As a penalty, you lose AF.\nWhy? That is easy to answer. The AF sensors in the 77 are rated for f/5.6 aperture use. Default movie apertures range between f/3.5 (typically set on fast lenses) and f/6.3 (well, with an f/6.3 zoom lens there is little choice). AF works best in this range. If you really want to shoot AF movies at f/2.8 on a 200mm lens, try by all means. I have tried at f/3.5 and for every clip which has a smooth focus transition, there will be another where the SSM, SAM, HSM or plain old screw drive makes a sudden shift.\nSo if you want to work at f/1.4, leaving focus to AF would be a disaster. Apart from making constant shifts, there\u2019s a big chance of hunting. I worked with the 24mm f/2 SSM Carl Zeiss for a while, and this lens does not find focus easily in low light with any camera. On the A77 for video it was auto-set to between f/2.8 and f/4 in low light. Video AF happens at the actual working aperture, not wide open like still AF. Being stopped down a little improved the 24mm\u2019s accuracy.\nAnd if you want to work at a smaller aperture than f/6.3 \u2013 say f/16 for a deep focus effect with a superwide lens \u2013 then AF simply would not work at all. The Manual Focus restriction placed by using the Manual Movie mode is necessary despite the howls of protest it\u2019s produced from those who don\u2019t understand the technology involved. A side benefit of setting Movie mode on the dial is that your view through the finder is cropped correctly to the HD area before you start filming, which makes composition easier \u2013 see below.\nIn the Movie position on the Mode dial you might believe you can use the self-timer. The manual ticks that box. We had to check it, but although you can set the Drive state, including self-timer, doing so has no effect on Movie shooting. Nor can you shoot stills with the Mode dial in this position. Various other manual details, such as indicating flash can be usedin this mode, are also incorrect or there\u2019s a small firmware glitch with the camera. I would expect the shutter release to be operational with the mode dial set to Movie, so that stills could be captured. It is disabled and you can\u2019t take still shots at all if the dial is in this position. Be warned!\nNot only that, but after I had pressed the Self Timer 10 second setting when in Movie mode, the LCD top display showed a single frame symbol plus the 10 from the self-timer mode, and the shutter release was disabled even after returning the mode dial to Program or other settings. The Drive mode had to be reset to get it out of this tangle.\nAs for the instant Movie button, it\u2019s not in the best place \u2013 a long thumb reach for on and off actions to start and end clips and the placing tends to make me tilt or move the camera needlessly. When adjusting the viewfinder dioptre to switch from working with spectacles to working without, it\u2019s so close to the dioptre control I push it occasionally by mistake. I would like the Movie mode to switch operation to the main shutter release OR the movie button.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that picture effects (see later pages) can be applied to movies, as can all other image adjustments, and will be seen in the finder as you shoot.\nBut what you won\u2019t see until the moment you press the movie button is the working HD movie area. It is a surprisingly fierce crop from the full sensor, not just a top and bottom slice to HD 16:9 format. This is required for the Steady Shot digital, pixel-shift based movie stabilization which does not move the sensor like regular SS. It reduces the 1.5X area to something like a 1.8X area, not as much \u2018zoom in\u2019 as using the 1.4X smart converter but enough to cut heads and feet off subjects you have pre-composed using the full finder. There are indicator marks on the display, that\u2019s true, but you will find them hard to see in many conditions even if you remember to use them.\nShot with the 24mm f/2 lens \u2013 no way to move back or zoom out for the movie, but plenty of space you would think for the 16:9 HD crop.\nThis is what the HD movie viewfinder field switches to when the Movie button is pressed (slightly re-composed horizontally but not cropped at all). The movie stabilization need the surrounding pixels. It highly effective, both through the live viewfinder and when viewing the results, and totally silent unlike sensor-shift SS. It also does not warm the sensor assembly up as much.\nA caveat to movie shooters. Select the highest quality AVCHD 2.0 formats (the camera will warn you) and you may not be able to play them, burn them to disc other than Blu-Ray, or import them into HD movie editing with programs like Apple iMovie. No doubt this will change with updates, but right now apart from Sony\u2019s PC-only Picture Motion Browser (they have now had half a decade to port it to Mac) there are few programs which can recognise the 1080/50 or 60p 28Mbps format and even fewer which edit it. You will need to buy software to do so. On my system, Toast Titanium 11 includes Roxio HD viewer and because it is a Blu-Ray compatible disc authoring package, this was able to handle the .MTS files in all formats, and convert them to formats editable using iMovie. Roxio offers similar PC utilities.\nSony PMB is also very useful for GPS data handling, map viewing and correcting GPS data. While Adobe Bridge with the GPS Panel (download from Adobe) installed allows viewing and editing of co-ordinates, it still has no link to Google Maps, Microsoft Virtual Earth, or any other useful location display.\nSound\nThere is no provision for audio notes or audio only recording, which is a bit of a waste of built-in functions as this would be possible and can be useful. Audio notations attached to images are popular with travellers and journalists.\nThe stereo sound is not much different to the NEX or Alpha 55 despite being capable of 48kHz (better than CD) sampling. The microphone under its unusual top grille seems less prone to wind noise than most DSLRs; the wind noise reduction feature, a bass cut filter, is additionally effective. Body handling noise is present, so is lens focus noise.\nThe external mic socket provides 5v phantom power for popular condensor mics, and is stereo too. No provision for fixed gain is made \u2013 auto level or gain is always on. The camera needs an option to disable auto gain so that a preamp or mic with dB cut choices can be used to control a fixed sound level; better would be three levels, like Nikon; even better still a proper sound level monitor display and full control in fine steps like Canon. Without at least one of these options the Alpha 77 can not considered for semi-pro or professional live sound video work.\nGPS Data\nWhile I think that the GPS on the A77 has so far proved faster in locking and more accurate in positioning than the A55, it\u2019s hard to quantify as I have not used both together for long enough in difficult locations. To improve your GPS, download this file:\nhttp://control.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/GPS/assistme.dat\nCreate a folder on your SD card inside the PRIVATE/SONY directory and call it GPS. Copy this file into it, put the card in your camera, switch on. Go to GPS in the main menus and make sure it\u2019s turned on, then look at the GPS ASSIST entry and you will find the assist data starts on the day you download and lasts a month. Visit the assist.dat download once a month or more often to keep your GPS working with the fastest and most accurate lockon and co-ordinates. Do not worry if you format or change cards, once in the camera the assist.dat file is copied to internal GPS memory. Your original card does not have to be present.\nSony state 15 seconds or more to acquire or change position, and variable accuracy due to GPS being a US military provision which can be subject to deliberate degrading. In this model, when no GPS signal can be detected on power up, the camera simply turns off GPS embedding (on the A55, it uses the last co-ordinate). But if you are out and about, the last position may be shown on some pictures. I don\u2019t think I move that far in 15 seconds\n.\nAn example of GPS map location from Media Pro and Google Maps \u2013 click on the image for a full size screen shot.\nAdobe gripe \u2013 it\u2019s long overdue for Bridge to have a GPS map function when Lightroom does. As it happens I use Media Pro for all my digital asset management. When this was Microsoft Expression Media 2 it has its own Virtual Earth window, but now it\u2019s been taken over by Phase One, that has been replaced by auto-opening a web browser Google Earth window. I don\u2019t really need to see maps at raw file stage, but it could help with filenames. I like my filenames to be a \u2018catchline\u2019 format \u2013 an alphanumeric string which contains a key word about the subject. That could be simple like venice2011-15.jpg or a bit more precise like guideccasangiorgiovenice2011-15.jpg.\nMouthful? Not ISO compliant? Not ancient PC friendly? Sure. But very useful indeed many years later when searching for stuff. And access to GPS map location helps me decide filenames, then later on input metadata for caption, keywords, description, and much more. With 15,000 finished images stored on my system everything which helps me identify them is valuable.\nImage formats and styling\nThe Alpha 77 has a stack of great functions and features I will never use. That\u2019s because they are not available if you shoot either RAW or RAW+JPEG. They include multi-shot modes (combining tonal range for HDR, or reducing noise for low light and high ISO) and in-camera post processing effects.\nThere are some of these JPEG-only modes I feel comfortable with. Panoramas, as an example, don\u2019t provide a raw file and you can\u2019t bracket exposures. You have to trust the camera despite the huge range of tones and light a wide panorama can cover. If you choose your start position well (including the brightest highlight area of importance) exposure is very reliable, and at low ISO with Fine quality, the JPEG is of a professional standard.\nStandard JPEG (click images for 1000 pixel wide version)\nThree-shot HDR using 3EV spread\nThree-shot HDR also works well, especially at low ISO settings of 50 or 100 and in Extra Fine JPEG. The 24 megapixel file gives plenty of scope for reducing to a smaller final result. There is also a special HDR Painting mode, which processes the file with a masking effect to create what is currently a popular \u2018look\u2019. Unlike the standard range of HDR settings, this is far from being a straight image and the lack of a raw file or normal JPEG to back it up means it\u2019s only for fun.\nOver the top with HDR Painting style, High strength \u2013 it actually works best on dull, wet days with grungy subjects!\nMore \u2018only for fun\u2019 stuff includes soft focus, selective colour against mono (called \u2018Partial Color\u2019), toy camera, miniature effect, two monochrome looks including one which uses three exposures, \u2018pop color\u2019, posterization, retro photo, soft high key. All of these are irreversible real time post processing. You have no normal backup when shooting.\nThe post-processing method offered by Nikon and others, where you can apply similar effects to raw or JPEG files already stored on your memory card and create a new version, is preferable. For standard HDR shots on Sony\u2019s current models, a normal JPEG is saved along with the three-shot HDR and that\u2019s good. For any of the Picture Effect post-processes, even multishot, no standard result is saved \u2013 all you get is the processed file, after a wait of 10 seconds or considerably less.\nSelective yellow on monochrome \u2013 but that\u2019s the only shot I have. No raw, no standard JPEG\u2026\nYou do get a pretty accurate preview of the result in the EVF. If the stop-down preview button is set to \u2018Shot Preview\u2019 mode instead of \u2018Aperture Preview\u2019, you also get a simulation of the effect of your shutter speed \u2013 so flowing water brief time exposures (up to 30 seconds) can be previewed to see exactly which shutter speed suits the water movement best. Along with exposure simulation, there should be no reason why your shot ever goes wrong.\nThe Auto ISO Multi-Shot mode, Multi-Frame Noise Reduction, captures six frames and creates one JPEG. The pixel alignment seems very accurate and shots at settings like ISO 3200 show an improvement in detail which would be hard to obtain even by good raw processing. It\u2019s not so much the noise that is reduced, it\u2019s the overall quality of the image which improves. Using the high 25,600 ISO setting which can only be accessed in this mode shows that it\u2019s slightly inferior to a straight 16,000 ISO shot despite the six-frame synthesis.\nFor all these multi-shot modes, the 12fps function of the Alpha 77, SSS, and the quiet, mirrorless shutter action combine well. They are all usable without much effort or worry, hand-held. The one \u2018tonal range\u2019 adjustment which does operate in RAW+JPEG mode, though only the JPEG is changed, is the DRO or DRO+ setting which uses a single shot.\nHigh speed shooting also benefits exposure, DRO and white balance bracketing. Early information and the use manual state that you can define the number of exposures for bracketing, and the range covered, with the Alpha 65. In fact it is limited to three shots. The Alpha 77 gives you a choice of 3 shots at +/-3EV, the same at 2EV, then 3 or 5 shots at 0.7, 0.5 or 0.3 EV intervals. It is missing the obvious 1 EV step choices and that will baffle many, especially HDR raw users who would like 5 shots at 1 EV intervals.\nFlash\nThe Alpha 77 has a proper, threaded, high grade studio flash sync terminal as well as the usual Minolta i-type hot shoe. Like the Alpha 700 and 900 (and unlike the consumer level cameras, including the Alpha 580) it can have the HVL-F58AM or 43AM wireless control capable flash mounted on the camera to control group/channel wireless strobes with power ratio. It can also use HSS (burst flash with shutter speeds up to 1/8,000th and corresponding power attenuation). It can not officially use the HVL-F20AM as a wireless controller, but owners have found it works \u2013 with a slightly longer than normal delay in flash firing, according to Gary Friedman, who has compared it with the pop-up flash wireless control.\nThe flash sync Prontor-Compur coaxial connector (PC flash socket) is sealed behind a cover shared with the Remote Release socket. This cover was so tightly sealed it threateed to break a fingernail opening it the first time, a small screwdriver was needed.\nThe most important change for professional and enthusiast owners is the long-overdue addition of a menu item which prevents the EVF or LCD live view from showing actual exposure when Manual aperture and shutter are set.\u00a0 This item is under Live View Display, and is called \u2018Setting Effect\u2019 \u2013 off or on. While this nomenclature is not exactly transparent, it describes the function well as all picture styles and creative effects normally shown in the finder are also bypassed. The important thing for studio flash users is that you can set 1/125 at f/16 with modelling lights, and see a normal finder view not a black hole. You still must remember to set white balance to Flash or Daylight, otherwise the camera will set it from the modelling light K.\nIt is best to use one of the three Memory registers (accessible through Menu screen after turning the Mode dial to MR, Memory Recall or Register) to store a manual exposure, fixed WB, low ISO, Setting Effect OFF preset for studio work. Then you can return to any other setting and get your accurate exposure and \u2018look\u2019 preview back again.\nThe internal pop-up flash (GN12) has the usual range of first, second curtain, fill-in, off, auto options; TTL Pre-Flash, ADI, and also manual power control down to 1/16th which can be useful for triggering slave flashes if you don\u2019t have a cable or a wireless trigger (and Minolta shoe adaptor). Because the body is weatherproofed, the flash shoe cover is a softer plastic type which seals tightly. Don\u2019t lose this shoe cover or swap it for one of your others.\nAnd the rest\nBy the time I\u2019ve written this single review article, it will be one-third the length of the complete camera guide books we used to do for Hove twenty years ago. The Alpha 77 has so much more to discuss.\nYou will be concerned about high ISO quality, diffraction, resolution, having good enough lenses. I would question whether the new 16-50mm, used wide open, is a \u2018good enough\u2019 lens \u2013 let alone the 18-55mm SAM also being offered as a kit lens. Just don\u2019t worry. Whatever your existing lenses are capable of doing, the 24 megapixel sensor will give you more of it. Let\u2019s say your favourite lens is really only good up to 12 megapixels. It will be just as good if you use the 12 megapixel Medium size JPEG option on the Alpha 77, and if you do that, the 1.4X Smart Teleconverter function will also deliver a 12 megapixel drawn from the centre of the field only \u2013 so most likely just as good.\nRather too distant heron, shot using the 2X Smart Converter for JPEGs (this is actually a clip from a raw file processed in aCR to match). ISO 3200, 70-300mm SSM G lens. Click image for 1000 pixel version\nClick image for 1000 pixel 100% size clip from ACR processed version (my density choice)\nClick image for Capture One Pro 100% clip from raw (ditto)\nClick image for in-camera processed (JPEG Fine, Low level of NR) 100% clip (camera\u2019s density)\nI am now shooting with auto ISO set to go from 100 to 3200 instead of 1600, I have started using Medium and Small JPEGs with DRO+ to ensure exposure correction for events type shots, I\u2019ve tried all the lenses I have and the only thought is that I need to stick around f/8 to f/11 for safety. Balancing extra depth of field with a hint of diffraction loss. I\u2019m using the manual focus \u2018peaking\u2019 function to check the accuracy of my AF (this shows a coloured line on correctly focused details, when the AF/MF button is pressed in). I am not so worried about low light, high ISO as I first thought. It\u2019s actually as good as the 16 megapixel sensor when needed, and when it\u2019s not, the extra resolution repays careful low ISO technique.\nThe new tilt, hinge, flip, swivel and cartwheel rear screen is just great for the few times I need to use it. The EVF may consume more power (470 images versus 530 per battery official rating) than the big rear screen but I no longer need to switch between the two for menu and function operations. Because of the new design, all positions found on other cameras from hanging-under to almost flat on top (R-1 style) are possible except facing forwards and positioned to the side. There are firmware or orientation sensor errors, as the imager can appear upside down in more than twisted position. The hinge design makes a vertical grip possible and also allows a wider range of tripods or quickmount plates.\nThe A77 has all the focus and AE hold and lock, slow sync, focus point shift, exposure over-ride and other key functions I need. It claims to be weatherproof, and having nearly broken that thumnbnail off opening the flash sync cover\u00a0 I do believe the seal is tight. The card slot door is not so reassuring and I see no trace of any proper sealing, not even a labyrinth design.\nI am baffled by Sony\u2019s indecision about ON/OFF switch design, the camera labelling is the reverse of the Alpha 55/33/35 or 580/560 etc, though the action is the same. The direction is the reverse of the NEX-5. But there is one consistency, to turn any camera on the movement is always from left to right \u2013 whether Alpha 100, 700, 900 and whether the switch is rotary or a slider. Maybe this is the rule they stick to.\nYou can not configure the directionality of the two control wheels, as you can with Nikon, and for some reason I have always tried to open or close the aperture by taking the wrong directione. That is because the wheel directions go against the old Minolta protocol that turning the aperture ring to the right opens up, turn to the left stops down.\nLike the Alpha 700, the Alpha 77 has magnesium alloy body shell combined with other metal and plastic components. It has the proper strap-lug fixed into the mag alloy casting, like the 700 and 900. This lug and triangle-ring design, as opposed to the slot-type strap fixing of the lesser camera bodies, is always a clue that the structure is based on a good solid metal skeleton. The overall design and balance of the Alpha 77 are as good as any Alpha I\u2019ve used. There are hints of the 700 and also some memories of the Dynax 7xi present in the sculpturing of the body. To those who say it looks a bit like a Canon, yes, it\u2019s true that Canon design has caught up with 1990s Minolta style in the last couple of years\u2026\nConclusion\nFrom the initial press meeting with Sony, where cameras were prototypes and the images were not allowed to be shown, I decided that if I could work for a year with the Alpha 55 and have no problems then the Alpha 77 was a safe investment. The viewfinder is a pleasure to use, though EVFs differ from optical screens in one important respect, that the eye can not compensate for small errors in the dioptre setting. With an OVF like the Alpha 900, I can set the dioptre midway between what\u2019s needed for my sight with and without glasses, and get along fine with either. That can not be done with the EVF and it demands a precise dioptre setting for each. I have found it more comfortable to use without specs, so they spend too much time perched on my head, hanging from my collar or stuffed into a pocket.\nIt will be another year before I know just how wise the decision to go with EVF SLT models has been.

December 2008 03:10\nJon Hornstein of Creative Touchpoint\nThis is a challenging time for photographers, as it is for almost all sectors of the economy. The photo industry was already facing a gloomy outlook even prior to the recent stock market meltdown.\nThe economy is cyclical. Booms followed by busts are the norm. But for many areas of professional photography this recession is a watershed moment. Print publishing, the financial lifeblood of commercial, editorial and corporate photography, was already rapidly loosing readers and advertisers. The current recession will only accelerate the loss of advertising dollars and hasten the death of many print publications.\nGeneral estimates are that this recession will last 18-36 months. Once ad spending does begin to increase again, fewer ad dollars will go back into print and more will go into Web, mobile, games and product placement. Much of the costs of creating an ad campaign that previously went to photographers will instead go to videographers, graphic designers, user experience designers and 3-D modelers.\nOf course commercial, editorial and corporate photography won't disappear. There will still be\u00a0 print publications as well as billboards, bus shelters, brochures and other marketing and promotional needs that only photography can fill. But much of that will be filled with low-cost microstock whenever possible.\nThese areas of photography that rely directly or indirectly on print advertising will continue to exist for a long time to come. But when the pendulum starts swinging back to more prosperous times, these areas are not likely to see the same opportunities that existed in the past.\nFaced with these challenges, what can a photographer do?\nSpecialize in areas that don't depend on ad spending such as weddings, fashion, portraits and product photography.\nThere will be fewer assignments over the course of this recession and budgets will shrink for those jobs that are still available. But some area of photography are more recession-proof than others. Less ad spending means fewer commercial jobs but people will still be getting married, new clothes and products will need to be promoted and companies will still need to document their work. Naturally, not every photographer can do, or wants to do, any type of photography just because it's where the opportunity lies. But if you've done some work in these areas, or have considered it, this is a good time to explore moving more in those directions.\nStay away from any area that can be filled by microstock (i.e. lifestyle, travel, conceptual, etc.)\nEven prior to the current economic difficulties, microstock has put extreme downward price pressure on many types of photography. Not only has it absorbed the money at the lower-end of the market but it's had the effect of lowering the value of much commercial and editorial photography in general. If much of your work tends to represent \"iconic\" concepts such as health, financial security, friendship, family, etc., then you are at great risk of losing your market to microstock. Take the time to really look at the images available through microstock agencies such as iStockphoto, Dreamstime and Crestock and evaluate how different (not just better) your images really are.\n"}, {"score": 192.3107, "uuid": "cb94c556-1f7d-5fb0-a89b-7c1710fc2daf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-40-25483", "target_hostname": "wrotniak.net", "target_uri": "http://wrotniak.net/photo/news-08.html", "page_rank": 1.1744332e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "wrotniak.net: Photo Tidbits News &mdash; 2008", "snippet": "The <em>camera</em> <em>should</em> be available before September.", "explanation": null, "document": "Photo Tidbits News \u2014 2008\nPicture of the Week (December 29): A mysterious stranger at the Maryland Renaissance Festival in Crownsville last August.

That's as good as it gets, a welcome reprieve from the daily rat race in suburban Maryland, especially in the recent months.\nJust yesterday a friend decided to get himself a belated Christmas present; walked into a local photo outlet, tried the Nikon D90 and the E-520, and chose the latter, a decision based mostly on the physical feel of the camera in his hands. Only then did he call me from the store to have his choice approved. Another friend is already lining up to get the E-30 as soon as it becomes available, to complement his 7-14 mm Zuiko Digital. This and other anecdotal evidence suggests that Olympus SLRs are more popular in Poland, compared to other brands, than in the States. Perhaps the bang-for-the-z\u0142oty factor?\nThe E-30: expectations vs. reality. Last March I wrote a small article for the Olympus Circle Quest newsletter in the UK, outlining my expectations from the possibly upcoming Olympus mid-line SLR model. Frankly, I forgot about it since. Now the article has been posted at this site , and the bottom line is that the new camera has almost exactly the specs I hoped it to have \u2014 except, perhaps, some unique feature to make it stand out from other makers' models, crowding this market segment.\nDecember 21, 2008\nIn a few hours I'm taking off for Poland; back in the States on January 4. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, everybody!\nDecember 20, 2008\nSo, what was happening while I was out of circulation (very much up to yesterday, inclusive)? Well, not much, but at least two developments attracted my attention.\nThe Micro Four Thirds standard announced jointly by Olympus and Panasonic, promises to bring lens interoperability between non-SLR cameras by various manufacturers.\nThe standard defines the sensor size (same as in Four Thirds: 13\u00d717.3 mm) and lens mount interface (both mechanical and electronic). The sensor size, while close to that commonly used in most digital SLRs, is well above that common in non-SLRs (I mean: EVF models): there is a factor of about 2.3\u00d7 (linear) or 5.1\u00d7 (area) when compared to the popular 1/1.7\" sensor size used in better EVF cameras (some use even smaller sensors).\nBecause the standard aims at cameras without the swinging mirror in front of the sensor, the distance from the lens mount to the latter can be smaller than in the \"regular\" Four Thirds, and so (if not for these reasons) can be the diameter of the lens mount. This should lead to a line of EVF camera models smaller then the current Four Thirds SLRs, but providing a performance superior to that of the small-sensor EVFs.\nThis may sound attractive, but I am not so sure. Technical considerations aside, all depends on what cameras will now follow.\nAt this moment only Panasonic has a model out, the very capable G1 (full name: Lumix DMC-G1), with clearly the best electronic (SLR-like) viewfinder in the industry. I really like the controls (levers below dials) and the finder looks really good, but I'm still not quite convinced. Certainly, I dislike the fact that Panasonic decided to go with their own in-lens image stabilization system; this certainly reduces the lens interoperability.\nThen, the G1 is not that much smaller than the Olympus E-420 (but it has a swiveling screen). Oh, well, this is the first attempt, and I will not criticize a camera I haven't tried (although my criticism on image stabilization remains valid).\nOlympus has shown a Micro Four Thirds camera mock-up of an entirely different breed: brick-shaped, no viewfinder at all, except for the LCD screen. It is tiny and elegant, but not serious at all. Maybe as a last-chance backup to your SLR? Because, yes, the new standard will allow for use of the \"regular\" Four Thirds lenses, with an adapter. Not without caveats, though: most of the Olympus lenses in that standard do not provide contrast-detection autofocus used by the \u03bcFT cameras. Only the most recent ones (just five models, I believe, as of today) do. So OK, your older lenses are fine, but in manual focus only, hardly a thrill.\nThese are just my initial thoughts; I still have to do more research and thinking on this subject; more should follow when I know what to say. Still, this may be the beginning of the dawn of the SLR era, as predicted in my Quest article of 2005:\n[The] EVF-based cameras may soon provide, arguably, the best of both worlds: real-time viewing of a quality comparable with today's SLRs, with less mechanical complexity and at a lower cost. [...] EVF cameras may [...] soon dominate the middle segment of the market (advanced amateur), with SLRs withdrawing to the higher ground [...]\nAs much as I would hate to see this happen, this may be what is really coming next. We can run, but we can't hide...\nThe mid-line Olympus SLR has been announced, at long last. Olympus decided to name it E-30, like to stress that it has nothing in common with the E-10 and E-20 from a few years ago. Do I sound sarcastic? Maybe, but that's on purpose.\nThe E-30 should become available some time in January, but the specs are already well-known. The camera looks like an E-3 on a (mild) diet; gone is the magnesium alloy body and weatherproofing, but the E-30 retains all that was good in its predecessor, and throws in a few improvements (and I do not mean just raising the pixel count).\nGenerally, I like the E-30 a lot, and I'm thinking of getting one as soon as it becomes available \u2014 unless I discover something really horrid about it in the meantime.\nI'm glad I did not fall to the temptation of the E-520 which, after all, is almost the same as my trusty E-510 (which has proven itself again very nicely in the Arizona desert this October).\nAnyway, whatever information I could find out about the E-30 at the moment, plus my usual comments on what is good and what could be improved, can be found in Olympus E-30: Just a cheaper, smaller, lighter E-3? . As soon as I get this camera in January, I'll start on a full review, detailed and nitpicking as usual.\nOctober 12, 2008\nThree months ago I disappeared below the radar. This was just a necessity: my professional work had to take precedence, and there was more of it than I could handle (I did, though). I was touched by those of the Readers who worried about my well-being, and asked if I am fine. Thank you for caring. Yes, I am, just busy, but things are looking better now.\nNow, with the work pile-up gone, I will be emerging (slowly) from the backlog of email, also neglected during that time. I'm starting from a vacation trip to southern Arizona, originally planned for May or June, and then postponed multiple times. When back after October 22, things should be back to usual at this site \u2014 this is an activity I enjoy a lot, and I am not even considering giving it up. Until then...\nPicture of the Week (June 30): This guy checks my patio every half hour or so. When I work on my laptop, on the carpet next to the patio door, I keep a camera at hand, just in case. All it takes is peanuts.\nAnd yes, I really like this lens!\nLens: 70-300 mm F/4.0-5.6 ZD at 300 mm\nExposure: Aperture priority (-0.7 EV); 1/180 s at F/8, ISO 400.\nPostprocessing in Photo-Paint: very slight crop, some tonal adjustment and sharpening.\n(Click on the picture to see it in higher resolution.)\nJune 30, 2008\nThe new Olympus E-420 is already selling in the States, and its non-identical twin, the E-520 will be on store shelves any day now. I compiled the available information in an article discussing these two: The Generation of 2008 . The article focuses mainly on differences between both models, and the changes from the last year's Class of 2007 (E-410 and E-510).\nAfter having used the 50-500 mm Sigma lens for over a month, I can say I'm not thrilled with it. Yes, it can deliver reasonably sharp images (tripod or not), but the resolution isn't that great, and AF problems do not help. I prefer the \"budget\" 70-300 mm ZD at less than half the price (and at third of the weight). Yes, it has less reach, but it works just fine with the EC-14 (1.4\u00d7) teleconverter, bringing the long end to 420 mm at F/8, with better (!) autofocus and at least the same effective resolution. (Additionally, I can use the EC-14 with my 50 mm F/2.0 ZD, getting a nice 70 mm F/2.8.) The Bigma write-up is still waiting for inclusion and discussion of my image samples.\nMy desktop computer, which I use to store and process photographs, just died last Friday when the power line was hit by a lightning. While I hope to recover the contents of the hard drive, I'm quite happy that all back-ups on an external USB drive (more exactly, two such drives; I'm not taking any chances!) were up-to-date. Accidentally, just a few days earlier I ordered a new, quad-core desktop, so no real harm is done at all. Now, stop reading this and update your backups...\nMay 19, 2008\nA recent Olympus announcement included, in addition to the new E-520 (see below ), a new lens: the 9-18 mm F/4.0-5.6 ZD wide-angle. This is a significant development, as with this lens Olympus has the whole 9-300 mm (18-300 mm EFL) range covered with their \"economy\" lens line. (The previously announced Sigma 10-20 mm also became a reality recently.)\nThe basic specs of the new lens can be found in my updated Four Thirds lens list . While I do not expect it to compete optically with the outstanding 7-14 mm ZD , I hope for its performance to be as good as that of the 70-300 mm ZD \u2014 good enough for most of my applications, while selling for much less. The lens should become available in September, and then we will see if my hopes were justified.\nTrue, I would prefer this lens to start from 8 mm, but 9 mm (18 mm EFL) is nothing to sniff at: on 35-mm film the 20 mm focal length was my favorite for close-quarters architecture shots, and every extra millimeter (2 mm EFL!) adds cost, size, and complexity. Count me first in line to get this lens when it becomes available.\n(Promotional picture by Olympus)\nMay 17, 2008\nMark these dates: If you live within driving distance from suburban Maryland, do not miss the opportunity to see Don Reichle's photo exhibition. Don has been documenting historic landmarks of Maryland (Howard County, Ellicot City, Annapolis, Baltimore and other places) since 1968, and amassed a huge archive of photographs, spanning almost 40 years. I've spent many enjoyable hours going through Don's large-format prints, and I am sure you will not regret the trip.\nThe exhibition will last from May 29th to June 21st, open from 9 AM to 9 PM on weekdays, to 5 PM on Fridays, and to 2 PM on Saturdays. The location is Slayton House, 10400 Cross Fox Lane, Columbia, MD 21044. Some framed and/or matted pictures can be purchased on the spot, and you can meet the photographer at the opening reception on June 1, 3-5 PM. See you there.\nDon Reichle: Roddy Bridge in Frederic County, MD, 1973\nCopyright \u00a9 1973-2008 by Donald W. Reichle\nFor those interested in technical issues: having started from a 4\u00d75 camera and a Graflex with B&W film, Don moved into 35 mm with Exakta, Leica, Konica and Olympus, more recently going digital with Olympus E-1, E-330, E-510, and E-3 SLRs. He is a no-nonsense perfectionist, and does his own printing and matting. If you have any doubts whether the Four Thirds system is capable of exhibition-class results, just see for yourself \u2014 but also have a look at Don's original Kodalith prints from the Seventies, something you will not see anywhere else. (The Kodaliths are not a part of the show, but Don will have them on hand if you want to see them, and you should.)\nIf you need more details, Don can be reached at\nor 410-730-3987.\nThe new E-520. It is this time of the year again, and Olympus had to announce the \"new, improved\" (no sarcasm intended) version of their enthusiast-amateur SLR, following the bestselling E-510.\nThis is an incremental upgrade, very much like the E-420 was to the E-410. The LCD monitor is now a tad larger (5 mm more diagonally, albeit with the same resolution), the frame buffer capacity increased (now capable of holding eight raw images), and the camera can focus using contrast detection in the Live View mode. The sequential frame rate increased to 3.5 FPS (from 3), and the imaging pipeline underwent some minor tweaking; most other changes (unless I've missed something) are really of tertiary importance. The camera should be available before September.\n(Promotional picture by Olympus)\nFor the last few days I'm receiving one or two emails a day, asking for help in choosing between the new model and the \"old\" E-510, so here it is, as subjective as it may be: if the new model is within $150 or so from the old one (which may drop in price now), go for it; otherwise get the E-510.\nMay 6, 2008\nLast Saturday a friend loaned me a Sigma 50-500 mm F/4.0-6.3 DG lens, affectionately referred to as the Bigma. (This means my write-up in progress should get out of the limbo state quite soon.) As soon as we left home to try the Bigma out on Sunday morning, my wife spotted this green heron on a tree just twelve yards from our doorstep.\nThe bird was quite co-operative, listening to a teenager on the lake shore below, who was playing some old Stones songs on his ukulele (I'm not inventing this!), so I was able to squeeze out a few dozen of frames; this is the very first one.\nOlympus E-510, Sigma 50-500 mm F/4.0-6.3 ED at 500 mm; aperture priority (-0.3 EV): 1/800 s at F/6.s, ISO 400, WB at 5300\u00b0K. Postprocessed in Photo-Paint.\nThe Bigma (or any other lens of this focal length) is not for everyone: large and heavy, with a razor-thin depth of field at the long end, prone to camera shake; you really have to watch what you are doing. Still, it has the reach (1000 mm on a 35-mm film camera), and it can reward the effort. Out of fifty or so pictures shot in that session, about forty were sharp enough \u2014 and that's without image stabilization, which I just forgot to turn on.\nIn the coming days I will learn more about this lens by using it, mostly for wildlife shooting. In the meantime, however, my User Report on the 70-300 mm ED ZD is ready, with lots of image samples; have a look if you are interested in these focal lengths.\nApril 28, 2008\nIn case you're wondering: I'm still alive, if not updating this site as frequently as usual. Busy at work, but also taking pictures, with not much time left for writing.\nThe 70-300 mm F/4.0-5.6 ZD: I've got this lens two weeks ago and I'm very happy with it: better than I expected. A full report will follow, but I can already recommend it to anyone who needs this focal length range. Here is an example of what I'm getting out of it.\nE-510, 70-300 mm F/4.0-5.6 ZD at 300 mm. Aperture priority (-0.3 EV): 1/400 s at F/7.1, ISO 400; Natural Picture Mode with contrast and sharpness at -2. Postprocessed with Photo-Paint: 0.7\u00d7 crop, tonal adjustment, noise reduction with the Neat Image plugin.\nApril 4, 2008\nMy E-500IR has arrived. The infrared response and tonality are as expected: just excellent; the bad news is that the autofocus is way, way off with all lenses I've tried (I'm working on that now). My first impressions, findings, and samples can be found in the updated article .\nOlympus E-500IR (IR modification by LDP ), 14-45 mm F/3.5-5.6 at 14 mm. Aperture priority (-0.3 EV): 1/250 s at F/9.0, ISO 100. Postprocessed in Photo-Paint.\nApril 1, 2008\nBack in the States, back home. And my E-500IR should arrive within two days or so; I'm very excited to put it to use and to see how digital IR photography looks with no ifs and buts.\nThe trip to Poland was slow, lazy, and most enjoyable. I've got some nice pictures of my old hometown of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, to be shared with you next week or so.\nThe camera \u2014 or the person behind it? Many say that the latter is the limiting factor in pictures; now a major camera manufacturer seems to have understood that. Here is the exclusive full story on the Lumix FRT-1 by Panasonic, a camera which will make you a better photographer.\nMarch 21, 2008\nIt's this time of the year again. In a few hours I'll be taking Amtrak from BWI to Newark, NJ, for a red-eye flight to Warsaw, Poland. Back in Maryland next weekend, but in the meantime my email may get a bit clogged.\nThe E-500IR story: the first installment is out. I still have to send out the camera to LDP, which will be in the first days of April; then I will keep you updated.\nI just bought a Panasonic FZ-18 for a friend in Poland. The poor man stubbornly insisted on a super-zoom camera, and no amount of persuasion would deter him (and believe me, I tried). After a few days with it, I stick to my guns. While this seems to be the best model in that class, the class itself stinks to heavens \u2014 from almost every angle. While I wasn't thrilled with the lamented Olympus C-8080Z, that is still a camera to match in the EVF category. And, yes, my five-years old C-5050Z runs circles around the FZ-18 in terms of image quality.\nFor a while I was thinking about writing a small review of this camera, but this is not worth the effort. Too much time which I can spend doing other stuff.\nWindows Vista got a facelift: Service Pack 1, released last Monday. I just installed it; the good news is that the upgrade does not reset all the tweaks I had to introduce to make this OS usable. So far so good; for the last two months I was running SP1 Beta anyway. No, no surprises; this is still Vista.\nI have also got the MS Internet Explorer 8, beta version. While I use Opera as my working browser, I always check how my Web pages are rendered on the MSIE (and on the Firefox ).\nIt took me 20 minutes to confirm that some old bugs (or \"non-standard features\") sill persist in the Explorer 8, with all the hoopla Microsoft is making about following the standards. For example, the bug causing my and icons to be rendered in a wrong place when the link text spans two lines, is still there.\nNo, I'm not going to work around this particular problem (and there is no simple work-around except for inserting the images by hand in all places). If you want to see these pages the right way, just get a real browser.\nHappy Easter, everyone!\nMarch 16, 2008\nMore on infrared: lots of activity here. First, a posting of my December Quest article: Digital Infrared; waiting for a B&W IR camera . Well, even with the new Fuji IS Pro and IS-1 the wait is not quite over until someone gets rid of the Bayer mosaic; read the article for more.\nSecond, I have collected the results of my research and deliberations on infrared SLR modifications into a new article: Digital SLRs for Infrared Photography . This is, in a sense, a follow-up to the other article, and it may be educational, even if you are not planning to convert one of your cameras (not yet).\nThird, Mr. Dan Llevellyn of LDP (or MaxMax.com ) kindly answered some of my questions regarding IR modifications of Olympus SLRs. Yes, they do the E-500 and E-510; no, they do not do the E-330; and, regretfully, no word on other models, including the E-1 and E-300.\nI have already decided to give my E-500 a second career as an IR-only camera, and I will send it to LDP as soon as I'm back from my Easter break in Poland. Then I will keep you updated.\nSite cleanup. From time to time I receive emails from those who would like to view this site in larger fonts. Or in smaller fonts. Or in sans-serif. Obviously, with various display sizes, operating systems, local font size settings, and Web browsers out there, not to mention personal preferences, it is difficult to please all.\nNot really. I just wrote a short script detecting your browser window size and adjusting the font accordingly. This should work for most users, as larger screens usually need larger fonts. Also, in small sizes sans-serifs tend to be more readable, while the opposite holds at larger ones, so this is also accounted for.\nTo give you an extra choice, I'm also providing a small page for font setting , accessible by the site map at the bottom of every page. From there you can tweak the settings yourself. For that to work, your browser must run JavaScript (not Java!) and accept cookies from the wrotniak.net domain.\nThis is an exception I had to make to my no-cookie policy, as the task is impossible without cookies providing persistency of settings.\nOnce set, your preferences will be remembered on a given computer and browser, and used every time you visit here. I hope you will find this useful.\nIn another refinement, many manufacturer's product shots in various articles have been replaced with those of better quality, usually linking to larger versions, like this one .\nMarch 9, 2008\nHaving a free weekend (no more E-3 this week, this can wait!), I decided to try the new Version X4 (this is 14, for sane people) of Corel Photo-Paint, the program with which I have a long love-and-hate relationship. This needs some challenge, so I chose to postprocess the oldest digitized photographs in my archives: those shot back in 1970 in Moscow (my first trip out of Poland, first flight, and first encounter with the Evil Empire).\nThese were shot with the Soviet Start SLR, a workhorse of a camera (still working!) on the East-German ORWO slide film, home-processed. In 1995 the slides were badly faded, so I had them scanned to the Kodak Photo CD (six megapixels); then for another thirteen years the CDs were gathering dust.\nTo give you an idea of the challenge, here is a Photo CD scan, converted into a JPEG, downsized, and slightly re-sharpened. Click at the image on the left to see the final result, in the same pixel size. Not too shabby.\nSurprisingly, the Image Adjustment Lab, a feature I never use with my digital-camera images, performed nicely in this application. In most cases, Auto Adjust would bring the image to a decent shape, needing only minor tonality and color adjustments (on the other hand, with other slides from the same era, the results were very bad).\nThe grain in the ISO 64 film was horrendous, especially in sky areas. ISO 800 on my E-510 (or ISO 1600 on the E-3) is way better; just no contest. In all frames I had to resort to the Neat Image plugin, which has proven itself quite well. But the most time-consuming task was removing hundreds of dark specks \u2014 maybe dust stuck to emulsion, maybe impurities in tap water used to prepare the chemicals.\nThe bottom line: while I wouldn't dare to print the results at 10\u00d715\" or larger, they can be quite presentable at 8\u00d712\" or less; a result worth the effort. If you have some memories stored on a Kodachrome (or, especially, Ektachrome) film, do not delay, have them scanned now. In a few years it may be too late.\nSome results of this session can be found in my Moscow Gallery ; I hope you will enjoy this trip in space and time.\nAnd what about the new version of the Photo-Paint, you will ask? Well, there are very few changes from the previous Version X3, for most users not justifying the $200 upgrade price. Some minor features have been added; some minor bugs fixed; many small but irritating bugs and inconsistencies still remain, unchanged since at least Version 9. Generally, the program performs well; as much as I complain about it, I still have to find something better for my needs (yes, I've tried them all, including the latest Picture Window).\nThe most irritating thing about Photo-Paint is how Corel sells it: only as a part of the $400 Corel Draw suite, take it or leave it. No wonder most photographers choose the latter option, having no use for Corel Draw itself or Corel Trace. I am not surprised seeing no other Photo-Paint users among fellow photographers: after all, Corel does everything to keep the program from selling. And this the thing they do best.\nMarch 5, 2008\nThe Olympus E-420 just hit the fan, or, more exactly, its press release did. Definitely, these days you've got to have a new model every year. So what's new compared to the E-410?\nLarger LCD monitor of 2.7\" (a difference of 5 mm diagonally), albeit with unchanged resolution;\nCompatibility with wireless \"R\" flashes (like E-3);\nAutofocusing with the image sensor in Live Preview (instead of, or in a sequence with the regular AF);\nFace detection technology (\"crystal clear for amazing portraits\", no, I'm not inventing this!), in Live View;\nShadow Adjustment (similar to Auto gradation in the E-3?);\nSequential shooting at 3.5 FPS (0.5 FPS improvement);\nChanged shape of the hand grip.\n(Image \u00a9 by Olympus)\nIt is hinted (if not explicitly stated) that the new camera has a sensor and imaging pipeline evolved in the direction of the flagship E-3. This, if true, could be actually the biggest difference.\nThe press release also mentions some other improvements, but these are the normal marketing blurb. I'm glad to see that this looks like an evolutionary upgrade, without starting from scratch again. The E-410 is a small delight by itself, and its successor should be even better in a few areas.\n(Image \u00a9 by Olympus)\nIn a quite unexpected development, Olympus also announced a new lens: the compact 25 mm F/2.8 ZD, measuring only 24 mm in length. This lens did not figure in the Olympus lens roadmap . (See my lens chart for details.)\nThe lens brochure says it is \"meticulously crafted from aspherical glass\". Whoever writes things like that should be sent for two months to clean the toilets at Olympus optical facilities, just to get more familiarity with the subject.\nThe camera is expected to become available in May at a street price of $500 (body), $600 (with the 14-42 mm F/3.5-5.6 ZD) or $700 (with the new 25 mm lens).\nDigital Camera Resource posted the full press release with extra illustrations, and the E-410 Preview at Imaging Resource contains quite a detailed description (seemingly based on Olympus promotional materials, not a pre-production camera). Last but not least, Popular Photography posted a small Hands-On Report , too. You may also browse the E-420 section of the Olympus site.\nNews from this site: my User Report on the 12-60 mm F/2.8-4.0 ZD zoom is out. It is among lenses what my wife is among women: as close to perfect as they come. Read the full text for more (about the lens, that is).\nMarch 2, 2008\nThe traffic here increased in the last month: from about 2400 unique visitors a day in January (typical for the past year), to 3600 per day in February. This may be related to the recent articles concerning the Olympus E-3.\nLuckily, the good people at PowWeb (who are hosting this domain) have increased my bandwidth allocation (and storage, too) to more than I can ever use, without even telling me. A nice surprise. This is a good hosting company: I send them a check once a year and that's the whole interaction we have: things just keep working. Do not feel guilty downloading all those full-size samples; all this site costs me is less than a dinner for two: $93.24 each year. Plus time.\nAnother E-3 installment: E-3 Image Samples, Part 2 . Most of these were shot under overcast weather. The next thing in line will be comparison of colors at various WB and saturation settings, coming in a week or so.\nOn image stabilization: your camera proudly sports an IS sticker (things without a sticker do not count). You are getting pictures without blur at 1/40 s with a 50 mm lens. Well, that's a 100 mm \"equivalent\", therefore IS brings a 2.5\u00d7 improvement, not bad! Then you notice that you forgot to turn image stabilization on. Oops. Looks like the factor of 2.5\u00d7 is the magic effect of the sticker alone... Maybe I should patent that. For the time being, I've put a note on this into the E-3 IS article . (2009: The note has ben moved here .)\nE-500IR? I'm considering a conversion of my E-500 (not used much now, anyway) into an infrared-only camera, with the a dramatic gain in shutter speeds (a factor of 1000\u00d7) and usable viewfinder. Presently I am awaiting some answers from a company doing such conversions. In the meantime, I've added a\non IR-enabled cameras to IR Photography with Your Digital Camera .\nGeneral news: According to the British Amateur Photographer, Leica announced an upgrade path to the M8, which will make this camera use a 24\u00d736 mm sensor (currently: 18\u00d727 mm). The first day of April is still far away, so this must be serious. I would expect that upgrading your existing M8 will cost $2500 or more, but the development makes perfect sense: the existing wide-angle lenses will become wide-angle again, and if you've invested $15,000 in Leica glass, you do not want to be stuck with film for the rest of your days.\nIn a possibly related development, the Leica Camera chief executive officer, who made this statement, received a pink slip just two weeks later. Keep guessing.\nDo not worry: your Four Thirds or APS-C system will not become obsolete, at least not because the \"full frame\" is coming back; in this round that standard will compete against medium-format cameras.\nI've used quotes here, as the real full frame is the 18\u00d724 cm plate camera format \u2014 not the tiny 24\u00d736 mm one (with a 7\u00d7 crop factor), which will never be useful for serious purposes because of its inherently large noise, too much depth of field, and significant lens diffraction at F/64 and beyond.\nFebruary 29, 2008\nOther camera setup articles updated:, To improve readability, I've split my E-5x0 customization article into two: one dealing with the E-510/E-410 , and another \u2014 with the E-500 (the camera still has many happy users, judging from my email flow). Back to square one: that's how the article started. Both pieces share 70% or so of text, but they are more compact and easier to follow now. At the same time, both were also updated and cleaned up.\nFebruary 28, 2008\nMaking the E-3 Work Your Way \u2014 yes, I'm done with the first version of the article on customizing that camera. As there are about 100 items you can set to your liking, the article is quite large. I am also sure it contains some errors and omissions, but with the usual help I'm getting from the Readers, this will be cleaned up in a few weeks.\nThe next installment on the E-3 will be the second part of general-character samples from that camera.\nMy personal numeracy crusade: Over the last week I found four (!) camera reviews mentioning a \"steep learning curve\" of this or that model. Judging from the context I think the authors meant something exactly opposite.\nA learning curve shows the progress (how much you have learned) along the y-axis versus the effort (how much work or time you've put into it) on the x-axis.\nLet us compare two learning curves. The green, steeper one shows the subject was learned effectively in two days or so; the red one (less steep) \u2014 in four days. A \"steep learning curve\" means fast learning process, contrary to what most of the people using this phrase mean.\nBut then, a sentence \"using this camera is hard to learn\" does not sound as professional as \"this camera involves a steep learning curve\", even if it reflects what the writer meant.\nFebruary 25, 2008\nAnother new article: Noise Filtering, Sharpness, and high ISOs in the E-3 ; the title should be self-explanatory. The piece includes more than 150 samples comparing the results at various combinations of these three factors. More E-3 stuff coming this weekend.\nFebruary 15, 2008\nHaving found some spare time to process the gathered data, I can now present the results of my E-3 image stabilization test . Using the procedure originally developed for the E-510, I've checked the new camera at focal lengths of 12, 60, and 150 mm. The IS advantage turned out to be\n1, 1.5, and 2.4 EV\n, respectively, which is within measurement errors the same as for the E-510. My suspicion of the 2-5 EV claim turned out to be justified.\nA few minor updates to the E-3 review , to account for the IS test results, and to clarify the situation with camera's weatherproofing.\nFebruary 9, 2008\nThe full Olympus E-3 review has been posted, and the First Look updated. The next step will be Part 2 of the samples, and a report on noise filtering and image sharpening in this camera; I hope to have one of those by the next weekend.\nFebruary 4, 2008\nNew (?) Sigma lenses. Sigma just announced the pending release of two more lenses in the Four Thirds mount: the 10-20 mm F/4-5.6 EX DC HSM and the 70-200 mm F/2.8 Apo II EX DG Macro HSM (these names read like those of Spanish aristocracy from a few hundred years ago!). The first one will become the second-widest rectilinear zoom for Olympus SLRs (after the excellent, and quite costly, 7-14 mm ZD ), while the second seems to be a direct competitor to the newly-available 50-200 mm F/2.8-3.5 ZD ED SWD by Olympus.\nNote that \"DG\" in a Sigma lens name means that this is actually a full-frame 35-mm film design, adapted to digital format (mostly by somewhat improved multicoating), while \"DC\" denotes a digital-specific design, covering only (and optimized for) the APS-C frame, just a tad bigger than the Four Thirds one. A rough guess is that DG lenses of focal lengths above 50 mm or so may be good enough for the higher resolutions required by the smaller digital image, but doubts remain about wider DG designs, which were optimized for an entirely different purpose; at shorter focal lengths I would trust only DC lenses.\nThis was one of the reasons my Four Thirds lens list had to be updated (plus some cleanup and new links to manufacturers' data). At present the list includes thirty \"current\" lenses, plus four to be released (including these two), and four more replaced with newer ones.\nMore \"progress\" on the xD-Picture front? Olympus issued a quite hilarious press release announcing the new xD-Picture \"M+\" type card. The new type will be about 50% slower than the \"H\" type (pulled off the market last year for no known reason), and capacities are expected up to 2 GB (the \"H\" type announcement of 2006 was promising sizes up to 8 GB). What is so hilarious, is that the press release presents this an as achievement.\nSeriously, the xD format should be long ago put out of its misery. All it offers is higher profit margins. My card-writing tests with the E-3 show that an xD \"H\" card is about three times slower than a SanDisk Extreme IV, a quite unimpressive performance. One of the reasons is that the xD design (at least for the \"M\" type) is based on multi-level memory cells (where one cell stores not one bit of information as two different states, but two bits as four states); slower and more error-prone, but cheaper than the two-level solution.\nInterestingly, you can also find multi-level Compact Flash cards; a 4 GB card of that type costs about a third of the price of a two-level card from the same manufacturer (Transcend) \u2014 less than twenty dollars (which is still a bargain, if you accept the caveats).\nThe full E-3 review is steadily progressing; about 50% of text is done, plus most illustrations and samples. Perhaps another week before it becomes presentable. In the meantime, read the huge and informative E-3 on Test article by my British friend, John Foster, posted on his site.\nIn any case, a man should have at least two things in life: a beautiful and caring wife, and a good, all-purpose lens. The first I already have; now I only need to get the 12-60 mm ZD.\nJanuary 31, 2008\nThe first batch of E-3 image samples is ready online. Some of them were shot, within minutes and from the same vantage point, with the two upscale \"kit\" lenses offered by Olympus: the older 14-54 mm F/2.8-3.5 ZD, and the newer 12-60 mm F/2.8-4.0 ZD. I have no doubt now that the new lens consistently outperforms the older one (which is already so good!), especially off-center, in spite of having a wider zoom range. Another question is whether this difference will be visible in less than 1:1 pixel scale, e.g., in reasonably-sized (12\u00d716\" or 30\u00d740 cm) prints.\nIf in doubt, feel free to grab some of my full-frame images posted in that article, print them (or have them printed online if a larger size is what you need), and then decide for yourself if the improvement (in addition to the extra 2 mm at the short end) is worth an extra $500.\nMy Four Thirds DoF tables have been recomputed (easy, as I wrote a program which generates a formatted HTML page with results), to include a number of new focal lengths; most notably 7 and 12 mm.\nI still have a ton of E-3 stuff to push out of the shop, so watch this space. In the meantime, my email backlog shrunk to less than two weeks; maybe this is not a losing battle?\nC-5060WZ users: the updated mode dial article now contains a PDF article, written by a German reader, on how you can fix the infamous problem itself, without paying Olympus $200 or more for repair. This camera has still lots of life left in it. Can you imagine that it still goes at the asking price between $350 and $650? Why did Olympus pull the plug on this line?\nJanuary 30, 2008\nOlympus E-3: The First (and Second) Look has just been posted, if in an early, draft version. This has been (and still is) a very busy time; so far I've shot about 1500 frames with this camera, and I think I've got some idea about it; enough to share with you.\nThe samples, at least basic ones, are also ready for formatting and a second-look scrutiny; this will take a few more days. I'm also planning at least four more related pieces: a full, detailed review, a piece on the suspected front-focus problem (already briefly discussed in the posted article), a quantitative analysis of image stabilization, and a comparison of noise reduction versus sharpening setting combinations. At least these are the pieces for which I've already collected the raw material, and which await only analysis and write-up. Only? Remember that I can work on this only on evenings and weekends, having a full-time job in a company suffering from shortage of cheap labor.\nKindness of strangers: In addition to Don, whose E-3 I'm torturing now, two other Readers offered me the use of their E-3's for the same purpose. For that I feel grateful, and flattered. (Thanks also for the collection initiative, you know who you are, but this I couldn't accept for a number of reasons. Still, same feeling.)\nFirmware updates: Both the E-3 and E-1 received new firmware versions yesterday. In both cases, the most visible change is allowing for use of image stabilization with legacy (i.e., non-Four-Thirds) lenses, and some users seem to be ecstatic. I've also dragged outside the E-3, and later, the E-510, equipped with a four-pound (more exactly: 1.7 kg) 300 mm Zeiss Sonnar, to see how this works, but no conclusion yet; at 1/150 s I've got all samples almost equally sharp \u2014 or rather unsharp, because of focus problems. Oh, well, I'll do better next time, soon.\nI might have been the only person who complained (at least publicly) about the misbehavior of the live histogram function in the E-510 under low light conditions. Lo and behold, the new firmware fixed the problem; the histogram seems to behave in a predictable fashion. (It is still acting up with Live View Boost enabled, but this I can, at least, understand and ignore: just don't use the boost.) I don't even know if the E-3 suffered from the same problem, as I was only planning to check that; with the current firmware it seems to be OK (with the same caveat). This fix is not even mentioned by Olympus, at least not in the U.S.\nWell, one day Olympus may even consider an option to upgrade the firmware without going thorough the Olympus Master or Studio, which would be very right thing to do. Let's not abandon hopes. At lest this time I was able to get to their server on the first attempt...\nIt is after 3 AM; some sleep would be nice...\nJanuary 20, 2008\nBack in Maryland, after a long and lazy Christmas break in Poland. Happy New Year!\nMy new Asus U6S laptop is performing nicely, thank you: it runs my air traffic applications 30% faster than my desktop computer, which uses an Athlon XP 3000+ processor from just a few years ago. And these applications do not even take any advantage of two processor cores! Being able to turn off most of the Vista \"improvements\" (shadow copy, quick search/indexing, and User Account Control to start with), I can use it almost as I've used Windows XP, if with a few irritating quirks and sporadic loss of wireless connectivity for no apparent reason: some days not at all, and some days every few minutes.\nI'm catching up with the email backlog, now handling messages from December. I'm responding to all legitimate emails, even those asking \"How can you claim that a cheap plastic E-510 with a tunnel vision viewfinder and highlight clipping can compete with ***\" (fill in your favorite brand here), although with this kind I'm slowly losing patience.\nThe E-3 is the subject of many emails I'm receiving: will I put this camera through its paces, and if, when will the write-up be posted? With no more than a brief session with the camera, I wasn't planning to do that; then a fellow photographer living nearby kindly offered to let me use his E-3 with the 12-60 mm F/2.8-4.0 ZD lens for a couple of weeks. Could I refuse that? (Thank you, Don!)\nHere I'm braving the sub-freezing temperatures today, shooting some comparative samples against the E-510 with the 14-54 mm ZD lens. No, I'm not sharing any impressions yet; expect a first draft in a week or so...\n(Photo by Ann Lipinski: Olympus E-410, program exposure at ISO 100; tonally adjusted and strongly cropped.)\nDon is also an experienced photographer and a master printer/framer; he treated me to some of his Kodalith prints of Maryland landmarks, shot about forty years ago, and impressed the you-know-what out of me; the best collection of Maryland historic photos I've ever seen. Currently he is using an E-1, E-330, E-510 and an E-3 (not for a while!), and his results are as good as mine will be in 10-12 years \u2014 if I work really hard. Stay tuned, this is not the last time you've heard of the man...\nOn the software front, I've decided to part with another $90, and upgraded to the new version of the ACDSee Pro . I've been living with earlier versions of this image management software since mid-Nineties, and, as much as I'm complaining about it, I keep coming back. (Yes, I've tried hard to like the Adobe Lightroom and some other similar applications, to no avail.) ACDSee is still the most responsive image browser/cataloger I've tried, more capable than the free Irfan View, and faster than the Fast Stone. (The latter is quite polished and capable, but a bit slow and limited; still a good choice if you are on a budget and willing to click through donation requests. I'll be watching this application closely.)\nThe good news about the new ACDSee is that it includes raw development for the Olympus ORF format. While I rarely resort to saving raw images, some people may find this of interest, especially that the feature seems to be nicely implemented, and with a wide range of adjustments.\nJust for the bragging rights: I forgot to mention that one of my pictures ended up as a two-page spread in the Wild Fibers magazine (\"wool around the world\"), illustrating a piece on the Polish Shepherd dog. This is a picture of Mt. Swinica in the Tatra mountains, shown in my Tatra gallery . It was shot back in 2000 with my first usable digital camera, the three-megapixel Olympus C-3000Z (which is still serving a friend).\n(The photo of the magazine: Olympus E-3 with the 12-60 mm ZD lens, built-in flash, aperture priority.)\nAnother Quest article, Leica M8: An Instant Classic \u2014 even if the M8 did not become an overnight hit, it might have affected digital camera development in more than one way.

Let\u2019s see them.\nPortrait by FurSid\nOriginal Image\nTechnical Aspects\nTechnically, this portrait is almost perfect. If I look carefully at the details in full view, I might say that the upper right eye is too dark and looses details. Exposure looks fine, kind of at the limit in the mustache area because of the strong contrast, which, otherwise, is good for the details and pops out the man\u2019s expression. The main focus point is well placed on the eyes of the subject. Composition is very good.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe expression captured gives a very deep feeling and the sepia toning adds alot to it. Congratulations for such a pleasant portrait!\nSpring time in the Mountains by Tudor\nTechnical Aspects\nThe image is well focused, with a proper DOF. However, the post processing resulted into some burned areas. Better pay attention at that. Composition is great: not just the right positioning of the flower, but also the slight radial feeling given by the grass adds to it.\nVisual Aesthetics\nUnlike classical spring interpretation, your\u2019s is full of mystery. I sense that the flowers from the dark side of the picture are still \u201cfrozen\u201d in the remains of the winter, while the other flower, the one that rises into the light, is the symbol of the spring yet to come. The vignetting looks good on this picture.\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com?

Let\u2019s see them.\nSky reflection by Guillaume Lagace\nTechnical Aspects\nThere is a good sharpness that fits the transparency of the calm water. The blue color looks very natural. Some details over the rocks are visible and the contrast is good. About the composition, the image is well equilibrated with the lines formed by the rocks and the cloud reflexion.\nVisual Aesthetics\nIt\u2019s nice that you captured both sky reflection + see-through water on the same picture, but here\u2019s a tip that will always work: try using a wide lens to catch more objects in the picture (like some mountain, forest, house, bout), otherwise the picture seems like an empty scene that doesn\u2019t tell much.\nDoug Dsmil\nTechnical Aspects\nThe lighting used for this shot comes from both back and front of the model. The back one is not necessary but it gives a special radiant mood that draws attention. The shape of the female model is nicely visible under the scarf, and, also regarding the scarf, it adds to the composition. The skin has a nice tone and it looks like it has been softly retouched. The technical skills used for this shot are definitely at high level.\nVisual Aesthetics\nI like the curve line formed by the scarf, I like the colors and the vibrant mood created by the back light. There is one thought I have in mind about this picture: instead of the few hair that is strongly visible because of the back light, I would have asked the model to show all the hair. This would have also filled out the frame more.\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com?

Let\u2019s see them.\nBoredom by Alex Watson\nTechnical Aspects\nUnfortunately, in this photograph, the subject is not well focused. There is also a high lack of contrast. This kind of shot would have been better with a stronger lateral light and a black background.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe image clearly creates a special mood, but I would associate this mood with fear rather than boredom. Behind the mask there is an angry look. This look should be more visible \u2013 like there is a need for more details in the eye area.\nEntra la Luz by Rodrigo Melgarejo\nTechnical Aspects\nThe image may not respect any traditional rules, but I still find it correctly done. The are sufficient details even if the light is powerful. There is a good contrast and sharpness. Nicely done.\nVisual Aesthetics\nI must say I love this photo. It\u2019s very peaceful and it gives me a relaxant mood, full of hope for better days that are up to come. This mood is not only transmitted by the incoming light, but also by the warm light colors. I do find a bit distracting the fact that there a two different kind of curtains at the window.\nJoey by Christine Eaton\nTechnical Aspects\nThere is a very pleasant lighting which combined with the DOF, clearly separates the subject from the behind scene. There is a nice diagonal composition and it is a very clear way of capturing the subject with all representative details (from the light in his eyes to the details of the guitar). There is a very good quality of the image in matter of colors, sharpness; even in high resolution there is no sign of noise or aberrations. Good exposure also.\nVisual Aesthetics\nYour model made a good pose. Everything looks natural and I really like this photograph. Keep it up so Christine!\nJack Baker\u2019s edited photo of his wife\nTechnical Aspects\nThe technique you applied here is called selective colors. You did it well. There are no soft colored edges, the delimitation between the yellow flower and the black and white grass is clear and sharp. If you look closely, you can see some green grass over the yellow flower at the right.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe composition is simple and brings nothing special but it\u2019s an OK photo. The number 3 is a good number to appear in a photograph. Also, I like this idea that comes in my mind while looking at the photo: a colorful spring comes out from beneath the frozen dead leaves. There is a powerful yellow on this image.\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com?

Let\u2019s see a part of them, and the others next week.\nIeva Milti\u00c5\u2020a\nTechnical Aspects\nTechnically, this image has some problems. The most obvious one is the overexposure. It seems to be a very bright sun in that day, and one step underexposure would have helped. The other aspect is the lack of sharpness. The image is kind of too soft and when about portraits, I prefer to see the face details nicely sharped.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe warm tones and the clothes make me believe this is a portrait shot in autumn. I like this warm autumn mood. There is a vertical shadow on the wall behind the girl. I suggest to photoshop that since it is a bit distracting. Otherwise, I like the combined background (wall + trees) \u2013 it popes out the subject. Also, she has one hand rising out of the frame \u2013 you can still correct this by cropping the picture from the bottom.\nTechnical Aspects\nThere is a perfect timing in this shot and a good focus. However, I believe the subject is too centered. I would have followed the rule of thirds for this situation. Exposure is good in this case.\nVisual Aesthetics\nFor a better approach to a perfect still life photo, you could have improvised a white background, or a light blue one, anyway, some uniform color. A uniform color behind the scene would have pop out the subject, making a big impact on the viewer. The color of the fruit looks very natural which is a very good thing for my taste in matter of photography.\nWilliam Hamilton\nTechnical Aspects\nThe image has a very good sharpness and black and white contrast. I believe that there are no technical problems within this image. Even if you pushed the B&W contrast at hight limits, there are no overexposed or underexposed areas. The sky looks pretty dark which makes me believe you used a polarizer: good so!\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe composition itself is not bad, but there is a big amount of the sky that is useless in this picture. You can crop it to a panoramic-like frame. Thinking about the panoramic view, it would have been a good idea to include the entire tree at the right within the frame. I like very much the subject of this photo: it\u2019s catching, story-telling.\nRyan Holloway\nTechnical Aspects\nFor this kind of photography (abstract patterns and textures), the are no difficult technical requirements. Exposure and contrast are OK. I\u2019m not really understanding where this was taken, what this really is, but the composition is quite catching.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe yellow gives a psychedelic mood. I first tried a high contrast black and white version, but then I noticed that with B&W it looses the 3D perspective. The approach of some objects and the far objects not only give the idea of 3D, but I also feel some speed in my blood hurrying to get to the end of the dotted tunnel (you title \u201ctrip\u201d fits). The are 3 white objects that I\u2019m not sure they match here.\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com? Send your image at laurentia.fr[at]gmail.com and next week your photo will be commented here.\nIn this second week of \u201cphoto critique\u201d I received 3 wonderful images. Let\u2019s see them.\nIeva Milti\u00c5\u2020a\nTechnical Aspects\nThis is an instant portrait with a good natural lighting. I would have preferred a more shallow DOF. The fingers are out of the photograph so this not technically correct. Everything else (contrast, colors, white balance, sharpness) is ok. I notice some warm tones over the image but I like this. The image looks sharp, which is important from my point of view. White balance is good: the white is neither bluish nor yellowish.\nVisual Aesthetics\nIt\u2019s important for an image to be quick, instant, natural, but in this case, the position of the mouth is not exactly a pleasant one. I notice that the pattern of her clothes goes well with the pattern formed by the windows at the back. The message transmitted by the image is clear: the morning cigarette on the balcony (or something like that). The eyes look beautyfull and every detail on the face of the model look very good.\nTechnical Aspects\nThis second portrait is much better in my opinion. I am very pleased with the composition, sharpness and DOF.\nVisual Aesthetics\nI love this natural smile, I love the coloring, the tones, the softness of the image in overall and the sharpness over the eyes. It really catches me. What I don\u2019t like is the position of the watermark. It\u2019s disturbing and I would have rather placed it in some corner. This image is worth to be featured in some magazine.\nThe other 2 images will be commented next week.\nAdri\u00e1n Mih\u00e1lko\nTechnical Aspects\nEven if there is an obvious underexposure, this image is a good example of exception from the rules. I noticed, in the high resolution image, that there is no noise but some pixelation in the shadows area, probably because there was some noise reduction applied. Nothing wrong with that \u2013 it\u2019s not very visible. The image is rather soft than sharp but in this case it\u2019s the right thing for entering the atmosphere of love.\nVisual Aesthetics\nKudos for making a creative picture! Originality is much appreciated. The image creates a special mood and I\u2019m sure this will make a great gift for someone special. I like the idea that the light forms a hearth while entering the darkness. Maybe you can consider duo-toning the image since there are some green and blue pixels there that don\u2019t make much sens. Great job!\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com? Send your image at laurentia.fr[at]gmail.com and next week your photo will be commented here.\nIn this first week of \u201cphoto critique\u201d I received 2 wonderful images. Let\u2019s see them.\nAlexander Artemenko\nOriginal Image\nTechnical Aspects\nThe image looks sharp, which is important from my point of view. White balance is good: the white is neither bluish nor yellowish. Everything is focused like a landscape should be. There are no overexposed areas, neither underexposed: every detail is visible. There is no visible noise (anyway, in this case, noise might have actually added to the mood of the scene). In other words, technically, this image is perfect.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe composition is just great: a perfect golden triangle. The scene is eye-catching: you got the wagon, a dramatic sky, snow over the railway. The perspective is somehow common but I can\u2019t figure any better one for this scene. This image has a very dramatic look, which is a very good thing. The dramatic feeling can pop out even more by giving the picture more contrast over the levels adjustment, and then convert it to sepia. But the natural colors of this original image are nice too. There is one element in the picture that I might have removed it with clone and healing brush: the crane over the wagon. Overall, I like this dramatic shot! Keep it so!\nRick Veazey\nMade with: Pentax K10D. Pentax DA* 50-135 f2.8 lens at f2.8 1/1000th sec shutter speed. ISO 800.\nTechnical Aspects\nIt\u2019s a very good shutter speed you used there: neither the players nor the ball have motion blur. Even if ISO800 is not a low level of sensitivity, there is no visible noise so this is another bonus. I relay like the DOF: not too narrow to completely blur out the tribune, neither too large to make the busy background distract from the main players. White balance, colors and contrast look just fine.\nVisual Aesthetics\nThe first thing I noticed about your image is that you really pushed the shutter at the right time: you got the player in a nice twisted position and you also got the ball in the scene. It would have been even better if you could catch this scene from the opposite position to surprise the player looking more toward you and the viewers of the photograph. However, there is one little thing that disturbs me: the second player is not completely inside the picture. I suppose you were very concentrated on the standing player and the ball and had to be quick to do not miss the opportunity, so you did not have the time to properly compose the picture with the other one inside the frame. Overall it\u2019s a very good sports shot! Congrats!\nDo you want your photo to receive a critique at photoaxe.com?

When <em>I</em> set this up on my Slik, it rattled like straw in the wind.", "explanation": null, "document": "In Praise of Cheap Compact Tripods\nby Ross Alford, 1996\nTweet\nI have several tripods, from a 12-pound monster, through a Manfrotto (Bogen in USA) 190, to three lightweight Sliks. The monster never moves from the lab, the Manfrotto goes on short hikes, but the Sliks really travel well. I recently carried a Slik 38T4 around for 2 weeks in Papua New Guinea, taking photos in rainforests.\nThe legs are 4 sections, with those damned annoying (but quite firm when locked) twist collars to lock them open or closed or at any intermediate position. With legs fully extended but no centre column extension, the camera platform is 31 inches above the substrate, and the tripod really is *very* solid, at least with a camera of moderate weight on it-- heavy enough to act as an anchor, but not so heavy that the head has trouble coping. With the centre column extended, the camera platform is 38 and 3/4\" above the substrate, but less steady.\nIts head isn't nearly equal to a Manfrotto or Linhof, but it was cheap, and it's easy to carry around. It collapses to 13-3/4\" long and about 3\" across when folded as compactly as possible. It weighs about 19 ounces. It fits nicely into a daypack-type backpack or photo backpack.\nIt held the camera steady for lots of 1/8 to 1 or more second exposures, including being set up in the middle of streams . The camera was a Nikon FE2, BTW, with a 17mm F/3.5 Vivitar lens dated about 1980.\nI have also used the Sliks with a 6 X 9 Crown Graphic, which is pretty lightweight for a medium format camera, and they'll do in a pinch.\nThe 38T4 cost me $A45, and I have seen it advertised by New York camera places for about $US 25. One thing worth noting--the head rotates and tilts back and forth, but does not tilt from side to side; it is really set up more like a movie panhead. I haven't found that this is a big problem; I just either loosen the tripod screw and rotate the camera a bit for fine adjustments, or mount it 90 degrees from the normal direction and tilt if I want to take a vertical shot. Slik does make similar tripods with heads that allow sideways tilts, using a mechanism that I have always thought looks a bit weak, but I don't know what the model numbers are.\nIf the 38T4 is too large for you, I have seen even smaller ones by Slik of very similar design and construction, but they are even shorter when fully extended. I find the more-or-less waist height of the 38T4 to be perfectly usable for most things, but I don't think I'd want one that was much shorter.\nI also have a model 800G FL, which is larger, has flip-locks on its three-section legs, has centre braces between the legs and the centre column, weighs about 29 ounces, has the camera platform 45 inches above the ground with no centre column extension, and 57\" with full centre column, which gets the camera eyepiece to just about my eye level. It is about 22\" long by 3\" wide when folded, and has the same sort of head as the 38T4. It is certainly a lot lighter to carry around than my Manfrotto (which weighs about 6 pounds), but is only a bit smaller, and I find that if I am going to carry something that large I usually go for the Manfrotto, which is built like a tank.\nIf some of your photography, like mine, is done in the field when your primary reason for travelling is not taking pictures, you often simply cannot manage to lug along something like a Manfrotto. When that happens, a lightweight Slik in the backpack is infinitely better than a rock-solid Manfrotto left at home.\nUpdate: January 1998\nIt looks to me as though the current Slik tripod that is closest to the 38T4 is a new (1/98) model called the Compact. From the description on the web ( http://www.tocad.com/nct ) it appears nearly identical to the 38T4. The second closest model is the 450G. It is perhaps a little bit smaller than the 38T4, but not much. It would serve the same purposes nearly as well.\nThe next best currently available model is the 500G-FL. This is larger (about 18\" long when folded) but almost as light weight and extends to a somewhat greater height (about 45 inches). I own one of these, too, and like it pretty well, though it does not fit inside a small backpack as the 38T4 or 450G models will, so I don't use it as often--if I am going to carry a tripod outside my day pack, I usually take my Manfrotto 190 (Bogen 3001), which is about 5-1/2 pounds including ball head, 26\" folded including the head, extends to 4'10\" tall, and is rock-solid with anything up to a light 4 X 5 field camera on it.\nText and pictures (c) Copyright 1996, Dr. Ross.Alford\nArticle created 1996\nAdd a comment\nDonald Gentz , May 13, 1997; 05:13 P.M.\nI recognize the dilemma between big & heavy vs. small and light support. I used to try all sorts of things to not lug heavy tripods around; I tried the five feet of light chain with a 1/4\" 20 threaded eyebolt attached (screw the eyebolt into the tripod socket, drop the chain, step on it and lift), I tried monopods, beanbags (including ziplock bags filled with handfulls of the local dirt--that's travelling light), and I had a Slik with square, not tubular, legs. It flexed, the leg latches slipped, the head would droop (particularly with a long lens) and I finally realized that a tripod is a tripod, and if you must lug one around then lug around one that will do the job. Most of my shooting was outdoors in the western US, where it wasn't crowded or close quarters, so I can only speak for myself when I say that if you're going to make a production out of taking pictures, drag that heavy old three-legged beast along.\nPiaw Na , September 18, 1997; 11:04 P.M.\nI've used a SLIK U8000, and gotten really good pictures out of it. At 3.75 pounds, it's light and easy to carry around, and comes with a pan-tilt head that works. You do have to wait for things to settle down if you vibrate the tripod, but what else is new?\nI paid less than $60 for mine, and have used and abused it in many situations. A good buy for a beginner.\nGerry Siegel (Honolulu)\n, October 03, 1997; 11:18 P.M.\nAfter reviewing the helpful comments here about tripods, conferring with Bryan Geyer of RRS, and reading Galen Rowell's books on field photography, I just decided to supplement my solid but heavy mid-weight Bogen 3030a ( the faucet lever leg lock model) with a Gitzo/\"Le Splurge-o\" model# 224, which has three leg sections. Definitely enough leg sections! This is a rather small tripod in Geetzo's formidable lineup, just old aluminum alloy. Without the center post extended,it is shortish for me, but I don't find that to be really limiting( except for binocular astronomy use-which is another story). I think it is safe to elevate the robust, non geared center post--carefully please- another 4\". I agree with our site host Phil that the leg locks are not for the clutzy at heart. They have the beauty of backpacking well and not tearing fabric and jabbing body parts as the Bogen Manfrottos can.\nI am much impressed and grudgingly credit the French with the fine machining of the Gitzo. When one releases the legs, there is a partial vacuum 'whoosh\". Definitely worth the 240.00 I paid at B and H. I dont see many Gitzos at auction. They are heavily used, not traded. Still, I will never part with my Bogen, or even the baby Leica tabletop legs I bought 20 years ago,( which I use with a small Slik ball head.)\nAll three fill a definite photographic need. Save your coins and you will grow into multitripodomania too. I commend readers for interest in tripods. Get a good one and you will fall in love again. Aloha nui loa, Gerry\nPaulo Bizarro , March 27, 1998; 10:24 A.M.\nThe first tripod I had was bought 8 years ago, together with an EOS 1000 (Rebel in the USA?) and 35-80 zoom. It was a Cullman, light but stable enough for my gear at the time. In December last I had to buy another one, because the Cullman went down a cliff into the heavy seas. In case you are wondering, my camera was not attached at the moment, but it was a revealing experience nonetheless. The tripod was literally caught up by the wind on this rocky spur and flew over the side of the cliff.\nSo I was forced to go out and look for another one. Fortunately, during those 8 years, I have learned a lot more about photography, even without the benfits of the net :-), so I went and look for a sturdy one. The moment I saw the Gitzo range, I knew it was it. Besides looking good, it does the job better than anything else. I ended up buying the 80 year special limited (only 5000 were made) edition, aka 226 leg set and 1275 ball head. I really much prefer the releasing knobs (no better word for it, pardon my english) of Gitzo than the butterfly wing type from Manfrotto, looks strange and flimsy. Besides, when I now need a table support I just use the ball head!\nSo, my advice to anyone out there on the lookout for a tripod is: get the best right from the begining, you wont regret it.\nBryan Kochis , April 05, 1998; 01:53 A.M.\nIn my beginner naiveity, I started with a Slik U6000, and snapped the head 2 days later. I soon bought a Slik U9000, and again had head problems within a week.\nFor those asking why I even bothered with such light tripods: I didn't know better, and I needed a tripod for backpacking and hiking (where I do most of my shooting).\nLo and behold, I learned my lesson and eventually settled on a Bogen 3205S and Bogen 3262QR ball head. OK, yes, you have to extend the center column to get it near eye level (I'm 5'9\"), and for some this is a stability issue. Possibly, but I have never had a problem. If the winds blowing, or I'm on bulb setting, I just lower it. But compared to 27\" of length for a 3021, and an additional 2 pounds to boot, the 3205S is a cinch to lash to a pack.\nFor those who want to know, the leg locks are screw ins (less prone to damage by sand or dirt). I have submerged it in water, mud, dropped it, packed with it, used it in 0-105 degree temps and NEVER had a complaint.\nLike lenses, however, one tripod cannot do everything, and what you get is dependent on your lenses. The 3262QR supports (I believe) up to 8 pounds, and the tripod 11. For a portable tripod, it is a wonderful compromise, and if you need more, then get the 3021 or 3221, which can use the same head. Tripods are cheap. Whatever you do, I RECOMMEND staying away from any tripod / head that incorporates plastic in the casing or supports, and stay away from any tripod that doesn't have independent, spreadable legs for macro / ground work.\nWayne -- , June 14, 1998; 11:47 P.M.\nI'm currently in Japan on work assignment, having left my EOS in my home country, I decided to purchase a small P&S. At the same time, I also wanted to purchase a small capable tripod. Something that I can take everywhere with me (basically leave it in my knapsack). I finally decided on the Slik compact because it was cheap (2000yen), small (fits in my knapsack), and light. I was looking at the Bogen 3001s, but while it is a very small solid tripod, it doesn't fit into my knapsack and it was fairly expensive here (9000yen). All I have to say is this: look very carefully at the model you intend to buy in the store first. I made several trips to several large camera stores playing around with various tripods, and while the Slik 500G-III or 450G was fairly useable, I found the \"compact\" to be a big pain. I understood most of the tradeoffs in going to a smaller cheaper tripod, and I was willing to accept it, but there is one very annoying aspect of the \"compact\": the legs are tubular, not squar-ish like the Slik 500G-III or 450G. Thus, when I am screwing the legs tight, the legs themselves rotate. With the squar-ish legs, I can grab all three screws with one hand when the tripod is fully retracted, and loose all of them, then with one hand on the tripod, the other hand can tighten each screw after each leg is extended. With the compact, because the legs rotate, you have no choice except to grab each leg, and extend each section of each leg seperately. A very time consuming process, not to mention that to prevent the legs from rotating, one must tighten the screw very tightly (very difficult to loosen, not to mention painful on the palm with the plasticky screw). In retrospect, I would have been better of purchasing the Slik 500G-III, or even better, the bogen 3001s. In 3 months time, when I return to Canada, I will probably buy a bogen 3001s with a 3055 ball head.\nJ.R. Neumiller , October 23, 1998; 05:38 P.M.\nMy first rule of thumb regarding tripods is: any tripod is better than no tripod at all. Having tried to jam a camera in the nook of a tree branch, or done contortions reading the viewfinder from a tabletop perch, I can safely state the above with all assurance. Even the worst piece of junk is better than nothing at all.\nI started with the proverbial SLIK U8000, and still have it, although the pan head broke on me. I still like it, because it is so lightweight and simple to use. No, its not the most adaptable or rugged, but 95% of my pictures don't make great demands of my tripod. Just set it up and shoot. My standard gear, (EOS Elan IIE w/ 28-105), is just not so heavy to need more mass. Surely, if my body and lenses needed it, a more substantial 'pod would be the answer.\nA Bogen 3221 entered my life a couple of years ago as the answer to just such question. I've used it sparingly, because I'm just not so into photography as a great pursuit like some. (I'm a grab shooter. So sue me.) If I know I'm going after fragile subject matter, (dusk or night shots, windy telephoto days, wedding portraiture) its with me. Mostly, it enjoys its space in the closet with two other Bogen monopods, which, though really cool, don't get much use either.\nConfessedly, the SLIK compact tripod, (don't have the model) which the former poster dissed, is my favorite, most used unit. Why? Simple: its light, small, and doesn't hassle me like a big 'pod can and will. I like the fact that it doesn't intrude on my traveling, as I hook its pan arm to any bag or pocket opening when tightened.\nWhen first purchased, I imagined it primarily as a backpacking 'pod, (which I don't really do that much of.) Instead, its become an established member of my \"ready gear\" - the shoulder bag packed with the Elan and short zoomer, 75-300 telephoto OR 380EX flash, my circ-pol filter in hard case, film box and microfibre cleaning cloth. I've got 90% of all my essential gear quickly stashed and ready to go. The SLIK compact is so handy, and doesn't even have to use a ball head; the screw mount is fast enough to use on the fly.\nMost places will offer a perch or table upon which it stands. I can get almost 4 feet out of it fully extended, but even I admit that's pushing it. (I've got some great night shots of L.A. from the Mullholland drive observation point using this unit. The rock wall was so handy.) Another great feature is when I use it as a defacto chest pod. No, its not the most comfortable, but for steadying a telephoto, or using slow film in low light, it has saved several erstwhile loser situations for me.\nBottom line, you should always have some kind of tripod with you, even if its only a tabletop model. Its too indespensible. I can forgo 75% of my gear most times and resign myself to its loss, but this compact tripod is so light and handy, I'm always bummed if I forget it... even if I don't actually need it.\nActually, this tripod is much better than better than nothing.\nJulian Svedosh , November 28, 1998; 09:43 A.M.\nLightweight Sliks are great for lightweight cameras, but if you're planning on having any significant weight on top, the vibrations from even a slight breeze defeat the purpose.\nFor a recent trek to Nepal, I loaded up with a Nikon 80-200 ED lens (portraits can be of mountains as well as of people), plus a 1.6x magnifier, in order to be able to take some moderate distance shots. When I set this up on my Slik, it rattled like straw in the wind. I wasn't about to consider lugging my Manfretto (which I love) into the Himalayas -- my lenses were going to cause enough pain. So I bit my lip, went shopping, and came home with a Gitzo mountaineer (G1228).\nThe mountaineer fits only half the criteria for this bulletin board -- is is definitely not cheap (about US$450 for a new one). But it is wonderfully light (about 2 lbs) and offers the sturdiest support of any tripod in its weight class.\nUsing a tiny, and cheap, used Gitzo #00 ball head, I have a replacement for my old Sliks which is just as light and wonderfully friendly.\nWith a sturdier head (such as the companion G1275), I have enough muscle to handle any combination of 35mm or 6x9 format lenses and cameras, and I can even get away with a 4x5 in a pinch.\nThe magnesium alloy technology which Gitzo uses is super strong, feather light, and folds very compactly. If you're going to splurge on a field tripod, you can't do better than this.\nRich Furman , February 15, 1999; 10:52 A.M.\nAfter reading everything on this page, I went tripod shopping. Came home with a slik compact XL and a Manfrotto Junior. The slik is incredibly stable for its weight and is sort of my \"any tripod is better than none\" tripod. It's already gone hiking with me once. Every one's praise for and condemnation of this tripod is correct. But its a good compromise and my partner sort of insisted I get it, because she suspected (correctly) that the Manfrotto would be to heavy for a casual day hike.\nThe Manfrotto Junior is a beauty -- rock solid, four segment legs. Twist collars that lock and unlock easily, and it brings the camera up to eye-level while remaining rock steady. It cost 100USD at National Camera and can almost certainly be had for less elsewhere.\nI think that as a pair these two tripods will serve me well for a long time coming. Although the head on the slik doesn't flip up for vertical, ingenious use of the mounting screw and tilt does provide a workaround. I think the one piece head design is essential to this tripod's solidness.\nMichael Kaye , June 15, 1999; 04:25 P.M.\nI found out the difference between the slik compact and the slik compact XL (newer). The XL is designed with a dual extension center column to provide an extra 5\" of height. So instead of the previous height of 39\", it will now extend to 44\". Same price, around $30.\nAdam Holzschuh , June 18, 1999; 12:08 P.M.\nI have just bought a Velbon CX 470 tripod. It was cheep and light and seemed sturdy (I only use the EOS 630 with a 75-300 commercial zoom). I was just wondering if anybody has had any experience (good or bad) with this product. Please post or e-mail me at HoleSchuh@aol.com. Thanks\nPaul Harris , July 04, 1999; 04:02 A.M.\nI wanted a tripod that could travel with me all the time when I didn't have room or was too lazy to haul my Gitzo. Since the Slik compact was mentioned, I got one. The pan head on the thing drove me crazy when I had to use the tripod on unlevel surfaces, so I took off the panhead and center column and bolted a small ballhead onto what was left. This leaves a very short tripod, but also one that will fit in a regular briefcase or small backpack. This is pretty much a cheap version of what Galen Rowell did with a Gitzo 01, and after a while, I will probably upgrade. In the meantime, used with care, it seems tolerably stable. It will do things my tiny Bogen/Manfrotto tabletop tripod will not do, but as the tablebletop tripod is really pretty solid, I may end up carrying both.\nPaul Harris\nMichael Eckstein\n, October 09, 1999; 06:42 A.M.\nI'v owned a few Manfroto's and Slick's over the years and they are good then I got a Benbo Trekker and was hooked on their ability to get down to the subject. I use this with a Benmbo ballhead for hiking photo op's and am constantly asked about the tripod when taking wildflower pictures because of it's abilty to assume the position necessary to get the image. I have since purcahsed a Benbo standard (heavier model) which I use with a Linhof Prof II ball head. The Prof II has a friction adjustment which can be set to the weight of the lens body combination and makes taking photographs a pleasure as the ball stays in the position you swing the camera to...great for taking pictures of wading birds. So the two Benbo's are all I need tripod wise.\nMike Eckstein, Spring Hill, Florida\nMoshe Aelion , October 16, 1999; 04:30 A.M.\nCommenting on the posting of Julian Svedosh, November 28, 1998, above, Gitzo Mountaineer's technology is carbon fiber, not magnesium. (Carbon fiber is lighter and stronger (and more expensive)).\nI have been using a Gitzo Mountaineer 1228, with a Bogen 3262QR (I got plates for several cameras), and I am pretty satisfied.\nIt takes a while to expand and contract the Gitzo, though.\nMoshe Aelion\nton arm , December 12, 1999; 12:57 P.M.\nA bit more news on the Benbo, I had a problem with the attachment of one of the legs to its centre cluster (fellow users will understand my \"terminology\"), after backpacking for a couple of months the constant battering left a considerable \"wobble\" and as the legs are press fitted and riveted repair was nigh on impossible ... but Benbo were more than happy to replace the unit despite it's beaten appearance ... reasureing in todays sell and forget market !!!\nKurt Maurer , January 17, 2000; 08:39 P.M.\nJust thought I'd contribute since this sight has been very helpful to me. I was looking for a tripod but was not looking to spend a fortune. Since there are no upscale camera shops in my area I was forced to do all my research on the net.\nOK here it is. I finally decided on the following combo. 3001 legs with 3047 pan head w/quick release. These legs are a bit smaller than the 3021 legs most recommend. I like them and at 5' 11\" I only have to bend over a little to use these legs without the center section extended. I'm glad I chose these legs over the 3021's because these legs are small enough to clip onto a backpack or fit in some camera bags. Now to the head. The 3047 is basically a nicer version of the popular 3030. It has two bubble levels which help to fine tune things a bit. BTW this is a $120 combintaion (head and legs). If you can spend more money get the 3275 head. This is a geared version of the 3 way pan head. And it is SWEET!. But you will spend your $120 just for it. The head (3047) is a little meaty for the 3001 legs but I still think it's a great combo. I have found it a little bulky (the head) to fit in my back pack. I guess if I remove the handels I could do it. Solution -- spend $28 bucks for the medium ball head. This head fits just fine in any camera bag or backpack and I use it on longer walks. Hey, a ball head is no pan head but if you're not gonna be able to fit the head when you're out on a photo excursion what's the point. So, there you have it -- 3001 legs with 3047 or 3262 head depending on the situation.\nKen Newman , February 27, 2000; 06:05 P.M.\nJust got a Cullman 1001 touring set. It includes a small, reasonably sturdy tripod, a suction cup to hold a camera to glass, a ground spike, a woodscrew, a c-clamp, coupla ball heads. It's really great ... lightweight. Am planning on putting it through its paces on the Napali Coast in Kauai in a coupla weeks. I'll comment on how it did when I return. FYI, got it at B&H for about $125 for the whole kit. Tripod alone is about $50. Anybody used this setup? Comments? Thanks ...\nIgnacio Feito , April 18, 2000; 09:36 P.M.\nOne word of warning about 'tilting' the pan-tilt head to get a vertical composition. I did it often enough with a small Slik (don't remember the model) that I used to own, and finally damaged the tripod screw on a Rebel (plastic mount) when trying to point the camera up and down. As soon as I upgraded my camera body I gave my tripod to a friend that will use it for his handycam and got a couple (3221 & 3001) of manfrottos with 'real' photo heads. BTW, I use the 3001 (190) with a small 115 (3029?) head and it fits inside any bag that I travel with, just remove the head for travel and install it later, that makes it even more convenient for travel than my old slik, and certainly a better platform!\nJohn William , April 20, 2000; 03:43 A.M.\nJust got a Vivitar VPT-10. It shrinks down to 14.5 inches (small enough to fit in my knap-sack), 4 sections, and extends up to 47 inches (just under 4 feet) with the centre column fully extended (11 inches). I already have a Manfrotto 190QCB, it's just too big and heavy to take with me when I travel. Comparing Vivitar's VPT-10 with Slik Compact, I found the VPT-10 to be a better tripod. Both are about the same size and weight but the VPT-10 has quick release leg locks and tubular leg sections with small grooves running down opposite sides to prevent the sections from twisting. The things that I don't like is that it doesn't come with a quick release head and the leg locks are plastic (some of the joints looked rather flimsy) but what do you expect for $18 US.\nKarl Amo , September 03, 2000; 10:34 P.M.\nI purchased a Slik Compact-XL tripod in mid-2000 as a result of this article. On inspection, I found that the pan head can be removed from my tripod. Furthermore, I discovered that the aluminum top piece that the pan head clamps to is hollow; it has a central bore for most of its length; the central bore has a diameter of 0.20 inches, just right for tapping with 0.25\"-20 threads. I clamped the aluminum top piece to a vise with soft jaws, center punched the top of the aluminum piece, and used a drill with a #7 bit (about 13/64\") to drill a short distance (about 1/16\") to expose the central bore. I tapped the bore with 1/4\"-20 threads and screwed in a 1\" long headless bolt, with top slotted for screwdriver blade, about 3/4\" into the aluminum top piece (bolt purchased at a hardware store). A Bogen 3009 ball head (with a 3/8\"-16 to 1/4\"-20 thread adaptor purchased at a well-equiped photography equipment store) fits on top of the tripod nicely now. What's more, the pan head can still be installed, when needed, in leu of the ball head.\n, March 12, 2002; 06:30 P.M.\nI have one thing to say: Slik U-212 Deluxe.\nOkay, maybe a bit more. Next to a Benbo or maybe a Cullman it's the funkiest lightweight tripod design around. But it flat works.\nIt uses lots of plastic in the head and leg locking levers and in five years of use not a thing has broken. It feels like nylon or similarly tough stuff.\nThe legs offer almost infinitely variable adjustments - you're not limited to preset clickstops as with the Bogen/Manfrottos. The flip-out levers are easy to operate with gloves or frozen hands. And they're secure.\nLeg angle is controlled by anodized aluminum bars with friction clamps. Very slick. Too slick. The friction clamping mechanism can slip a bit - not enough to spill a normal camera/lens load (35mm or most MF gear), but enough to mess up your careful alignment on that Monarch butterfly you're trying to photograph. The trick is to set those metal spikes (outdoors) or grippy rubber feet firmly after you've got the leg angles set the way you want. No worse than fiddling with a Benbo and, IMHO, less hassle than the Benbo. I'm considering roughing up the anodizing on those friction bars to minimize the slipping.\nThe head can be attached to one of the legs, thoughtfully provided with the appropriate bolt; or to the bottom of the geared elevator post. The other two legs have accessory shoes for mounting doodads like Slik's Long Lens Support, flash accessories, etc. These aren't standard flash shoes so you'll need to buy Slik's adapter.\nThe tilt/pan head - a combination affair for the still photographer and casual videographer - is very smooth for still work and only relatively smooth for video work. It won't satisfy a videographer who wants a buttery, well damped fluid head, but it only costs half the price of a minimally satisfactory Bogen/Manfrotto video rig. I don't care for the twist-lock pan handle - sometimes it jabs me in the neck. I keep saying I'm gonna take a hacksaw to it and trim about half the over-long handle away. All the other knobs and such are just fine.\nThe quick release would amuse Kirk and Arca-Swiss afficianados. It consists of a sort of metal button post that attaches to the camera and fits into a round (dime diameter) hole in the tripod head. A flip-out plastic lever cams the post into position. This rig is vice and virtue. You don't want to carry your precious gear around mounted on this tripod - snag that flip-out lever on a branch and find out just how rugged that F5 and 80-200/2.8 zoom really are. OTOH, if you discipline yourself to take the camera off the 'pod before moving it, the QR is the quickest, slickest thing around. When I last shot a wedding I mounted the QR posts on both camera bodies and switched between handheld and tripod shots with ease. These aren't just quick release posts - they're quick mounting posts too, quicker than anything else out there.\nBest sub-$100 tripod going, IMHO.\nStephen Smyth , April 10, 2002; 11:02 A.M.\nHere's the tripod that Herbert Keppler calls the perfect travel tripod:\nThe Perfect Travel Tripod Making sure the surface wound would be well out of cosmetic sight, Popular Photography\u0092s senior lab technician, David Phung, made a short but incisive scalpel cut into the black leg, slicing through its skin, baring it to shiny, base metal. He applied voltmeter probes to each end of the cut and the digital voltmeter reading jumped upward.\n\"It\u0092s metal, alright,\" Phung reported, confirming what I hoped was true about the Velbon Maxi 343E tripod. In these days when plastics seem to be substituting for all materials, I found it a relief that one of my specifications for the tripod I had not stressed was indeed as I wanted it\u0097metal construction.\nThe Perfect Travel Tripod To jog your memory, my association with the Maxi (for short) tripod began many years ago when I cried in the three-legged wilderness for an ideal travel tripod no more than 20 inches when folded, weighing 32 ounces or less, which could swiftly extend in 45 seconds to SLR eye level. Legs should be independently extendable so the tripod could be leveled on uneven ground. The tips should be threaded rubber spikes to steady the tripod on all terrain. And, yes, it had to be sturdy. Such a tripod, I thought, should prove desirable for every amateur photographer who balked at toting his regular tripod on trips. Even tripod haters might have second thoughts about a tuckaway tripod that could guarantee sharp photos. Many tripods came close to my ideal but usually fell short in some vital aspect. Sometimes they were the very devil to set up and take down. Most were too short. The photographer would have to bend his knees to see through the finder. Maneuvering the camera to an upward or downward angle proved very inconvenient. Some years ago, Velbon president Koichiro Nakatani said he was determined to make a tripod to my specifications. At photokina last year, he presented me with the first sample of the Maxi\u009732 ounces, a little under 18 inches folded and 62 inches fully extended. The 62-inch extension had been the major stumbling block, but Velbon engineers had found a new nesting tube system that provided extra extension of each telescoped leg. The tripod was well made and beautifully finished. April delivery was promised. April and most of May rolled by before a shipment arrived in the U.S. Naturally I was anxious to compare my preproduction sample (which appeared to be Japanese-made) with actual Chinese production. Could Velbon USA send one? \"Sorry,\" said a Velbon spokesman, \"they\u0092re all sold out. We expect another shipment in a few weeks.\"But I did get one that very day, thanks to one of Pop\u0092s editors who handles new product write ups and had the foresight to ask in advance for a sample. Pulling rank (after all I was the one who got the tripod ball rolling), I glommed onto the editor\u0092s sample. I went over it piece by piece and inch by inch. Every knob, lever, flip lock, rubber tip and the entire ball head, down to the attractive cork composition platform insert, were identical to those on the preproduction sample. The tripod operated with the same smoothness. Price? Reliable stores have started advertising the Maxi for $90, street price. There was one difference between pre- and actual production models\u0097the cosmetics. Nakatani had warned me previously that the unique black crackle preproduction model finish of the outer legs couldn\u0092t be duplicated in China. So I wasn\u0092t surprised to find the outer legs, tripod platform and ball head in satin chrome. However, a number of Popular Photography staffers said they liked the chrome better. Mislabeled Tripod?! I had overlooked one other area on the preproduction Maxi. Printed thereon were the words \"for digital camera.\" And I found a large label on the production tripod\u0092s box that read \"For Digital.\" Now I know that the magical word today in imaging is \"digital,\" but when you come down to the nitty-gritty of tripod buying in the U.S., I don\u0092t think owners of digital cameras account for many sales. The vast majority of digital cameras sold in the U.S. are of the point-and-shoot variety. Point-and-shoot users aren\u0092t usually known as tripod enthusiasts. It\u0092s 35mm SLR and medium-format owners who predominently use tripods. Will \"For Digital\" cause them to pass the Maxi by? Possibly. Perhaps a more universal label reading \"For film, video and digital cameras\" might be appropriate. Well, it\u0092s my fault. I had my chance to squawk about the digital emphasis at photokina and I didn\u0092t. Although I have my doubts that the digital appellation will aid Maxi sales, how many non-digital products might have increased sales if the makers did stress their digital applications? Let\u0092s say Fuji or Kodak labeled their films \"Digital Ready,\" meaning the images could be scanned into computers. Would it help film sales? Probably some unknowing stock analyst would get all excited, write glowingly about digital-ready film and thus send that company\u0092s stock upward.

It fit my criteria perfectly. It comes with a pan/tilt head with quick release and also a lateral tilt. None of the adjustments are fine, but the tripod does have a bubble level built in. The legs are in three sections. The clamps are quick and easy to work, but they make a loud SNAP unless you try real hard to keep do it quietly. The center column is geared, with a crank. At maximum extension, the platform is at eye level for me (about 5'7\"). The whole thing seems pretty light to me, about 3 pounds. It does have a slightly rickety feel, but overall I'm happy, especially considering the price tag.\nIf you want to check it out at the Promaster website, you can .\nRoss Alford , August 17, 2004; 02:20 A.M.\nIt has been a long time since I wrote the original article above. Tripod technology has progressed a great deal. I now am using a Velbon Ultra Maxi as my compact tripod. It's a marvel as compared to the old Slik--about the same size, a bit heavier, but has a very quick \"trunnion-shaft\" (whatever that is--means you twist the bottom of the leg and all sections either loosen or tighten) system for leg length control, and has a great pan head with quick release that is solid and does not change angle as you tighten it in position. It feels solid as a rock, and is, as long as you don't extend the center column. The only other thing that comes close in the present market is the Manfrotto/Bogen digital series, the one with flip-lock legs and a built-in ballhead. I still think that any tripod in the hand is a lot solider than the one you left at home because it was too big nd heavy to bring with you.\npaul moorhouse , August 22, 2005; 04:56 P.M.\nOn the subject of tripods, i use the stitz closed channel c550.

IS/VR technology does work. It does not however, replace a tripod, as it only eliminates camera-shake. What I'd like to see however, are the implications of using more glass (and IS/VR hardware) in such a lens on flare-resistance, etc. All is well with an IS/VR lens if your subject is front-lit; what interests me is how IS/VR lenses handle scenes that include a bright light source.\nBob Atkins\n, March 17, 2004; 01:48 A.M.\nWhen I had both a 75-300 and a 75-300 IS lens I did some tests and found there was no significant difference in resolution or contrast. I didn't specifically look for flare.\nI did look for flare differences between a 300/4L and 300/4L IS. Under extreme condition, e.g. with the sun in the frame, the IS lens did show a little more flare, presumably because of the increased number of elements. In normal use I didn't notice a difference (but I may not have looked hard for it either!). The non-IS lens was also fractionally sharper when used wide open, but the difference was slight.\nEither way, the number of shots in which IS is a benefit probably far outweighes the number of shots in which it is a problem!\nI agree a tripod is better (and cheaper) than IS. However if I'm wandering aorund NYC, I'll take my 28-135IS and leave my tripod home.\nAlistair Windsor , March 17, 2004; 04:36 A.M.\nI have also found IS useful in shooting from unstable platforms. I shot a bunch of pictures recently from a boat on Lake Windermere on a heavily overcast day. The boat was rocking but most of my shots taken with the 28 - 135 IS are sharp.\nIn the enlargements of the deer that you posted (nice garden by the way - well trained wildlife - I am guessing it's not downtown Newark) I noticed that the background of the shot taken with the 75-300mm appears sharper than that taken with the 300mm which, given they were both at f5.6, makes me suspect that the 75-300mm is focusing beyond the subject.\nBlack Bloke , March 17, 2004; 06:10 A.M.\nWell I guess all the people who like the IS feature, but don't want to pay the money for it, are really excited about the Minolta DSLR.\nKarim Ghantous\n, March 17, 2004; 06:12 A.M.\nPerhaps one day soon a major SLR camera manufacturer is going to build IS into the sensor - that is, the sensor will physically counter camera shake. You could do a 'virtual' IS by reducing the effective border of the image and use the outer segment of the sensor as a kind of 'cushion' area. I think some video cameras use this method.\nThe advantage of getting the sensor to counter shake is that all your lenses don't need to be changed. It's a similar principle to what Contax did when they brought out an AF SLR which moved the film plane in and out for focusing. This meant that you could use AF with your manual lenses. That was a bit clunky but the principle is interesting.\nErich Budeshefsky , March 17, 2004; 08:49 A.M.\nKarim,\nA manufacturer is working on a 6 MP digital with 'in sensor' stabilization. The product was announced at february's show in Las Vegas, and it is going to be out for consumers this fall. I can't wait for it since Minolta always had a great user interface(i.e. easy to operate under shooting conditions).\nSo yes, if you have maxxum glass, all of your lenses are going to be anti-shake/Vibration-resistant. I still don't think it is going to cause a revolution, since no one followed Contax lead when they made the AX auto-focus camera. So Canon and Nikon people will still have their systems. Still think both Contax and Minolta should have put it out three years before, but that's that.\nBob Atkins\n, March 17, 2004; 12:50 P.M.\nMinolta's idea of moving the sensor to compensate for camera motion is interesting. Once their DSLR with the system is available it will be interesting to see if it proves to be as reliable and effective as VR/IS technology. For example will it have the frequency response range that IS has to reduce mirror induced vibations with long telephotos? Will it give 1, 2, 3, 4 or more extra stops of \"hand holdability\" (IS/VR give in the region of 3 stops).\nI'm guessing that Canon/Nikon might claim that putting it in the lens allows it to be optimized for each lens, much in the same way as putting the focusing motor in the lens allows it to be tuned for optimum performance, rather than having one motor in the body which has to deal with all lenses.\nWe're just going to have to wait and see before passing judgement on it.\nSomething a lot of people would like to see woul be an IS/VR \"TC\". Perhaps a 1.2x TC which would provide an IS function for all lenses it was attached to. Technically possible, but might affect sales of IS/VR lenses!\nTim Adams , March 17, 2004; 01:19 P.M.\nVery nice, it does indeed show how much sharper it is when you crop. Too bad you couldn't have thrown in the \"Holy Grail\" of 300mm's the f/2.8L IS. Man do I lust after this baby, though it is not even on the same planet price wise to the lenses compared here.\nI had one of the cheaper Canon consumer 75-300 zooms without IS, and when I made the jump to the 300 f4L (without IS), and the 70-200 f/2.8L (with IS), I could see the difference even before cropping. It is true, you get what you pay for.\n, March 17, 2004; 01:33 P.M.\nBob,\nI'm more of a Big Sur than an NYC tourist, but your point about the 28-135 IS is well taken and needs to be stressed.\nNo the IS won't increase depth of field, no it won't help with \"moving targets\", no it's not steadier than a $500 tripod and head combo, no it's maybe not as sharp etc. than a bagful of primes that match the focal lengths. But when you're tired, windcd, on foot just touristing around, it WILL get those suddenly appearing shots that we've all lost without it. And my 300 f4 IS is great for stalking water birds that keep moving in and out of the trees\nWere I just a landscape shooter, I'd have gone to medium or large format a long time ago\nAnh Tran , March 17, 2004; 01:33 P.M.\nThe IS is obviously working great. But you said in the last line \"For the web\" , the non-L is great too.\nHowever, if only for the web, we don't need to conduct a whole test and even I can buy the Phoenix cheapo lens , It will show the same on the web compare to L lens\nBob Atkins\n, March 17, 2004; 02:06 P.M.\nThe Canon 300/2.8L is not much better than the 300/4L. I've tested them side by side. The 300/2.8L will give very slightly sharper images on fine grain slide film (e.g. Velvia), but the difference is pretty small and would be lost on scanning and web display. On a 10D (maybe even a 1Ds) you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I sold my 300/2.8L and kept my 300/4L. Virtually identical images, much smaller, much lighter, much cheaper.\nYes, almost any lens is good enough for small web images as long as you don't need to crop and you keep display size down to 640x480. The Canon lenses, even the humble 75-300 is WAY better than that. Once you start to crop your images though, quality counts, even on the web.\nPetru Lauric , March 17, 2004; 02:56 P.M.\n\"Minolta's idea of moving the sensor to compensate for camera motion is interesting.

It seems to provide 2-3 stops of latitude. And speaking of stabilized lenses, Panasonic has a digicam (Lumix DMC-FZ10) with a very interesting \"35-420mm\" f/2.8 Leica lens. The lens has a stabilizer, probably inherited from Panasonic's camcorders. Several reviewers have reported consistentlty sharp results at the long end when exposing at 1/10 to 1/25 seconds.

I'm not sure you can extrapolate performance.\nLike I said, we're just going to have to wait and see how well a DSLR with a moving sensor works.\n\" Panasonic has a digicam (Lumix DMC-FZ10) with a very interesting \"35-420mm\" f/2.8 Leica lens.

It's a lens with the same field of view as a 420mm lens would have on a 35mm SLR. Second, the \"300mm\" lenses I tested above are \"480mm\" lenses if you want to compare them with the Panasonic due to the 1.6x crop on the 10D. Some of the shots above, with IS, were taken at 1/30. So yes, I can quite easily see me walking around NYC with a 480mm (equiv) lens and shooting hand held at 1/30 with a Canon IS lens. No problem at all. I can even do it at ISO 3200 and get fairly decent images. Try that with a small sensor digicam!\nMichael Nigro\n, March 18, 2004; 12:40 A.M.\nI think you all miss the point.

And, using a tripod is not chisseled into any stone tablets. It's just the wisdom of a very accomplished photographer named Bryan Peterson, who just happens to have published a wonderful 147 page book entitled Understanding Exposure, Amphoto Publications, ISBN 0-8174-3712-6.\nMr. Peterson provides detailed descriptions of how his images were exposed and in each description he says...with my camera securely mounted on a tripod...\nDoes this help any Bob? You see, I can be as condescending as you, Bob.\nAnd, maybe we can pick up this discussion in the event that you put together and publish a book as good as that published by Mr. Peterson.\nOskar Ojala , March 18, 2004; 03:38 A.M.\nA nice article, I did enjoy the comparisons and the \"is it worth it?\" question. Personally, I've been looking at image stabilized lenses for some time, but the more I shoot the more I shoot in larger formats and in general with focal lengths from 24 mm to 135 mm (in 35 mm, same angle of view but a slightly narrower range for larger formats), so spending $$$ on a high-quality fast IS telephoto would not really be for me. Maybe other people share this experience? Anyway, I think it's good to note that in different situations people have different lens needs.\nMichael Nigro\n, March 18, 2004; 10:01 A.M.\nYes Panagiotis. Those sports photographers use monopods the object of which is to control camera shake and prevent blur. Kinda the same effect one gets by using a tripod, huh?. You don't see those people trying to hand hold their cameras now, do you? Also, why do you figure lens manufacturers go to the trouble of putting a tripod mounting ring on the barrels of their long lenses. Think it might have something to do with stabilizing equipment to prevent shake and blur? C'mon, your an engineer. Do the math.\nPetru Lauric , March 18, 2004; 10:52 A.M.\n\"Stabilizing by moving a tiny little sensor in a digicam is a whole different ballgame\"\nOf course.

Why do you think I used quote marks when I indicated the focal lengths?\n\"So yes, I can quite easily see me walking around NYC with a 480mm (equiv) lens and shooting hand held at 1/30 with a Canon IS lens. No problem at all. I can even do it at ISO 3200 and get fairly decent images. Try that with a small sensor digicam!\"\nC'mon Bob, there's no reason to feel attacked ... I was just making a comment about how this other stabilization technology can help get sensational results with a very compact and cheap camera. Cheap on many levels: low price but also low ISOs, low signal to noise ratio etc.\nI assume that many if not most readers of your photo.net articles are very intelligent and informed and they know what the pluses and minuses of a digicam are. No reason to remind them that a $500 digicam is only usable at ISO 100-200 and that the results cannot compare with those from a high end system. Also, there's no reason for me to remind you what the cost and the weight of a long fast lens is. I was just making a little fun trying to picture you lugging a 400/2.8 lens in NYC, that's all!\nThanks for an excellent review, btw.\nFrank Uhlig , March 18, 2004; 10:59 A.M.\nBob,\nyour analysis and conclusions on IS lenses is first rate. However, i would like to ask you to do one further test on the 35 mph speed sign: What happens if you reshoot this with and without IS activated from a monopod? Common wisdom says the L lens at 1/80 sec should give sharp images. Is that true? Does the IS lens prosper from a monopod, too?\nI say this, because these lenses are both a bit long and heavy and I would prefer to use them on long stands with a monopod. Others might want to, too. Thanks!\nPeter Bednar , March 18, 2004; 05:18 P.M.\nI would've liked to see the deer shot with the 75-300USM IS stopped down to f8 and f11 in comparison to the L glass. The EF 300mm lenses are notoriously soft wide open and all the way out.\nas Canon's very low noise CMOS sensors give us High-ISO performance better than film, Stopping down to get consumer grade glass sharper seems to be a possible option.\nPanos Voudouris , March 18, 2004; 05:18 P.M.\n\"Long lenses should be mounted on a tripod and a cable release should be used. Period!!!\"\nQuick! Somebody tell all those fools, those sports photographers who use big long white lenses on monopods without cable releases and they even have the nerve to MOVE them (imagine that!) to get this...this...dreadful pan effect...Blasphemy!\n------\n\"Also, why do you figure lens manufacturers go to the trouble of putting a tripod mounting ring on the barrels of their long lenses. Think it might have something to do with stabilizing equipment to prevent shake and blur? C'mon, your an engineer. Do the math.\"\nThey put the hole under the lens ring for the same reason they put the IS mechanism in the lens! Besides, not everyone carries a tripod around, nor one is very useful on a boat or other moving places. Ever tried taking a shot from a vaporetto platform in Venice?\nMichael Nigro\n, March 18, 2004; 08:20 P.M.\nPanagiotis: The point is that people SHOULD carry around a tripod or at least a monopod when using long lenses. And, as far as shooting on a moving boat or vaporetto platform there are just some places where a long slow lens is inapropriate and you mentioned two of them. Good reasoning!\nEric Carter , March 18, 2004; 09:39 P.M.\n\"I think you all miss the point. Long lenses should be mounted on a tripod and a cable release should be used. Period!!!\"\nWell, that may be the last word for you, and it may be the last word for a lot of very good photographers - but it doesn't mean that it is the way everyone HAS to do things.\nWhile I like primes on 'pods myself, there are times when the flexibility of a good long IS lens would have been very welcome. There are times when a tripod is very tricky - just try shooting using longer glass in many cities... they aren't very friendly to tripods, so IS may be a good alternative.\nNot everyone wants to be \"chained\" to a 'pod, and IS glass provides them with something of an alternative - especially nature shooters and hikers for whom space and weight may be at a premium. The 'pod is great for when you're sitting and waiting, but if I'm out and I see something - like wildlife - do I use an IS lens and get the shot, or pray it won't move while I whip out the 'pod to set up? Or do I just keep the camera connected to the pod while I dig through brush to get where I want to go... I've done that, and it's a bit unwieldy.\nI'll keep my 'pod, sure... but gimme the option of IS too.\nVesa Perala , March 19, 2004; 04:26 A.M.\nSorry Bob, but the zoom image is backfocused.\nOf course this is just my opinion but everyone can make her/his own by looking at the last pair of example photos. Carefully look between the ears of the deer. You see there are white thin branches of the bush (and/or highlights in thicker branches). Compare them in each photo.\nThe deer looks sharper in the 300/4L photo but the background looks sharper in the zoom image, doesn't it? And the further the braches are the clearer the difference is, imo.\nI don't say there isn't difference in sharpness but these sample images leave some doubts.\nNever trust AF. At least I don't.\nkind regards Vesa\nAlistair Windsor , March 19, 2004; 05:41 A.M.\nMichael,\nThere are innumerable situations where a long lens cannot be tripod mounted and triggered with a remote release. As Panagiotis Voudouris pointed out panned shots are often done with long lenses and even if you mount them on a tripod you will not be using a remote release. Fritz Polking, who has published at least 3 books that I am aware of, observed that if the camera was mounted in portrait format then triggering by hard produced less blurring than using a remote release. The reason is that the mirror and shutter exert force perpendicular to the axis of the tripod rather than parallel to it as is the case when the camera is in landscape format. In this case the use of the hand acted as a damper.\nCanon's second generation IS functions on a tripod and acts to stabilize the lens further. It is certainly beneficial on a monopod and for panned shots.\nI am sure that Bob does not object to the notion of using a long lens on a tripod. It is your inability to accept that there might be situations in which you might want to use a long lens without a tripod and/or a remote release. I have given you a situation, quite common, where using a remote release is actually counterproductive. Previous posters provided other examples where working photographers take shots using long lenses without cable releases.\nVesa Perala , March 19, 2004; 10:05 A.M.\nBackground crop.\nTo be more clear: I was thinking of this area of the photo (see the attachment photo: 300L left, zoom right).\nAlso want to add that the IS comparison was great to see. I've been too lazy/busy to make anything similar myself. Thanks Bob.\nBob Atkins\n, March 19, 2004; 11:48 P.M.\nWell I took a bunch of shots of different subjects with both the 300/4L and 75-300 IS at 300mm and they all showed a similar difference. I even took some shots of resolution test targets using MF and AF and came to the same conclusion. I thought the deer made a better and more interesting (and real world) subject for comparison, but its certainly possible there was a slight focus shift between those two particular images. Without strapping a tilted scale to the deer's back it's a bit hard to tell for certain! I don't think they are quite that tame...\nI actually don't see any evidence of back focus. For example I don't really see less sharpness loss in the ears than the nose. To me the backgrounds look pretty damn similar. If you note, the deer has moved its head slightly from side to side. It may also have moved it slightly closer (or further) from the camera, which could account for a very, very, very, subtle shift in backround sharpness though I doubt the AF would have responded to such a small shift. The DOF of a 300mm lens at f5.6 on a 10D at a distance of around 60m is approximately +/- 4m around the focus point. (see the DOF calculator on my website ).\nI also tested these lenses on film some years ago. As I recall the 300/4L resolved around 80 lp/mm and the 75-300 IS resolved around 60 lp/mm at 300mm (75 lp/mm at 75mm if I remember right).\nHowever I'm pretty firm in my conclusion - and I'm pretty sure nobody would disagree - that the 300/4L is sharper than the 75-300 at 300mm. If it didn't think that, my 300/4L would be up for sale!\nIlkka Nissila\n, March 20, 2004; 12:27 P.M.\nThe background of the zoom image does look sharper than that from the prime on a first look but the backgrounds are not identical so it's not possible to conclude anything based on that. It's possible that this is a visual illusion - the background of the image taken with the zoom looks sharper because the main subject is so soft, and vice versa. Vision is all about local contrasts. I don't really think it's a question of misfocusing.\nVesa Perala , March 22, 2004; 05:50 A.M.\nHi Bob and Ilkka\nI can only say that my crops (did you look at them?) of Bob's crops are both made from the area between the ears (of the deer ;-) and they show the same area (with about 60-70% identical coverage).\nThe thick branch with highlight (tilted left) on the lower left corner is the same, the small white dot in the top left corner/quarter is the same and the white thinner branches in the middle of my crops in V-shape (tilted to the right) are the same, aren't they?\nBut the small white branches which I mentioned above (and which are in the middle of my crops) are clearly sharper in the zoom image (the right one).\nThe thick branch is closest to the camera and the thin ones are further back.\nI'm not saying that the L prime isn't better, I'm just saying that in a court room, with this evidence, I wouldn't judge the zoom in punishment. I would free it because of insufficient evidence.\nVesa Perala , March 22, 2004; 06:29 A.M.\nadditional crops\nSorry, forgot to add these additional crops of the crops. 300L still at the left and the zoom at right.\nIn my eyes the zoom photo has always sharper background, if not quite exactly then at least almost by the same amount as the deer is sharper in the 300L photo.\nPatrick Eden , March 22, 2004; 07:41 P.M.\nPanagiotis: The point is that people SHOULD carry around a tripod or at least a monopod when using long lenses. And, as far as shooting on a moving boat or vaporetto platform there are just some places where a long slow lens is inapropriate and you mentioned two of them. Good reasoning! -- Michael Nigro, March 18, 2004\nI have been shooting marine images for over twenty years, the Image Stabilsing feature of the 300 f4l IS allows pictures to be taken in rough conditions which would be imposible to get without this feature. It is not just a case of being able to keep the camera still in order to get a sharp image it is also being able to hold the composition until you see the picture.This feature is an absolute godsend and in these particular situations it is the difference between getting the picture and not. It is the insurance that gives you the confidence to get the job done. The idea of IS is to free you from the encumbance of a tripod or monopod. I hate using \"crutches\" which restrict my mobility it is an anathema to the way I like to work. If I want more support I crouch down on one knee, then rest my elbow on my thigh, the IS adds that extra confidence. I must admit I am lucky to be able to afford the 300 f2.8L IS but I have payed the extra because this lens is sharp wide open, and my clients are not interested in excuses as to why I did not get the shots. I think the extra money payed out for the IS versions is money well spent.\nJim Jamieson , March 22, 2004; 08:25 P.M.\nI hate to even bring it up. Yes, I'm a Nikon user left wondering when, if ever, they will introduce a VR 500mm or 600mm lens. I really like my Nikon gear (particularly the D2H), but I too have been viewing all the Canon technology with great interest. It would seem the 1D Mark II at 8MP with the 500mm IS lens would be the perfect combination for bird/wildlife photography. Switching over is expensive for sure. My question is, is Canon really worth it?\nDan Barthel , March 23, 2004; 02:13 P.M.\nIt should be noted that the 75-300IS is the absolutely worst IS lens in the Canon lineup. TO really see what IS can do, try an L series IS lens or for that matter even the 28-135 non L which does very well too. I would not recommend the 75-300IS to anyone with a digital body.\nDan Barthel , March 23, 2004; 02:17 P.M.\n\"Long lenses should be mounted on a tripod and a cable release should be used. Period!!!\" This must come from someone who has never owned a long lens. Proper technique: Sturdy tripod, IS ON, left hand pushing down on front of lens, right hand pulling down on body with cheek against camera back to put the whole thing in tension. Then squeeeeeeeeeeeeeze the shutter release. With a cable release, even with mirror lockup, small breezes will affect the lens stability. In tension, not.\nIlkka Nissila\n, March 23, 2004; 03:23 P.M.\nProper technique is a function of the shutter speed. At a speed of 1 s or longer, I'm quite sure that a self-timer or a cable release is the way to go, and having your hands on the lens is asking for disaster.\nDan Barthel , March 24, 2004; 08:32 A.M.\nIlkka, you're probably right, although I doubt that any shutter speed that slow with a long lens and IS would produce a sharp image except during dead calm. I've never tried.\nErb Duchenne , March 24, 2004; 11:54 A.M.\nExcellent article Bob. Although I am hoping there'd be a part2 to this article covering more examples and pushing results both ends of the stop, like testing at extremely slow speeds handheld (like one second or more) or high speeds (like 1/300 or more on the 300mm)\nOn the back-focusing issue I tend to agree with those who think it's there. For a poor lens with lousy contrast it's churning out a background bush not just as clear but visibly clearer than an L lens. I've noticed on my 75-300mm that at 300mm autofocus is unpredictable and can be 'off' a large portion of the time. Not way off. But refocussing the same shot on the tripod over several shots does produce slight inconsistencies seen only at 100% or larger.\nAlso... between L and non, I'd like to see more cross comparisons, like tripod shots, handheld with and without IS at various shuttespeeds on both L and non.\nOverall though, I think people are wondering if the extra $$$ for IS, or an L lens, is worth it and not if they should banish the thought of IS and carry a tripod because that's how it's 'meant to be.' And I think Bob's article addresses this quite well.\nCanon makes tripod mounts for people who want to mount them on tripods, and IS for those who don't. So I don't understand why people keep asking stupid questions, like, \"Why do you think they made IS?\" or, \"Why do you think they made a mount for tripod?\" But seeing they invested quite a bit more in IS technology, it would seem to me that they take handheld customer's wants very seriously!\nMichael Nigro\n, March 25, 2004; 07:08 A.M.\nDan Barthel: Who in hell do you think you are belittling me for expressing an opinion about using a tripod with long lenses.\nYou suggest my opinion \"must come from someone who has never owned a long lens\" when you don't know me, my work or the equipment I use to make my images.\nIn your next post, you say you doubt that a one second shutter speed with a long IS lens would produce a sharp image. Then, in your own words, you say you \"never tried\" a one second shutter speed with a long IS lens on a tripod.\nYou know, it's people like you that mislead others coming to this site to show their work and learn methodology.\nSince you are so smart and talented why is it that none of your work is posted to this site? You've been shooting in all formats since the sixty's. Surely you have some fine work for us to view, critique and learn by, especially your images captured using a long lens on a camera you had on a \"sturdy tripod, IS on, left hand pushing down on front of lens, right hand pulling down on body with cheek against camera back to put the whole thing in tension... and then squeeeeeeeeeeeze the shutter\".\nSuch awesome methodology must have resulted in a superb portfolio and I think you should share your work with us as freely as you share your baseless and ignorant opinions.\nIn closing, let me suggest that the next time you post something here you might want to think before you dribble.\nPatrick Eden , March 25, 2004; 09:04 A.M.\nHave just added an image taken with my 300f2.8L IS +1.4+2x converters, probably, should have used a tripod but I think the IS certainly help me get the shot.

It's the most important development in photographic equipment since automatic focus, and many photographers, including myself, have largely abandoned Nikon because the company lags Canon terribly in implementing image stabilisation in its line of long lenses. I hasten to add that IS/VR can be extremely useful in short focal lengths, as well, and I look forward to the time when it's a part of the camera body itself or of the entire range of lenses.\nThe new mantra of the modern photographer should be this: A tripod is no replacement for IS.\nIlkka Nissila\n, May 15, 2004; 05:19 P.M.\nJay, could you show some shots which cannot be made with a tripod and a high-quality non-IS short lens, and can be done with the IS lens, and which have desirable qualities? I guess we're mainly talking about the 28-135 and 24-120 since they're (not surprisingly) the only ones on the market right now.\nWarren Marts , May 23, 2004; 07:31 P.M.\nThe advantages of an IS lens over a tripod apply when the situation does not allow you to use a tripod -- examples from my own experience would include:\nInterior of St. Peter's Basilica, Rome -- tripods not permitted\nSki slopes -- No way to carry most tripods, and no good surface to put it on\nCandid people shots -- tripod would be too obtrusive, too slow to set up\nAbout the \"debate\" over the focus point for the deer photos above, I have a very good theory: The 75-300 zoom is probably not a true f/5.6 at 300mm. If it were say, f/6 that would certainly cover the miniscule differences in background sharpness.\nIlkka Nissila\n, May 24, 2004; 03:59 P.M.\nDoes IS really help with candid people photography? I find that in order to ensure sharpness of the subject, I need a fast shutter speed (1/125 with luck, 1/250 is good if the subject isn't moving). However, to obtain such a shutter speed, a f/3.5-5.6 lens isn't always able to deliver the goods while a 50/1.8 does nicely.\nRyan Joseph , June 15, 2004; 04:17 P.M.\n1/200th at 400mm, AND its a 33 percent crop.

I am an amateur photographer (26-year old graphic designer) who is looking to invest in new (or used) equipment. I took photography in college and regained an interest in it again two years ago. Now, I try an take my camera everywhere.\nI am looking to buy the new Canon 7N/NE, along with a Macro lens and larger zoom lens. I was looking at the Canon 75-300 IS lens that is up for debate, but now I am not sure what to do. I came to this site hoping to find some advice/recommendations and clarity.\nI do a lot of traveling abroad and to car shows and race tracks. I take photos of the concourse cars (new and vintage Ferraris, Porsches, etc..) in a more artistic manor, and I would like to attempt to photograph the races. I also travel for pleasure so I take a lot of landscape and location shots. Just recently I joined a photography club to the NY Botanical Gardens and shot with a 180mm/3.5 Macro (rented along with a Canon 7E). I plan on experimenting more with a Macro lens since I loved the results I got.\nI certainly understand the importance of using a tripod because when I rented the camera and Macro lens, I actually couldn't even hold up the camera because it was too heavy. I borrowed a wonderful Bogen tripod which was fantastic. The big issue... you cannot use a tripod in the Conservatory, which I did not find out until the day of the shoot. I was able to manuever the tripod without extending the legs, but it was a pain in the a**. Granted, this has nothing to do with the IS lenses, but in many cases, tripods are forbidden.\nI am looking into the IS lenses because of the situations I will be shooting in... my 28-80mm lens has been fine but I have felt the need for a larger zoom lens and cannot use a tripod in most of my situations, especially when I travel. Is the 75-300 IS a good match for me?? I am concerned about shooting the car races. I need to obviously shoot at a higher speed, but will the lens be able to handle that?? Does anyone else have any other recommendations?? Is the IS worth it for me??\nConsidering the backlashes that have been going on, please be kind. I know I have a lot to learn, but I am just trying to be a smart photographer and do my homework before I start spending.\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks, Melissa Hyland\nClayten Hamacher , August 18, 2004; 02:47 P.M.\nMelissa: Yes, I think IS would help you. What I'd recommend (it's what I did) would be to get the 28-135IS, it's a better lens than the 75-300, so it's where I decided the extra $250 or so for the IS was best spent. Then I'd get a cheaper 70-300 because much of what you want to take pictures of at a long range is outside and much brighter than the inside of a museum, for instance.\nIs IS worth it? Depends. If you shoot flower macro shots in quiet gardens, maybe not. If you shoot anything on the spur of the moment, like travelling light, want to be unobtrusive, etc, probably yes.\nFor me, IS was a no-brainer because I bought a $1000 camera, a $250 extra isn't much. If I'd bought a used film body for $100 it might not have been so obvious.\nBob: Thanks for the mini-review. The speed-limit signs are a perfect example I can show to my friends to illustrate the difference. I've never turned IS off except for tripod-mounted macro work and while an 85 f1.2 would probably get the same picture, I don't have one, or the other primes I'd need, or the space to carry them. Easily worth double what I paid to read it. :)\nMichael: ... I don't know where to start. You're wrong of course. It's the results that matter and I've seen many great shots that weren't taken on a tripod, and many that were taken where tripods weren't allowed. Perhaps you should perform a blind test - as I said, it's the results that matter.\n, September 05, 2004; 07:52 P.M.\nBob:\nThanks for an unbiased review of the 75-300 lens. Many of the newsgroup contributors around the net claim the 75-300 is a piece of junk. I almost believed them until I demo'd one at my local camera shop. Even at 300mm, the images had plenty of detail and contrast. I'm sure it doesn't perform as well as an L series lens, but I didn't pay for an L, either. It doesn't get as much camera time as my 28-135 IS, but that's more a function of the difference in zoom ranges than any significant deficiencies in the longer lens.\nDon O'Connor , January 31, 2007; 12:57 P.M.\nFirst, Patrick Eden...I checked your website...nice stuff!\nDan Barthiel...I'm afraid Dan is right fellas and gals. You don't even have to make the image to see what IS does and that putting pressure on the camera/lens system helps. You need all the stabilizing you can get both IS and technique to get the most out of long lenses. Something else that helps dampen vibration is placing a sandbag on the lens where it joins the camera.\nAnother method that works well both with and without IS is to use the sandbag by itself...pushing the lens hard into the bag. Jamb the bag down onto something solid and it will equal anything you can do with a tripod; or use it jambed up against the side of a tree for similar results (trees and boulders are every bit as stable as any tripod). If you're out where there is nothing solid (the Namib desert comes to mind) then a tripod is your only option.\nUsing a long lens mounted on a tripod and releasing with either an electrical or mechanical shutter release, without restraining the system, will get you soft images every time unless you're able to use high shutter speeds. Unfortunately, even with the 300mm f2.8 IS, you will more often than not be unable to use those high speeds in real-life shooting.\n, April 30, 2007; 02:22 P.M.\nSo the conclusion is that you need an L spec' lens, with IS\nJ. Harrington USA (Massachusetts)\n, October 11, 2007; 05:36 P.M.\nThis good article on the benefits of IS, is a great help for people trying to determine if IS is worth it.\nCertainly, IS does not eliminate the \"need\" for tripods but it makes image making more convenient for photographers everywhere.\nI enjoy night/dusk photography and I often travel by bicycle on my night photo outings. A tripod would make traveling more difficult on a bike and make picture taking more time consuming.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of IS on my 24-105L I've created an on-line slide show (using LightRoom) with the shutter speeds under each image. Not every image is super sharp, but without IS (or a cumbersome tripod) most would have been blurred beyond usability.\nMy point is, if a tripod had been required, I would not have made this outing at all. BTW all images were made in a standing, non-braced posture.\nhttp://www.slidescanning123.com/route-1-saugus/\nAbner Sonnenburg , May 16, 2008; 05:12 A.M.\nWow!!! I love the heated debate going on. I honestly don't think I'm experienced enough to try and school anybody on IS lenses or the use of a tripod. I love photography and that's all I know. I just bought a Canon 40D and I found this site because I am looking to purchase a good lens for it. I have a 28-35mm IS lens that came with the kit. I am mainly into landscape and outdoor photography. Any suggestions?? (only Canon lenses). I have been absorbing an extraordinary amount of information since I got my camera. I have read a book recently called The Digital Photography Book (parts 1 & 2) by Scott Kelby-check out www.scottkelby.com (his credentials are unsurpassed) It is a fresh alternative to most photography books that I have read. It's very easy to understand. He discusses the use of a tripod to make sure you get the best possible image quality. He (and quite a few other pro's) also says that when using a tripod to turn IS off because IS in itself will usually cause some movement. However, I can see that in some cases how it can be good to leave it on-like when shooting a sunset in the wind. So I guess it really all depends on what you're shooting and the conditions. What I am getting from all this is that if you are serious about your work- -invest the extra money in the IS lens so if you need it then it is there for you.\nJohn Parsons , September 30, 2008; 08:03 A.M.\nGeez Micheal Nigro get over yourself!\nTom Reynolds , December 13, 2009; 04:27 P.M.\n\"Yaron Kidron , March 17, 2004; 01:12 A.M.\nNice article, Bob.

I shot a roll of silde to compare the image quality of both lenses. At wide apeture, the L lens really stands out in image quality! However, as I stopped down the apeture to f8 and smaller, I can't really tell the difference when I looked at the slides from the lupe.\nThis lens is also huge and heavy and I find it difficult to control the focusing ring when my hand shifts from the zooming ring.\nWhat I liked most about this lens is that it allows me to use wide apeture for minimun depth of field and fast shutter speed for handheld shots. Images are excellent even when wide open.However, sometimes the deth of field might be so shallow that it spoils the whole image.\nAnother advantage about this lens is that it screams out loud to others that I'm a pro! On several occassions, I might not be allowed to enter the scene to take photo had I not been carrying this lens.\n, August 03, 1997; 02:44 A.M.\nJust to add one more point about using a Canon 2X converter with this lens.\nThe AF tend to search more often under certain conditions. However, most of the time, the AF is still pretty fast.\nYou have to be careful if you stack more than 1 filter with this combo. When I stack a cokin 81B warm filter with the normal UV filter, images can never be sharp, especially at the 400mm end.\nPaulo Bizarro , March 06, 1998; 10:46 A.M.\nThis is the lens I tend to use the most, especially for portraits. At 2.8 it is sharp, and the range allows for careful framing. Sure, the 1n+booster+70-200 = 3kg, but I don't care, the results are impressive enough. I have portraits of my kid taken with this lens that will always be on the wall, and this is priceless.\nMagnus Aldemark , March 16, 1998; 04:54 P.M.\nFirst of all, I love this lens! But... When shooting (hand held) in dim light, the weight becomes pretty disturbing. I think it's much easier to get a sharp image using a 85, 135 or 200 at f/2.8 than it is with the 70-200. Sure, it may seem obvious, but I really didn't think of it when I bought mine.\nDavid Lewiston , March 24, 1998; 09:56 P.M.\nJust received my test roll of K25 from the processor. Interesting results. I test lenses the old-fashioned way -- a two-page spread of fine print from Shutterbug taped to a wall. Camera on tripod, aligned for perpendicularity using a mirror. Made comparison shots with the 70-200 on my EOS A-2; my trusty old 90mm and 200mm prime lenses were placed on a New Canon F1 (1979 model). Cable release with the F1, mirror lockup and self-timer on the A-2.\nAt 200mm, the 70-200 zoom and the Canon 200mm f2.8 FD lens were hair-sharp at all four test apertures, f2.8, f5.6, f8.0, and f16.0.\nMy 90mm prime is a Vivitar Series 1 f2.5 macro. Interesting comparison. At 90mm, the zoom was hair sharp at all four apertures. But the slides made with the Vivitar looked _terrible_. Huge suprise for me. I've had marvellous results in the 18 years I've used it. In fact, I think of it as my money lens. However, in this test the results at f2.8, f5.6, and f8.0 were unacceptable. At f16, it was fair. I'm not sure whether it's the fault of the lens, or of my deteriorating eyesight -- the main reason I've taken the autofocus plunge.\nFinally, I took the same sequence of shots with the zoom at 70mm. Lousy (unusable)at f2.8, f5.6, f8.0, mediocre at f16.0.\nGuess I won't be using it much at this focal length!\nColin Barschel , April 02, 1999; 01:14 P.M.\nI use this lens for more than 3 years and it was my first \"L\" lens. It is simply a PERFECT lens and incredible sharp! I also make some pictures with the equivalent Sigma and Nikon but it was not possible to observe the same sharpness and contrast as with the Canon one. It is also the lens witch I use the most and give me the best photos. I think that the price is not so expensive regard to the performance. Colin\nJuan Luis Polo , October 11, 1999; 01:48 P.M.\nI have been owner of a Canon 80-200 2,8L during 2 years. After that I changed to different lenses from independent manufacturers, I thougt that there was no so much difference between them. The result: 1 year suffering shot after shot: autofocus, quality of the lenses, quality of the photos... Now the 70-200 2.8 L to the rescue!: I have to take photographs from diferents parts of the world. And, of course, this is the lens for me. ?Heavy? sure, but you forget it when after the trip you see the material: quality and more quality, everything is razor-sharp, the autofocus is there: fast and accurate... ?and the optics? like my eye, what I see is what I get: no color dominants... Wonderful lens, believe me. If you need results this is your lens!\nStephen Rohrbacher , December 02, 1999; 11:19 A.M.\nI have had this lens for 2 months now and am crazy about it. I had the Canon 75-300 non-USM before this and have two years worth of mediocre pictures. Used it recently at my older daughters HS graduation in an auditorium using a 540ez from the balcony and got great results from 50 feet away. Took some more the next day at my youngest daughters dance recital in another auditorium, no flash allowed. I braced myself on the rail, spot metered, and the results were also good, though the dancers blurred in some shots. I highly recommend this lens. (12/2/99: Still love this lens. My wife needed some portraits for her new career in Real Estate, when the rest of the office saw them they wanted theirs done. And all I used was an on camera 540EZ bounced off the ceiling and walls.)\nBill Mallin , January 11, 2000; 06:56 P.M.\nI bought this lens originally thinking that this was going to be a good \"all around\" lens for fashion. At first, I was very pleased with the images, as they were definitely a step up from the consumer type zooms I used previously. As time went on however, I found that I was much happier with prime lenses like the 50/1.4, the 85/1.8, and the 100/2.0. They focused better in poor light, adding filters wasless costly in terms of money and light loss, and the lightness made photography much more spontaneous and fun. This is really a lens more for a photojournalist.\nPatrick Wong , February 28, 2000; 08:45 P.M.\nI have the Sigma 70 to 200 F2.8 HSM. It is correct for the UK magazine Pratical Photography to rate the lens higher then the Canon. It is razor sharp, it is the one lens I use full time on my EOS 3 and have many rolls of film to prove. It HSM (similar to Canon USM) is quiet, fast, and deadly accurate plus you focus maunally without pushing a switch. This is one the few lens that really give Canon or Nikon a run for there money, I save about $1000 CDN price different. There is a down side to the lens, for what ever reason the lens happen to slip of the mount and hit the floor, major damage. To make a long store short I cause about $300 in damage which Sigma USA agree to cover (normal they don't) plus it take three month to fix which was a PITA. I have one question is the Canon repair much faster, would Canon fix it for free and is the Canon that much more duriable. ( when I say Canon I mean Canon Canada).\nMichael Giuliani , April 24, 2000; 06:37 P.M.\nPictures with Sigma 70-200 f2.8 HSM EX .\nCanon or Sigma? What is the dilemma!? For as long as I have been involved in this beautiful hobby I noticed that one of the hardest aspects of it, it is buying the right equipment. There is a lot of good products out there that make the choice even harder. To discuss now about the two lenses mentioned (Canon 70-200L USMf2.8 and Sigma HSM 70-200 EX f2.8), after the experience I have had with both of them, I ended up buying a Sigma. Why? I mainly shoot action sports (motocross, desert racing, and horse jumping) to sell pictures, and everything else for stock. The two lenses perform vrtually the same. AF speed is critical in the sports I shoot, and the two AF motors HSM and USM are equally fast. If AF speed is a concen, and you own any Canon below the EOS 3 and want to buy the Canon USM lens, don't be a fool! Buy the Sigma, save the difference in cost, and upgarde your camera body ... it is the camera that auto-focus, not the lens. The lens has only the motor, and as I mentiond above the HSM and USM motors are equally fast (don't tell me that the USM is 1 nanosecond faster, please!) Image quality ... well, it is probably the same and maybe the Sigma is slightly better. Construction ... the Canon feels stronger, but it is just a feeling that you are getting because of its metal barrel. Keep in mind that the paint on the Canon will chip a lot easier than the one on the Sigma. They are both very well sealed against dust and to me this is a concern, since I shoot in very dusty places(Desert,sand,dirt traks). If you drop it is only important to know how lucky you are!(Either lens will suffer equally) Price ... well, Sigma wins big time by being cheeper. Resale ... they will sell fast because they are both excellent lenses in great demand, and the depriciation is proportionally equal. In conclusion, both are excellent lenses that can produce equally excellent pictures that you could sell even to National Geographic or Sports Illustrated (the only limit would be your own ability to take great pictures). I have choosen the Sigma because it makes more sense to me! I had the money for a Canon, but I saved the difference to buy other equipment. I hope this will help you in your research. Photography is about taking great pictures, and the ability of the person behind the camera that makes it happen! Yes, the right equipment is important, but don't buy a \"white\" lens because it will make you look like a pro ... work on your skills, not on your look. Good luck!\nSusan Butler , May 26, 2001; 12:48 A.M.\nMy \"Claim to Fame\"\nPhoto above: Dan Butler, Grand National Dirt Track Rider #22 - shot with Canon A2 and 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM (IS turned OFF). Shutter priority 1/60, Kodak Royal Gold 400, approx 60 mph at 30 ft - no digital mods made to image.\nI just added the 70-200mm f/2.8L to my collection. Most of my photographic shots are of motorcycles and people as you can see above. This shot is one of my favorites.\nAfter seeing the results of my first 5 rolls of motocross photos (not shown), I am convinced that the quality of this lens is superior to that which I was using (Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM) along with my Canon A2. For whatever reason, the 28-135mm was not as sharp as my previous 35-85mm (bought with the Rebel XS in '94 as my first camera). It didn't matter if I was using a filter or not, the images never seemed to be as clear as I had been able to obtain repeatedly with a different lens.\nOpting for the 70-200mm range was perfect for the typical distance between me and the bikes and of course, I have noticed the weight (I only weigh 125 lbs so this lens is a boat anchor for me to haul around) but I think this means I should start working out for the long hot dusty weekends at the race tracks!\nI love this lens and now, will be using it with my Canon EOS 1V HS for more motorcycle action. I had no difficulties with my A2 & this lens regarding AF and I suspect the performance will be even better with the 1V.\nMore photos will soon be available on http://www.butler22.com from my new 1V and 70-200mm combo (with and without Canon EF 2X Extender).\nLee Shively , May 28, 2001; 09:19 P.M.\nI bought this lens in March and have been using it a lot since. It is every bit as good as I had heard. In April, I went to the Texas Hill Country to photograph wildflowers--an annual trek for me. I used the 70-200 with the EF 1.4X Extender for about 75% of my shots. I used a tripod often but, due to the constant Texas wind, I also shot handheld wide open at a high shutter speed. The results were very pleasing. Combined with an extender or the 500D close up lens, it is a great alternative to carrying a macro. Anyone using the Canon EOS system would find this a very useful lens and, although expensive, it is money well spent.\n, September 09, 2001; 01:46 A.M.\n70-200L f4 @ f4, Fuji NPS\nBought the smaller f4 version recently. Pictures are very sharp and the lens is so much lighter than its 2.8 brother. Although f4, depth of field is still shallow and renders out of foucs objects nicely. Easier to carry around and pack. Moreover, I don't need heavy duty accessories (bags / tripods..) to support its usage.\nTony Zipple , December 10, 2001; 01:41 P.M.\nMy 70-200 f/2.8 has been my favorite lens for the past few years. Sharp, fast, contrasty.... it is everything that I could want in a zoom except for light and cheap. However, I recently sold it and bought the IS version of the 70-200 zoom. Optically it is also a remarkable performer and every bit as good as the non-IS version. IS adds a great deal to the lens, however. It lets me shoot slower film and sharpens up many of my shots.\nThe headline it that it makes handheld shots (most of my work) much better. Is it worth the $750 + what I got for my old lens? To me it is.\nNigel Nagarajan\n, December 17, 2001; 08:50 A.M.\nGlad to see that this page has now been updated to include the f/4L and f/2.8L IS versions of this lens. It would be useful to see a further update with more information on the optical characteristics of the different lenses and their relative performance. Optically, these are three quite different lenses, e.g. because the f/4L version has a flourite element which the two f/2.8L versions do not, also the f/2.8L IS has a more circular diaphragm than the non-IS version. So let's see some numbers, or at least some anecdotal evidence.\nJeffrey Siegel , December 22, 2001; 10:51 P.M.\nI recently purchased the 70-200 F4. This is my first higher end zoom lens and, like the comments suggest above, it is tack-sharp, very well built and a pleasure to use. I would also like to say that even though I got the smallest lens of the lot, it is still quite long especially with the hood attached (~10\"). It won't fit in my current camera bag (a kinesis belt system). I know that it is lighter than its bigger brothers, but I found it a little awkward to balance on the tripod without the tripod collar. I know that many people buy this lense for backpacking, and it is a great lens for this purpose, but be aaware that it is still quite substantial.\nkyle martens , December 29, 2001; 09:35 P.M.\nCanon has been slowly implementing the IS technology into their various lenses and although the 70-200 2.8 IS looks really nice, I am holding out till the inevitable 4.0 IS comes out. It should be the best bang for my buck.\nAndrew Grant , December 29, 2001; 10:57 P.M.\nI have the 70-200/F4. Aside from being much lighter than the other two it is also much cheaper. Phil did not mention cost issues in his comparison. The F4 version costs less than $600 with rebate, the F2.8 is over $1,100, and the 2.8 IS is around $1,800. For the difference in price between the F4 and the 2.8, I could buy a nice portrait lens or even the 100/2.8 macro. For the difference in price between the F4 and the F2.8 IS, I could buy the 300/F4 IS prime.\nI use the F4 on a D30 body. At 200mm (320 effective) out of focus backgrounds are not a problem. However, in low light AF can be. I currently use a 50/1.4 (80mm on the D30) as a low light portrait lens. When Canon has a full frame digital, I will need that portrait lens.\njack's dad , March 09, 2002; 12:47 A.M.\nCounterpoint to the comment above: I own the 70-200mm f4 and a 50mm f/1.4, too. I actually find that the 70-200mm f4 focuses much faster on my D30 (due to the ring USM versus the micromoter USM?) than my 50mm 1.4 in low light. It does not hunt the way that the 50mm 1.4 often does in low light, low contrast situations. Are you SURE that your f4 is worse in low light? For those of you worried about the f4's relatively small aperture and autofocusing problems on the D30, don't worry. You, too, will be surprised by how quickly it focuses in low light.\nStephen Lutz , April 16, 2002; 10:49 A.M.\nCivil Rights rally, January 2001, Louisville, KY\nLet's not forget the 80-200 2.8L. While it may be \"ancient\" without \"Full Time Manual\" and USM, it does take extremely good photos. Here's one taken with an Elan II and 380EX flash, with Portra 400NC. Very sharp wide open at f/2.8. If you don't mind buying used, this is the lens to get for 2.8.\nEvrim Icoz , October 21, 2002; 04:34 P.M.\nThe Canon 80-200 2.8L is termed ancient, however, it is an excellent lens. I had the 70-200 4L and I prefer the 80-200 2.8L. The focus is not bad at all, and the colors have that 3D pop to them that I didn't find with the 4L.\nMike Nunan , October 22, 2002; 09:38 A.M.\nI have recently acquired a brand new 70-200 f/4 IS, and I'm rather shocked by its tendency to flare. I set up a shot on Saturday where the model stood in front of a skylight-type window, which offered a view across the building's roof (it was actually a converted church) with the top of a tree occupying most of the background. The tree was being side-lit by direct sunlight, and was fairly bright. The difference between the inside and outside ambient lighting was probably around 3-4 stops, and I was planning to use a little fill-flash to balance the lighting. However, the flare in the viewfinder was so severe that I immediately switched back to a prime lens. Looking at Evrim's fine image above, I cannot imagine my lens dealing with this situation successfully. Obviously the IS lens contains many more elements than the old 80-200, but this result does seem a bit extreme. Is this normal or is my lens likely to be a lemon?\nnitin goje , October 19, 2003; 06:28 A.M.\ndear sir i really shocked to read that u said in ur gallery section that u prefar 2.8 aparter for brighter view rather than 8 aprture u said it 2.8 gives me brighter viwfinder as u know i think whatever the aparture in nowadays cameras vivewfinder only shows 2.8 brightness it s only when dimmer when u keep ur aparture on eight and click depthof field preview.iam poor in english but i hope i conveyd my message.\nVincent J M , January 21, 2004; 05:21 A.M.\nThe best decision I made was to trade in some assorted lenses (100-400L and a couple of others) for the beautiful 70-200/4L. This is one of the loveliest zooms Canon has made. The 100-400 used to stay at home most of the time, thanks to its weight and bulk. Now the little 70-200/4 goes with me almost everyywhere. It's easy to hand hold even on a light body like my Elan-7, Image quality is top notch. I wouldn't trade this in for anything, except perhaps a 70-200/4 IS if it ever comes out.\nHelen B. , January 24, 2004; 07:30 A.M.\nI have a \"cheaper one\", 70-200/4L on my EOS33 (=Elan 7) The lens is *NICE*: sharp even wide-open, immune to flare (with no filters attached), fast AF thanks to USM (if limited to +3m - +INF), 67mm mounting thread is compatible vs. EF24-85, hood supplied.\nBut there are also some weakenesses: first, after 1 year of not too intensive usage i have to contact service center because the entire optical block has been \"unscrewed\" for a unknown reason, and locked zoom position at ~73mm. One month required to reassemble the lens completely.\nThen, an expert who did the repair said that \"not the entire lens tube is metallic, but some rear parts are plastic\". That's funny!\nGenerally the entire built is very solid, lightweight if compared to f/2.8L (IS), rubber-coated focus & zoom rings both are very usable. Of course, it's not intended for portraiture works so its bokeh is more \"repartage-like\" instead of beatifaul backgnd blur - which is delivered for example by 100/2.8 Macro (not a portrait one, too, but bokeh is really wonderful)\nThe detail level especially @200 mm is exceptional - i have some shots of a 15th century church all made from the distance of 20-30 meters (Fuji Reala 100); when printed as 20x30 cm (8x12 inches) it is possibly to distinguish even where the rust is and where is not, each of bricks, and feathers on a small bird sitting on the roof.\nMorten Hansen , September 12, 2004; 04:59 A.M.\nI was sadly aware that the 70-200mm f4L suffers from Backfocus-problems on left side of image, when used on a DSLR (mine is the D30). This is more pronounced @ 200mm and f4.\nThis is described in great detail by Peter Kun Frary, Hawaii here: http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/frary/canon_ef70-200usm.htm\nHas anyone else observed this?\nI just received my lens from B&H, NY. and had to return it immediately due to this problem. I hope my next specimen does not suffer from the same problem. What a drag...\nWhat is going on with Canon's quality control??? This lens is not a new kid on the block and DSLRs have been around for many years... Have nobody else ever checked this out.\nI'm puzzled\nAndrew Robertson , September 19, 2004; 08:17 A.M.\nI have used the 70-200 f/4L for well over a year now. It's a nice lens, but it isn't perfect. My sample is uniform in its sharpness, and works great, but comparing images shot with it to those shot with the 135mm f/2.8 SF makes me wish I had the 200 f/2.8 instead. The 135 has much better contrast and color saturation, and is sharper to boot! Lately the L has been sitting in the bag, as I use the 135 SF and the 100 USM Macro more and more.\nTo expect a zoom to outperform a prime is expecting too much, though. For what it is, it's great! I would recommend this lens to anyone who would be able to appreciate a finely crafted but inexpensive tele zoom. I wouldn't recommend it to someone spoiled on primes, though. The 135 f/2.8 SF, for less than half the price, is a much better performer!\nGary Rowan Higgins , December 23, 2004; 11:40 P.M.\nWhat a cracker! Refer MTF curves for both tele and wide ends (70, 200mm) published by Canon (Lens Work Vol. III) for this puppy. Very telling of UD and CaF2 glass and giving DO elements are beating. Brilliantly endowed, this pup shamelessly flirts in the sun beside its ultra-expensive (and heavy) 2.8 brethren. Snappy contrast and consistent centre-to-edge resolution are bang on form which means have no fear in A3+ enlargements from 35mm (assuming you use a tripod, mirror up and expose precisely). Slim and inviting, smooth and well-weighted, this lens is a treat 'on the go'. Noteworthy is background blur from f5.6 to about f9.5; beautifully delineated--a true 'L' series hallmark; only the TS-E 24mm f3.5L (in retrograde or tow tilt) can take it further. If you're a bushwalker / traveller, get this beauty over the f2.8. Recommended as an excellent bridging zoom for the equally flash 17-40mm f4.0L. Note re FILTERS: Resist putting cheap filters on this (or any 'L' series) lens. Use a filter(s) by Canon, Hoya Super HMC, Pro or Ultra type or B+W MRC and ONLY one on this lens at a time. If using a Polariser, a B+W Kaesemann-type (ultra-thin and unfortunately ultra-expensive) specifically for highly-corrected apochromats (as this lens is).\nAnand Srinivasan , December 18, 2005; 08:21 P.M.\nI am trying to decide between buying a Canon EF 70-300/4-5.6IS USM and a EF 70-200 F/4.0L USM.

I will not bet that it's sharper than the 100mm f2.8 for macro shooting but if you consider the oveall sharpness and contrast of this lens you'll be satisfied...

I use this lens 3-4x more often than I ever used the non-IS version. The non-IS model was not an all-around, go-to lens. It was a lens that I used in bright sunlight or used on a monopod or tripod. I carry the 70-200mm f/4L IS around with me everywhere as half of a two body, two lens system along with another great lens: the 17-55mm f/2.8 IS.\nThe IS is fantastic, I shoot at 200mm using 1/60 second at f/4 and expect sharp imagery 99% of the time (the 1% I miss would be due to operator error). I can shoot at 1/30 second at f/4 with an expectation of a very creditable percentage of keepers. Due to my growing older, I used to want to keep the non-IS version up around 1/500 second when at 200mm.\nThe lens is expensive but, you are getting value for your purchase price. I am using a lens costing twice as much, three to four times more often.\nNow that I have a 40D, I will appreciate the weatherproofing, especially on my upcoming trip to Alaska this summer.\n, January 17, 2009; 10:47 P.M.\nYoung George Washington\nI am looking forward to an up to date review of these lenses including the incredible 70-200 f/4L IS (separate reviews and strings?). It is now my favorite on a 40D - ok I still love you 17-40L.\nIan Luyt , October 06, 2009; 06:29 P.M.\nI have a bit of a \"knock\" on my 70-200 IS. Seems the front and back halves move slightly. Almost a very slight wobble. Can't say I've noticed this before, and haven't had an incident of damage. Any thoughts from anyone please ?\nKARL BLACKWELL , October 21, 2009; 07:58 P.M.\nI've noticed a few people have mentioned problems with the canon L series 70-200mm F4 lens. I've had mine for 5 years and have dropped it on one occasion, but that was 4 years ago... now, and only now do i notice the left hand side of pictures shot at infinity (especially) are not sharp, even when the rest of the picture is sharp... Does anyone know what sort of a problem this is and if it' s the sort of repair that one can do oneself?

Note that I purchased my Original Lensbaby with my own money like any customer, but that the Lensbaby 2.0 was supplied as a review lens by the maker. They contacted me, kindly sent me a review copy, and included a macro lens adapter kit with the 2.0.\nThe Lensbaby\nSo you\u0092ve just spent piles of money on the latest fancy camera equipment. Maybe a nice digital SLR with top of the line lenses. The camera\u0092s spitting out technically superb, high-contrast, ultrasharp images. Yet... somehow... something is missing.\nWouldn\u0092t it be nice to get that dreamy otherworldly look that toy cameras often generate? The blurring, the light leaks, the heavy vignetting... To hell with precision engineering and quality optics, and back to the toys! That is sort of the idea behind the Lensbabies lenses , created by American photographer Craig Strong.\nHow they work\nLensbabies are small, compact lenses mounted inside flexible ridged rubber tubes, much like vacuum cleaner hoses. The tubes have sturdy metal rings at each end, keeping the whole rig secure. The lenses are available in a wide range of different lens mounts to fit different cameras. The supported lens systems are Canon EOS, Nikon F, Pentax K, Olympus OM, Minolta Maxxum/Dynax, Minolta Manual, Canon FD, Contax/Yashica, M42 universal screwmount, Leica R and even Olympus Four Thirds digital. I reviewed the EOS version.\nClockwise from the upper left corner: the Lensbaby 2.0, the Original Lensbaby, the aperture storage case (note the thrifty recycling of the Kodak 35mm film canister lid!) and aperture extractor tool, the LensPen cleaning tool included with the Lensbaby 2.0, three aperture discs and the sturdy threaded metal Lensbaby lens cap.\nThe Lensbabies are actual SLR lenses. They aren\u0092t add-on fittings which can attach to existing lenses. So you need a camera with interchangeable lenses to use a Lensbaby - you can\u0092t fit one to a point and shoot camera.\nThe build quality of the Lensbaby lenses is excellent. The metal is thick, precisely machined and nicely finished in black. The lens elements are installed inside a short metal tube which acts as a kind of lens hood or shade. The lens cap is actually a thick metal disc, like a heavy black coin, threaded with a 37mm filter mount. The lenses use a very old-fashioned way of controlling the amount of light which enters - rather than adjustable irises like most lenses they use simple removable aperture rings. (much like the Waterhouse stops used in Victorian times)\nThe Original Lensbaby.\nThe first version of the lens has a single lens element made of uncoated optical glass. It uses cardboard discs punched with circular holes, which fit inside the barrel and are held in place by a rubber washer, to adjust the aperture. The discs provide for f/4, f/5.6 and f/8 aperture settings, and you can also go for f/2.8 by just using the washer. The lens ships with a custom-made plastic storage container for the washers, complete with a funny sort of prying tool on the end for removing the rings safely. I bought an Original Lensbaby because they were out of stock of the newly released Lensbaby 2.0 at the time.\nLensbaby 2.0.\nThe version 2.0 lens has two multicoated lens elements made of high index glass. It uses a slightly different method for aperture control - the aperture rings are held in place by three small magnets. You have a range of aperture sizes available to you: f/2 (no aperture ring), f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, and f/8. It too ships with a plastic container for keeping the rings together, along with a rather nice little LensPen cleaning tool.\nWhat can a Baby do for you?\nSo that\u0092s a summary of the products. Now, what does this all give you?\nFirst, the simple lens construction means you get tons of spherical aberration. In other words, you get a sharpish patch in one area of the image and the image becomes increasingly soft the further you get from there. Old portrait lenses of days of yore frequently had a lot of spherical aberration, which gives the effect of concentrating your attention to the in-focus area (the \"sweet spot). This is a form of selective focus, as can be seen by the fairly sharp seeds in the middle of this sunflower. The Lensbaby\u0092s peripheral blurring also has a sort of streaky motion blur look to it.\nThe Original Lensbaby is pretty blurry with the stops taken out, and moderately sharp in the sweet spot at f/8. The Lensbaby 2.0 is noticeably sharper at wider apertures and can actually be reasonably crisp over a small area.\nSecond, the flexible hose means you focus the lens by squeezing the outer ring and pulling it closer to the camera or pushing it away. There\u0092s nothing precise about this - you just fiddle with the lens until things look right (making it useless for rangefinder cameras). But, more interestingly, the hose can be sort of pushed to the side for a shift effect and pushed down on one side or the other for a tilt effect. In theory this allows you to tilt the plane of focus away from the plane of focus of the camera\u0092s image sensor or film surface, just like on a view camera with tilt/shift capabilities or a tilt-shift lens on a 35mm camera. In reality you can\u0092t really shift the lens all that much, because the rubber tubing doesn\u0092t let you shift sideways very far, so the lens is more useful as a tilt lens. Also, if you push the lens too far when using a full-frame camera you will get some cut-off occurring and the interior of the lens barrel will be visible as a dark area on the edge of the photo.\nThird, at least in the case of the Original Lensbaby, the uncoated lens gives you a ton of flare. (the Lensbaby 2.0 has coated optics, which lessens the amount of flare) Flare is generally undesirable on precision lenses, but does tend to cause glowing haloes around bright areas of the screen, which can be an interesting effect. It also provides for a soft diffuse look to things.\nIn short, you basically get the sort of look that you get with a lot of toy cameras. About the only things you don\u0092t get are light leaks (since those are usually problems in the camera body) and vignetting. And this look can have an interesting effect.\nWhat is the Lensbaby Look?\nThere can be a less literal view of a subject through a Lensbaby, and perhaps even a sense of timelessness. The picture on the right is of the Grand Union Canal in London\u0092s Little Venice. Aside from the fact that the boats are now houseboats and not working boats, this view hasn\u0092t changed much in a century and a half. Original Lensbaby, I think with no aperture ring in place.\n(note - these pictures don\u0092t look that impressive in thumbnail form like this. Click to view the larger size versions, which get the point across more)\nAnother useful aspect to the lens is that, since it tends to blur things outside the sweet spot, you can selectively focus attention on the interesting part of a scene and sort of blur out all the boring stuff.\nThe photo of the traffic lights art installation draws your attention to the walking man and gives a sense of the crowded clutter of the installation. The statue of a boar had a bunch of market stalls behind it, but by using the Lensbaby I was able to blur that background stuff fairly effectively. Both were shot using the Lensbaby 2.0 with an f/4 aperture ring installed.\nBrutally sharp lenses honestly reveal; Lensbabies gently suggest. And this is something that I think a lot of wedding photographers, for example, can appreciate.\nTake this shot of a group of Edwardian-styled rowboats. It\u0092s sort of veering towards cheese, but the gauzy romantic nostalgic thing works here, I think. Taken with an Original Lensbaby. I don\u0092t recall which aperture ring was used.\nSomewhat moodier is this shot of Salvador Dal\u00ed\u0092s tomb. The light levels in the room were extremely low, making ordinary photography very difficult, and I couldn\u0092t set up a tripod. So by using the Lensbaby I sort of masked the problem. The picture\u0092s pretty blurry, but with a Lensbaby it\u0092s going to be a bit blurry anyhow. Original Lensbaby with no aperture ring installed.\nA popular thing with Internet photographers right now is faking tilt-shift lens photos. (inspired by photographers such as Olivo Barbieri of Italy and a Japanese photographer on the bitter*girls Web site, who both use real tilt lenses) This involves taking a regular picture and processing it in Photoshop to simulate the narrow plane of focus that can be an effect of a tilt-shift lens. The result is something which almost looks bizarrely like an incredibly detailed toy or model. A shot of a town square from a tall building, for example, can look like a model railway scene. The Lensbaby can emulate this look since it has genuine, if limited, tilt-shift abilities. Take this photo:\nA vast building which looks almost like a wedding cake model. Lensbaby 2.0 with the f/4 aperture ring.\nOr this fire engine, which looks like a toy. Lensbaby 2.0 with the f/5.6 aperture ring.\nMechanics and using the lens\nUsing a Lensbaby is very different from using an ordinary lens. First, you focus the lens by squeezing it. Generally you hold the camera in both hands and use your left index fingertip and right ring finger to press and manipulate the Lensbaby\u0092s focus ring. Then you press the shutter release with your right index finger. You have to hold the ring in place during the exposure since the rubber hose is made of fairly springy material - the lens reverts to its neutral position when you let go. You can also push the ring outwards slightly away from the camera body to focus on nearer objects, up to a point. The whole thing does look a little amusing in operation, like a bendy snout.\nOnce you get the hang of it it\u0092s fairly easy to focus and move the lens reasonably quickly, though it\u0092s pretty awkward at first.\nThe Lensbaby also differs from modern lenses in that it doesn\u0092t contain any electronics at all. So it can\u0092t communicate anything to a modern electronic camera. I use EOS cameras, which luckily work quite well with such manual focus lenses. You just install them, the camera sets the aperture to \"00\", meaning no electronic lens is installed, you switch to aperture priority mode and off you go.\nThere are two caveats. First, the Lensbaby seems to require exposure compensation on all the EOS cameras I\u0092ve tried it with. In other words, the camera isn\u0092t capable of metering correctly with the Lensbaby in place and you have to dial in some exposure compensation.\nThe amount of compensation required seems to vary. On my 10D, for example, I don\u0092t need to apply much exposure compensation. But on my 5D the camera meters completely wrongly in P mode (massively overexposed - over 2 stops), and meters 1 stop over in Av mode. So installing the Lensbaby does involve a few extra fiddly steps - I have to change to Av mode if I\u0092m not there already, I have to dial in -1 stop exposure compensation and I generally switch to centre-weighted averaging metering. Then, and most critically, I have to remember to undo all that every time I put a normal lens back on. I\u0092ve lost a number of shots because I forgot to set exposure compensation back to normal after changing lenses. Oops. Maybe I should tape a warning onto the Lensbaby cap reading RESET SETTINGS to remind myself.\nSecond, since the aperture is set by means of a physical ring you can\u0092t just set the aperture to whatever you need and go. You have to take the camera, remove the ring and install the one you want. Not difficult, but also not entirely conducive to quick spontaneous shots.\nIncidentally, the EOS method of specifying 00 as the aperture setting for an all-manual lens yields a useful trick. If you\u0092re using a file organization system such as Aperture, Lightroom, iView Multimedia, etc, you can set up a smart folder which displays all photographs with an aperture setting of 0. This automatically shows you every manual lens photo for you.\nDrawbacks and criticisms:\nNo long exposures\nSince the lens has no focusing helicals and has a natural spring to the rubber hose section, you can\u0092t use the lens with long exposure or tripod photography. The lens must be held at the correct focus by your fingers alone. This is fine for simple point and shoot impulsive shots, but it\u0092s obviously a problem for studio or night shots. I thought it might be an interesting approach to use a different type of plastic for the hose, but while I was working on this review, Lensbabies released version 3G of their lens. I haven\u0092t tried one, but the version 3G product uses a number of threaded bolts that you can rotate to adjust the lens position precisely. Which makes the lens look sort of like a tiny version of those frightening metal cages used as bizarre torture implements in SF movies. In other respects it\u0092s said to be identical to the Lensbaby 2.0.\nThe Lensbaby Look\nThe look doesn\u0092t satisfy everybody. Photos taken with the Lensbaby have a very distinctive and easily recognizable look to them, and not everybody likes it. Some dislike the apparent motion to the blurring of the peripheral areas, as can be seen in this shot of a bridge house. The weathervane is perfectly sharp, but the lower section of the photo almost looks like it\u0092s moving. (there\u0092s a lot of coma, which is a lens aberration which causes circles to stretch out into comet-like lines the further you get from the sweet spot)\nOthers dismiss the Lensbaby look as a gimmick that\u0092s time is up. Frankly there\u0092s not much to say to this one - either you like the look or you don\u0092t. Personally, I generally do. It works better for some subjects and compositions than others, obviously, but used right I think it has a rather fun and dreamy look to it. I can definitely see that the huge amount of coma (the blurring that looks almost like motion blur) can turn some people off.\nWhat\u0092s the point?\nSome people don\u0092t get it. After all, you could just Photoshop your photos and get something similar, couldn\u0092t you? Well, sure. You could in theory build up a whole photo, pixel by pixel, if that\u0092s what you wanted. The point isn\u0092t that the look can\u0092t be more or less Photoshopped (I say more or less because the main effect - spherical aberration - can really only be approximated digitally, not perfectly replicated) but that the Lensbabies are fun to use. It\u0092s kind of a nice change to be able to forget about the obsession with sharpness and image quality and whatnot and instead just go for a mood. Lensbabies are a great tool for this.\nFocusing isn\u0092t super easy\nThese lenses are sort of fiddly to focus. I\u0092ve tried the Lensbaby on two digital and one film EOS camera. The film camera is obviously full-frame, and of the two digitals one was full-frame and one was 1.6x. The 1.6x cropped camera, a 10D, had Haoda Fu\u0092s split-circle viewfinder screen installed. The full-frame digital, a 5D, had the stock Canon viewfinder screen. And I find it much easier to focus the lens when there\u0092s a split-circle manual focus assist aid installed. Admittedly it only helps with compositions that have the sweet spot in the middle of the picture, but it\u0092s better than nothing. Even the 5D, which has a pretty bright and large viewfinder, and with a screen that has a decent \"bite\" to its surface, was tricky to focus sometimes. A camera with a small viewfinder, like the EOS Rebel/300 series cameras, can be rather problematic for any manual focusing.\nOver the months that I used the product it definitely became easier, so practice has a lot to do with it. But it can still be tricky, particularly if you\u0092re trying to set the sweet spot off to the edge of the frame. I find it best to fire off a few shots while adjusting the focus pressure and see which one turned out the sharpest.\nMetering complications\nAs noted earlier, metering requires exposure compensation on most cameras. This makes switching back and forth to and from the Lensbaby somewhat time consuming and prone to error.\nFocal length limitations\nThe focal length is somewhat limited at roughly 50mm. This is okay on a full-frame camera. But it can be a bit frustrating on a cropped digital SLR, when the lens suddenly becomes a roughly 75-85mm lens, and the sweet spot becomes much larger. I wish the field of view could be wider, but of course technically that isn\u0092t really possible. SLRs have mirrors which physically prevent the lens from getting too close to the focal plane, and something as inexpensive as a Lensbaby can\u0092t be designed with retrofocus optics like an expensive wide-angle lens. You can slap wide-angle adapters on the lens using the standard 37mm thread on the end, and I\u0092ve certainly tried this, but I find it a bit fiddly and inconvenient.\nWhy spend the money?\nFinally, there\u0092s the criticism that anybody could build their own manual-focus lens like this. Which is of course true. Anybody can take a magnifying glass lens or optical leftover or shaped piece of ice and install it inside a toilet roll tube or rubber plunger or gearshift sleeve and make their own homemade lens. I\u0092ve experimented like this and it\u0092s really fun. But the advantage of the Lensbaby is that the hard work in engineering a reliable and straightforward lens has been done for you. If the process of building and constructing and tinkering it your main interest, then the Lensbaby is obviously not for you.\nOriginal or 2.0?\nThat is the question. Single uncoated element or double element, multicoated? Well, the main difference between the two is the sharpness of the image in the sweet spot and the resistance to flare. The 2.0 is slightly faster, and thus less in a bit more light when the aperture rings are taken out, but it\u0092s not a huge difference. And the magnetic rings are a bit less fiddly to deal with.\nThe main decision making factor, money aside, is whether you prefer the lower contrast and frankly blurrier look of the Original lens or whether you prefer the sharper crisper sweet spot. And to that I can only say - take a look at photos taken with the two lenses and decide which is more likely to suit your needs. Personally I prefer the 2.0 because it\u0092s a bit more versatile, but I do also appreciate the moodier aspects to the Original lens.\nMacro (closeup) kit\nOne of the optional accessories sold by Lensbabies is a macro diopter kit, and Lensbabies supplied me a set to review. The Lensbabies lenses themselves don\u0092t have the greatest close focus distance at around 40 cm (about 20 cm if you push the tube outwards), and so aren\u0092t at all suitable for macro work. Thus this pair of simple diopters - think add-on magnifiers - that can be screwed onto the lenses\u0092 37mm filter mounts. These allow an increase in the close focus distance and, unlike extension tubes, don\u0092t really cost much by the way of light.\nThe two diopters ship in a black vinyl carrying case. And frankly the build quality of the diopters doesn\u0092t match the standards of the lenses. They\u0092re made of inexpensive metal, and the machining on the threads is not particularly accurate. Compared to the Lensbaby lens cap, which threads smoothly and confidently onto the lens, I kind of cringe attaching the diopters. First, they\u0092re difficult to align and get started and it\u0092s easy to cross-thread them. And second, it just feels like the sharp uneven edges of the diopter are grinding down the lens filter threads. The singlet glass elements are uncoated.\nIn terms of magnification, the two diopters have values of +4 and +10 respectively, and can be stacked. What does this mean in real life? Well, I attached my Original Lensbaby to my full-frame EOS 5D and peered through the viewfinder at a ruler. This gives a sense of the closest magnification possible. The horizontal width of a frame of 35mm film is 36mm (the frame is 24 by 36mm in size; 35mm refers to the width of the film itself). So if you can take a photo of something 36mm wide with a lens then you\u0092ve got a true 1:1 macro lens. Most consumer lenses never get that close, and typically have ratios closer to 1:4.\nWidth\n"}, {"score": 178.93518, "uuid": "44135cda-8022-5eff-b79d-88e29728b3e0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-74-17879", "target_hostname": "www.photoclubalpha.com", "target_uri": "http://www.photoclubalpha.com/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.174649e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Photoclubalpha - Part 2", "snippet": "Kodak did manage to do things within the digital world, from their 1994 Chinon-based first consumer <em>camera</em> to the demise of the DCS Pro 14 megapixel full-frame Canon and <em>Nikon</em> bodies <em>a</em> little <em>over</em> twenty years later.", "explanation": null, "document": "Sony\u2019s Zeiss 24mm f/2 Distagon ZA SSM T* reviewed\nBy admin, on December 28th, 2011\nThe Sony Zeiss 24mm f/2 SSM Distagon ZA T* is probably the best, or equal to the best, in its class. It may perhaps be the best ever 84\u00b0 angle fast lens ever made for the general SLR system market, and I would happy to pitch it against any of the current equivalent offerings for medium format digital.\nThe initial journey with the 24mm f/2 was not one of intensive companionship \u2013 I am long past the stage of getting hold of a wonderful lens and then shoehorning all my photographs into that lens\u2019s view just because I love the glass. I\u2019ve been through that phase. I remember when I was 18 and my then fianc\u00e9e (Shirley \u2013 still here!) bought me a brand new 35mm f/3.5 SMC Takumar, my first ever multicoated lens as well as my first new boxed product. I shot almost everything with that lens for a month\u2026\nA full-frame Alpha 900 study at full f/2 aperture. Check the sharpness in the central \u2013 very limited \u2013 sharp focus zone by clicking the image for a full size version.\nMy review of the 24mm appears in the British Journal of Photography for January 2012 but was written in November, and at the end I comment that I do not think I would buy one. Well, between writing that and publication \u2013 after returning the test lens loaned to me by Paul Genge of Sony UK \u2013 I placed my order. I sold a set of lenses including a 28mm f/2 Minolta RS and a 17-35mm Konica Minolta D to pay for it.\nCheck current availability and price at B&H Photo Video (opens in a new window will not lose this page).\nWhy?\nIt was partly medium format which persuaded me. I\u2019ve been experimenting with MF digital, first using a Hasselblad with a Phase One P20 and then shifting to a Mamiya 645 AFII with a 22 megapixel ZD 37 x 49mm back. Once you put the Zeiss on the Alpha 900, the image quality jumps to match the level of a similar MF pixel count. And without spending into the tens of thousands you can\u2019t match the angle of view at a higher pixel count.\nThese two cameras both shoot 22 megapixels over a 16 x 12\u2033 print shape (the Alpha 900 being cropped) and both were current in 2008 \u2013 though the Mamiya ZD model was shortly to disappear. And the two lenses have similar coverage.\nI looked at the corners of my MF shots on a 35mm lens (nearly identical angle of view) \u2013 to be clean, they demanded f/11. And then I looked at the corners on the Zeiss, which are even cleaner by f/4. Finally, I considered what Sony may have in store \u2013 36 megapixels on full frame. Everything I\u2019ve seen from the 24mm \u2013 including its performance on the A77 and A55 \u2013 indicates it will not run out of resolution even if full frame goes well over 50 megapixels.\nThen I had the job of looking back over the Alpha 900, Alpha 55 and Alpha 77 pictures taken with the 24mm, and preparing some comparison shots. This was when I realised that my normal line-up of zooms, no matter how good, never got the same from any camera \u2013 APS-C or full frame \u2013 as this CZ prime. It may be bulky, take large filters, and cost nearly \u00a31,000 but no other solution on any format from NEX through A77 to MF offered the same as the 24mm on Alpha 900. You will, however, be surprised later on to see just how well the tiny NEX 16mm f/2.8 does in comparison when both lenses are stopped down to f/8.\nThe 35mm 2:3 format shape offers a bit of vertical composition \u2018rise or fall\u2019 potential compared to to 3:4 shape of my Mamiya with 35mm wide\u2013angle.\u00a0Beyond this, the 24mm offers both CD and PD focus with different adaptors on the NEX system, and smooth near-silent AF during video on the Alpha 65/77 and future models. It\u2019s both future-proof and a future classic.\nPhotojournalism or architecture\nBecause the 24mm has a fast f/2 maximum aperture, it\u2019s seen as a choice for news, documentary, reportage, sports, and close quarters party or family shooting. Though a little vulnerable because of its size, it does this job well. Unlike tele lenses, any mark on the front glass of a wide-angle like this will show in pictures when the aperture is stopped down. Special care should always be taken of retrofocus and fisheye lenses with vulnerable front elements, my own lens will get a Sigma EX DG 72mm UV filter. Why Sigma? I ran a series of ad hoc tests on filters and these turned out to be just as good as Hoya Pro 1 Digital at half the price, and with better multicoating.\nAt f/2, struggling with light for a hand-held shot with 1/40th at ISO 1600 on the Alpha 55, the 24mm showed surprisingly clean imaging from the boat to the lights on the cliff top.\nHere\u2019s a shot taken at f/2.5, 2/3rds of a stop down from wide open \u2013 a sensible aperture to give that hint of extra depth of field and improved optical performance. Click the image to view a full size A55 image on pBase.\nWhen fitted to my A55 or A77, the 35mm-equivalent field of view is also a good general lens for photojournalism (what you get is more or less a Fuji X100 equivalent, but hardly pocketable). The performance over the APS-C field of view is so good that working at full aperture carries little penalty at all except restricted depth of field. The geometry and field flatness over the restricted field mean \u00a0you could use the lens for artwork copying and get a better result than the 50mm f/1.4 of 30mm f/2.8 SAM macro will produce.\nOver full frame, this technical excellence makes the lens attractive to the commercial, industrial and architectural photographer. Whenever you need to apply a strong software correction, focal length figures are thrown out of the window. For example, once the on-board lens correction in the A77 is applied to the 16-50mm f/2.8 SSM lens at 16mm the true minimum focal length equivalent becomes close to 17mm not 16mm.\nHasselblad\u2019s 28mm superwide for its HD series cameras has strong barrel distortion, relying on in-camera and Phocus raw software converter functions to remove it. So while the lens claims to be a 17mm equivalent, that is only true over absolute full-frame 645. On their digital sensors, it\u2019s only equal to a 21mm and the correction means the true crop is more like a 23mm.\nA second effect of applying any in-camera or post-process distortion correction is loss of true image pixels. Either you crop the frame after sampling down, or the image is interpolated upwards to fill the frame. Both solutions are far from satisfactory because unlike a fixed interpolation, the value ranges from 0 to whatever maximum is involved (typically between 3% and 7%) and all of this is never a clean ratio.\nAbove: a sea horizon (the top of the crop is the top of the frame, and it is full width). Top, CZ 16-80mm at 16mm 0n Alpha 77, uncorrected, showing complex wave-form distortion as well as vignetting despite stopping down to f/11. Centre: CZ 24mm on Alpha 900, uncorrected, at f/13. Bottom: 24mm after applying a 2% barrel distortion correction. Click image to view a larger version.\nHere the 24mm CZ shines. It really uses all the 24 megapixels of the A900 or indeed the A77, because geometric correction rarely needs to be applied. It has a true 24mm focal length which does not need to be quietly changed to 25mm or 26mm by applying a lens profile. If a 35mm retrofocus AF lens was made for MF digital to this standard, even without the f/2 aperture, it would be hailed as a world-beater. The most that\u2019s needed is a correction of 2% (+, removing barrel distortion) in Adobe Camera Raw and this restores something like a sea horizon near the top of a landscape format frame to a perfect straight line.\nNo correction is applied here to this full frame 24mm Alpha 900 image \u2013 a central horizon, and straight lines which are not parallel to the frame edge, make the 2% distortion (similar to many standard 50mm lenses) no issue at all.\nFor many subjects, depending on the distance and a \u2018rigour\u2019 of the shot (the sea horizon is the most demanding example) no correction at all will be needed. This applies to most interiors, and always to scenes like mountain views or forest landscapes where there is no perfectly flat horizon.\nThe Alpha 900 is so close to MF digital quality I should really forget the attractions of MF systems. Nearly everything I see from them which impresses me is down to using prime lenses of first quality like the Zeiss and Mamiya 80mm f/2.8 standards and working in a methodical way often using a tripod, minimum ISO, mirror-up operation. Applying the same parameters to Alpha full frame lifts the end result to match \u2013 and the CZ 24mm f/2 is a key to unlock that quality.\nAt f/14, the 24mm is not losing detail sharpness on the Alpha 900 as long as the correct raw processing parameters are applied. To secure this depth of field, f/14 was needed \u2013 a medium format camera would require f/27. Holding the camera, viewing and composing this shot were all aided by the ergonomics, weight and viewfinder quality of the Alpha 900. Click image for a full size version on pBase.\nThis is a dual-purpose or multi-purpose lens. Where the 16mm focal length of the NEX SEL 16mm f/2.8, the Alpha SAL 16-50mm f/2.8, the CZ 16-80mm or SAL 16-105mm all cover the same nominal angle not one of these has the same neutral geometry, even illumination and good corner to corner sharpness at wider apertures. Corrected by software, they don\u2019t have the same true angle and the outer field can become noisy because of extra sensor-mapping gain applied to reduce vignetting.\nThe size and SEL comparison!\nBut I would like to show you something surprising. I am a great fan of the 16mm NEX f/2.8 pancake, which is one of the few such lenses made to have a positive (pincushion) simple distortion pattern and a cup not cap shaped field of focus. It is a revolutionary inverted telephoto design of great simplicity, with only 5 elements, enabling the lens to be 16mm focal length yet have a rear node position over 20mm from the sensor \u2013 thus avoiding all kinds of vignetting and colour shift problems.\nPeople who don\u2019t understand how to use a focus plane where the corners are focused FURTHER than the centre \u2013 the exact opposite of the CZ 24mm f/2 where the corners are focused CLOSER than the centre \u2013 do tests like landscapes wide open and wonder why the grass either side of their feet dissolves into blur. Actually all the little 16mm needs is modest stopping down, as would be applied by any professional using a Super Angulon for that matter, to f/8.\nFirst of all, have a look at some lens sizes. I like this shot, as it shows just how big CZ had to make the 24mm to get what they did. It dwarfs the SEL 16mm for NEX and the classic Minolta 28mm f/2 RS:\nI\u2019d like you to see the exact comparison between Alpha 900 with 24mm CZ and NEX-5 with SEL 16mm.\nThis is the A900 and 24mm, entirely uncorrected and uncropped \u2013 the building on the right actually does not have a straight wall, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking there\u2019s a sudden burst of barrel distortion! Aperture f/8.\nThis the NEX with 16mm, corrected in ACR; I\u2019ve tried to keep the camera positions very close but this was real-time shooting and with viewfinder versus screen composition, not so easy. You can see that the 16mm has slightly less true angle of view when corrected but don\u2019t judge from the foreground flower tub, just check the horizontal angle. This is also at f/8.\nYou can click each image and view a full size JPEG. I have made both of them 24 megapixels, exporting from the NEX to the same size file as the Alpha 900. That may be unfair but you can judge. My opinion is that both the NEX 14 megapixel sensor and the SEL 16mm are underestimated by far too many owners; as far as ISO noise handling goes, the 16mm f/2.8 on NEX is actually as \u2018fast\u2019 as the 24mm f/2 on Alpha 900 but that comparison may change with future full frame bodies. As for depth of field, the f/8 shot on APS-C would need to be at f/13 on full frame to match, but in practice both are well covered.\nUsing the NEX 16mm in different conditions would produce a different result \u2013 wide open in a room interior, the corners would be likely to look very blurred. My scene above conforms to the cup-shape focus plane of the NEX lens, and works against the cap-shape focus plane of the CZ 24mm.\nRemember as a general rule: barrel distortion = corners focused close than centre. Pincushion distortion = corners focused further away than centre. Moustache or wave form = a doughnut normally of closer focus between centre and corners, but when a full frame lens with this type of distortion (like the 16-35mm CZf/2.8 \u2013 or a more extreme example, Canon\u2019s 24-105mm f/4 L) is used on APS-C, you get this doughnut at the corners and more or less have straight barrel distortion not waveform. No distortion at a given distance usually means a flat focus field, the quality which Carl Zeiss highlighted when naming the Planar lens.\nAlternatives to the 24mm\nThe best way to get the 84\u00b0 coverage with similar near-perfect rendering is to go for the mid-range of a high end zoom. As it happens, Sigma\u2019s 8-16mm is better at 16mm than any of the above-mentioned APS-C options and you can also get a pretty good 16mm from their 10-20mm options and Tamron\u2019s 10-24mm. Tokina\u2019s 11-16mm f/2.8 is weakest at 16mm, best at 11mm. The older Sony 11-18mm is not wonderful at the longer end.\nOn full format, 24mm at the bottom end of the 24-70mm CZ is no match, it has more distortion and softer corners; 24mm in the middle of the 16-35mm CZ f/2.8\u2032s range is better but with strong complex distortion, more even than the Konica Minolta 17-35mm f/2.8-4 D lens (which manages f/3.2 wide open at 24mm). You might think Sigma\u2019s 12-24mm full frame zoom could be good at 24mm, and perhaps version II HSM when it finally become available for Alpha will prove to be. The original, which I still use mainly for its superb 12mm results, places its worst extreme of field flatness deviation at the image edge when set to 24mm.\nI have used Canon\u2019s 24mm f/1.4 USMII and this is faster, larger and more expensive than the Sony CZ lens in almost perfect proportion. Like the CZ f/2 it is a nearly perfect lens, with a hint more barrel distortion and slightly soft extreme corners on full frame wide open. The same goes for the Nikon 24mm f/1.4. I\u2019ve also used Canon\u2019s 24mm TSE tilt-shift and this lens betters the CZ for technical and architectural uses, as it should \u2013 so does their 17mm f/4 TSE, which has no match in any format. But such lenses can\u2019t also be used for everyday autofocus image grabbing whether professional or family.\nLast question, then. If such a perfect lens can be made at f/2, surely all the affordable 24mm f/2.8 designs could be just as good? We wish! Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the classic Minolta 24mm f/2.8 AF which Sony never transferred to the new Alpha range proved to have the same optical excellence as the CZ? It does not. Nor do the Canon 24mm f/2.8, or the Nikon, or anything made by Pentax or Olympus, or even Leica.\nThe 24mm f/2 used at f/2.8 on the Alpha 55. Try this with a classic Minolta 24mm f/2.8 and even on APS-C you won\u2019t get the same corner to corner even illumination. Here the focus is on the distance, not the tourists \u2013 they are also showing a surprising amount of movement at 1/40th. Click the image for a full size view.\nThis 24mm is the most recent AF 24mm prime lens to have been designed for full format. Zeiss have designed a slightly more complex manual focus 25mm f/2 Distagon for Cosina partnered manufacture, available for Canon and Nikon, since Sony showed the 24mm at photokina 2010. But Sony\u2019s full-frame DSLR rivals, Canon and Nikon, have not gone for this sub-\u00a31,000 RRP \u2018moderately fast\u2019 24mm niche.\nIf there\u2019s one competitor, it is Sigma\u2019s excellent 24mm f/1.8 EX DG, which uses a larger 77mm front diameter glass unit to reduce vignetting to the absolute minimum. Distortion is higher, and the lens at present has no HSM version. This makes it less future-proof for Alpha system owners, and also less compatible with NEX and with video shooting in general.\nFeatures of the 24mm\nBecause it\u2019s a fixed focal length, the 24mm is a very plain lens \u2013 it has only two controls and one moving ring. There is an AF/MF switch, though unlike SAM lenses this lens can always be controlled from the body. With SAM type lenses (built in non-supersonic focus motor) it is essential to use only the lens switch, and never to use the body switch instead while leaving the lens set to AF. This is because any attempt to focus manually may damage the gears and motor unless the switch on the lens is specifically disengaged.\nManual focus or held focus can be set or toggled using the single on-lens button. New Alpha models like the 77 allow a wider range of functions to be assigned to the lens button, which is described in the menus as a Focus Hold button. Direct Manual Focus is also supported on bodies which offer DMF, meaning that once focus is confirmed and locked by your pressure on the shutter button, you can fine-tune focus by eye before firing.\nThe manual focus action is very smooth and well balanced, not too light and not too short in throw (which can be an issue with shorter focal lengths. The focus scale is minimal, behind a traditional Minolta-style clear window, with a depth of field indicator to the minimum f/22 aperture. Really, such markings mean little today as we expect so much from higher resolution sensors. It is time that Sony, and others, built parameter-governed DoF calculation into firmware.\nHere, f/5.6 was judged to be fine for the degree of differential focus wanted \u2013 at ISO 400, by tungsten kitchen spotlights and window light mixed, on the Alpha 77 hand-held with SteadyShot and manual \u2018peaking\u2019 focus.\nThe CZ design is clearly corrected for medium distance work but retains its performance for close-ups. Unlike Sigma\u2019s design which achieves 1:2.7 image scale, or the new manual Zeiss 25mm which focuses down to 18cm and 1:4, the Alpha lens focuses to 19cm (actually, I make it 18cm as the scale goes beyond the 19cm marking) and manages a 1:3.4 image. Don\u2019t be fooled by distances! The front element of the CZ is already 12.2cm from the sensor plane, and the lens hood takes another 3cm or so. The actual clearance when shooting at close range is minimal. For comparison, the SEL 16mm f/2.8 for NEX will only focus down to 24cm, and the front of this lens is only 40mm from the sensor, leaving a clear 20cm between camera and subject. The Nikon and Canon f/1.4 designs are limited to 25cm and are, quite simply, nothing like as useful for close-ups as the CZ.\nYou might think that the 16-50mm f/2.8 or the 16-80mm CZ could match the combination of wide angle and close focus found on the 24mm \u2013 but not so. To get similar close-ups even at a 24mm setting is not possible \u2013 an extra 6 or 7cm in minimum focus distance, when you are talking an 83-84\u00b0 angle of view, makes a big difference.\nMoving in to minimum focus, the bottom wing of the lens hood was only 1cm away from the subject \u2013 under 19cm from bread roll to sensor, but only 6.8cm from bread roll to front element. At f/3.2, a hand-held 1/40th was needed (the closer you get, the less you can rely on SS to handle speeds like 1/15th). Focus peaking again enabled the manual focus point to be precisely judged. Great bokeh too.\nWith a non-rotating front thread, 72mm is one of the classic Minolta sizes. It is necessary to use slimline filters, as with the 20mm f/2.8. It\u2019s interesting to compare the revived older lens with the newer one. The 20mm has only five mount contacts, being non-D specification where the 24mm has eight and reports much more accurate focus data. The 20mm has no lens button, uses screw drive focus, and has a close limit of 25cm at which it has a 1:7.7 image scale. There is also a considerable difference in the build and feel of the CZ; I have no doubt it contains some plastic, but it feels like a good solid piece of engineering and is stated by Sony to have a metal lens barrel. Not metal-skinned plastic, like NEX lenses.\nAs for coatings, Minolta\u2019s legacy was a use of multiple layer (super achromatic) coatings to rebalance both the contrast and the colour transmission of the entire AF lens range (except designs made by third parties, like the 100-400mm APO). This advantage over other makes was never capitalised on, and made some Minolta designs seem lower in contrast than competitor\u2019s equivalents. No-one ever complained about the colour though! Zeiss\u2019s path from 1975 onwards was to use multicoatings a different way, maximising contrast and light transmission but permitting each lens design to have its own colour transmission quality and variation in contrast. Contax RTS lenses were always praised for their resistance to flare and their extreme macrocontrast.\nSince the advent of digital, both overall contrast and colour transmission have become less critical \u2013 no need for packs of filters to balance lenses for repro purposes, no need to test Kodachrome with a clip-test to set this up. Just post process or shoot a WB card to taste. Also, Sony Alpha lenses are made in many places \u2013 the old Minolta unit, the new CZ-Sony collaboration, co-developed with Tamron and apparently also with Sigma, built by Shanghai Optical or some other owned and partnership facilities in China, made in Thailand but not apparently any more in Malaysia\u2026\nWhile distortion associated with viewpoint and perspective perception is always a companion to shorter focal lengths, over the field of the Alpha 77 (equal to a 35mm lens view or so, in full-frame terms) shapes and solids look natural. At f/4, and ISO 1250, I\u2019ve chosen to downsize this 77 file to 3600 x 2400 pixels (click the image to open). This still allows you to see how clean the light sources in-shot are, with absence of colour fringes. Depending on conditions 1 pixel CA cancelling may be needed with the 24mm.\nSo, we have here a lens with a Zeiss design and a T* coating which is entirely unlike any Minolta legacy design and will surprise those used to the way ex-Minolta lenses perform. It is fairly immune to flare, not entirely so when confronted with bright sources just outside the image margin, but without the strings of coloured patches associated with 24mms and light sources in the shot. It focuses silently and at a speed which means you may not notice it.\nThe lens itself weighs 555g, and at 76mm length and 78mm diameter it\u2019s smaller than the 16-50mm f/2.8 SSM which weighs 22g more. I\u2019m not a big fan of lenses you can not clasp in one hand while also operating the lens release mount of a camera; optics this size and weight are about the safe limit. You can not compared the lens-juggling friendliness of the 28mm f/2, for example, with either the 24mm or 16-50mm and even the 16-80mm zoom is much easier to handle in the field. It\u2019s best to remove or fit the hood before changing the lens, don\u2019t leave it in storage position.\nThe hood reverses over the lens neatly. The whole item, when in this configuration, is a bit large to handle for safe and secure lens changing.\nThe finish is lustrous, with rubber rib grips that collect dust and dander readily. The supplied lens hood is surprisingly flexible plastic, with a slight spatter finish to the exterior and a kind of semi-flock paint on the inside. It is efficient, but a poor fit with a not very firm bayonet locking action. It\u2019s easy to get the alignment wrong and it\u2019s not as firm or solid as most other Sony hoods. The rear lens cap is still the frustrating one-orientation only design inherited from Minolta, which leaves even those with a quarter of a century of lenscap-fitting experience fumbling for the correct position.\nThere is of course a Zeiss front lens cap and you get a free blue badge on the lens itself!\nFormat, pixel count and cropping\nFor many years when using film I found wide-angle zooms were not essential, standard zooms were useful, and tele zooms were vital. Generally, with any wide-angle you can zoom with your feet or by doing little more than leaning forward or back a bit. Either that or you simply need the widest lens you can get. Whenever I fit my Sigma 8-16mm or 12-24mm on their respective formats it\u2019s the 8mm or 12mm end which is needed. I only end up zooming in if for some reason I decide to leave the lens on, and move to a different situation without time to switch lenses.\nWith film, you could crop and enlarge. Small pixel count DSLRs made that difficult or impossible \u2013 when you are trying to make 6 megapixels do a full page magazine image, cropping is not an option. Zooming in to fill the frame every time became vital from 2000 to 2008 when the first full frame 24 megapixel models arrived.\nI think that 24 megapixels has finally made cropping an alternative to zooming. You may need 9 or maybe 12 megapixels, or if you are shooting entirely for the web you may need no more than 2 megapixels. Fixed focal lengths of exceptional quality, sharp all over the frame in the plane of focus, start to be useful. It has never been a good option to crop wide-angle zoom shots asymmetrically, using just one corner. With a lens like the 24mm you can crop any composition out of the high resolution frame and it will not look so different from an on-axis shot with a narrow angle lens.\nLens resolution really does count, as I have found. For three years I used the Alpha 900 with a range of lenses, including the 24-85mm Minolta RS I keep for convenience. When working with medium format lenses on adaptors, I could see that zooms while \u2018sharp enough\u2019 usually came nowhere near realising the potential of the 900. Then, using the 24mm, I saw the same pixel-level sharpness pop out. After a month using the 24mm (kindly loaned by Paul Genge) my ordered Alpha 77 finally arrived. I had already seen how the 24mm got the maximum from 16 megapixel APS-C, and this was followed by discovering its power to do the same at 24 megapixel APS-C.\nA standard Sony leather-look lens posing pouch is supplied.\nHow far can this go? If Sony\u2019s 24 megapixel APS-C sensor formed the basis for a full-framer, it would be a 60 megapixel monster and match all but the most expensive medium format image sizes. I believe the 24mm CZ could go there if Sony chose to.\nAnd that, in the end, is why I changed my mind about owning one. The hour or two of useful daylight and howling gales outside have not allowed me to make much use of it yet \u2013 but this is a lens for the long term. And for tomorrow\u2019s Alphas as well as today\u2019s.\n- David Kilpatrick\n"}], [{"score": 170.51761, "uuid": "15678c84-dc0f-57cc-8a18-04e0f41ce2bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0901wb-75-06201", "target_hostname": "heyhotshot.com", "target_uri": "http://heyhotshot.com/blog/index65.html", "page_rank": 1.2935941e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "The Hey, Hot Shot!

Obviously then if you just play statistics, the more frames you shoot, the better your odds one of them will be sharp.\nThe only caution I'd have is that the shutter life on any camera isn't infinite. I don't know of any tests on the 10D, but I think the projected life is around 50,000 shutter cycles. I know the EOS-3 has a projected life of 100,000 cycles, but in actual tests performed by Chaseur d'Image magazine it went for almost 450,000 before failure. Some shutters will fail early, some will fail late, you just don't know. With film and 450,000 shutter cycles you'd have to shoot 10 rolls of film a day, every day, for about 3.5 years to wear out a shutter. With digital and 50,000 shutter cycles and enthusiastic shooter firing off 9 frame bursts could get there pretty fast!\nI believe shutter replacement costs are around $200-$250 - though I've personally never had to have one repaired (yet..)\nGary Berg , July 08, 2003; 12:18 P.M.\nThis is the same technique that Nikon uses with their \"BSS\" setting on their Coolpix series, isn't it? I believe Nikon uses a 3-shot burst and takes the best/largest.\nStill, it is a very effective technique to improve sharpness, and this shows an easy way to do this with almost any digital camera.\nLeonard Richmond , July 08, 2003; 02:32 P.M.\nSimilar results can be obtained using the self timer. Using the 2 second on my p&s digital allows me to avoid the inevitable movement coming from squeezing the shutter release and greatly increases the length of time I can have the shutter open. Perhaps combining the 2 methods, 2 second self timer plus a burst of several frames, would give the best of both worlds.\nLeonard Richmond , July 08, 2003; 02:32 P.M.\nSimilar results can be obtained using the self timer.

There's a number of \"proper techniques\" that do work but not everyone can manage and those with shakey hands such as my father is could benefit from this. Although he usually steadies the camera against his face and avoids the shaking problem that way.\nW J Gibson\n, July 08, 2003; 10:59 P.M.\nOne other area where the burst mode may help --- a family of geese and goslings on my shore - lying down behind a retaining wall - Coolpix5700 with digital zoom on, and zoomed out just slightly not much beyond 1.0 - hand held burst shots. I got a few good frames using this technique. Much better results than I have had using a bit of digital zoom with single shots.\nAdrian Bratt , July 09, 2003; 04:34 A.M.\nThe Poor Man's IS?\nThat would be a TRIPOD. :-)\nAdrian\ncsab' j\u00f3zsa , July 09, 2003; 04:53 A.M.\nI agree with Adrian,above:) practicing this with a film camera, you'll *become* a poor man quickly. However, I used this technique(well...i was happy with 3 shots in the burst) in cases when the light was really low and i *really* wanted to be sure that I'll get one decent, sharp frame. It worked.\nChris Combs , July 09, 2003; 06:19 A.M.\nNikon's BSS allows you to take as many frames as will fit in the buffer; on my 995, I believe this is either 8 or 10 frames.\nrichard harris , July 09, 2003; 08:54 A.M.\nWell, I guess I should have said it in the article, but I also totally agree with the tripod comment - I always use one where possible, it's always the best option. This is just for those few times when it isn't possible to use one.\nRegarding good technique, just out of curiosity Carl (and whoever), with your best technique what sort of results are consistently achievable? Can you go 1 or 2 stops beneath the 1/focal length rule? Personally my technique is certainly not up to that but I would be curious to hear what others can do.\nDerek Stanton , July 09, 2003; 10:00 A.M.\nThis is semi-interesting, but i have a question about part of this process that seems to have been accepted by all.... The image with the greater sharpness will be a larger file size? Because of the compression? I was of the impression that the digital camera creates a file size based on the parameters of the image grade selected. Based on the pixel dimension. I'm astonished to hear that a sharper image provides more information. I would think that within a 2200x1600 frame, it wouldn't matter what was depicted, nor how blurry.... Similarly, would this mean that a photograph of clouds or moving water would be a smaller file size than a photograph of something highly detailed (\"praying mantis on a brocade sofa\")?\nPaul Elliott , July 09, 2003; 10:39 A.M.\nImage detail is what increases the file size. If you take a 512x512 image that is a solid color and save it as a highest quality JPG, then add heavy noise and save as a highest quality JPG, you'll see this effect taken to extremes.\n(So yes, measuring the level of compression is a good indicator of how sharp the image is when comparing a sequence of shots of the same scene)\nHisham Atallah , July 09, 2003; 11:20 A.M.\nI heard somebody claim that the battery grip can buy him an extra stop handheld. Has anybody tried this?\nJay Scott , July 09, 2003; 11:23 A.M.\nI know two image processing ideas for improving images that suffer camera shake. 1. For a single image, if you can make reasonable mathematical assumptions about the nature of the image detail, it is possible for software to estimate from the image data a model of how the camera moved, and to use that model to find an improved image that could have been created if the camera had been steady. This is relying on the fact that when the camera shakes, every pixel of the original scene is smeared into the resulting image in a predictable and consistent way. I have seen research papers about this, and I was astonished when I could not find a Photoshop plugin that does it. 2. If you have a set of images, typically each of those conveys some information about the original scene which the other images in the set do not. A suitable algorithm can combine the images into a new one that includes all the information, and is sharper than any single image in the set. I have seen this done as a way to \"beat the camera's limitations\" for things like landscape photos, but never as a way to reduce the effects of camera shake. By combining this with idea 1, it should be possible to get an image which is considerably better than the best image in the set.\nNathan Whitaker , July 09, 2003; 11:54 A.M.\nCan anyone point me (and others who are trying to improve their technique) to any resources explaining the best handholding techniques?\nany advice would be appreciated\nPeter Langfelder , July 09, 2003; 12:32 P.M.\nPoor man's IS? Let's see - either you use a $1500 digital camera (plus several hundred $ more for required accessories) or you burn 5-10 times as much film as you would otherwise. Neither sounds like a solution for a poor person to me.\nI have tried the technique a few times when I didn't have my tripod with me, and to some degree it works - but a cheap $40 tripod is still a far better and cheaper solution.\nDean G , July 09, 2003; 03:38 P.M.\nThis is a technique I'm unfamiliar with, and despite the drawbacks which apparently preclude frequent use, it seems like a great tool to have in your back pocket when you can't or don't want to use a tripod. For my digital P&S in particular where ISO choices top out at a noisy 400, and that I use as a pocket/street camera, I plan to experiment at that and some lower speeds. In most low light cases with the 10D, I would still prefer to use a tripod and/or the higher ISOs that are quite usable on this camera. Thanks for posting this article.\nAns Beaulieu , July 09, 2003; 06:14 P.M.\nI am often travelling on business trip where a tripod would be out of the question, so I came up with the same technique on my 10D. I'm even getting good pictures at 1/2\" exposition hand held (Chicago Tribune). I've also experimented hand held with the timer trigger and the remote with no tripod, but the easiest and most convenient with digital camera is burst shooting.\nImage Attachment: 00031_RT16 .jpg\nMike Kelly , July 09, 2003; 06:20 P.M.\nJay - Your proposed algorithms describe what I believed digital image stabilisation does, as commonly found on digital video cameras, and cheaper digital still cameras. I think that IS lenses use a mechanical / optical solution. Don't know whether this is inherently better quality, or just a legacy from non-digital SLRs. Given that the software does exist out there in other devices I wonder why it isn't an option on a camera like the 10D.\nThis quote from dpreview (http://www.dpreview.com/learn/Glossary/Optical/Image_Stabilisation_01.htm) doesn't explain why:\nImportant footnote: Only Optical Stabilisation will work for digital still cameras, digital image stabilisation (seen on some \"lesser\" digital video cameras) works by pixel shifting the image (not something that will work for a digital still camera).\nIgor Ivanov , July 09, 2003; 10:52 P.M.\nInteresting, and has a scientific explanation :-). When the camera shakes, its movement is approximately periodical and you have points of zero and maximum speed. Hitting the shutter release several times, you are more likely to get closer to a moment when the speed is zero.\nAn alternative image enhancement technique is using several shots of the same scene and special software. The resulting image is sharper than any of the originals.\nThe real value of your finding - if you are the first - is that it is very simple and you have formulated it. Congrats.\nIgor\nDer Jan , July 10, 2003; 01:37 A.M.\nOn a 6x7 medium format and a 120 film that would be one photo per film ;-)\nTomaz Levstek , July 10, 2003; 03:23 A.M.\nI use this technique often, when I don't have tripod and need a shot at low light. I just didn't know about the file size. It's logical but didn't quite put two and two together. :) Thanks.\nAxel Farr , July 10, 2003; 08:19 A.M.\nNot really an IS,\nbut what you describe in your article has a very simple background: Most of the shake, additional movement and vibration comes to a still camera exactly in the moment, when you take the image. You press the shutter, the camera moves the mirror upwards and the shutter is opened. The second and third can not be influenced by the cameraman, but the first can. There are some things to avoid for good, sharp handhold images:\n1. you have to control camera shake. This means, holding the camera firmly gives sharper images than holding it with rather loose grip. To a minimum of camera shake, a good stand and e.g. the arms rested on your body or on a tree etc. are further improvements.\n2. you have to press the shutter in a soft and smoth movement. Most shutter releases are designed that way that the release is done _before_ the button is in its mechanical end position. So with a smoth move, the camera will have its image taken bevor your finger reaches the mechanical stop of the release movement, so extra disturbing is avoided.\nIf you doing series shots, than the chances are not bad that you can have one or two of the images taken in a moment of relative rest, but you still can improve your images with a better hand-hold technique.\nI have a lot of shots taken with twice the inverse of focal length, beeing sharp enought to be viewed in a slide projection. Maybe not totally sharp, but getting a good handhold technique is always good even for cases when the \"1/f\"-rule is perfectly matched or far bypassed by the lighting conditions.\nGreetings, Axel\nJoe Garrick , July 10, 2003; 08:20 A.M.\nMy hands shake more than Shakira's backside, but my tripod is rock steady, and doesn't waste film or burn through shutters. Use a monopod where a tripod isn't convenient.\nAns Beaulieu , July 10, 2003; 12:31 P.M.\nI have a tripod, a monopod, steady hands, I use rocks, walls or anything that can steady my aim but frankly, I still use burst shooting very often. Even when you control your breathing and the way you push on the shutter this technique is still useful to \"push the limit\".\nTripod and monopod are great but there is a lot of occasions where it is not practical or even prohibited to use them. Have you been in a crowded city where shoplifting is a national sport? Have you been in museums, aquarium, music shows, bars or special event? Have you travelled light and with minimal gear where photography was not the purpose of the trip? So for all the \"pro\" out there, kindly stop saying tripod this and monopopd that, you are missing the point. This technique is for when you don't have anything better and believe me it has it use.\nPeter Foiles\n, July 10, 2003; 11:58 P.M.\nJust to note that if you are shooting raw you do not need to extract the jpeg to check for size as a measure of sharpness. The size of the raw file itself changes in the same way (it is compressed losslessly). I was just doing some lens tests and the raw file size consistantly increased as I stopped down the lenses.\nTodd Roseman\n, July 11, 2003; 03:05 A.M.\nTip: To compare the frames in-camera, zoom in to max zoom on preview screen and then use the Main Dial near the shutter release to go through the burst images. The preview screen keeps the zoom location for each. Pick the best and discard the rest.\n(in case someone didn't catch this in the manual, like me)\nTodd MacDonald , July 11, 2003; 04:36 A.M.\nMaybe everyone knows of this, but as a newbie I thouht it was a pretty good addition to the \"poor mans\" IS bag of tricks. Everyone knows resting a camera on a unipod adds some degree of stability, but what if you reverse the force....pull up instead of push.\nIn other words, attach the camera to a line to the ground and pull up. I found (from the grandfather of a Swiss friend of mine) that wrapping a line around your lens, (or attach it to a quick release on the camera's bottom) standing on the other end of the line and pulling up adds a nice degree of stability. I've created a simple setup with bungey and 1.5 inch webbing that works pretty well. Since I don't always have my tripod but always my bag and line, I've always got a little extra help.\nHappy Hunting\nGordon Richardson , July 11, 2003; 01:24 P.M.\nThat fact that Jpeg sizes increase when there is more image detail is well known, though I don't know of any written sources that refer to this method. As mentioned above some digital cameras already use a \"best-shot\" mode - it is possible that this method is used.\nIf the original scene is an astronomical photo the file-size could get larger! Point sources of light would be smeared out across several pixels.\nOne downside of this method is that Jpeg is not the best format for images - Raw or Tiff would give better quality. Given the limitations I would suggest that this tevchnique is unlikely to be used often!\nI wrote an article on Jpeg Compression in April this year (http://www.photo.net/learn/jpeg/).\nCarl Smith , July 11, 2003; 01:36 P.M.\nProper technique can allow you to shoot at slower than 1/focal length. But for me it sometimes takes a moment to prepare myself, I can't usually just shoot from the hip at very slow speeds. Can't do it when your heart is racing and your sweaty and shaky. You know, common sense. :)\nAlthough this man is sometimes a walking, talking Nikon advertisement I know a number of people who have improved their technique based on his recommendations here. The link given is for short lenses but it has a link on how to handhold longer lenses as well. The link is here .\nJeff Green , July 11, 2003; 01:50 P.M.\nTodd's idea is a good one. I have used this for years, with a screw eye into the tripod socket and a string attached to it. It is very small and light and slips in your bag well. Just step on the end of the string and pull up to stabilize.\nAlso, if you don't have the time to screw in the string, just lower your vantage point, and step on your camera strap and pull up.\nI always look around for something to prop on and possible use the self timer. There is almost always something .. .\nZibadun -- , July 11, 2003; 08:44 P.M.\nTodd's and Jeff's idea is pretty good. If you look at some older camera manuals you will see similar technique described with things like rolleiflex strapps: put it around your neck and pull. Although with waist level finder this is much easier...\nJay Scott , July 12, 2003; 05:54 P.M.\nMike - I always supposed that digital image stabilization consisted of simply shifting successive images so that they change as little as possible. The complicated algorithms I was suggesting could be used too, but I'm sure it's beyond the state of the art to run them in real time on portable hardware.\nDigital image stabilization actually is a technological possibility for digital still cameras. Imagine a future image sensor which dedicates silicon to fast readout circuitry instead of to storing a wide range of image brightnesses. Then what the camera user thinks of as one frame of 1/100 second could internally be many subframes which are added together, possibly with additional processing such as digital image stabilization. Another advantage is that the theoretical dynamic range increases with the exposure time; night shots could be incredible. In the meantime, until this wonderful sensor is available, I'll be satisfied with the burst shooting technique.\nAlan Davenport , July 13, 2003; 12:42 A.M.\nThe most consistent result seems to be, \"Poor man's IS\" = \"tripod.\"\nRon Chappel , July 13, 2003; 10:44 A.M.\nOne technique i read about from a sports photographer is to hold the end of your long lens.I'm surprised it's not more commonly known\nOliver S. , July 14, 2003; 09:06 A.M.\nThe strap technique has been well-known for decades. But thank you, Todd, for reminding us of it!\nHolding the end of a long lens? Even a 180mm doesn't allow me to keep my left elbow in contact with my upper body then. Ron, are you sure the sports photographer wasn't referring to use of long lenses on a monopod or even tripod? With a really \"long\" lens, additional suppport makes lots of sense. There are even self-made pentapods for precisely that purpose out there.\nWrt to hand-holding technique:\nPlace your left hand under the lens and keep it there, even if you're using a very short lens; (then cradle ring and small finger under the camera body.) I see so many photographers who eagerly ignore this; don't and most of your hand-holding problems are gone. For additional help:\nKeep your elbows in contact with your upper body.\nCompose, focus, breathe in, breathe out, press the shutter button.\nIf you're using a really long lens, consider placing the left hand under the lens with your thumb on its right side. (Look at .22 target rifle shooters and you'll understand what I mean. They often grip the foreshaft with their fingers at its left and the thumb on its right side when standing position is required.) Your left elbow then touches your torso near the centre rather than at the side.\nFor advanced handholding, get used to expanding your diaphragm and your belly, not your chest, when you breathe in.\nFinancial cost of all this: zero.\nPractise a steady stand: knees very slightly bent, feet approx. 1' apart sideway and 1' in shooting direction, left foot forward-pointing, right foot at 45\u00ba outwards. [For ving tsun disciples: both feet pointing inwards, of course :-) ]\nThat's poor man's IS! :-)\nMartijn Leensen , July 14, 2003; 12:07 P.M.\nReading the tips in this article I was asking myself: is it beneficial to use the mirror lock up also when not using a tripod? A main reason of making a couple of pictures seems to be the movement of finger and mirror when making the first picture. Using MLU, one does not need to make the first picture(s) which are unsharp. Only one picture might be enough to get a decent result. One does not have the possibility off course to choose from, let's say 9, pictures. On the other hand, 9 frames per 'picture' is not a poor man's solution.\nDean G , July 14, 2003; 04:27 P.M.\nThe target shooting analogy is very apt. I used to do quite a bit of 10 meter slow fire air pistol target shooting, as a hobby, and to a degree a sort of meditation. Anyway the breath control and small motor control required to squeeze rather than \"snatch\" the trigger is exactly applicable to holding a camera steady. Also what one learns in target shooting is to slow the breathing and whole system down and let the shot happen. Don't mean to sound \"new age\" here, these are simply practical matters.\nAnother good reason to cradle something like the 10D with the left hand under the lens, is that if you don't you'll soon wind up with a very sore right wrist!\nGus M , July 14, 2003; 04:41 P.M.\nThat technique is also useful for another purpose. When I got my digicam, I was very disappointed with the shutter lag, especially when taking photos of my baby. With an SLR, I could usually see a good smile from her and take the photo. With the digicam, I'd see a smile, hit the shutter, and have no smile in the picture.\nBy taking bursts of pictures, you don't have to worry about the \"right\" moment. Push down the button until the buffer fills and hopefully, she'll have a good expression in one photo.\n, July 16, 2003; 04:07 A.M.\nAre we talking about AI servo ? The word never came up though it seems logical.\nChristian Deichert\n, July 17, 2003; 10:43 A.M.\nThis just seems foolish. The author suggests that taking 9-shot bursts and hoping for the best is a good photographic technique. My opinion, this does nothing but promote laziness and sloppy technique.\nWhat's even more ridiculou is that the author insinuates that this will work for the \"poor man.\" I have a paying job now, but when I was a law student living on $400 a month, I had to make every dollar count. For photography, that meant making every shot count, so I used a tripod. I couldn't afford to waste film by handholding and taking 3 shot bursts and hoping one came out OK, and I certainy couldn't afford a $1500+ digital camera.\nFor that matter, I couldn't afford to buy a camera that would support IS -- I went with a 20-year-old used manual focus SLR. Fortunately for me, it's a great camera that's part of a great system -- I still have it and use it frequently.\nBen Lanterman , July 18, 2003; 12:39 A.M.\nI have a 1D and use IS lenses whenever possible. And yes, even with IS I find that I can make a blurry photo. The 1D is a fine camera but it is lacking in a review zoom setting that will allow judgements of whether or not the shot is in focus. What if that were the only one that I had taken? Someday I hope to be able to shoot one photo and know with full confidence that it is going to be perfect, until then why not let technology help with the process.\nI enjoy taking photos of small birds and airplanes. In general there is always time to study and use exacting technique to set up the equipment to take the photos. However the exacting technique approach does not allow for those little random factors that can occur - if you get them recorded by taking a series of shots you have a chance to find a photo which is just a little better.\nTaking many photos will not destroy your photographic vision, it might even help sharpen your discrimination.\nConsequently I fire away and take hundreds of photos and thoroughly enjoy the experience when I find a really neat photo occassionally.\nVince Resor , July 18, 2003; 10:40 A.M.\nI am fascinated by the relationship between file size as expressed by JPEG compression and image sharpness. Assuming this is indeed the case, and assuming that Nikon has alreaded included this feature in their digital P&S cameras in the Best Shot Selector mode, why then wouldn't it appear in a firmware update on their dSLRs? Come on Nikon engineers, are you reading this? How is your auto-notification profile configured? Just about every keyword in this article has been included (D100, D200, D1h, D1x, D2h, VR, etc.). Am I missing something? Does the same relationship exist with NEF? NEF may be a no-loss format unlike JPEG, but does it not include some compression relative to uncompressed formats like TIFF? If Nikon has decided that no one serious enough to drop $1700-$5000 on one of their dSLRs would save images as JPEGs, then they have missed the marketing boat. I for one would love to see DVR (digital vibration reduction) as a selectable feature on the next D100 firmware update, wouldn't you?\nJohn Marsden , July 19, 2003; 08:14 A.M.\nGreat posting. Thank you.\nJust another point. Heavy cameras are much easier to hold steady. Inertia and all that. An old clunker can be good for this. However my Canon 1v with motor drive weighs a ton and seems to attract heavy dark matter as I carry it out on long bush walks. However it does seem to take sharper pictures with the motor drive than without.\nAs a note you can set the motor drive options on the 1v to shoot only so many frames. So I'll set it at 5 for now and if I do use this technique its not really that expensive. It is good to consider as a standby.\nThank you for bringing this to our attention and putting such a detailed posting to go with it.\nPS if you use this with IS lenses (which I also have) you may be able to get even slower speeds for some shots.\nThis may explain why I once got an image to come out sharp at 135 mm at 1/8th of a second f5.6 (28-135 IS). (It was a mistake I was so absorbed in the event that I'd left it all in aperture priority !!! I was quite amazed when I checked the data collection later from the camera.)May have been helped by using grainy B&W film too Delta 3200 rated 12800).\nWhich also raised another poor mans IS. Use faster film !!\nEnough - I just like the original posting. Thank you.\nKlaus Sailer , July 19, 2003; 06:17 P.M.\nTo return to Bob's first comment...\nMany users of digital cameras will not consider the shutter life as important as film users. I mean to say, almost always a digital camera is obsolete before any mechanical or electrical problems can arise, and it's considered normal practice to get a new one.\nNothing that a poor man could afford anyway.\nJordan Viray , July 21, 2003; 01:56 A.M.\nA few issues with some of the responses: As for digital photography being out of the poor man's reach: I bought my EOS D2000 Digital camera in July of 2002 for $600 off of E-bay. So far, I've taken over 1500 photos over the course of a year. Assume it costs $10/36 exposure roll for film and development. 1500 photos is about 41 rolls or $410. 41 rolls over 12 months averages to a little less than a roll a week. So with fairly minimal use (~ 28 photos a week), the net cost of the D2000 is less than $200 in film-camera terms. I argue, then, that an older generation Digital SLR is well within a \"poor man's reach\"\nAs for shutter blade life: the D2000 is rated at 100,000 cycles which is the norm for other high-end Digital SLR's, so shooting a series of shots is a moot point. Not all photos will be semi-low light handheld ones needing a battery of frames to obrtain a sharp image.\nAs for laziness in technique: this method of gaining image quality has analogues in other parts of photography: flash exposure bracketing, plain ol' bracketing, white balance bracketing etc. . . Since Digital SLR's have histograms, lots of exposure latitude, and preview LCD's, normal bracketing isn't as important as it used to be. What these cameras can't do (yet) is compensate for camera shake. With this in mind, I think that the author's technique is *more* valuable than even traditional bracketing. Regarding laziness, how about white balance bracketing? Now THAT'S lazy!\nAs for using a string in a tripod socket, fastening it to the ground, and pulling up: Don't pull too hard. I found this out the hard way.\nThanks to the hard evidence from the article, I'll be using this technique a lot more (though probably in smaller bursts since machine-gunning a camera usually gets curious responses).\nAndrew Robertson , August 02, 2003; 08:15 P.M.\nI would also argue that digital is the most economical way to shoot photos ever invented. I have had my 10D since April, and have shot over 5,000 frames with it. Velvia 50(my preferred film) is about 8 bucks per roll (36) and about five bucks for processing, so some quick math tells me that I've shot 1805.55 worth of film so far with it. It's paid for itself and the 100-300 f/5.6 L that I got off eBay so far. I've probably shot 10 rolls with the 1n since April, btw (pretty much only in torrential downpours b/c of the weather sealing).\nI truly can feel definite progress and feel my technique improving at a faster rate than ever. It's simply because I'm shooting more pictures.\nGiampi . , August 06, 2003; 12:05 P.M.\nGOOD ARTICLE-thanks! I agree with Igor about the workings of this techniques. When shooting more pix in burst mode you have a better chance to catch the camera in \"mid air\" (i.e. that point of the shake in which the camera is in almost neutral 'gravity' so to speak). Locking the mirror of course (when possible) would also help.\nAnd yes, the best way to improve is to take more pix and with digital you can finally do that without breaking your bank!\nBill Tuthill\n, August 08, 2003; 03:02 P.M.\nOne bugaboo is that some digital cameras alter JPEG quality so filesize remains relatively constant. If your digicam does so, this IS method may fail.\nNick Kiest , September 23, 2003; 09:22 P.M.\nI am now using this technique on my D30, and it works wonderfully. Using the 28-135 IS lens, I can reliably get 1/30th of a second on the long end with IS and three exposures. 9 out of 10 times the second or third image is the sharpest one. It works fine for RAW, as others have attested. I wish it were possible to view the file size on the camera though (unless I have missed it). Good hand-holding technique is vital though.\nMany say to use a tripod, and I use when I can, and I always get the best images that way. But I often travel with family, and they won't put up with me setting up my tripod. Also security guards approach me when I use a tripod and hassle me, as no \"amateur\" would use one.\nNick Kiest , September 23, 2003; 09:28 P.M.\nI might add that my father is a surgeon, and using a Powershot S50, he can handhold 1/6 or 1/4 second exposures, and get them razor sharp on the first try. Unfortunately I did not inherit his hands. It more goes to show that with training, anything can be done.\nPaul Chaplo , September 29, 2003; 12:03 A.M.\nI admire your perceptive observation! A few additions: if the files are close in size, check to see if the framing is slightly different between frames (shooting hand held may results is minor changes in the view, and hence different sized files), also, this works with whole roll scans for film. It's interesting that file size can vary, even when shooting with a tripod! Gee, this could be applied to even a rich man's IS -- I'd like to hear from an IS shooter who compares multiple frames with lens IS \"on\" -- there still could be an application for a truly crucial shot!!! Excellent job! - Paul\nRay Pfeiffer , October 30, 2003; 12:51 A.M.\nRichard.. Your suggestion indeed does what you have observed. I have been shooting both camera and other pointed opticals for a few years. I retired my film Canon body 3 years ago to experiment with digital and became addicted. A few months ago, I purchased a Canon 10D and a 100-400mm (650mm) IS lens with 2x and 1.4x teleconverters. I shot the moon eclipse and in the recent few days the solar flares. Being mentally a tad on the extreme zoom side of the photo equation I shoot a great many of on and off tripod and other experimental large zoom shots in the attempt to find the 'limitations' of the equipment and environment, along with my steadiness. Being a hunter in a previous life shooting with scoped rifles at great distances is not that much different in acheiving success. I have indeed used your suggested method and without doubt it works to degrees regardless what mode I am shooting. Generally, I like to simply shoot several shots when time permits 'one shot' and reassure focus as well. While it may only make sense to some that the more shots you take the greater chance for success and in that respect correct. As we would say on the hunt, 'shoot between heart beats and squeeze the trigger'. I have shot bursts of the sun's solar flares through double black filters with both teleconverters stacked attempting to match SOHO results (in my dreams) on tripod and shooting a series of several shots will yield varying levels of success for various reasons even on tripod. Even at lower zoom levels that normally can be shot hand held I have shot bursts of 'one chance' opportunities and generally find that one or more shots are sharper. Probably for all the good reasons that have gone on here since your July article introduction. No mystery or voodoo. Your observation is a sound concept for my money! If the shot is somehow special... shoot it several times. NOT suggesting hunting with a machine gun (it's not quite the same), you certainly should be rational but many of my friends shoot good opportunities once with one bad result.\nErin Boyd , December 11, 2003; 07:43 A.M.\nHockey\nThe burst theory that the author of this article proposes is a good enough technique for static subjects, along with the various good practices mentioned by other posters (breathing, shutter release, arms tucked in, left hand supporting lens ,esp heavy ones, etc. I have been a press photographer for many years, and a tripod is not part of the equipment,too awkward to lug around, yet sharp photos are a requirement of the job. At present I use a D60 and 10D Canon for general and sports work. The frame rate (3 frames per second) is far too slow to capture an action sequence, or two shots of a single maneuver. The technique I use is one shot, Same as using a single barrel shotgun. With a Digital keep the camera awake by tapping the shutter button frequently. If not using the manual prefocus option, lock the AF on as the action is approaching and follow focus. Take a few images (3-4) for safety, (pic in the can) At the spot you have chosen to take THE image, gently depress the shutter button, and continue to follow through with the camera. Sure with a semi pro type camera such as the 10D or D60 you will miss a few such action shots, but you will always come home with enough clean sharp ones to keep the boss and yourself happy.\nErin Boyd , December 11, 2003; 07:47 A.M.\nHockey 1\nAnd one of the safety pics taken seconds before of the same action flow\nSteve Armstrong , January 14, 2004; 08:52 A.M.\nHas the occupant of flat 9 been suffering from paranoia since the completion of your test?\nSteve nicholson , August 01, 2004; 02:21 P.M.\nI wonder just how poor this \"poor man\" has to be. With the Canon Powershot S1 is, available for as little as 370 pounds in the UK I bit the bullet and would highly recommend it. Waiting to afford the latest, smartest, newest model on the market will never get you anywhere.Buy now, reap the benefits now is my motto.\nNotify me of comments\n\u00a9 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.

I am Greek Armenian, born in Saudi Arabie and grew up in Cairo and Beirut. I've lived in the United States since 1963. What a journey it is for all of us.

You have such and eye for light and what it does. Your use of it is phenomenal. Your work is an ongoing process that just gets better. I remember your early work on PhotoSig. We critiqued some photos there and then you kind of disappeared. I have come over here now. Is my work not up to these standards? My eyesight is not what it used to be.\nThanks for sharing your work, Sam - DigitalTucson\nJohn Warren , April 16, 2007; 07:38 A.M.\n3/3 Raters\nBiliana, You have totally mis-understood the anonymous 3/3 raters. A ten year old or someone with the intellect of a ten yearold has devised a system whereby,for whatever reason, they can AUTOMATICALLY give ALL the postings a 3/3. If you do not believe me put up one of you best shots and within 30 seconds you will get a 3/3. This just upsets the up-and-coming young photographers who need encouragement above all else.. The 3/3 raters DID NOT improve your photography, YOU DID. PN have got to get rid of the 3/3 anonymous raters because they are losing the serious photographers on the site hand over fist so you must add your voice to the dissenters and help get rid of them........SMILE John\nAiri Pung , April 17, 2007; 03:12 P.M.\nThank Your so much for commenting on my picture.

All emotions come from your inspired images and I consider myself lucky that YOU are sharing so much beauty. I don't know where to start and take time to savour, I have seen many of your images many times but I have to come back and back and back again....\nPascal Agneray , October 27, 2007; 08:42 A.M.\nGate in the snow from Biliana\nI came to this place because of Dennis Aubrey who is a friend of mine and who thinks highly of your work. So I was curious about it. It takes quite a long time to survey all your pictures, there are so many. I always try to find my favorite picture in a portfolio, as if I was shopping for something to keep in my house to look at again and again. It was not easy to pick. I love some of your water work. If I were to give you an advice as a friend and fellow photographer (not as an authority, I would not dare), it would be the following....You are so creative and full of ideas and passion for your work that you want to cover and absorb everything. You do a darn good job at it but it makes you the equivalent of a Jack of all trades, good at everything but excel at nothing. That sounds a little harsh I know and in fact I think you do excel at many things, it's just a form of speech meant for you to remember what I am saying because I think it might be important for you to hear it (so please bear with my harshness, I mean well). If I were you, I would create a folder called \"my favorites\" or \"the pictures I am most proud of\" and keep it to less than 10 pictures. It is going to be excrutiatingly hard for you to pick less than 10 pictures because your taste is as eclectic as your path, you have been to too many places, seen and loved too many things. Think of it as the process of dilution as opposed to a person who has never seen anything and is fully concentrated inside. Like the principle of entropy...a drop of ink in a glass of water will form beautiful patterns and then mix evenly or drop to the bottom, it will never come back to a drop or a complex pattern within the glass. But unlike ink in water, since you are a human, you can reform your original self as a concentrated drop but first you must be so selfish and focused on what you like for yourself instead or what is \"good looking\" or pleasing to the eye or to others. I see path of genius here and there and then it's as if you have lost the thread, gone to other ventures. It reminds me of someone starting a great story who suddenly het side tracked and start another story as if no one is listening or paying attention. Seeing how many people have commented on your work, I think you need to start thinking a lot higher of yourself and what you have to say. OK this is way too long, I have other people to go oppress too. Good luck in your endeavours, I really enjoyed visiting your world, it is so rich, my Gosh. It's wonderful. I attach my favorite picture of yours.\nBiliana Rakocevic , October 28, 2007; 06:28 A.M.\nTo Mario Lupo\nGrazie tanto caro Mario :) for your lovely words on my WOrk :) I am so honored and humble :) Thank you for making my day today, I need it :)\nGrazie mile caro Amico :) I am so happy that you too can enjoy my photography, as I am enjoying yours :)\nSaluti di Belgrado e sinceri sentimenti di amicita \")\nBiliana\nBiliana Rakocevic , October 28, 2007; 06:58 A.M.\nTo Pascal Agneray\nThank you so much dear Pascal for your lovely words and great advice you gave me :) and you are absolutely RIGHT - I know a lot, but not knowing everything :) yes, you are right, I have to filter my Work, but for now, I am not able to do it so.

At the same time thank you for letting us see your world, our lives are so much the same, we all care about our families and friends and we all share the same things, maybe someday our photos will help make for a lasting world peace.

But I thought you were in a little lack of inspiration these days , and you keep uploading more and more original photos. I wonder what you will come up with when your \"inspiration\" is back :-)\n, February 05, 2008; 07:04 P.M.\nHi Biliana\nFantastic! So many great images to choose from! We are almost at opposite ends of the spectrum - you produce brilliant conceptual images and I produce more simple shots. It just goes to show what a fantastic hobby/passion that we have that enables such infinite possibilities with just a camera. Thanks for the comments on my shots. Regards Steve\nLauren Partida , February 17, 2008; 02:56 A.M.\nBiliana: Your portfolio is magnificent! You are a lady of the water! The colors are magnificent, and your work has a certain power to it. I also see what you write, and so many times, I think, yes, we are on the same page for sure!

Every day something new happens, something gets invented, something becomes popular or disappears back into obscurity. Remember the disposable flash bulb? Remember the Kodak Disc? Photography is very much alive. It has always been. Some trends will only be of interest to a select few, some will gain wider interest and some even become so well known, that you see them being used over and over.\nAn example? HDR became pretty hip pretty fast back when HDR processing software Photomatix was released, especially when used in the form of a way-over-the-top effect. Now, several years later, I see more and more people using it the way it was originally meant to be used: to subtly increase the dynamic range of an image. Another example? The tilt effect (also often mistakenly referred to as the tilt/shift effect) that allows you to make regular scenes look like miniatures is one of those trending examples. It has been around forever, but it only became popular a few years ago. And it already is beginning to look somewhat old and dated.\nIt's easy to look at these trends as unrelated events, but the sheer amount of interesting things that have popped up over the last few years makes me believe that we are actually at the beginning of a fundamental shift in how the medium of photography is perceived and how it's being used in more creative ways than ever.\nThe Analog Clean Room\nSome of us, myself included, come from a film SLR background where it was crucial to get the best, the slickest and most reproducible results. Good glass and technique helped to make sure you didn't end up with any unwanted vignetting, and it was a sign of quality of your equipment and work if you pictures had the desired level of sharpness and contrast next to a good composition. Cropping was done when enlarging photos, but it was less practical when shooting slide film, unless you used my method of cropping the slides by sticking black electrical tape on them.\nThe Digital Clean Room\nThen all of a sudden digital was there, and even though I gave up a lot of control, my first two mega pixel camera with its tiny sensor, its from today's perspective horrible dynamic range, and the overprocessed JPG images that it produced - JPG was the only choice - even with all that, there was something magical about the instant feedback and the possibility to try as often as I liked to get the desired result. The first DSLR followed a while later and it gave me back control. And perfection. Overexposed? Correct and shoot again. Got the framing wrong? Move the camera, shoot again. White balance off? Fix in post. Almost like a computer game where you have an infinite amount of lives. Died during the boss fight? Try again. And again.\nSpray and Pray\nThere are a lot of situations where the spray and pray approach is the only one that will allow you to get the exact result you want. There are a lot of jobs and situations where digital is the only way to go, and I love to be able to quickly grab the camera, take a 21 mega pixel picture and post it online before an analog photographer can even get the film to the lab.\nBut if you take a look beyond that, you are bound to realize that for more and more photographers the digital way is becoming less and less satisfying. And I'm not even speaking of the massive backlog of pictures un-dealt with that more and more photographers fight.\nImperfections\nThanks to the fact that Lightroom, Aperture and other photography software allowed us to move the vignetting slider in both directions, a lot of photographers started to add vignettes to their pictures as opposed to removing them. Artificial grain was added to make digital black and white images more moody, more analog looking, and to bring back some of the overall grittiness that the analog world used to have. In fact my hard drive still hosts a high-res scan of a gray medium format slide, that I used to overlay on some of my pictures in Photoshop.\nLenses With Flavor\nNow we have Hipstamatic, Camera Bag, The Best Camera, Lo-Mob and more. These are iPhone apps that simulate an analog look, and you find a lot of them on other platforms too.\nWhen it comes to your DSLR, you can buy creative lenses like the Lensbaby, the Subjektiv, the Dreamagon, adapters to use a Holga plastic lens on your Nikon D700, or even stereo lenses, all optical ways to turn your camera into something entirely different. Ever shot with a zone plate instead of a regular lens? How about a pinhole? The sometimes not very predictable results that those lenses give you, make it really exciting to finally look at the pictures on your computer and be delighted with the imperfections that they add to your photography. Without using a single digital filter.\nThe Music World\nIn my other life I produce audio, and I can't help noticing big analogies between photography and the field of sound. Audio went digital quite a bit earlier than photography did, and I suspect a bit of a parallel development (pun not intended). Back in the 1980s, when the CD came out and everything in the production world all of a sudden turned digital, a lot of productions started to sport a very clean and almost analytical sound. Drum tracks turned very sterile thanks to clean quantization, removing the flawed human element. And the loss of that often went hand in hand with the loss of emotion. Consequently it didn't take the drum machine manufacturers long to introduce humanizer circuits into their boxes to get some of the feeling back. And the clean and digitally recorded sound ended up being fed through digital algorithms that simulated the warm sounding distortions of analog tubes and tape machines.\nHipstamatic anyone? I'm actually surprised neither Canon nor Nikon have introduced any effective \"make it dirty\" sliders in their DSLRs yet.\nToday with audio,I do the same many other producers do: I add dirt by running my microphone through an amplifier that uses an actual analog tube. I do that because neither have I found an equally good sounding digital version of analog tube distortion, nor am I patient enough to spend the time it takes my computer to make all the intricate calculations to add those fake distortions. This is simply more authentic and faster. Many music producers still (or again) record certain things on actual tape machines, because the punch their productions get through the tape saturation is unparalleled in the digital world. Analog is alive and kicking in the music business.\nThe Right Tool For The Job\nThere's a really interesting shift happening in photography too, and I believe it goes beyond being a fad, beyond being a trend that will have disappeared again a year from now. At least for their creative expression, a growing amount of digital photographers is moving (back) into analog photography, and away from the clinically perfect digital world. Why? Maybe because digital photography makes you unhappy ? Maybe because it is missing some of the human element? Maybe because it allows you to re-introduce a certain amount of randomness back into your art? Maybe even because photographers are too impatient to spend all the time and effort (and in case of expensive digital filters the money) to re-create a digital version of their beloved Ilford HP5+ pushed to ISO1600. Actual Ilford HP5+ pushed to ISO1600 simply does a better job. And a more authentic one at that. And if you still feel like playing, there's always the hybrid approach where you scan your negatives and continue working on them in the digital realm.\nWe Want Our Flaws Back It Seems\nWe have all seen a lot of perfect, we have been marinated left and right in crisp, noise-free and predictable digital photography. It almost seems, people want the flaws back. And that clearly shows in a lot of developments (sorry, douldn't resist). Look at all the creative films that you can get today. Some of my favorites are the Rollei Crossbird (a slide film that has been made to work really well in cross processing), the Redbird (a red-scale film that has the color emulsion reversed, resulting in some intense red color cast), and even the Fuji Astia 100F 100F slide film, which produces some pretty intense results when processed in negative film chemistry instead of its intended slide film soup. Cross processing gives you results that are somewhat unexpected, results that you probably wouldn't have achieved (or even tried) in digital, that's how different they can look. But nevertheless results that are much more likely to make you come back and look at these pictures for a second time.\nThe Trust in Chance\nInstead of fully controlling every aspect of their work, more and more photographers deliberately introduce elements into their workflow that are hard to reproduce exactly the same way. Look for instance at some of the instant film materials you can get through the Impossible Project at the moment. Predictable results? Hardly. Or look at double exposures. Taken by different photographers. Did you know you can buy exposed film on eBay to add your own second layer of exposures, then develop it to find out what you've got? What an element of surprise! Some deliberately shoot film that is far beyond its best-before date and take advantage of the interesting characteristics some aging film materials get. Some expose the whole 35mm film, including the sprocket holes, and some even partially remove the lenses from their cameras and tilt them to achieve effects similar to lensbabies and tilt lenses - that's called \"freelensing\". Or the deliberate manipulation of the medium, as seen in the emulsion lift, where integral instant film is taken apart and the photo emulsion gets transferred onto a different material.\nInnumerable interesting and important developments that define a new style and even more important, a new approach to photography that is much more playful and unpredictable than anything else in photography has been for many decades.\nPhotography goes far beyond the clean and perfect results that our 24 megapixel DSLRs and our impressive L-class lenses will give us. And even if you don't want to take a step into the analog world and instead opt to use Hipstamatic or Camera Bag on your iPhone's digital camera, at least you give the random element some level of chance.\nAnd maybe, after a while, you're ready to spend twenty bucks on eBay for a used old brownie, you load it with a roll of 120 slide film, you shoot some fun pictures, then you drop the film off at the next drug store with the note \"please develop this slide film using the C41 negative process\" - and after a few days, you'll get to enjoy the prints of your first batch of cross-processed pictures ever.\nChrisMarquardt\n"}, {"score": 159.72346, "uuid": "5a86a503-21cc-5b4f-9ce4-0c66681f7221", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1114wb-72-26318", "target_hostname": "www.briankilgore.com", "target_uri": "http://www.briankilgore.com/original_index.htm", "page_rank": 2.701121e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Brian Kilgore", "snippet": "Kodak Gold 400 consumer color film, chosen because <em>I</em> happened to have <em>a</em> roll at home, and because it has punchy color, great <em>for</em> shooting <em>portraits</em> in the shade, where there&#x27;s no sun to add impact. <em>Leica</em> M4-P <em>camera</em> with 50mm Summicron lens, because <em>I</em> own one and some crook stole my <em>Nikons</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "New Internet Company Boosts Media Awareness for Businesses - -- PublicityFinder.com Links Reporters to Companies Through Innovative e-Commerce Tec...\nDaniel J. Edelman, founder and chairman of Edelman PR Worldwide, addressed a public affairs symposium of the International Section of PR Society of America held at the U.N. yesterday and today.\nAs I read it, I started shaking my head, wondering if this package of meat was past its 'best before\" date. But Edelman has made such a contribution to our profession, I thought the story was worth repeating. On Friday, David Finn (Ruder and Finn) spoke, too.\nTo read the speech, go to www.odwyerpr.com and use freepass for the user name and xmas for the password. All in lower case. At the bottom of the PRSA conference news story (about David Finn and about Daniel Edelman) there's a link to the speech itself.\nJack O'Dwyer's PR Daily web site broke the Edelman story, as far as I know, and Jack has told me that BAK's Report readers are welcome to visit his site, and provided codes to get past the registration.\u00a0 He wrote to me, \"This is an important speech and an important seminar. You could give all your readers a temporary link to our website if you wish. It's freepass for the user name and xmas for the password (all lowercase).\"\nThe website is www.odwyerpr.com . You'll see Jack's story about the speech, and at the bottom of the story is a link to the speech itself. My quotation-marked words \"educational\" and \"intriguing\" are based on my reading of the actual speech, which I think contains some interesting lessons for PR people. As you read the speech, you might think of these lessons.\nEdelman leads his speech with some history, saying, \"When I came back to Columbia College for my senior year in September, 1939, I was overwhelmed by the surge of political support for the Presidency by a group of students from the South. They carried the message of a businessman named Wendell Wilkie. He didn't succeed in a presidential race against Franklin Roosevelt. But he brought to public view his concept of 'One World.' \" PR LESSON #2: Starting a speech with history is a good way to get the audience to sleep.\nA paragraph or so later, Edelman gets to a rehash of the history of the UN --\"we can consider the record of the United Nations over the past half century\" -- and then another rehash of more modern history, from 9-11 to the invasion of Iraq. Again, everything the audience already knows.\n1039 words into the speech, he finally says something we either care about (we did not care about 1939) or had not read in the paper this week already. In fact, it's pretty boring well past the 1039-word mark for a few more paragraphs, until finally he gets to \"Switching gears now to globalization of PR, Id like to state that it has proved extremely important to our firm to be in business in the major markets of the world. We have more than 20 multi-national clients today which we're representing in two, three or even ten or a dozen different markets around the globe. Our greatest volume comes from these multi-national clients. As everyone in this room knows, they don't automatically hand you their international business. They consult with their indigenous managers. In some places there may have been a domestic firm that had been doing the work for some years. They usually retain that company even as we launch an international program.\"\nI put the words in boldface, but don't know if he raised his voice making the point. But at least we're past international history and talking about PR.\nAnd finally we get to what I think is the second most important paragraph, educational and intriguing, of the speech.\n\"As I'm sure all the agency people here have experienced, it's really a one-way street, taking U.S. multi-nationals to other parts of the world. Very little of it flows in a U.S. direction from Europe or Asia. Clearly, this has to be corrected in the years ahead. It's been our experience that in most instances we have to sell the company's U.S. president rather than executives at the headquarters in Europe or Asia. That's particularly the case with Asian companies.\"\nWhat I love here is the imperialism inferred. When an American company expands overseas, the US bosses impose US pr companies on the branches. But when a non-American company expands in the USA, the \"foreign\" owner trusts his US president to hire a PR firm in the USA. Chrysler in Michingan doesn't get a German PR firm imposed upon it. Nissan does not get a Japanese firm forced on it. Or, as reported in various papers today (and in O'Dwyer) Hollinger Inc. in the USA does not get a Canadian or British PR firm imposed upon it, but hires Keksk & Co. in NY, for the USA, and a British firm to handle British issues.\nHe writes about American giants taking over local PR agencies -- PR LESSON #2. If you get this kind of offer, ask for cash, take the money, and run. Canada is full of American-owned (some go back from the USA to England if you follow the ownership chain) pr agencies still locally \"managed\" by the former owners, tied to the firm by stock deals, with their stock prices in the toilet, facing nutsy demands for money to be sent to NY and London. The former owners have given up control, got low-priced stock, have bosses demanding ever-increasing fees, and pissed-off clients\nAnd here, tied to PR LESSON #3, is the most important, educational and intriguing, paragraph for my readers, from his speech.\n\"The United States is currently facing an unprecedented wave of hostility from foreign countries. My son Richard, our company President and CEO, and Pam Talbot, U.S. President, were shocked by attitudes of our staff and people generally toward the U.S. when they participated in a meeting of our European managers in Amsterdam recently. The Europeans feel now it's not the \"Ugly America\" but an \"America Gone Wrong.\" That's basically Iraq. But another key factor is the paradox that we support free trade but we put tariffs on steel and textiles.\"\nFor months BAK's Report has been urging (it's PR lesson #3 here) PR managers in international organizations to pay special attention to how various companies view the USA, especially when American PR managers are forcing US-created programs on the branches around the world. Edelman and Edelman, a smart old man with a smart son, were both so slow of brain that, he said at the United Nations, they were \"shocked.\" No surprise to me, or to BAK's Report readers who have been paying attention.\nNew on Thursday, December 4,\u00a0 2003\nBilly Ray Cyrus is in Toronto, filming a television program called \"Doc.\"\nOne of the best two-way community relations and external promotion programs is behind the filming of this and other TV shows and movies.. From the Toronto side, there's strong and effective efforts from the municipal, provincial and federal governments, to convince film makers based in the USA and other countries that they should come to Toronto to shoot.\nAnd at the same time, the film makers work hard to get the city to make extra special efforts to accommodate their special needs. Below we see a genuine Toronto police officer directing traffic during rush hour, as Billy Ray \"drives\" his pickup past a faked New York advertising pillar, followed by a fake New York taxi-cab.\nNew on Wednesday, December 3,\u00a0 2003\nDavid Miller is Toronto's new mayor, with a PR lesson or two for us\nYesterday was the most important day in this man's life, I would think. He's David Miller, and was sworn in as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city, and then he hosted a skating party in Nathan Philips Square, in front of City Hall. And it must have been a really long day, because here he is yawning for my camera, getting ready to be interviewed on the Toronto One television station. Click on the photo to see a bigger yawn.\nPR LESSON 1 Tell your clients that whenever they are in front of a camera, TV or still, or near a microphone, anticipate that everything you do will be recorded for posterity. I'm sure this yawn is in the TV station archives now, recorded while waiting to go to air. And, PR LESSON 2, assume that the least flattering photograph, not the most flattering, will be the one that gets published, like I did here. I think Mr. Miller may be a good mayor -- I believe our last one was nuts, partly because he was very sick -- so Mr. Miller can't help but be an improvement. So I'm a touch embarrassed at running the worst of the photos I took. But they make the point, and are more interesting than the bland ones, aren't they?\nNew on Tuesday, December 2,\u00a0 2003\nBAK's Courses and Coaching\nIn response to several questions over the past few days, I'm formalizing my offerings of training courses. There will be more information shortly, and you'll be able to learn more by clicking on the little green ads up above. Information is already there on courses relating to employee surveys.\nI have a multi-module course on interpersonal business communications, designed to help managers communicate among themselves on business topics. It takes several hours, once a week, for several months, and worked well for the management team at a Canadian electronics manufacturing plant, and for field managers across a province for a public service organization.\nI have a course on understanding media relations, which has proven useful to the management team at several companies, trying to get their collective heads around how the media works, how to deal with reporters, how to understand the agendas of reporters and editors, and so on. There's a course on Employee Communications that radically challenges the accepted conventional wisdom. And I'm developing What PR Pros Need To Know About Digital Photography.\nCOACHING offerings are aimed at recently promoted public relations executives who know they can benefit from my thirty years experience; at non-PR executives to whom PR departments report; and at lower-level public relations people who have taken on new responsibilities in fields in which they lack experience.\nNew on Monday, December 1,\u00a0 2003\nA bit of an essay on\nThe Relationship between Journalism and Public Relations\nThis is simply a reprint of a quick and dirty response to a message in The Fleet Street Forum, a discussion group of primarily United Kingdom journalists.\n(I welcome any Fleet Streeters who have come to look. And perhaps some MediaPro forum members)\nYou could go nuts getting philosophy, the role of journalism in society, and\nso on and so forth.\nWe could start with this premise. There are others, of course.\nThe purpose of journalism is to fill the space between the ads with\ninformation interesting enough that people will read the paper and be\nexposed to the ads. (we care not talking about state-controlled journalism\npaid for by license fees enforced by jail terms)\nAnd PR people can provide quick and easy information to fill the space.\nIf you look at the entertainment pages of daily newspapers, for the most\npart, they are filled with PR-supplied information, perhaps run through the\ntypewriter once, surrounded by ads for motion pictures and live theatre and\nmusic and dance, all selling tickets. Sports teams sell tickets when there's\ncoverage of their sports. people vote for politicians they have heard of.\nBut, people being cynics and all, and not wanting to get suckered, the\nreaders demand that the information not be purely self-serving.\nSo now the journalists are required to make sure it is accurate, and editors\nare required to make two judgments; First of all, is it accurate and\ninteresting, and second of all, is it more interesting than something else\nthat could fill the space.\nThat adds to the challenge facing journalist and PR person alike.\nSmart journalists have caught on that confrontation gets readers. So, every\ntime there's some sort of positive story, journalists go out to get a quote\nfrom someone opposed. They may try to convince themselves this is balance.\nmaybe, or maybe it's just stirring up trouble. \"So, Mr. Axman, what is the\nposition of the United Pedophiles Association on this matter/\" Is the world\nbetter served by his quote? And what does it matter if his association is\nonly 1/10 of 1/10 of 1 percent? Mr. Axman is on the other side, and will say\nsomething that might get one reporter's story into the paper rather than\nleft in the wastebasket, with the space filled by a rival journalist.\nOr, reporters spice up their stories, which would have made the paper\nregardless of spiciness, because the added spice moves the story closer to\nthe front page, or higher on the page.\nNow, over in the PR world, the smart PR folks know how the system works, and\nare ready to support or oppose whatever story is being written. It doesn't\nmatter if they are on the in favour or opposed side if they get their name\nin the paper, in a story that reflects their view.\nIn the UK, every time Blair says something, every paper looks for an\nopposition politician to quote, just for the sake of... well, for the sake\nof what?\nTony will wish everyone a Merry Christmas, and reporters will seek out some\ndullard who says this is a racism comments and Blair should be strung up for\noffending Jews or Muslims or just plain atheists who don't celebrate\nChristmas. And how can it be merry with our troops in Iraq? And what about\nTiny Tim? His dad has to work.\nBut a smart anti-Christmas pr person will make sure reporters have the\ntelephone number to call, or even have news release delivered. PR meets the\nneeds of the journalist, but we might wonder how much the needs really\nmatter.\nThere is a huge amount of mutuality of interest (assuming mutuality is a\nword). If I as a PR person can give your photographer the opportunity to\ntake a great photograph of my client (imagine Richard Branson as an example)\nyou as a reporter can write a business story on Branson's latest enterprise,\nbut that story will not run buried in the back on the business pages but\nwill move to page one, just because of the photograph I set up for you. Your\nstory may even make it out of your paper and into papers around the world.\nAnd, at the same time, readers are happy to see the photo and read the\nstory. So is anyone hurt?\nPR ranges so far afield, it's hard to make judgments about anything,\nreally. In Canada now, and I expect in the UK, newspapers and magazines are\nrunning stories with pictures of expensive things people could buy to give\nas Christmas gifts. Or perhaps more importantly, ask their loved ones to buy\nfor them. When I look at the photos, they almost all reek of \"handout.\"\nThere's no sign the reporter when out to a dozen shops, compared the Canon\n300D to the Nikon D100, telephoned four real photographers and asked\nopinions, and then decided the Canon was to be included in the story. To me,\nit looks as if the editors just pick through a pile of news releases, and\nhave someone write a story from these. And that someone got a paycheque that\nweek, and readers got a story that, while not all that deep, still was not\nawful.\nASIDE -- The Canon 300D would have fully deserved the story, and is a great\ncamera, and I recommend it. (update, correction, and addition. The camera is the 300D in most of the world, the Digital Rebel in North America, and the KISS in Japan)\nPR people have to understand reality, in two senses. Journalists will try to\nget \"balance,\" and this is good and bad for the PR person, depending on what\nside of the question his or her client is on. And journalists often but not\nalways need PR people. We've seen examples in this string of messages where\nPR people are gatekeepers. If a journalist wants a quote from a particular\nexecutive or leader, the journalist needs the PR person to open the door, or\nthe journalist needs to be outside the restaurant when the big shot leaves,\nand then shout the question.\nBut, more often that not, the journalist could ask someone else the\nquestion. It does the PR person working for Mathew Barrett no good if she\nprotects Barrett from your question, and so the boss of another bank gets an\nopportunity to comment on the latest change in interest rates, and mention\nhis bank has a new loans program.\nIt really is an adversarial partnership -- sort of like a marriage.\nA couple of months ago I took the daily paper from Buffalo, New York, a\nToronto paper, and a British paper (can't remember which, but probably The\nTimes because it is the easiest to find in Toronto every day), and went\nthrough each, while sitting in a donut shop. (big table, no one expels you\nfor staying too long, good coffee, washrooms) Story after story after story\nhad the hand of PR. Academics could study this more carefully and try to\ndetermine the \"importance\" of each story. Were the important stories more\npure? Well, president Bush and PM Chretien and PM Blair all have PR people\noverseeing whatever words they say, to varying degrees of success, and they\nare important to cause war, or refuse to go.\nIn the sports pages, access to many of the players comes via the PR people.\nEntertainment pages are a given. Good fires can often be covered without PR\ninvolvement just by following the fire trucks, but how important are they?\nBombs, however, generally have police or military public affairs officers\ninvolved.\nUK news photographers are more aggressive than those in NA, and I note some\nFrench photographers just got acquitted of supposed crimes. Again, the PR -\njournalism relationship depends on the nature of the story. As a PR man, I'd\nrather establish guidelines with photographers and them bring them onto my\nproperty after the industrial accident than have them invade the hospital\nand photograph the little kid of the unfortunate victim, crying by her\ndaddy's bedside.\nBut more importantly, as a PR man, I'd have been working inside the company\nto spot potential bad news stories and get management to make changes so\nthose bad situations would not turn into accidents, (or arrests) and thus\nwould never cause me to be trying to get a reporter to ease off on a story.\nWe will have a new Prime Minister in Canada in a couple of weeks. His press\nguy has already threatened the major nation-wide news gathering cooperative,\nCanadian Press. Bad move, because all that did was get every paper in Canada\nto write about the threat.\nNothing's easy.\nAnd, by the way, I know many journalists think there's a purpose over and\nabove filling the spaces between the ads. I'm one. www.BrianKilgore.com\ntakes you to my publication, web based, that is all about PR and corporate\ncommunication, and has no ads.

She's Senior Manager, Firm-Wide Communications, at KPMG in Canada.\n1.\u00a0 Readership surveys are totally useless.\n2.\u00a0 What organizations should be doing are employee attitude surveys, where the effectiveness of the publication is part of the communications mix.\u00a0 But traditionally, publications (hardcopy and electronic) only account for between 7 - 12 percent of how people get their information.\u00a0 The two biggest questions about publications are:\u00a0 a) it is timely and b) are the articles actionable?\u00a0 Do they help you do your job better?\nMy response to Charles was that I used the bright green to make the story very visible to one particular reader who was new to BAK's Report, but that I'd fix up the design later. What you see below is the fixed up version. Line length has been shortened, color of the words changed, new background added, column form established, and more. Plus Jana notes that many readers love the words but wish I'd team up with a good designer. My response is that I'm after readability, not beauty, and the volume of content requires the format and the typographical tricks, like bold face and color. That said, there's a redesign underway based on, among other things, the fact that most monitors have higher resolution than when BAK's Report was first designed.\nNew on Wednesday, November 26,\u00a0 2003\n3 Thoughts on Employee Opinion Surveys\nOne BAK's Report reader knows this is for her, just to help her thinking. But other readers may find it useful, too.\nI was nudged into thinking about employee opinion surveys earlier today, and promised 3 thoughts would be in BAK's Report by 4 p.m. today. So here you go...\nDon't ask questions you don't want answers to\nAll specific numbers are suspect, so work in broad strokes and with concepts\nUnderstand that you want and need different information from various groups,\nlevels and sub-sets of employees\nYour senior people are probably your most important respondents\nIt is more important to understand actions than to understand wants\nDon't ask questions you don't want answers to\nThe process of asking for opinions is a major outbound corporate / employee communications initiative, and employees believe / want to believe that their opinions and interests are important, and you will act on them. If you are not prepared to act, do not raise false hopes by asking what employees want.\nTrue story: We did a survey for an organization where health service professionals had to be members in order to get their jobs. We asked lots of good questions, and left some space for comments. Survey form after survey form had write-ins saying the paid executive staff was arrogant, un-helpful, and out of touch. The formal questions about the training courses offered all had very negative responses, too. The end result was that the association management further alienated employees by not reporting the full survey results.\nAll specific numbers are suspect, so work in broad strokes and with concepts\nThere's no difference that matters between 82 and 78, or between $145,678 and $160,287, and you'll go nuts trying to micro-manage your results if you worry about too much detail. And cynics will try to examine each number and prove you wrong. What matters to people managing employee expectations is knowing what it is that most people agree on, or hardly any oppose, or, most in Montreal are in favor of but two out of three in Vancouver oppose. And \"around $150,000\" is good enough for planning purposes. (About specific numbers being suspect. Note this is not \"3 thoughts....\")\nTrue story: I was reviewing survey questions earlier today for another organization, written by a British company which asked respondents to look at a list of 13 factors, and arrange them in order of importance. Impossible to do, just as it is impossible for you to say whether one kind of pasta is 'better\" than another. It all depends. Besides, in the real life British example, maybe items 12 and 13, even if far down the list, are still \"very important.\" What the survey should have asked is, \"Please mark each of the 13 items as very important, somewhat important, neutral, or doesn't matter.\" Then you'd have some useful information to use in designing a program. ( click here to see the 13 points -- can you put them in order of importance, or would you say \"it depends\" too.\nUnderstand that you want and need different information from various groups, levels and sub-sets of employees.\nWhat many managers, and too many employee communications specialists, at headquarters believe is that employees far down the organization, time zones away from headquarters, care about broad company policies and actions. They don't. They care about their plant, and their community, and their division, and it's only a few of their colleagues who want, and will benefit from, the big picture. So offer the big picture to everyone, (you don't know which of the younger folks far away will rise to the top) but don't worry about all those who don't care, don't read the company headquarter news. The few who do are the few who will get promoted and take leadership roles. The people on the plant floor usually have a narrow view. It's good enough that they want to do quality work, cheerfully. So when you do your survey, sort out the corporately-engaged from the locally-engaged, and measure what matters with each group.\nTrue story: I was working with a 250-employee Canadian manufacturing sub of a European powerhouse, and we'd arranged for all 250 employees to see a live video feed of the world-wide chairman and CEO speaking to all the company's hundred thousand employees. At our factory, about five people paid attention to his speech, but most of the 250 were fascinated by a little bit of video footage in the introduction, showing production lines in a Thailand plant that made the same product as they did. We taped the presentation, and played the 30 seconds of Thai footage over and over, as our staff analyzed the operation. But no one, except the plant general manager starting an upward career, and two mid-level production managers who wanted to be transferred to bigger plants someday, and my partner and I, cared about the vision and mission, world-wide.\nYour senior people are probably your most important respondents\nIt's the vice-presidents and executive vice-presidents and divisional general managers and even the upper-managers called directors that most people think of as their bosses, who matter most.\u00a0 Find out what they think. It is these executives who need to fully understand the organization partly because they shape it, and partly because they have to go out and face the troops, day after day after day. Think of them as the colonels and majors and captains -- they are the men and women who lead your company into battle for market share and profits, and they need to understand and support the organization.\nAnd don't forget to ask the members of the Board of Directors -- in the era of corporate governance spotlights, they really, truly, matter. For subsidiaries doing surveys, what does head office in some other country think of you? For international headquarters, what do the presidents of your subsidiary companies think of you?\nIt's more important to understand actions than to understand wants\n... and the organization's wants are more important than those of the employees.\nHere are a couple of good \"for instance\" questions, and you can imagine less effective alternatives.\nQ1/ How often do you tell outsiders, whether they are friends, clients, investors\u00a0 or suppliers, positive information about the company, its plans and products and services.\nor..\nQ2/ How often in the past year have you changed the way you work because of something you read in Acme Widget Infosphere.\nThe fact that employees may like to read the bowling scores and updates on retirement does not mean that these parts of a publication accomplish anything for the organization. So instead of asking a \"read most\" question, ask a \"most useful to you doing your job\" question.\nHere's the 13 questions from the \"Specific numbers\" true story above. Choice of language, i.e. jargon and cliches; choice of language tone; consistency in message across stakeholder groups; consistency in publishing frequency; design of publications; full color publications; honest management; how corporate communications compares with mainstream media; over communicating; open management; realistic stance; under communicating; visibility -- management by walking about.\nNew on Tuesday, November 25,\u00a0 2003\nNonsense from The Toronto Star\nReader determines if it's a public relations disaster\nRANDY COHEN\nEVERYDAY ETHICS\nQ I'm considering hiring a public relations representative to promote my new business, but I worry about having him write letters for me to sign. When I read an article or a letter, I expect the name on it to be the author's.\nThe public relations rep argues that he is simply conveying my message more effectively than I could. But wouldn't I be lying to tack my name on his work?\nTal Ziv, Honolulu\nA Context is all. When the president gives a speech, few Americans believe he composed it. We assume that the words are those of a speechwriter; the president is merely endorsing the policies he articulates, and there's nothing wrong with that.\nHowever, when someone's name appears on a novel or a magazine article, it is fair to assume that those are his words, not just a collection of sentiments he admires. And yet novels have been ghostwritten, and the president has signed his name to op-ed articles that some people find difficult to believe that he wrote (or, among the more cynical, that he read).\nIn such cases, to sign your name is to claim credit for work you didn't write \u0097 i.e. to lie. What's important is the assumption of the reader.\nIf the customs of your business are such that your recipients will take your signature to mean you wrote these letters, then that's what you must do \u0097 write them. If they'll assume someone wrote them for you, then no problem. Your obligation is to avoid being deceptive.\nAnd so it's fine to employ a public relations firm to help with your communications skills, but it's not fine to do what amounts to plagiarizing.\nWho knows where this crap comes from, but to consider an executive agreeing to the words written by a Pr person, created for the express purposes the signer hires the PR person for, is plagiarism, is nonsense. Should we note that the words in annual reports are not written by the CEO? That the quotes in news releases started off with the CEO?\nNo. What matters, what is ethical, is that the person identified agrees with the words, and is willing to stand by them.\nNew on Friday, November 21,\u00a0 2003\nStories have legs, and they act like germs, and things get worse ...\nA little way down the page, here, I write about a crisis in Ontario hospitals, based on poor sterilization of some instruments. The story grows each day, with more and more hospitals reporting they don't sterilize properly either, and notifying former patients that t they may be infected. Back in June, Malcolm Gladwell spoke to the big conference of the\u00a0 International Association of Business Communicators. He's the author of The Tipping Point, a book that discusses how \"things\" grow, and then boom, they reach the tipping point and are upon us with a vengeance..\nOur job as PR people is to anticipate the excrement hitting the rotary atmospheric motion instigation device, and be ready with shields, mops, and disinfectant. Earlier this week I've been in several discussions about the Hollinger / Conrad Black / unauthorized payments scandal. My belief is that this story is going to travel far, and perhaps fairly fast. Because Black's sort-of Canadian, (he renounced his citizenship so he could be ...) sort of British (he's a Lord over there, not allowed by Canadian law if he was still a Canadian citizen) plus he owns The Telegraph, and many of Hollinger's investments, and shareholders, are in the USA, this will be a three-legged, tri-nation story.\nNow, combine Hollinger with prostate instruments, and we come to today's PR LESSON. You really should be a pessimist, and when you see something out in some part of the world that could go wrong in your organization, get ready for things to get worse. The bad news is your non-PR colleagues will get annoyed with you for being negative, and they won't thank you when it turns out you are right, and things to get worse.\nHere's my prediction of a few things -- broad strokes thoughts --\u00a0 that could affect a large number of the organizations for which my readers work. Are you up to speed and ready to talk about, for attribution ...\n-- Corporate governance issues. Independent directors, and sign offs on the financials, special payments and one I think will explode, just how much work do directors actually do for their fees?. And related..\n-- Changing definitions in financial communications. Do you, for instance, know what \"independent\" means, today?\n-- Offshore operations taking jobs away from your \"native\" country. Companies have a headquarters somewhere, and only a few are thought of as not \"belonging\" to some nation. So when Morgan Stanley, an \"American\" company, starts killing US jobs and hiring people in India (see the latest Fortune magazine) be prepared for internal communications problems, and government relations problems.\n-- Politics meets business -- I hope I'm wrong, but I anticipate anti-American actions hurting (perhaps literally) operations of American-controlled businesses outside the USA. We've already seen how Americans are trying to punish French organizations operating in the United States of America. Yesterday and today's demonstrations in London are politics-based, but I wonder when they will turn to anti-American-business. McDonald's franchise owners in many countries already know, and have suffered, because they are a symbol of the USA.\nManagers who screw up love to blame the messenger. That's you, so get ready to get in trouble because you are anticipating the worst, and then get blamed again when you are proven right.\nAnd, to quote Stanley Bing in Fortune, about not being believed when being pessimistic, I write, \"just remember two words. 'Arthur Andersen.'\"\nNew on Thursday, November 20,\u00a0 2003\nGreat story about public relations and the media in\nThe Guardian, from London.\nGo to http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1086527,00.html and you'll see the story, written by PR woman Julia Hobsbawm\nHere's the first part of the story:\nWhy journalism needs PR\nMembers of the fourth estate may love to hate the world of public relations but without it they would struggle to fill their newspapers, argues Julia Hobsbawm\nMonday November 17, 2003\nThe Guardian\nJournalism loves to hate PR. It has become the norm in the media to knock us, whether for spinning, controlling access, approving copy, or protecting clients at the expense of the truth. Yet journalism has never needed public relations more, and PR has never done a better job for the media.\nIf you think I'm exaggerating the antipathy, here's what Bryan Appleyard, the distinguished author and journalist, wrote in the Sunday Times in May: \"Hacks still naively pursue something they like to call the truth. Their problem is that it no longer exists. For truth has been destroyed by public relations executives, or 'scum' as we like to call them.\"\nSingling out showbusiness, celebrity and sport PR in particular, Appleyard concluded that it has become \"a virus ... infinitely more infectious and, in the long run, more damaging than Sars\" (I kid you not).\nGiven that a (conservative) estimate of 75% of entertainment stories and 50 to 80% of news and business stories emanate from public relations, it is understandable that journalists can resent their reliance on us.\nIt's worth reading the rest of the story. I've gone through daily papers over and over, during my career, marking the stories that clearly have the hand of pr upon them, and it is astounding how much we in the PR profession contribute to the content of newspapers, radio broadcasts, and television news and public affairs.\nWhat many unobservant observers observe incorrectly is that even the anti-pbursinss, anti-government stories that are published are often at the instigation and with the support of PR people; it's just that they are not PR people on the side of business or government but PR people\u00a0 on the other side, whatever side that might be.\nWho is Julie Hobsbawm, anyway? She's in her late-thirties. chairwoman of Hobsbawm Media + Marketing Communications Ltd (www.hmclondon.co.uk) in London, and, she writes to BAK's Report, \" I'm now London's first Professor of Public Relations.\"\nHer firm has\u00a0 23 employees, and she is the daughter, the Guardian tells us, \"of the well-known Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm,\" and then says, \"Julia has specialised in promoting mainly leftwing and ethical clients.\" It says her energy is legendary, and \"She is a staunch defender of public relations against its critics and recently attacked journalists for \"biting the hand that feeds\" the media.\"\nGood for her. I don't see the defense coming from the associations that should be doing this.\nPlus, she wrote to us, \"I liked your site very much!\" although not in bold type. But she did put in the exclamation mark.\nNew on Wednesday, November 19,\u00a0 2003\nUPDATE ON: Bad communications is a life and death issue JUST BELOW\nI've now read the sterilization instructions on the prostrate probe that has caused vast worry to hundreds of men. The instructions are clear; the technician at the hospital was both lazy and badly trained, but the fault sure does not lie with the manual writer.\nNew on Saturday, November 15,\u00a0 2003\nPR LESSON: Think about dates and get them complete and easy to understand.\nDo you know what day of the week it is, based only on the number, like 19 in this sign? No?\nDo you have a better idea if you're free on, say, next Wednesday, or free on the 19th? You don't even know which day the 19th is, without doing math in your head, do you?\nNeither do most people, so if you want to schedule an event and alert people in advance, put the damn day of the month into the sign, on the invitation, into the flyer, at the bottom of the ad.\nMake dates easy, and as PR person, it is your job to make sure everyone in your organization communicates clearly.\nNew on Thursday, November 13,\u00a0 2003\nPR LESSON: promote your advertising, inside and out\nWhen your marketing department does an interesting advertising campaign, make sure your employees know about it, just before it breaks, and you can often get external publicity, if your campaign is interesting. Part of your job as PR expert is getting good photos to give to the media, of course.\nI just happened upon the chance to take these shots: I was not shooting for a client, but they illustrate real world meeting fantasy, as the genuine fire truck heads out on a run, putting a pause in the shooting of the beer commercial. In Canada, beer and hockey go together. I shot from my office window and from the street in front of my building.\nThe fake action of the hockey-based TV commercial filmed at the fire station across from my office was interrupted as the real fire truck headed out on a genuine call. The grey blurs in the big photo are pigeons, some of whom live on the outside of my office air conditioner.\nNew on Tuesday, September 30,\u00a0 2003\nUpdate to an earlier story\nThe National Film Board in Toronto has great animation classes for kids. Here's more about them.\nI wrote an earlier story here about the animation workshops my son has been attending at the National Film Board Mediatheque. Since then, I've visited the NFB web site and discovered a special site for kids, at www.nfbkids.ca with games for children.\u00a0It's fun to watch how kids learn when they get to exercise their creativity doing something they think is special.\nFor information about the Animation Workshop info, go to http://www.nfb.ca/mediatheque/en/fallworkshop.html and to just learn more about the offerings of the NFB in Toronto, go to http://www.nfb.ca/mediatheque/en\nNew on Monday, September 29,\u00a0 2003\nHacks insult flacks\nWe in PR continue to get insulted by journalists\nProblem is, too many of us deserve it.\nRichard Morochove is an accountant-turned computer consultant who writes better than the average bean-counter, and has his words in front of hundreds of thousands of eyes every month. Today he writes in the Toronto Star's business section, and some other papers, about Kodak's financial and organizational moves, and he writes about digital photography. He's not that far off being right on the photo front, although he leaves out some info about Kodak's leadership in professional hardware, and he appears to not have visited the latest Kodak photo kiosks. You can't read his column on the web, as far as I can see. It's not on the Toronto Star web site, nor in his own.\nBut, inside Morochove's own web site there's a funny-if-it were-not-so-true section aimed at the PR people who send him releases and leads and story ideas they want him to cover. You can read the whole list at Six dumb PR questions you should never ask inside www.morochove.com There's some other very good advice in the site about how to send stories and photos to a freelance journalist, too.\nHere's one of the\"six dumb\" I particularly like from his site. It rings so true, from Toronto's Richard Morochove ...\nI'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When I Comes\nQ: Will you be coming to my press conference?\nA: If I'm coming, I'll be there. If I'm not, I won't. I attend very few press conferences, because most are a poor use of my time. Due to the fluid nature of my work, I cannot guarantee my attendance at most events.\nExcept, except...\nOver in Jack O'Dwyer's PR Daily, the biggest and best (next to BAK's Report) on-line PR publication, my friend Fraser Seitel (never met him in person, still think he's a friend) has written today, in a great professional development feature, these words...\nSeitel\n#7 Alert the media.\nAnd speaking of the press, journalists are notorious no-shows at special events.\nThey'll tell you they're coming and may, in fact, plan on making it. But then, at the last minute, a new assignment beckons, and you're left with a low media turnout at the function and egg on your face with the CEO.\nSo journalists must be called early and often. See if they're available for the event by notifying them early on. Check back with them prior to the event to see if they still plan to attend. Finally, on the morning of the event, call their offices just to make sure.\nFew things are more disconcerting - or suicidal -- for a PR professional than having no reporters show up at a press conference.\nSo how do you resolve the apparent conflict between Mr. Morochove's view, as the getter of the callers, and Mr. Seitel's position, as the gettee of the calls?\nPR LESSON? Develop really good lists that indicate the nature and preference and relationship with various reporters. There are some events where you are only working with an assignment desk, and do not know the names of individuals who might come. Other times, you have specific names of reporters. We all know now that if we've invited Mr. Morochove, we'll just annoy him if we call again. Seems to me that since he's an accountant, he understands how to keep dates straight, and since he's a computer expert, he knows how to be reminded electonically.\u00a0 So, beside Morochove, on your list you mark -- call to invite; do not remind by phone. Then the day before, send him a reminder e-mail. Don't call and annoy him.\nBut for me, say, if you wanted BAK's Report to cover an event, call me twice if you want, and send a pre-paid taxi.\nMedia relations is not a job for juniors. If someone is going to call a reporter, make sure it is someone senior enough, and knowledgeable enough, to talk intelligently with the reporter if you should reach a human and not an answering machine. Oft-times the reporter will write a pre-interview story, and you'll get two hits for the price of one, but only if the call the day before is from someone willing and able to be quoted. And the media relations person needs to know the industry, its issues, and where your organization fits in.\nBAK's Hint for best phone reminder system? Have one of the speakers at the news conference make the call, unless you really need to keep a lid on the content of the event. Let the reporter pre-interview one of the principals.\nAnd finally -- Mr. M. is right on when he says most press conferences are a waste of his time. Instead, don't hold a press conference, hold some sort of industry event, aimed at clients and prospects and educators and other prime audiences, and then invite the reporters too. They'll still learn about your product or service, they'll be able to interview other people, and all in all, the efforts to hold the event will pay off much better.\nI shake my head at the public relations organizations ...\nHere's the intro to a paper I'm presenting at the management committee meeting this afternoon of one of my clients.\nFor more than 30 years I\u0092ve been in the PR business, and for that entire time, the profession has done a poor job explaining just what public relations is, and why it matters.\nThe result; half the world seems to think PR is lying to the media, and the other half thinks it means organizing parties.\nHere is the world\u0092s best definition of the craft and profession;\nPUBLIC RELATIONS, as defined by BAK:\n\"The management function which determines an organization's communications-related objectives, evaluates public attitudes, identifies the policies and procedures of an individual or organization with the public interest, and plans and executes a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance and cause actions to meet the objectives.\"\nThe definition of public relations, and a phrase by phrase breakdown of it, are here, near the bottom of this page . It would be great if the bosses of the organizations would go out and tell the world what it is we do, instead of organizing more was to extract more money from their members. But that, unfortunately, seems to be what drives them.\nNew on Monday, September 22,\u00a0 2003\nAre ethics and communications in general\nimportant topics in the business community, or not?\nI had two interesting conversations last week. In one, a man who supplies keynote speakers to major business conferences in Canada and the US told me that when discussions of what speaker to select get around to experts on either ethics or communications, the conference organizers lose interest.\nAnd, on the other side of the coin, (and the other side of the ocean) in an e-mail exchange with Sandra Macleod, Chief Executive of Echo Research in London, Paris and New York, she told me about the ever-growing interest in ethics, and corporate social responsibility, telling me she's launching a new study this Wednesday, September 24,\u00a0 about CSR and the business community.\u00a0 \"Ethics will not die down that easily,\" she wrote. I hope to have more about her conference here by the end of the week.\nNew on Thursday, September 18,\u00a0 2003\nPR LESSON: Always include the day when you publish a date.\nIt seems so obvious, but designers who can't think, and poor PR people, all too often leave out useful information. Today I read this notice from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: \"... Hosted by Andy Barrie, September 22,\u00a0 5 - 7 p.m. ...\" which forced me to go to a calendar and look up the 22nd, to determine what day of the week it is. Why not just put \"Monday\" in the notice, making it easier for everyone? Are people brain-dead?\nKids learn animation at National Film Board:\nThe Toronto office of The National Film Board of Canada has a wonderful Saturday and Sunday program teaching animation to children. It's from 1 - 3 both days, costs $5 per session, parents are welcome to watch for free or participate for their own five bucks. The kids learn about scripts, make their own props, think about the actions, learn to plan and implement, and all in all, have fun while learning a lot. If you bring your own blank videotape, you can take away a copy of your work.\nThe NFB office is in the Toronto entertainment district, at the corner of John Street and Richmond Street. The instructors are recent graduates of one of the best animation courses in the world, and they really know how to work with kids.\nI'm planning on telling a newspaper education reporter about this course. It really educates kids, and it is fun. If you arrive early, you get to watch movies for free. I recommend Wrabbit, a cartoon, if the kids are seven or older. Parents will enjoy it, too. Info about the workshops is at at http://www.nfb.ca/mediatheque/en/fallworkshop.html\nLISA HOMER\nThe new president of the Canadian Public Relations Society speaks to BAK's Report readers.\nI asked Lisa Homer, a Calgary PR-woman and the newest president of CPRS, what her plans were for the advocacy part of her role leading the organization. Here, below, is what she wrote.\nWhat do you think? Is there an action program here? I don't see any sign of the one person who could make a difference, the actual President, out making our profession important. No, there's some speakers bureau, and you've never seen one of these that was any good, have you?\nI can remember back, many years ago to another Calgary president. John Francis, from Francis Williams and Johnson, made a coast to coast speaking tour. And Jean Valin made some good efforts a few years ago. But those are the last times I remember any president actually out talking about the association he or she was supposed to lead. I've spent time in the CPRS web site tonight trying to find indications of external efforts. Not much there. But her article talks about the presidential tour. I need to find out more.\nUPDATE: With an hour of putting up this story, I got more info from Lisa Homer. Some of the examples in her piece stretch back over the years, apparently. (Accreditation ads, for instance) There's no plan, yet, for her to make a major effort to speak to senior business execs, but it's a topic to be discussed several months from now at a board meeting.\nI don't think she understands she's the most important public relations practitioner in Canada, the elected head of an organization desperately in need of leadership. But, on the other hand, who else is there willing to fight for the reputation of our profession?\nBy Lisa Homer, President, Canadian Public Relations Society\nThe public relations profession could use a little \"p.r.\" As public relations professionals, we all know this, but it\u0092s a little like the shoemaker\u0092s children.\nThe Canadian Public Relations Society has a role in promoting our profession and advocating for our place with the key decision-makers in an organization. We have been doing this in one way or another for several years through accreditation promotion, the presidential tour, recent articles in some key publications, national conferences, media relations, the awards program, and professional development initiatives at the local level.\nAt the national level, we will continue promoting our profession by going outside of our membership doors and inside other organizations. One of the ways to accomplish this is by creating a speakers\u0092 bureau. We hope to have some of our long-standing, experienced members take advantage of speaking opportunities with various organizations outside of our profession like APEGGA, the Human Resources Association, the various accounting membership associations and so forth. Speaking opportunities will provide us with a venue to talk with those with whom we closely work to promote our value. I believe two of our greatest skills are the ability to look at the big picture and the ability to synthesize information for all audiences, no matter how complex or sensitive that information may be.\nBut the promotion of our profession does not come from the national or local association alone. Each and every day, we demonstrate our knowledge, skills and experience as individual public relations professionals. To truly demonstrate our abilities to those outside our profession, we must commit to lifelong learning, to adhering to our code of professional standards, and to continuing to build our base of accredited members.\nNew on Tuesday, August 12,\u00a0 2003\nBAK's Report and I are mentioned in a Ragan publication\nCharles Pizzo, one of the top speakers at the IABC conference in Toronto this June, a past chair of IABC, and a New Orleans-based PR man, has written about on-line journalism in PR Intelligence, a Ragan publication. It's a good article, even without his mention of BAK's Report.\nHere's what he wrote about us.\nWe\u0092re deep in uncharted territory. Online writer Brian Kilgore (Blogger? He says \u0093no!,\u0094 preferring journalist) has confounded observers with views about the various global communication associations. He\u0092s a critic and a champion both, and he really doesn\u0092t care what you think. He calls \u0092em as he sees \u0092em, a sort of journalistic gunslinger\u0097to borrow a phrase penned by Kathleen Parker (a syndicated writer who composed an insightful piece about the blogger phenomenon).\nShould the subjects of Brian\u0092s blog\u0097he finds that term insulting\u0097treat him as a journalist? Or, as an individual who reports in a Web log, BAK\u0092s Report?\nPR Intelligence is a registration-only (but free) publication that is well-worth reading. Just go to www.ragan.com/pri\nAnd work your way thought the (easy) registration process, and you can read not only this story, but others about crisis communications, the real estate business, and more.\nElaborating on Charles' quote about me, yes, I am a journalist when I'm writing this, but a journalist from the \"columnist\" side of the ledger, with opinion. I work hard at the facts, making sure I get them right, but willing to comment on them, too. And since Google can find content within BAK's Report, and since journalists use Google to do research, PR people should think of BAK's Report the same way they think of the New York Times, sort of. A lot less circulation, but my comments come up on a screen in a Google search, so my stories reach your audiences, too, thinks I.\nNew on Thursday, July 31,\u00a0 2003\nToday's thinking ...\u00a0 is that we in public relations, myself included, sure don't make as good use of photography as we should.\nDigital camera or film camera?\nHere's a piece I wrote today for The Fleet Street Forum, a web site based in England, primarily for UK journalists. One of the members was considering buying a digital camera.\nA quick guide to the film compared with digital question for semi-serious photographers\nDigital cameras cost much more than film cameras, for similar features. In Canada, it's at least 2.5 times as much for digital as film, and may be worse in the UK.\nThe savings on no film in digital can only be achieved over many, many photographs.\nIf you need prints, or want prints, the big difference is this. With film, you usually have the whole roll printed. With digital, you only print the ones you wish, and leave the other frames unprinted. the math gets complicated, depending on how many pictures you would throw away from a 24 exposure roll of film.\nAbout flat bed scanners.\nYes, it is easy to scan a print to the standards required by a magazine or newspaper that cares so little about quality that it does not use real photographers. (Not trying to be snarky, just an observation) And if the original photo is any good, both artistically and technically, the end result will be fine.\nA 4x6 inch print, scanned, can be \"enlarged\" (digital terminology gets confusing) to be published at around 5x7 inches with no trouble. If you think the magazine will want to run the photo bigger, you should have a bigger print made, and scan this. So a 5x7 print can be scanned and enlarged to 8x10, but you'd be better off scanning an 8x10 so it runs at that same size.\nThe biggest advantages of digital are these:\n-- Faster. No need to wait for prints, and then no need to scan them\n-- You can still get prints if you want. Photofinishers have new equipment that makes excellent prints, quickly\n-- You can check the quality of the shots right now. Digital cameras have a little screen on the back, and you look at that and see if you have a nice shot, and if so, you can stop shooting.\n-- Digital mistakes can be fixed easily, often but not always. Because you have the original digital file, you, or someone at the publication, can play with it in Photoshop and make fairly significant adjustments to some of the technical aspects of the picture.\n-- Often, better quality to camera size ratio. Tiny digital cameras take good pictures.\nThe biggest advantages of film are these:\n-- Much less expensive\n-- You get prints more easily\n-- You still get digital advantages by using a flat bed scanner, or by sending the negative to the magazine, where it can use a film scanner to get excellent quality.\n-- If your photofinisher has the equipment, you can get a CD made of all the negs at the same time the film is being developed, so you \"go digital\" very early into the workflow. I just did this on a job, and got the film developed to negatives, and then a CD made, but did not have any prints made. Then I used the CD to open files, processed them, and then sent them by e-mail 500 miles to be published.\nSome of us actively involved in photography are starting to think digital images look better, at least up to 8x10.\nAbout picking a camera: The most important number to know is the resolution, measured in megapixels. 2 megapixels makes good 5x7 prints. 3MP makes good 8x10 prints. 4MP makes prints good enough for a full magazine page in a medium quality publication, or half a broadsheet page.\nI personally advise you to buy a camera from a camera company -- Nikon, Canon, Olympus -- and not from a computer or home stereo company -- Sanyo, Casio, Hewlett Packard.\nThe tiny, tiny cameras are amazingly good, so if \"cute\" appeals, you won't sacrifice too much in quality or features, but you'll always have the camera with you.\nCan you charge extra for the photos? If so, and if you have the camera all the time, you might actually work hard at taking better pictures, get editors to buy more, and end up financially ahead.\nDigital zoom is unimportant. Optical zoom is important. 3x describes the ratio between the widest setting and the narrowest. i.e. 3X would describe a lens that, in 35mm camera terms, zooms from 35 mm to three times that, or 105mm.\nToday, in Toronto, an excellent, full featured 35mm single lens reflex film camera costs the same as a lower-middle, limited capability, point and shoot digital camera. Nikon F65 cf Canon A70. For you, as you describe yourself, I think the digital would be the better choice.\nExtra costs: with a digital camera, you may need a spare, expensive, battery, a battery charger, extra memory cards, a card reader to get the pictures into and out of your computer, and maybe even need to upgrade your\ncomputer. Digital camera files eat up hard drive space, so I bought a CD burner. Besides, you need to save the pictures, and can't trust your hard drive.\nIncidentally, some people don't understand that the memory card is reusable. Take, say, 100 shots on it, transfer those pictures to your computer, clean/erase/reformat the card, and start taking a second 100 on the same card.\nMy bottom line: when I'm not being a pro photographer, and just a father who takes pix of family and friends, I love digital, but I'm using a thousand pound, ($2000) or so, camera. And when I'm being a pro, I love digital even more, for the speed of getting pictures to editors, up on web sites, and more.\nFinally, the best way to improve quick and dirty portraits is to use a reflector to soften the shadows, or shoot in some gently lit place, rather than in bright sunshine. The reflector can be as simple as a white wall. Just move the subject over so light bounces off the wall onto the darker side of the face.\nNew on Saturday, July 26,\u00a0 2003\nNike ad slammed in Marketing, by me\nMarketing magazine, Canada's leading advertising industry trade publication, ran a letter to the editor from me inthelatest edition.\nHere's the letter from the July 28 / August 4, 2003 issue\nAnother letters piss fest\nDon't just do it on the street please\nWhen an advertiser resorts to promoting pissing in an alley-the Nike campaign made the front page of the June 16 issue of Marketing-it's no wonder that advertising is sneered at by so many.\nHere's the Nike poster on the side of a publicly-owned Toronto Transit Commission streetcar.\nAl and Laura Ries have it right in The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR. Not only does (far too much, but not all) advertising have no credibility, but efforts sanctioned by the likes of Caroline Whaley-Marketing tells us she's director of marketing for Nike Canada and responsible for this Runto.ca program-should embarrass everyone in the business.\nMarketing says \"The campaign's public relations is being handled by Veritas Communications of Toronto,\" but doesn't say if \"campaign\" means the ad campaign or the overall run program. Veritas is supposedly an expert in good and bad PR, according to the \"How Not to Drop the PR Ball\" article on page 16 of the same issue, which describes how Bob Reid and Derek Kent of Veritas pronounce judgment on PR actions of others. Look inward, gentlemen.\nI wonder if they'll write about alley-pissing as a way of helping, to quote the Marketing page one story, Nike meet its \"goal of returning the beleaguered city of Toronto to its former self.\" In my city, I'd prefer no-one in Nike suits \"doing it\" in public.\nI hope the TTC is charging full rates for the streetcar sides. If it's willing to help promote Toronto as a city of boors, it should at least get paid well.\nNew on Tuesday, July 22,\u00a0 2003\nNew cool (well, hot, really) store near my Toronto office\nI was out\u00a0 researching digital photography printing the other day when I discovered the first Calphalon Culinary Center in Canada, and the second in the world. The other is in Chicago.\nIt is at King Street West and Spadina Avenue, in the gizzard (a culinary word, just west of the heart) of downtown Toronto.\nCurious about the place, I went in, was warmly welcomed, and given a tour. There's very high quality cookware for sale, and two classrooms where you can learn to use the cookware. One is like a theatre, and you watch the chef at work.\nBut the other's got two gas burners per student, the best in Kitchen Aid appliances, and a corner of the kitchen where, when the class is over, the students and the teachers gather together and eat up the course's projects.\nI have no business connection -- I just thought it was a sharp (sells knives, too) place you should know about if visiting Toronto There's more at www.Calphalon.com . Look for the link to Toronto\nMy first magazine cover was of this fireboat\nI took this shot last weekend, just at sunset down at the harbor in Toronto. The first time I shot this boat, my picture ended up as my first magazine cover, and was a big part of getting me into professional photography. The original was taken when\u00a0 was in Grade 10, a guest of my father on a harbor tour sponsored by the Toronto Board of Trade. I shot the boat and made a print in my high school darkroom, and my father liked it and took it in to Cyril Davies, the editor of the Board of Trade Journal, who bought it and ran it and got me encouraged.\nNew on Monday, July 7,\u00a0 2003\nAccreditation doesn't matter at IABC's biggest chapter\nIABC Toronto, which I've been told repeatedly is the largest chapter world-wide in this association, has an accreditation program it touts as being one of the advantages of membership.\nBut not one member of the board, save last's year's president who automatically becomes past president, is either\u00a0 1/ qualified to become accredited, or if eligible to write the exam, 2/ bothered to become accredited.\nIABC's got a mediocre system of selecting \"leaders\" as it likes to call them. Once you get to the Executive VP level, at least at the Toronto chapter, you automatically become the president a year later. Same principle, different titles, at IABC world-wide.\nThis guarantees that members have no real say over who is going to be the head of the association in a time of rapid change. Instead, they get someone chosen (\"elected\" seems too strong a word, since there don't seem to be many candidates running for office) a year before taking office. If changing circumstances requires a different kind of leader, well, you're out of luck at IABC Toronto.\nFor that matter, you're out of luck at IABC world-wide, too, unless the man named this year is the right guy for the changed circumstances a year from now. Next year's Chairman is already chosen -- David Kistle. He's from Minnesota, and he's accredited.\nThe new president of IABC Toronto is Amanda Brewer, who works for a mutual fund firm. She has no ideas of her own that she's willing to share with BAK's Report readers. Leadership??? Here's what she wrote to us; \"At this time I will have to decline your offer to provide you with my mandate for the chapter - that is something that the board collectively will work on during our strategic planning session, which will take place later in the summer.\" It makes me wonder what \"President\" means.\nI'm curious if the IABC Toronto board mandate will include actually implementing the principles of business communications (not the dental plan stuff, the image and advocacy and fighting for their members stuff) that's been missing for far too long.\nNew on Wednesday, July 2, 2003\nTHE FALL OF ADVERTISING AND THE RISE OF PR -- Al and Laura Ries\nIf you need summer reading, here's the book to get. It might well\u00a0 change how you make presentations to your clients, whether you are an advertising or public relations professional. But if you're on the ad side, you won't like what the book says, even if you admit to yourself that it is true.\nThe thrust of the book is simple: use public relations (Al\u00a0 and Laura thinks this is mostly publicity, with some special events tossed in) to build a brand, and then use advertising to maintain the brand. Stop spending multiple millions to launch a new product with a blockbuster ad blitz, and just use publicity (PR) instead.\nThere are lots of examples, and they do make the point that there are exceptions to the rules. But what they end up saying, several times, is that the credibility of PR, as expressed by editors who decide to print stories about our clients, outweighs the lack of credibility in most ads. Readers expect ads to be one-sided and incomplete, and they trust editors to pre-clean the honestly of PR claims.\nI'm recommending that publicity-oriented PR firms buy lots of copies, and give them to clients as gifts.\nISBN: 0060081988\nPublished: September\u00a02002\u00a0| Published\u00a0by HarperCollins Publishers, Incorporated\nNew on Friday, May 30, 2003\u00a0--\nCanada's finest publishing company thanks us all and says goodbye\nMacfarlane Walter & Ross, Canada's finest publishing company, has shut its doors. The real Macfarlane, John left, the Walter, Jan, center, and the Ross, Gary right, invited the authors, designers, editors, editorial assistants, landlord, and other friends of the firm to a goodbye and thank-you party, on Thursday, May 29. MW&R had books atop the best seller lists month after month, year after year, and for several years, the number one best seller all year was an MW&R book. Fifteen great years.\nI was a friend of the firm from the start, spent countless hours bouncing ideas around, designed and assembled catalogs, wrote the best ad about a book ever written by anybody -- for On The Take -- and took dozens of photos of authors, and hundreds more of my pictures were published in Going To Town.\nNew on Wednesday, March 26, 2003\u00a0--\nDigital photography is worth looking at, so to speak\nI've invested in a Nikon CoolPix 5700 camera, and am conducting experiments to see just how far a camera of this level can go in meeting the needs of public relations professionals for high-impact photography without the time (or expense, although digital is not much cheaper)\nIf you've got questions about digital photography and public relations, just drop me a note at briankiglre@BrianKilgore.com and I'll try to answer them.\nSo far, the investment seems to be paying off.\nYork University, Toronto (I went there) appoints ad guy Chief Communications Officer\nRichard Fisher, who spent the past four years at TBWA \\ Chiat \\Day, and his background includes some other ad agencies. (O&M for one.)\nYork is a huge university, mostly on the northern edge of Toronto, although there's a smaller campus closer to downtown, where I was a student long ago. Fisher's got his work cut out for him. There's a letter to the editor in a national newspaper in Canada today pointing out that goons at York regularly attack people who have opinions. My overall opinion of the school is that it is not very good, except for the business school, is badly run, encourages goons and thugs to bully other students, and generally is home to people who can't get into a better school, or live in the neighborhood. Maybe it does need an advertising man to run communications, but I might have opted for a genuine public relations professional. Mr. Fisher's department ran a big appointment ad with a huge photo -- as appointment ad photos go -- of himself, and then ran another ad announcing another appointment to the York board. Each ad repeated lots of bumpf about the school, meaning York and its students paid for the same message to be published twice, a page apart.\nI'm curious now, and will be watching to see what I can learn about the school as the new CCO goes to work.\nNew on Friday, February 21, 2003\u00a0--\nPR stunt of the month --\nA good story by a good reporter about a good pr stunt\nHere's the opening blurb on the National Post newspaper web site today, leading to a story about how a Canadian airline, Westjet, offered people named Hamilton the chance to fly anywhere the airline serves, for free, for one day. It was part of a promotion to let Canada know the airlines now flies to Hamilton, Ontario. ASIDE: Attention IABC members. If you are flying to Toronto for the conference, (see red box below) you can fly to Hamilton instead, via Westjet. The Hamilton airport's closer to Toronto than the Edmonton airport is to that city. Fortunately for the airline's PR people, there is a National Post reporter named Hamilton (Graeme is his first name) with a sense of humour and a sense of adventure and a sense of fairness.\n535 Hamiltons take flight without paying a penny\nOTTAWA-HAMILTON-WINNIPEG-CALGARY-VANCOUVER-CALGARY-HAMILTON-OTTAWA - I wouldn't know the Hamilton tartan if it flapped in my face, and I lose track of my family tree at the outer branches, but this much I can say with certainty about the Hamilton clan: We love free flights.\nIf the link in the blurb does not work for you, go to www.nationalpost.com and search for Hamilton. I thought it was a great story, fun to read, not even counting the PR success for Westjet. The Post's editors thought it was worthy of the front page. So do I.\nNew on Tuesday, November 19, 2002\u00a0--\u00a0 my wife's birthday!\nEight things to remember during downsizing\nIf you go to Eight things to remember during downsizing you should see an interesting article by my friend / associate / colleague / client Mark Towhey, an expert on crisis communications, whether physical -- fires, bombs, etc., -- or intellectual, like a downsizing. It's the latest addition to Mark's web site. If the link does not work, try www.towhey.com , and then look on the left hand side of the page for the link to the article.\nHere's one of the points he makes, just to give you the flavor of the article.\n2. Remember the survivors.\nWhere your company has been able to pick and choose who goes and who stays, you have probably chosen to retain your superior performers. Don't forget them during the downsizing turmoil. They will probably be just as shocked as those who are leaving. No doubt, their first thoughts are \"how does this affect me?\" and \"am I going next?\" Productivity will drop during this period, that's a given. How well you can communicate with them, and make them more comfortable, confident and effective, will determine just how far productivity drops and when/if it recovers. Expect to need special communication programs targeting these people.\nI know there are some PR people, and other managers, coping with downsizing who don't in fact, have the luxury of having retained to top performers. As we live our lives held hostage to financial \"analysts\" and with CEOs still trying to beat the street estimates, all too often the top employees are fired after years of loyal service, in order to cut the payroll even more. What's left? Juniors who are in over their heads.\nTylenol -- another look at the crisis communciations. Go see www.odwyerpr.com for a new take on an old story.\nNew on Thursday, November 14, 2002\u00a0--\nAre you making your media events tv-friendly?\nMost PR people are not, of course, doing this\nHere's something I wrote for a photography forum in the internet, where a person had remarked on how hard it is to take good video pictures. PR LESSON? The television crews need interesting things to happen in 30 second chunks, and you need to tell them when those 30 chunks will arrive.\nI spend a fair bit of time with television news video photographers because I'm mostly in the PR business.\nIt's amazing how most PR people do not take the needs of video photographers into consideration when setting up news conferences and publicity stunts.\nWhile a still photographer needs on, say, 1/125 of a second of interesting action, the video guys need 30 seconds at a time, repeated several times.\nIf your CEO is making a speech, get a copy beforehand, mark the paragraphs that you'd most like to see on the TV news that night, and give it to the tv crews. You'll find they are just as interested in getting the good stuff as you are, and chances are pretty good they'll turn the camera on if you tell them when the best parts are.\nFailure to provide tv-friendly events results, as you can see by watching television news, all those tv news shots panning across the gathered reporters and other photographers, just in order to have something going on to put on the screen for the time the announcer needs to tell the overall story.\nHere are some more tools, techniques, tips and philosophies that most PR people arranging media events seem to forget.\n1/ Television requires props. Have real products, or blown up photos of real products, or samples of raw materials, or charts and graphs that are big and bold enough to be seen on television.\n2/ Television does not require dull-looking un-named drones standing behind the person being featured. There's no need to surround t he person being interviewed with silent unknowns, and it distracts from your message.\n3/ More people will see the tv coverage of your event than will see the event in person, if you do your job right, so make it easy for the tv people to get their shots. I remember working at a conference organized by twinkies who put the television crews at the back of the room, so they would not get in the way of the people in the audience. Just plain stupid, and stubborn as only a twinkie can be. the only way we got the tv people to the front, where they needed to be, was when I told the twinkies that there would be no luncheon speaker and that instead we'd hold a news conference outside the banquet room.\n4/ Lighting matters. If you can illuminate the podium, and illuminate the displays with the products or the posters or the graphs, the tv crews will happily use your lights, instead of turning on the camera lights and blinding your speakers. And they won't be disturbing everyone by installing and removing their light stands when the event is underway. The still photographers will appreciate your efforts, too.\n5/ Help with the cutaways. Television video requires pictures to show in between the chunks of a speech that are being broadcast. Producers just can't cut from one part of the speech to another, because the picture of the speaker jumps. So cutaways are used. These are chunks of film -- often the panning shot of the audience -- that are in between the pictures of the speaker. Before the event starts, take the tv crews aside and show them samples, graphs, posters, raw materials, etc., set up under good lighting. They'll shoot these, and be able to insert them into the news clip when they need a \"bridge' from one shot to another.\nThere are lots more ways to pay special attention to television crews. Use your imagination, and you'll improve your coverage dramatically.\nNew on Friday, November 1, 2002\u00a0--\nEither three days too late or 25 days early\nDid you send out a great photograph with your month end results?\nPR LESSON: Lots of industries report results at the end of the month. The car companies all provide sales figures, real estate boards publish sales stats, and so on. If your company is a player in the industries that provide these kinds of stats, did you send out a great photograph for business editors on daily papers to use when they ran the industry story?\nJust asking....\nNew on Wednesday, October 30, 2002\u00a0--\nI go nuts when supposedly professional communicators bury interesting and important information. The story below is on the International Association of Business Communicators web site, but you sure wouldn't know it if you just went to the front page of the site, and looked for what's new. No, the people that run the site can't figure out that putting news up front would be a public service. IABC did not bother sending me the news release, either\nOver at the Toronto chapter of the Canadian Public Relations Society, the web site boss is looking for committee members who know HTML coding. Why? You don't need coding to figure out what stories and information should be on a web site, nor do you need the knowledge in order to post the info, if you use a decent piece of web management software. And as a reader pointed out to me today, HTML coding is the old fashioned stuff, so if the committee needs tekkies, that's the wrong qualification.\nAnyway, below is the latest important info from IABC -- a lot more important than an announcement of yet another opportunity to spend money, which is the usual IABC non-news News Release.\nNew on Tuesday, October 22, 2002\u00a0--\nCanadian Census data shows our audiences are changing greatly\nWe appear to be at the point where major changes to demographics are happening more rapidly than in my memory. The Globe and Mail website, at www.globeandmail.com has a new story telling us how families are changing, where the most common-law families are, how many kids are still at home, and lots more of interest to communicators who want to reach mass audiences. the main point? Mass audiences aren't what they used to be. It's easy to find the story, and, PR LESSON? when you read it, think about what it means to your communications plans. Here's just one paragraph from the story, by Darren Yourk:\nMarried or common-law couples with children aged 24 and under living at home represented only 44 per cent of all families. These accounted for 49 per cent of all families in 1991, and represented more than one-half in 1981 (55 per cent).\nImagine what this means if you're planning the communications plans for a car maker, or even a dealer. Do you pull the minivans from the ads, and replace them with the two-door sedans, high enough off the road that 50 - 60 year old knees are still able to get in and out? How does it change your promotion of vacation sites, or even your menu planning for a company picnic? There's lots to think about in that story, plus links to more sources.\nAre you involved in \"lifestyle\" marketing communications? The study gives some stats on same-sex couples, too:\nStatistics Canada released the first-ever count of Canada's same-sex couples Tuesday, saying a total of 34,200 same-sex common-law couples were counted in Canada in 2001.\nThe number represents 0.5 per cent of all couples in the country. Male couples outnumbered female couples in the 2001 census, with 19,000 male same-sex couples comprising 55 per cent of the total.\nHow does this compare to the numbers you've heard from special interest groups?\nYou can read the IABC story in the National Post\nIABC says Canadians beat Americans in access to the bosses, increased budgets, but take a 30% pay cut to accomplish this\nYesterday's National Post newspaper's Financial Post business section included a column called Ad Lib, written by reporter Susan Heinrich, with a segment about the International Association of Business Communicator's latest member survey. I wrote about it yesterday, just a bit down this page. Today, you can read the entire story by going to www.nationalpost.com\nThen, type \"Susan Heinrich\" into the search box at the top. Then look for the story headed \"Look for Marketel New Venture\" which is the headline for yesterday's column. Scroll down and the last story is about IABC. My favorite line from the story, referring to the increased access and decreased paycheques of the Canadians, is, \"A bit of advice to all you out there who are \"In like Flynn\" with Mr. President: ASK FOR A RAISE!\"\nNew on Monday, October 21, 2002\u00a0--\nIABC finally gets some good PR.\nNational Post newspaper, read by business leaders across Canada, covers the International Association of Business Communicators \"Profile\" survey.\nIABC PR manager Heidi Taff was in Toronto last with with Warren Bickford, elected head of IABC's research foundation, and Annette Martell, the elected queen of all IABC (she lives in Toronto) and they went to visit Canada's two nation-wide newspapers. In the Financial Post section of National Post today, ad columnist Susan Heinrich has six and a half column inches of her Ad Lib column devoted to some of the stats from the survey -- Canadian IABC members have better access to the top management than do US members, Canadians make two thirds the pay of the Americans, and, in Canada, 59% increased department budgets over the past two years, compared to only 37% with increasing bucks in the USA.\nMs. Heinrich reports that IABC surveyed 1,349 members. Semantics raises its ugly head: In fact, it surveyed about ten times that, (around 13 thousand) and 90% of members did not bother to answer the survey. You can probably read a lot about the survey yourself by going to www.IABC.com\nI can't find a way to get to this Financial Post story on the web. The Financial Post / National Post web site is weirdly constructed, with lots of interesting stuff missing. Maybe it is trying to get you to buy the paper, or maybe it just has not enough money to hire people to get all the stories up. If you have the paper, look on page FP6. For reasons I do not understand, Bickford, Martell and Taff are not mentioned, and even International Association of Business Communicators isn't in bold face like every other organization in the column, so the story certainly does not stand out. But, at least, an IABC story is there in a major newspaper. IABC tried media relations and it worked. An ad columnist recognized a business communicators (whatever \"business communicator\" means, anyway) story was worth covering and of\u00a0 interest to her readers ...\nI've been trying for years to get the associations to do something important in media relations, other than, as the story below about the Public Relations Society of America shows, wasting their time on crap that does not serve the members, or news releases touting courses.\nThursday, September 26, 2002\u00a0--\nI'm right about the newsworthiness of pr association events\nCPRS / Consultants Institute meeting makes\nCanada's National newspaper\nTom Hoog, chairman of Hill & Knowlton USA, was in Toronto last week and spoke to a joint Canadian Public Relations Society and Consultant's Academy meeting. The contents of his speech made it into the Globe and Mail, which is a national newspaper roughly parallel to a combined Wall Street Journal and New York Times in the USA, read by business leaders across Canada\nYou can read the story at www.globeandmail.com , by typing Tom Hoog into the search engine. Or try clicking on the story title here: It's good PR to keep employees loyal\nRegular readers know I've been campaigning for years for the PR associations to do a better job with PR for themselves. One argument is that the meetings are not interesting enough to justify coverage. Leaving aside why a chapter would run a dull meeting, at least this proves that reporters will come when invited, and newspapers will run the stories. PR LESSON? Invite the media to the speeches your executives give. There will be more people outside the room who are interested than there will be inside the room.\nBut what about IABC? Julie Freeman, paid boss of the International Association of Business Communciators, spoke recently in Malaysia about ethics, but I can't find her speech on the IABC web site, and it's not on the IABC Malaysia link provided on the IABC's main site, either. Here's all I can find on the IABC web site: \"In addition, Julie presented a keynote address on the ethical practice of communications in the New Economy.\" I've asked Heidi Taff, IABC's PR manager, for a copy to publish for my readers. Did IABC even send the speech to the business newspapers in the world's capitals? I'll see if I can find out.\nNew on Tuesday, July 16, 2002\nIf you don't want to believe me, believe Fraser Seitel\nThe PR chief should sit at the right hand of the CEO\nIt says so in my First Principles, which you can read here . And today, in O'Dwyer's PR Daily web publication (PR daily is at at www.odwyerpr.com and the article is at http://www.odwyerpr.com/0716prof_dev.htm ) Fraser Seitel writes, with my emphasis added, \"\nThe fundamental difference between PR and advertising or marketing is this:\nAdvertising and marketing sell the product. PR sells the organization.\nThat's why the PR director should properly report to the CEO, while the advertising or marketing departments can be subordinated with line product or service groups.\nIt's another good Seitel column, worth reading because it discusses primarily when advertising belongs to the advertising sub-section of a marketing department and when advertising belongs in the public relations or corporate communications department, and then goes on to discuss media choices.\nI'll add four thoughts to the content of Fraser's column:\n1/ Getting corporate advertising right is very hard to do, and requires a senior level brain (which may or may not be housed inside a fairly young head.) For instance, if you have today's New York Times handy, turn to page C3 for a lousy ad from, presumably, the PR department of American Electric Power. The first sentence of the body copy is self-justification twaddle that causes smart people to almost wretch. Don't have the paper handy? It says, \"AEP knows the equation for financial success. Our business model is built on rich, diverse assets across the energy spectrum. This provides a strong foundation for sustainable growth in a varity of market scenarios.\" And it goes on, unread.\nShareholders, regulators, employees, and customers should write to the CEO of AEP and ask him why he approved wasting tens of thousands of dollars on this crap.\nWhich leads us to point two.\n2/\u00a0 Bad corporate advertising is worse than no corporate advertising. Do you have any respect left for Carly the HP gal, after she blew tens of millions on misleading advertising promoting her get-Carly-rich merger with Compaq? Remember the really awful corporate ads from Alcatel where they bastardized Martin Luther King's Washington speech for selfish corporate gain? Note that Alcatel is now laying off people and the stock is in the dumpster. Lousy corporate ads sure did not help it, either.\nAnd, just to make life more interesting in the intra-office turf wars, I suggest to you point three ....\n3/ All advertising is corporate advertising, sortof. I believe that someone within the corporate relations or public relations department should be both authorized to and required to sign off on just about all product and service ads created by the advertising department, because advertising speaks to the values of the company, in addition to helping get something sold.\nI assumed this role at Northern Telecom (Nortel Networks before the idiots took over and ran it into the ground) and it took some diplomacy to get it working, but it did work, and the ads spoke to the corporate values of the time in addition to selling phones and cables and switches. I ended up getting deeply involved in the content of the product and service ads, but that was just the nature of the place and the people there at the time, and is not necessary. Just make sure, for instance, the ads do not use fuzzy photos, because this suggests fuzzy thinking. And that the copy is straightforward and not misleading, because honesty is a corporate\u00a0 value. PR LESSON: Want an example? No good PR person reviews Dell ads, or that small type at the bottom would be enlarged to be readable, instead of leaving the impression that there are catches and tricks and scams being pulled that Michael Dell and Steve the tv-guy don't want you to know about, so the ads are deliberately hard to read.\n4/ Print ads are meant to be sent directly to your most important audiences, so order pre-prints (even better than reprints) and add \"With the compliments of ...\" cards, and mail them to the people most important to you. Post them on bulletin boards and include them with pay stubs. Frame them in lobbies and include them inside product packages... Remember, all the people you want to read the New York Times or Wall Street Journal on some Tuesday may be reading the Times of London and the Financial Post that morning, so send them the ad, uncluttered.\nMore Seitel praise from me...\nMartha Stewart and Brunswick pr\nHe writes well and informatively about Martha Stewart and the Brunswick PR agency that PR headhunter Arnie Huberman thinks is the wrong choice for Martha. Fraser writes at http://www.odwyerpr.com/0715comm_martha.htm , and I write about Huberman's scorn for Brunswick here.\nAn update in November of a story originally from Friday afternoon, July 5, 2002\nThoughts on crisis communications\nBack in July I ran a story about crisis communications related to Martha Stewart. Here are some of the thoughts from back then that still apply today.\nCan we find some PR LESSONS? in this? Here are four (plus) thoughts about crisis communications for the readers of BAK's Report.\n1/ In the world of crisis communications, the requirements of the agency hired to help (or PR firm, or counsellor, or whatever you want to call the firm or person hired) as to size and heritage are these:\na/ What matters most is the experience and way of thinking and approach and skill and talent of ONE INDIVIDUAL within a firm responsible for the overall strategy (and the word is the actual word to use in a crisis) used to cope with the crisis.\nb/ It barely matters how many other people work for the firm, but the counsellor should have a circle of trusted associates to bounce ideas off of.\nc/ The extent of the geographic scope of the crisis requires the individual in a/ to have access to strategic advice and tactical implementation in appropriate geographic places. In a financial crisis, those places usually can be defined by country, rather than by state or city or county. Where is the stock listed? Where do large numbers of shareholders live? Where are there company operations so big that the local / national media care about the problem? As an example of this \"where are\" considerations, look at the interest in in the USA in the Vivendi scandal, which concerns a French company. But a French company with a lot of USA operations.\nHowever, there is no need for these \"geographic reps\" to be employees of the same firm as the lead counsel. In the case of Martha Stewart, her stock is listed only on one stock exchange (New York, in the USA), the vast majority of her magazine sales are in North America, her store sales are almost all in the USA and Canada, and it is reasonable to expect the same geographic interest in her via her web site. She can be served well by a counsellor in the USA, and Brunswick's non-USA people, and foreign ownership, don't matter. All that matters is the quality of the individual one or two Brunswickers involved in leading the project.\nd/ And it does not matter where the company owning the crisis counsellor is owned; all that matters is that the person working the file knows the country where the crisis is. (Note all the ad agencies and PR companies actually owned in England but operating around the world. Or, if you are a BAK's Report reader outside the USA, think of all the ad agencies and PR firms in your country that are owned in the USA but staffed by local experts. (I know, I know, lots are staffed by expatriate Yanks who don't know anything about your country, but that's another story.)\n2/ I believe a crisis can involve a well-meaning individual just as easily as it involves a genuine crook, and I believe that the lead players in a crisis can often include people who just plain refuse, at least for a while, to catch on that there is a crisis.\na/ Related thought: a crisis can involve a number of people with conflicting interests, but it is amazing how often they will, at least for a while, try to support each other. In the Martha Stewart case, look at the initial reaction of Martha and her then-supporters as they acted instinctively to questions, and then look at later developments when they had time to think out the implications of each word spoken, and as they found out additional facts.\nb/ It's necessary in a crisis to calm down and think of where the problem really is, and what range of end-results you would consider reasonable. In a lot of crises situations, the thought is that media relations is the most important element, but often the most important element is criminal prosecutors or civil suit lawyers. Where the skill of the crisis expert often really gets tested is in the oversight of media relations prior to (intending to avoid) legal filings / charges.\n3/ The two hardest parts of crisis communications are:\na/ getting the person / people involved to realize that a train is coming down the track at them, and ...\nb/ getting them to do what the PR counsel tells them, often in conflict with their instincts and often in conflict with the wrong kind of legal advice. (Good legal advice is always welcome by the top PR people. We don't hate lawyers, we just hate bad, chicken, lawyers. As I say in my First Principles of Public Relations (it's here) We are only as good as our clients allow us to be.\nc/ We (the PR counsellors) do not, of course, have any ultimate control over the elements of a crisis. We can often predict a problem coming, but usually we are ignored. We may suspect a problem, but we don't get heard. Other times, things develop without our knowledge, we are blindsided, and we are as surprised an anyone. This blindsiding should be rare, though.\nWhen we do our job right, we are cynics and pessimists and we can see bad stuff coming.\nWant a prediction of trouble? Here's one you can get ready for. The PR profession is going to be next (after analysts, brokers, and accountants) getting slammed over the shambles in North American business, and the \"leaders\" of the communciations associations are ignoring this train coming down my metaphorical track, and just trying to sell you more courses and manuals.\nAnyway, back to the topic.\n4/ Luck plays a huge part in crisis management. Is there some big story breaking that keeps your crisis out of the paper? Does the politician who would take up arms against you go off on holidays the day before the plain brown envelope damning you arrives at his office? Is the crisis so complicated that most reporters can't figure it out, so skip the story (Global Crossing, for the first few months, Enron for many months.)?\nNew on Thursday, May 2, 2002\nI'm in O'Dwyer's PR Daily today\nA few weeks ago, Jack O'Dwyer, to my mind the dean of the PR journalism profession, asked me to write a guest column for his web site. Here's the heading he put on the opening page today. You can read the whole column by going to www.odwyerpr.com , and then scrolling down the page, or click on http://www.odwyerpr.com/0502gc_kilgore.htm to go straight to the column. Or, click on the first few words of the extract below.\nGUEST COMMENTARY:\nBy Brian Kilgore\nEditor, BAK's Report\nBy not speaking up on key issues, leaders of PR groups such as PRSA, IABC and CPRS are failing their societies and the PR industry. Joann Killeen, elected head of PRSA, is the most important PR woman in America. But try to find anything she ever said\nAnd a warm welcome to any O'Dwyer's readers who have come to BAK' Report for the first time, courtesy of the links Jack put into his PR Daily. I try to put lots of interesting comment here, along with hints and tips that either reinforce the thinking of some people or bring fresh ideas to others. And, if you are an IABC, PRSA or CPRS member, and you do have any examples of good presentations, speeches, out-reach -- call it what you will -- by the top elected leaders of your associations, please tell me about them, and how they were \"taken out of the room\" in a way that would cause business leaders (and other kinds of clients and employers) to get the PR people more involved, earlier.\nNew on Monday, April 8\nFREE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\nTired of paying huge amounts of money for the webinars and seminars and fancy binders full of pretentious bafflegab (and some good info) offered by the Public Relations Society of America and the International Association of Business Communicators?

Here's some of what I did.\n-- Short excerpt from speech given to conference organizers for pre-conference publicity.\n-- Speech reproduced for distribution to media.\n-- Media conference called for 9:30 on morning of speech, since speech is at dinner, and that's too late for the television news that night. Media notice included speech extracts.\n-- Suppliers to deliver props for news conference, to be used for photos and to generate interest with reporters.\n-- Poster for background at news conference, with major points in big type, making it easy for news photographers and tv cameras to capture main points.\n-- Poster will be main focus of speaker's opening remarks at\u00a0 news conference.\n-- Speaker to say four most important two-minutes portions of speech at conference, so TV can tape them.\n-- Speaker scheduled to do live interview on major business television program morning after show.\n-- Copies of speech, along with cover letter from speaker and/or division head, ready for mailing morning after speech to over 300 customers who will not be in attendance.\n-- Table cards with phone, e-mail and regular addresses of division head and speaker designed, printed, and ready to be put at each guest's place at dinner, to be used to request copy of speech.\nWe know enough to take the speech out of the room. And I wasn't even \"elected\" president of PRSA.\nNew on Saturday, February 2, 2002\nLow-priced presentation training: I worked on a couple of speeches / presentations last week, without being able to deal directly with the speakers in person. One of the speakers is just wrapping up her comments, in a city many miles from me, as I type this. Here are the hints I sent to them for low-priced, easy-to-do, self-serve presentation preparation. They'll work for every speaker without the time or budget for professional rehearsal. Feel free to cut and paste them into a memo for your own staff, although I'd like some credit.\nFive hints for successful presentations and speeches\n1/ Record your second or third run through as you read through your text.\nThen play it back, listening to yourself. You are your own best critic, and you'll see immediately how and when you need to adjust pacing, emphasis, and maybe even change some of the words. You'll realize what names or other words you can't pronounce, too.\n2/ Revise your speaking notes so they are designed for the ear, not the eye. Most speeches start with a grammatical written text, and this looks good to the eye when you read it silently to yourself. And this is fine for the handouts and news release.\nBut, for your speaker's version, revise it just a bit, revise it just a bit so that there's some repetition and bridges from thought to thought. Flip back and remind your audience aurally of those points they would look back and re-read in a paper-based version.\n3/ Format your speaker's notes so that you can read them easily, and they guide your pace and emphasis.\nKeep the words on the top two thirds of the page, so your eyes keep looking at the audience, and you aren't always trying to find your place.\nMake the type big enough to read without putting on silly glasses.\nBreak up sentences so that there's emphasis in the right places. Sentences that are two long on the page make you rush through them,\n... but you slow down when they are broken up in your notes. (Test for yourself; just read the preceding sentence out loud)\nIntroduce a new thought at the end of one page, so it sinks into the audience while you are not speaking because you are turning to the next page inyour text.\n4/ Synchronize your breathing and reading. This takes a little practice.\nA/ Turn your eyes down, breath in, read a sentence silently and insert it into your brain\nB/ Bring your eyes up, look at the audience, and say the words while breathing out\nC/ Look down again, take a breath, read the next words silently and put them into your brain\nD/ Look up, say the words, and maintain eye contact.\nWatch most business people as they speak. (at least the ones who didn't read this.) You'll see the top of their heads when they are talking to you, and you'll see their eyes while they are breathing and saying nothing.\n5/ If your slides don't matter, don't show them. But if they do matter, give the audience time to read them. Remember, they can't read the slides and listen to you at the same time. People's brains don't work that way. So pause, or read some of the slide out loud while the audience reads along silently with you.\nNew on Monday, January 21, 2002\nMy predictions for 2002\nCharles Pizzo, the immediate past chairman of IABC, a PR man based in New Orleans, and an excellent lecturer, is speaking in Tucson and Phoenix this week (January 23 in Phoenix and January 24 in Tucson) and he asked a number of people for predictions. Here's the heart of what I wrote to him, edited for BAK's Report.\nCharles, I've been working hard over the past few days to get into a positive mood, so I could tell you about the great things that are going to happen in our business in 2002.\nI failed. 2002 is going to be more of the same, and the same is pretty crappy.\nNew on Wednesday, January 16, 2002\nJust about a year ago I wrote:\nThe nine most important concepts in\u00a0employee communications\nBrian A. Kilgore -- Communications Counsel\nSaturday, January 27, 2001\nIf you missed it, you can read it at the top of the page in the new Internal & Employee Communications section, right here.\nNew on Sunday, January 6, 2002\nThe internet as a (publicity subset of) PR tool\nI could write a whole book on this, but Steve O'Keefe has beaten me to it. You can read about the book over at Jack O'Dwyer's web site, at www.odwyerpr.com , in Fraser P. Seitel's Professional Development section about Online Publicity, part way down the page. Fraser writes, \"The best resource for mastering such publicity is the seminal work by Internet publicity pioneer, Steve O'Keefe, Publicity on the Internet, published by John Wiley & Sons.\"\nAnd if you do a web search (I used Google) you'll get to more info on Mr. O'Keefe and his ideas. I'm going back later today just to troll through the stuff, and pick up some tips.\nBut, for those of you here expecting something useful from me, here are, off the top of my head...\nSeven things PR people need to know about the internet. (And there's an earlier story about Public Relations on the Internet down here. )\n1/ The web is just another courier, letter carrier, envelope over the transom delivery device. It's just (sometimes but not always) faster and cheaper. I could mail BAK's Report to you if I had your addresses, and you could carry it out onto the porch, put your feet up on the railing, and read it there. But I don't have your address, and it takes a long time to type up the envelopes, so it gets delivered by computer.\n2/ The content matters. You won't read BAK's Report if you don't trust me, but the delivery medium does not really matter. You read this for what I write, and what I find for you. You may read for entertainment or enlightenment or because your tv is broken, but content matters more than delivery system. Chances are the people writing most web sites for most companies are among the most junior professional communicators, or they are not even pros in the field of conveying \"content.\" That said...\n3/ Speed is the greatest thing about public relations and the internet. You can send (\"send\" is the wrong word -- see below) information anywhere in only a few seconds. Yet vast numbers of PR people have no idea that speed and the internet are related. Want an example? Go to www.PRSA.org and root around for a while. You'll find reference to a story in the New York Times about PRSA but the braintrust there did not bother to even mention the story on the PRSA web site until so much time went by that the free access to the story -- You would like to read it, wouldn't you? -- has expired and now it costs $2.50. And you won't pay that, will you?\n4/ You find them / they find you. In the O'Keefe story on O'Dwyers (and remember, it was very short piece about a whole book, so there was probably more on this topic)\u00a0 the idea was that PR people send releases out to editors. This may quality for the jargon-word \"push.\" But \"pull\" also occurs, where editors (or other stakeholders) go looking for stories that have not been sent to them. So even if you send news releases by e-mail to selected editors and reporters, remember that others of us just go prowling around on web sites we think may have stuff. That's what I did as founding editor of eBizChronicle, and that is what I do here, too.\nThis means you need to get your releases up on your web site the moment you send them to editors. This is especially important in publicly traded companies. Another example? PRSA, after years of dealing with me, still doesn't bother sending me releases, and I get most of my news about this organization by searching through its badly designed and inadequately managed web site. Harsh? Try to find anything about the content of PRSA ex-Queen Bee Lewton's really-pretty-good speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. Links to a webcast were easily available, but no one put them up on the headquarters PRSA site for members or anyone else interested in PR to find. (Want to hear it? Go to www.prsadetroit.org There's a link there.)\n5/ Get to the readers of the reporters. When some people think first of PR (or the publicity subset of PR) on the internet, they think about sending stories from them to reporters and editors. Well and good, but of great importance is also getting to their readers. Reporters are going to filter your release in various ways when they prepare it for their papers, newscasts, and so on. By having your release information up front and obvious on your site, your stakeholders (the readers of the reporters) can get the full story, too. Yet finding news releases on most web sites is a dig, dig, dig exercise. Bad web managers put all kinds of crap other than news on the opening page, and the news is buried in some \"Press Room\" or \"Investors\" sub-section. You want the story on the font page of the Wall Street Journal or The Financial Times, and yet you bury it on your own site? That's just stupid.\n6/ The first two \"W\"s in WWW stand for \"World Wide\" yet most web sites are country-based. Your customers, employees, suppliers, investors and more are all over the place, yet you are provincial in your web presence, aren't you? Those few companies that even try to be international think it's good enough to start out with some flags viewers can click on, and then the sites become country-by-country. And some don't bother making each country site complete, linking viewers back to (often) the USA site to get the full story. That pisses people off people who do not live in the USA. Look at your site's executive biographies, and see if the top five people in England, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, France and other places are deemed important enough by some junior webmaster in the USofA to have their names even mentioned. If the junior webmaster has not included these people, maybe you should make an executive decision to overturn his or her bad judgment.\n7/ The web is the greatest way to deliver photographs to the media. There are two ways to do this (well, there's more, but these are the most important) You can include photos in the news release package you send by e-mail to editors. It's often better to send them as attachments, so that download times are quicker for the release itself, and editors can them choose whether or not to open the attachments.\u00a0 Or you can just send small sized, low resolution images in the news release it self, so the editors can see what the shots look like, and then insert a link to higher-resolution print-friendly versions. The editor needs to go back to you to get the shot, but you can offer it scanned for, say, 2 columns and five columns in a newspaper, half a page and full page in a magazine, and in color and black & white\nGo prowl around for a while on your site, and the sites of your biggest competitors (you do go visit their sites regularly, don't you?) and see which of these points applies.\nNew on Tuesday, January 1, 2002\nHappy New Year.\nNeed some New Year's Resolutions? No time to think them up? Here are a couple most PR executives can use.\nI resolve in 2002 to:\n1/ Write an 18 month rolling communications plan aimed at prompting actions that will benefit us. A \"rolling\" plan adds another month as each one ends, meaning it always looks 18 months into the future. I'll do this by January 22.\n2/ Depth of Management will be a component of the program. We won't let ourselves get tied to the life or death struggles of a single executive.\n3/ We're going to \"own\" our industry. Our communications program will convince more people, month after month, that we are the company in our industry.\u00a0 Best products. Best services. Best people creating them. Best to work for. Best to sell to. Best to buy from. Smartest. Most socially responsible.\n4/ Our communications department is going to properly adopt at least one new technology or tactical tool within four months. It may mean fixing the web site; maybe it's Blackberrys for the whole department. It could be digital cameras and photo transmission. But it will be important, and it will be operating very well by March 15 and\u00a0 flawlessly by May 1.\n5/ We'll write down the public relations and corporate communications mission of our web site, in plain English, and we'll get started with putting this mission into practice. What's a PR mission, in plain English? Here's a possible one: \"Because our\u00a0 web site can reach almost all stakeholders, anywhere at anytime, it will reflect all the strategies, tools, techniques and elements of our entire PR program, from reprints (and rebroadcasts) of speeches to summaries of our positions on issues of international importance to governments in all our markets around the world.\"\nFor an example of a web site that does not fulfill a PR mission, just go to www.prsa.org , and try to find info on the New York Times column about public relations, printed back in November, or info on the content of a speech made by PRSA to the Economic Club of Detroit.\nNew on Thursday, December 13\nKARA SWISHER'S BOOMTOWN -- The downside of the Wall Street Journal pay-to-read web site is that I don't pay, so I don't read. We get the actual paper-based paper at home. But if you can get to the site, go to Boom Town tomorrow, and see if I'm quoted.\nYesterday I sent her a shortened version of the article I wrote down here, earlier in the week. Here's the shortened version:\nIf you allow me to add \"better\" at the end, I'm pleased to offer nine items\noff the top of my head about what AOL Time Warner needs to do, or keep\ndoing, to make the merger work, better.\" I think it's working pretty well\nright now.\n1/ Each unit, each business, has to be viable on its own. Cull any operation\nthat is a loser.\n2/ It's still the content that counts. Good content means happy customers\nand financial success. My wife bought me a Fortune subscription for\nChristmas and at my house we watch, to quote my wife, \"my man Aaron (Brown)\"\nalmost every night, because of the quality of the content of the show.\n3/ Recognize that almost everyone who works within the AOLTW empire works\nfor some organization with a real name, a real reputation, a real product or\nservice. Time, Fortune, CNN, Warner Music, Little, Brown and so on.\n4/ It's a world-wide company. Pay attention to all of the empire, all at the\nsame time. Don't be insular Americans.\nDon't lump Stockholm and Cairo into the same region, and then ignore it\n5/ Convergence is semi-nonsense, and is no big deal. And synergy is a scam.\nDon't force-fit magazine writers into daily journalism, or make musicians\ninto TV hosts. And can anyone remember any honest and accurate prediction of\nmerger savings? They are all lies, so ignore them and get on with the job of\nbeing great.\n6/ Remember your customers aren't rich. We'll stop paying when it costs us\n$500 a year to read web versions of magazines And we don't have another $500\nto see a stock quote on an AOL-enabled cell phone.\nWhich brings us to...\n7/ We don't care. Contrary to badly designed and semi-honest, at best,\nsurveys, we don't care if we see movie trailers on our cell phones or if our\ncable television brings us 150 channels (we can only watch three at a time\nanyway without getting divorced) and we don't care whether we get a daily\njoke e-mailed to us.\n8/ Keep flexible. Don't get locked into the wrong technology, philosophy,\nor strategy, unable to get out because you are worried about saving face\nwith some analyst.\n9/ Your employees risk their lives for you. Respect this, respect them, and\nrespect the trust your customers have in you.\nNot all risk their lives, of course, but enough do, and many, many more\nsupport those risk takers. Aaron Brown told us this week of Steve Allen, a\nCNN technician who died in Afghanistan, not directly because of the war,\nthis week.\nHe was there, he was risking his life for no on-air glory, sending signals\nback to Atlanta and around the world. I benefited from his work. Mr. Case\nshould be at the funeral. I'm willing to bet, as I write this, that Mr.\nTurner will be.\nAt the heart of all nine is the need to provide good service and good\nproducts, not roll over to meet the desires of the commission-churning stock\nmarket industry.\n"}, {"score": 153.35445, "uuid": "2b9d0a50-fdb0-5c0a-91bf-aa5444eb6ef3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300wb-17-12471", "target_hostname": "www.rps.org", "target_uri": "http://www.rps.org/region/South-West/Latest-Regional-Newsletter", "page_rank": 1.614657e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "South Western Region newsletter - The Royal Photographic Society", "snippet": "Will has enjoyed working in the photographic press <em>for</em> 25 years and is currently the editor <em>for</em> Advanced Photography Magazine.

The recording proves that Strickland was cooperative with police.\nBesides, when was the last time you heard of a car thief dialing 911 in the midst of a crime spree to report police brutality?\nIn its letter to Miami Beach Mayor Matti Bower, the ACLU also brings up the excessive arrests that occur every Memorial Day Weekend when throngs of young black people descend upon Miami Beach for the annual hip hop fest.\nThey are accused of arresting people for photographing incidents of police misconduct and seizing their memory cards and cameras.\nIf you remember, I was one of the photographers arrested by Miami Beach police last Memorial Day Weekend. This is from the ACLU press release.\nMBPD officers also have an alarming history of arresting individuals, particularly African-American men and women, who witness police misconduct. During Urban Beach Week over Memorial Day weekend, the ACLU of Florida received reports that MBPD officers threatened and then arrested people of color who observed and photographed officers\u2019 unlawful arrests. MBPD officers forcibly seized SIM cards from observers\u2019 cell phones after they used their cell phone cameras to document incidents of police misconduct.\nBesides the Memorial Day Weekend Blitzkrieg, the ACLU says there is an ongoing pattern of harassment against gay men, which might be surprising to some considering that South Beach has long been considered a mecca for homosexuals.\nThe announcement of the lawsuit comes on the heels of a Miami New Times article that described Miami Beach as one of the most dangerous places in Florida for homosexuals to live.\nThe article prompted criticisms from Miami Herald gay issues reporter Steve Rothaus and Miami Beach\u2019s gay publication, Wire Magazine as being exaggerated and sensationalized with both publications stating the numbers cited in the New Times\u2019 article were misleading.\nBut if it is true that the Miami Beach Police Department has an ongoing systematic pattern of unlawfully beating and arresting gay men, then it\u2019s a sure bet those numbers were understated.\n"}, {"score": 147.59247, "uuid": "9c79bf2a-9a42-5a62-9276-e71e8929aa3a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900wb-56-03138", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/arizona-deputies-harass-videographers-on-3-occasions-in-less-than-2-weeks", "page_rank": 1.2015023e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Arizona deputies harass videographers on 3 occasions in less than 2", "snippet": "Everyone <em>should</em> carry <em>a</em> <em>camera</em> at all times.

INTRODUCES THREE NEW imagePROGRAF LARGE FORMAT PRINTERS\nLatest Models Feature New LUCIA EX Ink Set, Improved Quality and Performance\nLake Success, N.Y., February 22, 2010 \u2013 Canon U.S.A., Inc., a leader in digital imaging and advanced office solutions, today answers the increasing demand for large format prints in the photographic, proofing and graphic arts market with the introduction of three new imagePROGRAF large format models \u2013 the 44-inch imagePROGRAF iPF8300, 24-inch imagePROGRAF iPF6350 and the iPF6300. Designed for precise, ultra high-quality print performance and increased productivity, each model features Canon\u2019s new, 12-Color LUCIA EX pigment ink set and advanced printing technologies specifically developed to produce prints with an enhanced color range and improved durability. The new imagePROGRAF models will be unveiled at the Wedding & Portrait Photographer International (WPPI) Convention at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, March 8-11, 2010.\n\u201cIn just four short years, Canon has introduced more than 20 imagePROGRAF large format printers to the market with each new model raising the bar for outstanding, vibrant image quality and overall versatility,\u201d said Jim Rosetta, vice president and general manager, Imaging Systems Group, Canon U.S.A. \u201cCoupled with our new LUCIA EX ink set and advanced media capabilities, the new imagePROGRAF models represent an ideal solution for the graphic, fine art, photography and proofing markets.\u201d\nEnhanced Color Spectrum\nWith increasing consumer demand for professional and high-quality print jobs, high-end graphic and photographic studios continue to seek the capability to accurately produce vivid output of consumers\u2019 most demanding projects. To enhance its available color spectrum, the new imagePROGRAF models feature a revolutionary all-new 12-Color LUCIA EX pigment ink set increasing the achievable color gamut by approximately 20 percent from the previous imagePROGRAF iPFx100 series and enabling over 90 percent coverage of PANTONE \u00ae (*) colors to produce rich expression. Additionally, to better meet the needs of the professional print market, the new models feature a reinforced mechanical structure to enable precise ink placement for improved text and line accuracy, making these new devices a powerful proofing solution.\nExquisite Photographic Output\nThe introduction of the new LUCIA EX ink provides photographers with the ability to precisely achieve their desired results by producing more expressive and crisp blacks, smooth color gradations, and the capability to reproduce the finest details in the shadow areas of photographs. The new inks are also designed with an innovative polymer structure that results in greater scratch resistance and protection from color fading, while also reducing bronzing and metamerism ensuring durable, stable output.\nWilhelm Imaging Research (WIR), the world\u2019s leading independent image permanence testing laboratory, has been evaluating the new Canon LUCIA EX expanded-gamut, 12-color pigment inks. Henry Wilhelm, president of WIR commented, \u201cA review of preliminary data from the still ongoing tests indicates that prints made with LUCIA EX pigment inks and select photo and fine art papers will achieve WIR Display Permanence Ratings in excess of 75 years for color images and well beyond 200 years for black-and-white images. In addition, LUCIA EX pigment inks exhibit excellent short-term color drift (\u201cdry-down\u201d) behavior, which is critically important for color-managed workflows and in proofing applications. The new LUCIA EX inks also achieved WIR\u2019s highest rating for resistance to damage from atmospheric ozone, a particular concern in urban environments in situations where prints might be displayed unframed and exposed to ambient indoor air.\u201d\nSimplified Workflows\nRecognizing the expanding array of media options for large format printers and to further improve the versatility of these new imagePROGRAF models, Canon has developed a new Media Configuration Tool which allows customers to not only utilize genuine Canon-branded media, but provides the ability to add and make adjustments to paper settings to enhance the precision and quality of output achieved with third-party media. Upon release of the new printer, ICC profiles of popular media types from Intelicoat, Ilford, LexJet and Moab will be available for download on their respective corporate Web sites.\nTo expand print options and improve proofing capabilities, the iPF8300, iPF6350 and iPF6300 come bundled with a new Print Plug-In for Photoshop\u00ae, Digital Photo Professional and support for Adobe Color Management Module, enabling features such as Black Point Compensation. Through the Photoshop Plug-In, each new model allows 16-bit RGB images edited in Photoshop to be sent directly to the imagePROGRAF printers, preserving smooth and high gradation.\nBrian Hampton, an award-winning nature photographer printing with a Canon imagePROGRAF for the first time stated, \u201cThe quality of the print is amazing. I was particularly impressed by the iPF8300\u2019s ability to reproduce shadow details in a way that exceeds anything I\u2019ve seen previously on the market. It\u2019s quite a step above the competition.\u201d Hampton also noted the built-in workflow solutions and commented, \u201cThe ability to export out of Photoshop via the plug-in is outstanding. Many of its capabilities perform as well as an RIP program without the additional cost.\u201d\nMaximize Productivity\nIn order to support high-volume printing and streamline workflows the Canon iPF8300 and iPF6350 come equipped with an 80 GB high-capacity hard disk drive (HDD) that allows for faster spooling of large files as well as the ability to reprint jobs directly from the printer. To ensure the highest level of productivity and reduce overall print time, all new models are also equipped with a standard gigabit Ethernet network interface and an automatic dual-blade cutter.\nIn those environments that utilize a complete workflow solution in conjunction with CGS, EFI, Ergosoft, GMG, ONYX and other leading RIP manufacturers, updated drivers will be available for download upon the release of the printers from their respective Web sites.\nPrecision Technology\nTo fully capitalize on the dynamic color range of the new LUCIA EX ink set, each new imagePROGRAF model employs two advanced one-inch print heads, each featuring 2,560 nozzles per color and outputting a super fine four picoliter (pl) droplet at a full 2400x1200 dots-per-inch resolution (dpi) to reproduce details with extraordinary accuracy and clarity. Paired with enhanced plug-ins and new, High Precision Printing Modes, these new imagePROGRAF models provide an extremely high level of photographic and proofing quality prints.\nThe new imagePROGRAF iPF8300, iPF6350 and iPF6300 are compliant with U.S. ENERGY STAR energy-saving standards and RoHS compliance standards. The new Canon imagePROGRAF iPF8300, iPF6350 and iPF6300 large format printers will be on display at WPPI booth 401 in Las Vegas, NV from March 8-10, 2010. The imagePROGRAF iPF8300/6350/6300 will start shipping in March for a manufacturers suggested retail price of $5,995, $3,995 and $3,695, respectively.\n"}, {"score": 152.85573, "uuid": "d2a967cd-58ac-5c5e-b3fd-65e5a4499869", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0310wb-86-35081", "target_hostname": "home.europa.com", "target_uri": "http://home.europa.com/~telscope/listpr50.txt", "page_rank": 1.1758057e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Archives of an email list on the history of binoculars.", "snippet": "Sold them on ebay <em>for</em> that reason. <em>I</em> had the Fujinons which <em>I</em> had planned to sell when <em>I</em> acquired the <em>Nikons</em> at <em>a</em> <em>camera</em> show <em>for</em> <em>a</em> microscope and <em>a</em> little cash.

Zeiss numbering & trademark, Aluminum restoration, Teleater variation ===================================== Subject: Early Zeiss binocular serial numbers From: Fred Watson\nI read your piece in Binocular List #49 with great interest. Your list of serial numbers and Larry's production figures are both most illuminating. A few comments, together with the serial numbers under 250000 in my collection, as you requested: 1. The point that early serial numbers are model-specific has also been made by Larry in his 1990 ZH article, and by Hans Seeger in his `Feldstecher'. 2. John Gould noted some early serial numbers (including an 8x20 with the enviable S/N of 3!) in his 1986 ZH article. 3. I know Hans has been an avid collector of early Zeiss serial numbers for some time, so he may already have the answer to your question. My early serial numbers are: 8x20 Feldstecher: flat top, no ipd scale, signed in script, S/N 1634; 12x25 Feldstecher: sloping top, ipd scale, signed in script, S/N 9481; 5+10x Marine-Glas mit Revolver: ipd scale, signed in script, S/N 117. I don't think these add much to the debate, as they're all within the known envelopes. (I have two other Zeiss glasses with low serial numbers---a Fernglas 08 Galilean, and a Zeiss (London) British Army No.3 prismatic, both of 1916---but these are clearly not relevant to the present discussion.) Fred ========================= Subject: Zeiss lens trademark From: Lngubas@___m In conversation with my source in Jena, the Zeiss archivist - Dr. Wimmer. He says that although the trademark with the lens cell was approved in 1903 - it was not used until 1906. Well, he has the records to prove it. Larry Gubas =============================== Subject: Restoring aluminum From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nIn my work I have had to refurbish underwater camera housings that have been made from alluminium. The cause of the corrosion would obviously be salt water and the damage could be quite bad. The best method I have tried to date has been to have the surface 'glass bead blasted' rather than 'grit blasted'. This leaves a much smoother, but not glass smooth, surface than grit blasting. It will remove all traces of corrosion without removing lots of metal. I have then had the housings anodised rather than powder coated [painted] as it gives a more lasting finish for use in salt water. Also I have found a powder coated paint finish will 'lift' allowing water to pass between it and the housing causing a leak. For the binoculars in question a powder coat paint finish in an appropriate colour may be all that is required. Rod Bolton. Brisbane Photographic Repairs. PO Box 698. Kenmore. Brisbane, 4069, Australia. ------ (Another collector told me that after exposure to salt air, you have to neutralize salt, then you can use black anodizing, which is applied like cold blue for steel.) --Peter ==================================== Subject: gyro stabilized binoculars From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nhttp://www.tiac.net/users/lanint/gyro.html (16x40 Russian gyro stabilized binoculars) I found the above site while looking for other things, maybe its of interest to you? Rod. ============================= Subject: Teleater variation Bill Beacom bought an unmarked glass that looks like the Perkeo on p47, Seeger, Feldstecher. It's IF, unlike most Teleater clones that use moving objectives to focus. He took it apart, and the prisms are like Seeger p132, lower row, (a), used by Schuetz, Ross, Zeiss; but these are cemented similarly to a Porro II. Bill's glass has a cover plate that is heart shaped, without the longer horizontal lobe of the Teleater, and the top corner comes to a point. I've seen that prism design in books, it's standard although I don't know the name, a different way of making a Porro II, both of which are a 'rearrangement' of the Porro I, by cutting the prisms in half & fusing two pieces. --Peter =================================== ======================================== Binocular List #51: 3/13/98. Steinheil, collimator, comparisons ========================================== Subject: Steinheil adjustment for image rotation Jim Rose is repairing a binocular with a very unusual & useful design that permits adjustment of image rotation while the binocular is assembled. The glass is marked Steinheil, Munchen, 8 x 30, 87369 VL, and has coated optics. Inside, there are four light shields, similar to those that are commonly found covering the reflecting sides of the prism. These are curved, not flat sheet metal like most, and at the base (the hypotenuse of the prism, at the edge where it meets the reflecting face) is a socket that engages a screw that passes through the body of the binocular, so the screw can be moved from the outside of the assembled binocular. The screw head has a groove cut in its circumference that engages a slot in the body of the binocular, about one half inch long, parallel to the housing covers. The screw therefore can move side to side and force the prism to rotate, which in turn causes the image to rotate. The leather cover of the binocular must be removed before the screw is visible. I know of no other binocular with a provision for adjustment of image rotation beyond simple moving of the prism in its seat, and would like to learn of other models that allow this. --Peter ======================= Subject: Binocular collimators From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nI am making some progress on the collimator I am building but as I was working on the zero telescopes the thought came to me that in all the info I have managed to find on the subject of collimating, nowhere does it say what distance the binoculars being collimated, should be focussed at. Would any list member be able to give some advise regarding this? Is there an optimum setting or is infinity/long distance as good as any? Rod Bolton. ====================== From: Fan Tao\nSubject: Review of Burris 8x40 Fullfield, Celestron 9.5x44 ED, Swift 8.5x44 ED Recently I acquired a Burris 8x40 Fullfield and a Swift Audubon 8.5x44 ED. I have a Celestron 9.5x44 ED which invites comparison to the Swift, so I'll review it also. These are all porro prism binoculars with Japanese optics. I'll start with the Burris. Burris is a company which seems to cater mainly to hunters, so I haven't been that familiar with their binoculars. Their Fullfield line of binoculars (which include 7x35, 8x40, 10x50) is touted to have a generous enough eye relief (1 inch claimed) to see the entire wide field of view, even with glasses, hence the name. They are also nitrogen filled and waterproof. The 8x40 sells for about $260 at discount, though I picked up my seemingly brand new pair for a lot less on the eBay auction (maybe it was a demo model, or the seller, Wholesale Hunter, was trying to generate some business). The Fullfield feels good in the hands, being fully covered with a thin layer of rubber, and has some nice features. The right diopter adjustment has click stop indents which are very difficult to accidently move, and you can lock the focus knob by sliding it. The main drawback is the weight, about 2 pounds, the heaviest in the group. The Burris' field of view is nice and wide at 8.2 degrees, and I was able to see it all easily with fairly thick glasses on. Though the eye relief is claimed to be a full inch, it seemed to be closer to about 20mm, perhaps they measure it from the lens surface rather than the top of the ocular bezel. The eyepieces have long, thin folding eyecups which seem kind of flimsy. The view through the Burris 8x40's was surprisingly good, considering their wide field of view. They were sharp very close to the edge, nearly as good as the Celestrons. The optics are said to be fully multicoated. I tested for spurious reflections by viewing with the bright moon nearby. The Burris' unfortunately, had noticeable scattered light from off axis. There was also some color visible with the moon, mostly towards the edge of field. Overall though, I am very impressed the Burris Fullfields, they would be an excellent choice for those who wear glasses and want a rugged, waterproof pair of binoculars. The Swift Audubon 8.5x44 binoculars are highly regarded birding glasses, and the ED model improves upon it by using extra low dispersion glass in the objectives. The ED's are also supposed to be \"showerproof\", though I don't think this means they are entirely waterproof. They retail for about $440 from discounters (the regular non- ED model can be obtained for about half that). The Swift 8.5x44's have a solid one piece body covered in the usual pebble grained finish, with some rubber armoring on the ends of the objective tubes. They have a nicely balanced feel in the hands, though they are fairly hefty at 29 ounces. The oculars have hard rubber eyecups which are difficult to fold down. The Swifts have a snugly fitting ocular guard attached to the binocular strap which has an accordian-like piece between the eyepieces, one of the best designs I've seen. Their eye relief is rated at 14 mm, and I could not see the entire field of view with glasses on, though a good portion of it was visible. The Swifts have the same actual field of view as the Burris at 8.2 degrees (the apparent FOV is slighty more). They are very sharp on axis, though the sharpness falls off noticeably towards the edge. I would say that their edge correction is better than the average wide field binocular, though not as good as the Burris' (which has a slightly smaller AFOV). The Swifts are fully multi-coated, and unlike the Burris, had very little in the way of spurious reflections from bright off-axis objects. This may be due to the use of slotted prisms. I could detect very little color with the Swift ED's while viewing the moon. My impression of the Swift 8.5x44 ED's is that they are fine performers, with the only major drawback being their short eye relief. If the regular Audubons are nearly as good as the ED's then they are a true bargain. The Celestron 9.5x44 ED's were one of the first binoculars advertised to have ED lenses. Though I don't believe that Celestron sells them anymore, Eagle Optics is supposed to have the same model available, for around $300. The Celestrons have a two piece body, with rubber covering much of the surface, though I wouldn't call it rubber armoring. I do not believe that they are waterproof. Though they are very light and easy to maneuvre at 24 ounces, (there are even weight-saving cutouts in a bridge piece), they don't look like they would stand up to much field abuse. Interestingly, the Celestron's objectives look nearly identical to those on the Swift ED's. They both have very steep curves on the external surface, and the cells look the same. I wouldn't be surprised if the ED objectives were sourced from the same company, though the rest of the binoculars look very different. The Celestrons have very soft, easy to fold eyecups. The eye relief, rated at 15mm, was adequate enough for me to just see the entire field of view, 6.0 degrees, with my glasses on. Though their field of view is not as wide as that of the Swift or the Burris, the overall image and edge sharpness are as about good as I've seen in any binoculars (I haven't seen the Nikon Superior E's yet). The Celestrons appear to be fully multicoated, but there was some scattered light from the off-axis moon. There was a bit more more color visible than with the Swift ED's but this is understandable given the higher power. The Celestron ED's are excellent glasses for those who do not require a rugged, waterproof binocular. - Fan Tao fantao@___et.att.net =============================== ================================ Binocular List #52: 3/25/99. Collimation, Zeiss, German mil codes ================================== Subject: binocular collimation From: dewees\n>what distance the binoculars being collimated, should be focussed at. >Would any list member be able to give some advise regarding this?I was an U.S. Navy Opticalman from 1975 to 1980. I'm new to this discussion group. I'm sure the binocular is collimated at infinity. I can't actually remember being told this or reading it in OM 3 and 2 but that was a long time ago. I just whipped out my 10/50's which are perfectly collimated at infinity and there is a lot of parallax evident at close (20 feet) range. So when looking at less than infinity you must be cross-eyed. From a vision standpoint this makes sense because if you collimated at a finite distance you would have to go \"walleye\" when looking at objects further away - that simply doesn't work. There is also the problem of the optical axis of one or both barrels not being aligned with the hinge axis - That alignment of all three axes is a basic requirement of good binocular collimation, and can only exist with infinite based collimation, so I guess that proves it. I would think that OM 3 & 2, which leaves nothing basic to interpretation, has something to say about this Randy Dewees ------------- (addendum) What I should have said is: Absolutely all binoculars are collimated at infinity. What you got was my thought process instead. The requirement of aligning the optical axes to the hinge axis is to maintain collimation over the range of interpupillary adjustment. The basic geometric statement can be made that these axes are parallel and that requires parallel light (from infinity) as a reference. In the collimation procedure the free barrel is aligned to the hinge first, then the fixed barrel is aligned to the free barrel. Randy =========================== Subject: Zeiss lens trademark From: Fred Watson\nNote on the trademark in Binocular List #50. It puzzles me a bit, because six years ago, in a second-hand camera store in Britain, I saw an early-model (pre-1907 shape) 6x monocular with the lens trademark. Engraved on the lower prism cover was `From ... to ..., 1904' (I didn't note the names). The only possibility seems to be that I transcribed my notes incorrectly, but I'm usually fairly careful. (I wish now that I'd bought it!) Fred ============================= Subject: 8.5 x 44 From: Bill Cook The Audubon 8.5 x 44 is my birding glass. HOWEVER, the Superior E blows it away.

Collimation, Vixen 20 x 125, repair tool ================================ Subject: Collimation From: Atmj1@___m Today, binos are probably collimated for infinity. However, in times past, many were collimated for some distance less than infinity. I believe I came across that in some reference material presented to me by Daniel Vukobratovich of the Optical Sciences Center at the University of Arizona. If I ever find the primary source, I will post it to this list. Bill Cook, OMC Retired ============================ Subject: A Visual Test And Comparison Of The Vixen 20 X 125 Binocular Telescope From: \"Robert B, Ariail\"\nI ran a few tests on the relatively new Vixen 20 X 125 Giant Binocular for my own interest and thought it may be of interest to others who may be curious as to its performance and capabilities. I also compared it with a Nikko 20 X 120 WWII binocular (S#779) that had been put into good shape a number of years ago. Appearance & Details: Very appealing to the eye. Well made and finished in white. Has a convenient handle for carrying the 24 pound instrument easily. The handle also functions as a line of sight finder for bright objects or specific positions in the sky. An optional standard finder is available if desired. The mounting while on the light side and appearing rather flimsy, performs well with the Teflon coated trunions held in position with lock ring supports. Tightening the lock ring supports provides the desired friction. The mounting is reasonably stable if fully opened, locked into place and tightened properly to avoid vibrations, etc. The portability of the mounting more than makes up for any deficiencies of being on the light side. Vixen claims the optics to be multi-coated and fully baffled. Field of View: Vixen gives 3.0* as did Nikko. The exact field of view that I found as determined from measured star patterns is: Vixen = 2.9*; Nikko = 3.2*. The image fall off at the edge of field with both glasses appeared about the same. It may have been slightly less in the Nikko considering the more than 11% greater field of view. This deterioration became serious at about 25% from the edge of the field of view in both binoculars. Magnification: Specifications provided by Vixen indicated an f/5 system of 625mm f/l. Although marked at 20X on both binoculars, I attempted to confirm the exact magnification by carefully measuring the exit pupil in bright light (with a precise caliper) and dividing it into the aperture of the objective lenses. The results were: Vixen = 20.67; Nikko = 19.44. An exact focal length via the knife edge test would have been a useful aid in this procedure, but disassembly would have voided any warranty on the Vixen and was therefore not attempted with either glass. All things considered, the manufacturer's stated powers were quite good. Color & Ghosting Check: The Vixen binocular was tested on various street lights - Hg & Na - to make a determination of the color correction and the degree of ghosting. The 'multi-coated' optics were apparently quite effective against ghosting since evidence of such was minimal. Glare was clearly seen as the test street light angled out of the field. This, however, seems to be the case with any binocular or telescope. An examination of the large exit pupils with a magnifier (a la Dick Buchroeder) revealed no evident 'prism leak' that I could detect. With Hg, there was color galore as expected. Nevertheless, it appeared to be slightly less (subjective) as compared with an average of many other optics - binocular or telescope - over 4-inches aperture with fast to medium systems. Eye Relief: Vixen gives 20mm of eye relief for the binocular. The Nikko is somewhat less at about 15-18mm of eye relief. Without glasses, both binoculars were quite neat and provided full image circles (field of view) at a convertible position on the binocular. With glasses ( I have some astigmatism), the full image circle was just available with the Vixen but sizably reduced in the Nikko. Magnitude Depth: The limiting magnitude test was more of a relative comparison of the two binoculars due to my location in Columbia, S.C. being within the city limits with the resultant light pollution. It should also be noted, however, that on the evening the binoculars were tested it was dark, steady, and clear with few lights in the area. This estimate was made with an AAVSO (American Association Of Variable Star Observers) \"B\" chart for the field of R Leporis. This chart provided a limiting magnitude of 10.6. Careful visual estimates with the comparison stars gave a limiting magnitude of 10.4 for the Vixen and 9.8 with the Nikko. There is little doubt in my mind that the Vixen under dark, steady conditions and with the observer's vision dark adapted, would easily reveal stars of 11.5 magnitude near the zenith. (The R Leporis chart provided a field at an elevation of not more that 40* in Columbia during February) Features: The medium field oculars along with the freely rolling prism housings allowing adjustable interpupillary width, give a comfortable view and work very smoothly. Eye relief is good as stated above. The first thing that is quickly noticed in the binocular is the velvety dark field the glass provides. This illustrates probably the best feature of this glass as compared with older giant binoculars and smaller modern ones - its outstanding light grasp. The mobility of this binocular and tripod make it \"feel\" much lighter and smaller than it actually is. Set up properly it handles well and is a pleasure to use and move about. It can be set up and in operation in two minutes; a feat which is rarely possible with the usual giant binocular and its mounting which in many cases may weigh 100 or more pounds. In summary, the binocular performs moderately well optically and very good mechanically. It is advertised as a \"binocular telescope,\" but such is not the case. This instrument is a pure binocular with none of the primary characteristics of any binocular telescope. Is it worth the retail price of $3200? Well, that all dependents on the individual observer. For a binocular specialist used to the characteristics of the instrument and resigned to image degradation at the edge of field, possibly so. For those desiring refractor like images and used to a narrow field of view with pin point images at the edge of the field; probably not. There is no question that a great deal of fun may be had with this instrument at a dark sky site sweeping up star fields with clusters and nebulae. A very comfortable, quick and pleasant way to survey the skies. Bob Ariail =============================== Subject: Repair tool. From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com I found an expensive tool for unscrewing thin wall tubing that is threaded into other parts. Strap wrenches are OK but this looks much better, at least the catalog makes it look better. It resembles a spanner, but the jaws are a coiled spring made of a strip of sheet steel. You coil the spring around the tube & then torque on the spring. http://www.rolyn.com/rolmis3.htm (no picture here, there's an image in the printed catalog) ROLYN SNAKE PLIER MODEL SZ4/C-55 The SNAKE PLIER consists of two coil springs with their turns interleaved, attached to two arms projecting from and sliding for adjustment of diameter on the main supporting bar. Coil springs, each one adjustable for a range of diameters, can be quickly interchanged giving an infinite variety within the capacity of the tool. A spring of approximately the same diameter is placed over the work to be turned, and the coils of the spring tighten as the main bar is turned, thus effecting a tenacious, equally distributed friction grip which renders the assembly or dismantling of the most fragile threaded cell or thin wall tube the simplest operation, without risk of damage or marking.

Previous harangues have concerned the need for all of us to accumulate paper (catalogs, manuals, brochures, etc.). Now the issue is the importance to all of us -- repairmen, collectors, dealers -- of photographing the binoculars that pass through our hands. These photos will serve many functions: they will let you ask others about specimens; they will be useful for insurance; photos are very helpful when time comes to sell a glass; but mostly they will be an important historical document. I don't know who among us will gather the ambition needed to write that book length text we all need: the English language history of binoculars. But I am sure that illustrating such a book is almost as much work as writing it. If we start accumulating photographs of binoculars, that would be a great service to an author, and will greatly speed the day when we all have such a book. This documentation does have a few requirements. 1. Tripod mount the camera, use cable release. 2. Illumination: use either a tent; or use several lamps or flashes, preferably pointed backwards into some reflective mylar. 3. The image, either the entire glass or a detail, needs to almost fill the negative; and so two, high quality lenses will be needed. 4. Depth of field: details at the front and rear of the glass need to be in focus. 5. It does take a good amount of time to do this. It would be very discouraging to take all these pictures & then be informed by an author that they aren't good enough for reproduction in a book. But there is no black magic here: if they're sharp, details well illuminated, preferably no shadows, they should work well. Just look in books by Seeger or Rohan for examples. --Peter ====================== Subject: Help Wanted From: Atmj1@___m (Bill Cook) Captain's Nautical Supplies - America's most respected name in optical instrument repair -- is looking for a dedicated Optical Technologist / Optician to work in our Seattle, Washington facility.

Bothell, WA 98012 ============================== Subject: Bnox From: Fan Tao\nHere is an entertaining web site from the makers of the ultra-inexpensive Bnox binoculars that use mirrors and plastic lenses: http://www.bnox.com/ Take a look at their \"Evolution of Binoculars\" timeline. The optics of the Bnox were apparently designed by a Dr. Stephen Fantone of the Optikos design house (Cambridge, MA). Fan Tao fantao@___et.att.net ====== I have heard these Bnox are of very poor optical quality. They use mirrors instead of prisms & have molded acrylic lenses; their flimsy construction doesn't hold collimation, and they are fixed focus. They are interesting because the layout places both objectives to the right of both eyepieces. The outer (rightmost in use) objective has two inversion mirrors (light bounces vertically), then two reversion mirrors (horizontally bouncing). The inner (left most) objective sends light to reversion, then inversion mirrors --Peter. http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05633753__&language=en =============================================== ======================================== Binocular List #55: 4/23/99. Photography, books, image quality ======================================== Subject: Photography From: \"Martin, Dick\"\nI have some photos now. A few went to Rohan for his next book. In addition to the technical format, I suggest a requirement to display certain features as a baseline then additional shots to cover unique features. I have done this type of photography and could lend a hand but I am not knowledgeable about binocular technical or historica other than what I have picked up as a hobbiest in the last five years. Who will actually retain the photo archives from this collection process? A tip for photographers. Remove the yellow contrast filter so useful in landscapes. The black and white images in a binocular make shadow detail difficult enough without adding more contrast. Dick Martin -------------------- > display certain features as a baseline then additional shots to cover unique features. Yes, a standardization would be useful. Of course, if it's like pulling teeth to get good sharp pictures anyway, additional requirements would eliminate some volunteers. My doubts are more like, you'll get help, but the photos will be washed out, fuzzy, etc., & then you'll have to tell them they're unusable. > Who will actually retain the photo archives from this collection process? That would be up to the photographer, though a publisher might have something to say about rights. As far as a permanent archive, hopefully a book will be filled with illustrations & serve that purpose. I have made a point of collecting photos, but they've been from people asking about value; and some from repairmen. My collection of photos is one of my most useful references. >The black and white images in a binocular make shadow detail difficult >enough without adding more contrast. Re: contrast. Jack Kelly got a parachute cloth tent & multiple spotlights. It eliminated shadows, which is very helpful, but might have actually gone a little too far in reducing contrast. A professional suggested that a slightly better technique might be spotlights or flashes pointed backwards into mylar. It is a tough problem, proper exposure of hard black binoculars, especially since white background seems best. I shot part of Fred Schwartzman's collection, using two desk lamps & a white sheet backdrop. They were sharp, but only barely good enough to use; contrast was mediocre. It is discouraging to travel to a collection & have to spend time on photography, rather than on inspecting binoculars. Steve Rohan's photographs are good, Jack Kelly likewise, Kevin Kuhne has taken many examples of good binocular photography, and Seeger's books are a model. The problems are not that severe, it just takes time & that is one thing you don't have when visiting a collection. One binocular is black and glossy, the next is flat black, another brown, then mother of pearl; and you often have to re-shoot to get a good image. So, photography by owners would be immensly helpful. -- Peter =================================== Subject: The book on binoculars From: Atmj1@___m > I don't know who among us will gather the ambition needed to write that > book length text we all need: the English language history of binoculars. If Barlow comes to take over all the workaday work aspects of nuances of running the Journal, I will have the ambition. That is unless Peter beats me to it. In fact I will eventually do a book even if Peter does beat me to it. I have been talking to Perry R. about the matter for years. However, other pressures dictate that the time is close but not here. My youngest son will be leaving the nest in 2 years and after I get finished with replacing all the broken branches, I will start the book. I think a book by someone who actually goes inside these things on a daily bases would be worth a look. Besides, I have never even come close to justifying that History degree. Still, while in an effort to turn a profit, I can't photograph every piece that comes across the bench, I have tried to photograph some of the more interesting pieces. I would recommend that Peter (if he has the time and desire and it can be economically), keep a collection for all concerning to donate to and copy from. I would assume that anyone wishing to download images would be willing to give credit where do. Bill Cook, Mgr., Precision Instruments & Optics, Captain's, Seattle; editor / publisher, ATM Journal ---------------- Bill & I share the ambition, and there is plenty of subject matter for more than one volume. Steve Rohan continues to work on publications, and so there's hope (if there's immortality). An image archive, with all 'rights' retained by the photographer, would be useful to everyone. An electronic file, like the images available at my 'ftp site', is important, but these downloadable images won't have the quality needed for a book. An electronic photo has to be of a huge file size before it is reproduces nicely. However, I certainly extend an offer to post further images, like this: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc1.jpg found at http://www.europa.com/~telscope/ --Peter =================================================== Subject: Optical quality From: Peter Abrahams A couple of our members have noted that an interesting subject of discussion would be: What are the qualities that make a binocular really excellent? I agree, and since I'm most interested in what makes a glass give a really excellent image, I'll start off with that subject. There's a lot of other qualities that make a great binocular, but the image is a good place to start. --Sharp image mid field is certainly #1. However, this problem has been solved for telescopes for some centuries now, and certainly the first Zeiss binoculars of 100 years ago are quite sharp mid field. My personal feeling is that most decent quality consumer binoculars of today are sufficiently sharp mid field. However, there are people whose eyes are much more acute than mine & they say that certain models are quite a bit sharper than others, as shown in simple tests like viewing a printed page at a distance. These eagle eyed types are not just less myopic than I, even corrected vision can vary; the eye has spherical aberration in varying quantities. This is why I tried to set up an auxiliary scope behind a binocular, as related in the list of a few months ago. --My criteria for a good binocular involves how sharp the image is at the edge, which is mostly a function of astigmatism of the eyepiece. If you focus on a target mid field, then move the binocular so the target is at the edge, it will be out of focus in every binocular I've used that has a decent field of view (it is easy to just insert a field stop in the eyepiece so that the whole narrow field is sharp). Junk binoculars get blurry just off the center, and excellent models are in focus across almost the whole field. Some experienced users don't care about this quality: they figure that they just move the glass to view the object mid field; and unaided vision is only sharp mid field - so this is an unnatural view and uncomfortable to some. --Low distortion --Color correction & color fidelity, critical to birders. --Pupil correction: the most common violation is 'kidney bean', when a curved portion of the image blacks out when you slightly move the glass; this is due to spherical aberration of the exit pupil. There are other aspects of pupil correction that I'm a little fuzzy on. If the binocular has an exit pupil exactly the same size as your eye's pupil, any slight movement of the glass or rotation of the eye will cause partial blackout; which is a similar effect but is vignetting & not related to correction (if I'm correct). --Freedom from ghost images & stray light. --The placement of the image in physical space: Eye relief is critical to people who need to view while wearing their spectacles. Unfortunately, adequate eye relief for those folks (about 20mm) means that other viewers have to hold the binocular away from their eyes by that distance. There are compromises: you can have retractable eye cups. But, to my limited knowledge, an eyepiece is optimized for a particular eye relief. If you try to simultaneously accomodate spectacle wearers & others, you have to compromise the correction of aberrations. (Either that, or I'm wrong.) Other aspects of a good binocular include: --Water resistance: if you live in a dry environment, you might underestimate this one. Not just rain & dunking, but moisture resistance. --Ruggedness: Swarovski has a very rugged binocular, but I believe it is at the expense of serviceability, as they are more or less filled with foam. --Ease of handling: Most people think that Porro I binoculars are easier to handle than 'twin cigar' roof prisms. It is my experience that this is true for two reasons: first, the Porro I has a wider body, so your hands are more by your temples than your nose. Second, the really long narrow roof prisms, like the Hensoldt, do not have the compressed optical path that the Porro I has, and the objective sits out in front of you by 9 inches or so. This means that any small movement of the glass moves the objective twice as far as a 'shorter' binocular, and leads to more image 'jiggle'. Final note: this isn't a totally academic exercise. There are people out there, designing & marketing consumer binoculars; and they have been known to ask the advice of some members of this list. I highly doubt that I'm entirely correct in all the above details, and hope for corrections & further input. I wrote an article on related issues for the local amateur astronomers. It can be found at http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binotest.txt =================================================== ==================================================== Binocular List #56: 4/25/99. New binocular, binocular design, photography. ===================================== Subject: New binocular From: DeutOptik@___m As it happens, we are among \"those people\" currently designing an all-new binocular. We've teamed up with a Swiss subsidiary of Leica to develop a new top- of-the-line glass starting with the 6x42 Sard as a model (seemingly the favorite glass of almost all collectors). Yup, it will be relatively heavy (and not cheap), but we hope to combine a 5 element (minimum) Erfle eypece with modern lens design and coatings to produce a 11+ degree field of view with crystal clarity virtually to the edges and color correction up there with the best of 'em. All the other items you mention are part and parcel of our plans as well; it just remains to be seen how many of them we can incorporate into the design and still keep the cost underneath that of a luxery automobile. Our hope is to have something by the end of the year; we'll keep you informed. s/ Mike Rivkin ======================= Subject: binocular design From: Randy Dewees\nOn what makes a great binocular. I must say that really high quality binoculars have a certain aroma, especially German binoculars. I have a learned pleasure reflex to that smell which heightens my enjoyment. The exit pupil correction is important! The exit pupil is simply the image of the entrance aperture formed by the intervening optics. The rolling kidney bean effect is the result of spherical aberration. There can be other aberrations of the exit pupil such as coma, astigmatism, and distortion. I believe these can degrade the ease of \"linking up\" the binocular to the eyes. In my experience all great binoculars are easy to look through. By the way, the exit pupil occuplies a fixed location for any particular focus setting - there is no practical way to vary the eyepoint. Another image feature of great binoculars is good control of lateral color. I find colour fringes on off-axis objects to be distracting even when looking at objects in the center of the field. Finally, contrast is important second only to sharpness. Some binoculars have relatively low contrast without having obvious design deficiencies. There just isn't the sparkle that great binoculars have - that better than real life quality. I think this results from all the contributions of little things like less than perfect lenses surfaces, coatings, glass, and maybe a somewhat compromised design. Randy ============================ Subject: binocular design From: \"Loren A. Busch\"\nRE: Checking For Sharpness at Edge of Field A more effective way to check for sharpness of image across the entire field is to focus on an object at the EDGE of the field first, then move the subject to the center. This tends to show problems (or good performance) better than focusing in the center of field first. My guess is that eyes, especially in older/less accommodating eyes, seem to adjust better if focused first for the usually good on axis portion of the image, but not the other way. This tip from Bill Cook. Your point about constantly hitting the edge of the field when the exit pupil matches the pupil of the eye is a point that is given much to little attention. In fact, a lot of attention is given in advice to beginning amateur astronomers about 'matching the exit pupil to the eye' to avoid 'wasting light'. I sometimes wonder if these writers have ever spent any amount of time actually using binoculars for astronomy because they seem to ignore (or are ignorant of) two important aspects of binocular astronomy. First, if the exit pupil matches or is smaller than the pupil of the eye, you are constantly fighting to keep your eyes centered, and IPD adjustment becomes very critical. Two, it becomes much harder to even find the exit pupil and keep aligned with your eyes. During daylight use, we have a very bright field in the exit pupil that makes it easy to align with our eyes and make adjustments to eye relief and IPD. At night, looking at the sky, we don't have that bright, well defined edge to the field, and getting the eyes aligned exactly with the exit pupil is much more difficult. I point out to people that not only is it important to place binoculars on something solid like a tripod, but for astronomy, if you can also rest your head on something to essentially lock your eyes in place behind the binocular. The eye relief problem is being addressed more and more by binocular manufactures. Virtually all bino's marketed today have roll down rubber eyecups, an increasing number of medium and even low cost bino's have pop-up push-down eyecups. This feature used to be found mostly on high end products. The Zeiss \"B\" (long eye relief) series used to be an option, a separate part number. Now most models that had the \"B\" ordering option are \"B\" only in the catalog. Presenting and selling binoculars to the general public on a daily basis gives a chance to see some of the \"people\" aspects of binoculars. Here are some general observations. 1) Tremendous range of what people expect a \"good\" pair of binoculars to cost. About 20% are amazed that they may need to spend more than $100 get get a binocular of reasonable quality. 2) A near obsession with \"Waterproof\" binoculars. Many, many buyers are convinced that they need a waterproof binocular, regardless of how they are going to use them. 3) Wide apparent field of view impresses people much more than image quality. A designer can get away with distortion and fuzzy images at the edge if the eyepiece design gives a wide apparent field. 4) A small percentage of the general public have realized that investing in a top end binocular will provide a lifetime of good seeing, and either save for or make the sacrifice to buy a Lecia, Zeiss, Swarovski, or high end Nikon. Most of the buyers of top of the line binoculars are buying for their ego and pride of ownership: the quality they are getting is just a side benefit. 5) The fit and feel of binoculars in the hands of the user can be quite subjective. Part of this is physical, such as how deep an individuals eyes are set in their head. I frequently see people choose not the optically best from two or three binoculars that may be in the same price range. They choose the binoculars the \"feel best\". Gee, I do ramble on. Busch ============================== Subject: Photography From: \"Martin, Dick\"\nRegarding exposure. Binoculars on a white background are the same exposure nemesis as the black cat in the snow. The way I compensate for this is by setting exposures with my old 18% gray card available from any good photo store. It always work dead on. Place the card in front of the binocular so that the card is perpendicular to the light source. Get the camera off the auto exposure mode. Do not let your body interfere with the light source(s). Allow the card to fill the viewfinder. Manually set the exposure. Remove the card. Change nothing . The exposure meter will change reading when the card is removed but that's because the meter is averaging a whole new set of brightness values. Disregard that and shoot. Dick ================================= =================================== Binocular List #57: 5/5/99. Design, photography, Nikon Venturers, collimator ================================== From: rab\nSubject: binocular design It seems to me that the most enviable WW2 hand-held binoculars were without doubt the German 8x60 wide angle, 'gas-mask' designs. Other sought-after models, like the SARD 6x42 and Nikko 10x70, featured wide angles and comparatively large eyerelief. Image quality at a given APPARENT FIELD OF VIEW angle is surprisingly the same in all the good old binoculars, and is not a distinguishing characteristic. My list of the most important features in a binocular are, in order of importance: 1. Eyerelief 2. Apparent FOV 3. Exit pupil diameter (large being better) 4. Image quality and freedom from ghost images Regards, Dick Buchroeder ============================================ Subject: photography From: Atmj1@___m Peter et. al.: I am aware that electronic photos would not be good enough for publication -- especially since too many people don't know what TIFF is all about. However, if the images were saved as TIFF files (scanned at 200 dpi or better), they could be passed along on Zip Drive or CD and life would be good. The every-popular JPEG files are harder to work with and they lose data each time they are transferred. Regards, Bill Cook Manager, Precision Instruments & Optics, Captain's Nautical Supplies, Seattle ==================== Subject: New Nikon Venturer 10 x 42 From: rab\nI've gone back to Jensen's Ammo store twice now to look more carefully at their Nikon binocular that we assumed to be the Venturer LX. However, there is no \"Venturer LX\" imprinted on the binocular or on its box and enclosed documentation. Jensen's binocular looks like the Venturer shown on the Nikon home page, but Jensen's price of $1143 seems lower than Jensen would charge for such things. I took them outdoors today and examined solar reflections off chromed bumpers. Image well-behaved, hint of some ghosts. Also did out-of-field look in vicinity of sun, and while there are ghosts they are pretty darn good for such tests. Wearing my glasses, I can see the field stops indoors; when I go outdoors, my pupils have contracted to the point that I can no longer see the field stops. I examined images very carefully as they travel from center to edge of field. The images are NOT PERFECT! But about as good as anything I've seen in binoculars before. Next step would be to star test them at night. Distortion is very low; verticals stay almost vertical, horizontals almost horizontal. Compared them to Pentax 10x40(42?) Waterproof, Zeiss 10x40(42?), and Leica 10x40(42?) and the Nikons are, in my opinion, very preferable, most particularly because of the enhanced eyerelief, but also because Zeiss and Leica have conspicuous distortion. I'm schizophrenic about distortion these days; can't make up my mind anymore whether it ought to be required, or praised when it is corrected. The Pentax has a noticeably lower contrast image than the others, but its comparatively long eyerelief makes it good value. I bought the 8x42,which has enough eyerelief. But its reduced contrast by comparison with the more expensive binoculars is its weak point. I examined the exit pupil of the Nikon 10x42 with a good magnifier, and it is magnificently baffled, with no hint of a leak or incipient leak. Best in the business! Examined the Nikon from the objective end, allowing sunlight to enter and illuminate the input baffles. Has scads of baffles, never seen anything so complicated in a commercial binocular before. Bravo! Like all similar binoculars, it does show its secondary color; it would be nice to see them use exotic glass to fix that, and no doubt the next generation would do so. It's comparatively easy to do just by throwing a little extra money at the problem. Regretably there is almost no commercial demand for an exotic 10x70 binocular these days, so I don't think we'll see Nikon make anything larger than the 10x42 Venturer (or whatever other name it may go by). If I were a hunter or birder, I'd sure snap up a pair of these Nikons just in case they decide to discontinue the line! In my opinion, it's vastly superior to any other similar binocular now on the market. Regards, Dick. ======== From: Steve Stayton\nGlad you agree with me on the Nikon 10X42. The 8X42 is equally impressive with an extra 1mm of eye relief (20mm spec vs. 19mm). May get a chance to see both at the Guild Camera Shop in Phoenix next weekend, they have best stock in AZ of binocs. I can assure you that the one at Jensons is the Venturer LX model. Also called the 10X42HG DCF WP for High Grade, Dach, Center Focus, Waterproof in Japanese Deutsch speak. Nikon USA seems to not have a clue as to how to market this stuff. These glasses have been out for almost 2 years and few people know it or appreciate it. I first saw one of these last year in Boston and knew right away it was the best all around binoc today (since I had the Leica and Zeiss Night Owls to compare to right there). Mail order prices range in 1050 to 1150 that I have seen from reputable dealers over the last year or so, worth every penny (even though the images are not 'perfect' over the full field), but call to check latest prices. I got my Leica 7X42 just before the Nikon models were available or I would have the Nikon. Have Matt Boston's geiger counter and have not found anything very hot yet except the expected EKC 7 inch f/2.5 Aero Ektar WWII lens. Will have to get together this week and check your stuff (and our Russkie 80's) for glow in the dark. Regards, Steve ======= I inspected both models of these Venturers at Hunts in Boston, and while I didn't have a comparison glass, I was very impressed, especially with the image sharpness to near edge. They are comfortable to use, with a good shape and textured housing (not rubber, which deteriorates too fast for me). My only objection is that they are very heavy. --Peter ================================================= Subject: collimator v. collimator From: Cory Suddarth\nI've got a quandary to post to the group. I have two collimators at my disposal,and while they display similar error levels on binoculars, the claimed error value is very much disputed. Here's the problem. The U.S. Navy collimator is expressed in ten (10) minute(s) of arc increments, six (6) units equal one (1) degree. This scale then reads six (6) degrees in four (4) quadrants, up, down, side-to-side, the zero point originates in the center. The Fujinon collimator [Universal Binocular Measuring Machine] uses a projected scale that goes through the bino and is displayed on a ground glass screen. Claimed error for these increments are one (1) minute of arc each. Here's where the fun begins. If I purposely tweak one (1) degree of vertical error (or step) in a pair of 7x50 Swift Seahawks using the Navy Mk V, then place it on the Fujinon collimator, the error should be off the screen of the Fujinon. Vertical error only goes to twenty (20) minutes ,therefore, sixty (60) minutes of arc, or one (1) degree error would not be on this scale, off the chart! Well, this is not the case. One (1) degree of step comes to the tenth place on the Fujinon scale. Question is, if these are indeed one (1) minute of arc, Why does an error of sixty (60) minutes show up as only ten (10) minutes of arc? Off by a factor of six (6)!! Here, let's try again. This time I will induce an error of only thirty (30) minutes of arc on the Mk V, 1/2 degree error. Now put this on the Fujinon collimator. Theoretically, this error is over the scale limits (by 10 minutes of arc) but should still show up on the screen. Here's where the target falls, it falls on the fifth place, five minutes of arc. how can this be??, again off by a magnitude of six (6). My analyses is that the scale on the Fujinon collimator is not expressed in minutes of arc, but tenths of a degree. This would explain the one degree error landing on the tenth place, and the 30 minutes of arc error showing up on the fifth place. Check points. Both machines have been checked for calibration, and so to verify, a binocular of a known angular value is placed on the Mk V. Within minutes of arc, the FOV matches what is expressed. So now let's put this on the Fujinon. Fujinon has a power scale. Now the bino's line up to within a few tenths of the power expressed on the glass. Both machines read true. If either machine is off, it's certainly not by a factor of six!! Does anyone have any experience expressly with these two machines?? I use these both daily, and as long as I think tenths of a degree error on the Fuji, not minutes of arc, we get along fine. Help me O-B-One.

Steve and I visited Guild Camera Store in Phoenix, AZ. They have a web site and an 800-number, and were fully cooperative with us as we looked over all the interesting high-end binos, including the two Nikons we came to see: 8x42D and 10x42D. As before at Jensen's Ammo, we tested them in various ways, including examination of the exit pupil with a loupe. Two pair of 10x42D's were available. The one on the counter showed a small cosmetic flaw on one of the internal surfaces, visible with the loupe. Probably harmless, but I asked to see the second set they had still in the box. Examined it with loupe, no flaws, examined it indoors, then examined it in full-sun outdoors. It appeared magnificent in all respects. Bought it on credit card and took it home to Tucson. Night-time testing showed that the phase correction of the left side was flawed: significantly bright diffraction spikes were observable on very bright objects like oncoming headlights and stadium lights in the distance. The right side was free from the problem. Shining flashlight into the objective end showed colored reflections that were very different on left vs right side, indicating either poor quality control, or at the least, that the optics were not from the same coating run. In my opinion, there was also narrow-angle scattering around bright lights. I was surprised to find that even in darkness, I was unable to comfortably view the field stops even though this model features 19mm of eyerelief. I should report that I'm slightly farsighted with about 2.5 diopters of astigmatism, with the zero power axis aligned nearly horizontally. Thus, in the vertical direction, I may have as much as 3.5 diopters of positive power in my spectacles, which shifts the eyepoint nearer the eyepiece than if I weren't wearing my spectacles. Thus, a farsighted person (hyperope) requires more eyerelief in his binoculars than does a nearsighted person(myope). However, the Nikon 10x42D does better for me than comparable binoculars from Zeiss, Leica, Swarovski and Pentax. Since amateur astronomy is a big part of my optical life, I decided to return the binoculars for refund. Regards, Dick Buchroeder. ============================== Subject: Collimator Testing From: Steve Stayton\nIn response to your request on Binocular List #57 about discrepancies on angle readings between your two binocular collimators I have the following suggestion. It would seem that at least one of the collimators is incorrectly calibrated for angle measurements. But first the distinction must be made between collimation angles measured in object space (objective end of the binoc) and in image space (eye end). A target collimator by itself (that just projects a reticle image into the binoc) without a reading telescope as part of the system may have a scale that reads in object space angles only. The collimation angles in image space, as read by looking through the eyepiece of a binocular with a test telescope will be magnified by the binocular magnification. That is, an error of 2 minutes at the collimator will be approximately 14 minutes at the eyepiece of a 7X binocular. So you must know where the collimation angle is measured, object space or image space, this is very important. The US Mil Specs that I have seen specify tolerances on collimation in image space as is most appropriate because that is the error the eyes sense. It is possible that one of your collimator rigs is reading in object space and one in image space so that angle readings would differ by the magnification of the instrument being tested. But it could just be an error in scale marking on the Fuji as you indicated (poor translation from the Japanese?). One way to check the angle readings of your collimators is to place a prism wedge of known angle of deviation on the bench in place of the binocular and see what your collimator reads for the angle displacement of the target reticle. The target reticle image will only be displaced along the direction of the prism wedge and will not be magnified but this gives good angle calibration. If the wedge deviation is 2 minutes and 30 seconds say, then the collimator should read the exact same angle, 2 min. and 30 sec. in image space. The best way to know the exact angle deviation of a prism wedge is to measure it with an autocollimator or theodolite. Let me know if you need help with this part, the procedure is straightforward. Steve Stayton =================================== Subject Saegmuller From: THGART@___m Would you ask your group members to share any information they might have on G. N. Saegmuller (or questions about him, for that matter, I\u0092m becoming knowledgeable about his life). I would also ask you to share with them the fact that I\u0092m looking for a pair of 'Triple Alliance' B & L -- Zeiss -- Saegmuller binoculars, size not specified but in good condition and preferably center focus, for not more than $100. Tom Garver (Tom has accomplished some very productive research on Saegmuller, a man about whom very little has been published. More unusually, it seems his research will actually reach the printed page, so any help will be very useful. --Peter) =================================== Subject: Binoculars with built in rangefinder? From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nPeter I had a request today for information re binoculars that Sport Archers, in the USA are using to determine the distance to the target. Bushnell makes a pair of 4x? that use a laser and are good to 400yds. Bushmaster make a monocular that uses a graticle. Greater detail is not known at this time. Do you know of such a beast and where info may be found?. Rod Bolton. =================================== =========================================== Binocular List #59: Yellow Zeiss prisms, New Bushnell WA, Rangefinder, ============================================ Subject: Yellow color in Zeiss prisms From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com Some of the best binoculars ever made were the Zeiss Porro I glasses from the 1950s. However, many of them are suffering from a yellow cast to the image. I had thought that it might be from an exotic high index glass that discolored in time. Recently, I heard that it was the cement used in the binoculars that was yellowing, whether in the ocular or the prism was unspecified. I would greatly appreciate any information on this. These are fabulous binoculars, but the discoloration can be severe; and if it is the cement, then they are repairable. Thanks, Peter ===================== Bushnell WA 10 x 50 From: rab\nHave you heard anything about the newest addition to the Bushnell Xtra-wide, a 10x50 with what appears to be a 95-deg AFOV? http://www.bushnell.com/productinfo/binoculars/xtrawide.html Price: $119 from Eagle. --Dick Buchroeder ======================= Subject: Bushnell Laser Rangefinder From: \"linda\"\nHi there, I am a newcomer in the binocs group and this is the first time I try to be useful to members. I own a Bushnell yardage pro 900 which is twice ranging the Bushnell 400. It is not a true binocular because it has one only exit eyepiece. Through the eyepiece the target is aimed and after the launch of the laser beam in the same eyepiece is read the distance of the target. My own which should range up to 900 Yards has low redundance . It is very difficult to range ,in open sun, also at 500- 600 Yards. It ranges at these distance only with a very reflecting target. It works much better in dimmed light. Near the sunset it ranges to 900 yards with medium reflecting targets as walls and vertical obstacles. I found very much effective the Russian Army Laser Rangefinder which is bulky but ranging easily to ten miles in every condition of light. Russian Laser rangefinder has only a great defect: It is very dangerous for people's eyes. I never saw a Bushmaster monocular but I believe it works like militrary binoculars with reticle. This system is far less accurate in ranging than laser rangefinder. I know two only true binoculars with rangefinder the Leica Geovid 7x42 and its military Brother Leica Vector 4000. But they works with infrared rays like modern cameras. As far as I know the Bushmaster type rangefinders are useful playing golf where a great accuracy is not needed while where a great precision is necessary( adjusting optical rangefinders for example) a laser or infrared rangefinder is indispensable. Excuse me for my poor English. Giancarlo Bozzano ----------- (I asked Giancarlo for an introduction, and also asked about the 3 Italian makers I'm aware of: Koristka, San Giorgio, and R. Esercito. --Peter) From: \"linda\"\nHello Peter, I am a collector of military binoculars,optical rangefinders and sights. Formerly I collected Leica M and R Cameras and lenses. After twenty Years of camera collecting I got tired of this nothwistanding my collection had become one of the more complete in Italy. On day at a flea market I found a Leitz Flakglas and I was fascinated by that marvelous object built by my beloved Leitz. This was the beginning and from then I began to look at optic instruments with a captive Eye.After I discovered stereoscopic rangefinders which have been a mistery for me for two years or more because having got firstly stereo rangefinders with fixed marks (mit fester skala in German) I understood nothing or about nothing how they worked. I looked a long time for any explicative booklet without any appreciable result. I looked also for tank's gunners but they knew only rangefinders with swinging marks(Wandermarke in German).The mystery was clarified when I got a Russian 1 mt. basis rangefinder with mobile marks from which I understood all or almost all. Stereo rangefinder have a great appeal for me. I must also say that the Russian stereo rangefinder used as binocular(I believe it is 12x60) is the more satisfying binocular I ever tried. I don't know much about binoculars (I have read three books about Binoculars the Two Seeger and the Rohan's one and I don't know German at all) but I want learn and Joining you will be a great source of informations. About Italian Binoculars makers I will prepare something next week to submit to Your attention. I am sorry to be not able to express completly and correctly my thoughts in English. Thanks Again, Giancarlo ============================ Subject: Rangefinder From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nI went into a shop today that had the Bushnell in stock so I have some more info on that one at least. The only part that was correct was the price $749.00. They are not binoculars, just look like them at a distance from the front. The model I saw was the 'Bushnell Yardage Pro Laser Ranging System, model 400. It has a monocular sighting system through the centre, with the laser transmitter and reciever either side, hence the binocular look from the front, from a distance. The laser is \"Invisible/eye safe Class 1 laser Multi-function\". [Thats in the brochure] A LCD display for read out is visible in the monocular sighting system. Magnification is 4x. Uses a standard 9v alkaline battery and has auto shut-off, total weight 18ozs. Size 6-3/16\" x 4-1/2\" x 2-5/8\".

Such discolourations are known in older camera lens's also. Dismantling and examining the cemented lens elements should find the offending lens/s.

The color is not noticeable when viewing unless a comparison is made with clear binocs. The yellow cast is very noticeable when several are lined up on the bench. After trying every available tool that is supposed to remove the diopter scale ring on the above type binocs (without crushing it), I devised an easily made tool that requires few tools, and works well and is cheap. If anyone is interested, I can I describe it via email. Zack White leather company in North Carolina has considerable leather stock useful in the covering and repair of binocs and cases. Nice people. Regarding the photographic technique, I have used natural light (outdoors) and white reflector board to photograph complicated stuff. A 50% gray matte background with small aperture will yield good contrast and good depth of field. Kodak Plus X and Bromide paper gave superior detail years ago. A little fiddilin' round with stops was required.....I know, I'm living in the past again. Does anyone know a technique to replicate lens retainer rings for ,say, 50mm objectives? I use a Sherline lathe and have to support the thin ring on nylon 66 blanks.....very tedious. Alii Service Notes, Adjusting and Repairing Binoculars, describes a \"hand held collimating tool\" which is a prism pair with one tinted prism. (p 41) Has anyone seen/used one of these? I am still working on a 1936 Huet tuna can I bought on eBay last year. It has a beautiful prism cell with clever exterior tilt/shift screws. Every optical piece in it had to be re-cemented. The cover screws were filled with solder and the eyepiece tubes were frustratingly thin. Interesting binocs. Bill ======================= Subject: TM9-1580, etc. From: DeutOptik@___m A few notes and errata: i) We are in the process of re-printing several of the WWII (and later) vintage technical manuals on binocular repair, including TM9-1580 (\"Binoculars\" etc.,) and TM9-1575 (\"Wrist Watches, Pocket Watches, etc.\"). They will be available in the next few weeks and run about $20, for anyone interested. There are several editions of the TM9-1580, and we've re-printed the original 1945 edition. However, a later edition (dated 1953) includes some new information, and we will do a re- print of that one a little bit later this year. ii) Regarding the Bushnell wide field binoculars, this has been accomplished with mirrors (not prisms) and the overall quality of resolution is considered quite poor. We've discussed the possibilities of a better mirrored binocular with Kamekura (the maker of the Bushnell model) and they claim that even marginal resolution over about 6x is currently impossible to achieve, and collimation continues to be problematic. However, we're also hearing whispers that Kamekura has presented an improved mirror binocular to Nikon and Fujinon for possible inclusion in their respective line-ups, a fact which (if true) would certainly indicate an improvement in quality over the Bushnell model. We'll keep you posted. best/Mike ======================= ============================ Binocular List #61: 06 June 1999. Yellow Zeiss optics, phase coatings ================================== Subject: Yellow color in Zeiss binoculars From: HOldenburg@___m Hi there, I've been very quiet since I was invited to join the list - I still didn't get round to write a proper introduction - but I think I can comment briefly on two of the topics mentioned. > Zeiss Porro I glasses from the 1950s. However, many of them are > suffering from a yellow cast to the image. I've got a pair of Zeiss 10x50 Porros which my father-in-law bought in 1963 and a pair of Zeiss 8x50B Porros from about 1966. They're both very good binoculars, although the contrast isn't as good as in binoculars with modern coatings, especially not in the 10x50's which have a simple single-layer coating. Neither of these pairs shows any yellowing, and I've never seen any yellowing in any of the old post-war Zeiss porros I've looked through. There's only one exception: Some military binoculars have a yellow tint because that increase contrast under certain conditions. This tint is very obvious for instance in the military binoculars made by Carl Zeiss Jena, for instance the 7x4040 DF's. Having said that, what I'd do is ask the Zeiss people in Wetzlar about the yellowing you've observed. They're very good, and as far as I know they still offer repairs to virtually all these old binoculars made after the war. I had both the 10x50's and the 8x50's serviced last year, and they still had all the spare parts needed. What I'd do is write to them in Wetzlar asking them about the yellowing and what can be done about it. Make sure you quote the serial number of the binoculars in your enquiry. The address to write to is Carl Zeiss, Kundendienst Ferngl\u00e4ser, Hensoldt AG, Gloelstra\u00dfe 3 - 5, 35576 Wetzlar They're very helpful and friendly people. Hermann Oldenburg =================================== Subject: Yellow color in Zeiss binoculars From: Atmj1@___m To Peter et al. Being a coward, I try to stay as close to fact as possible. However, I would like to go out on a limb to say that I have heard that the yellow cast is caused by a poor choice of glass for the flint element. I have heard this from more than one source, though I cannot assign a name. The new Chinese Bigeyes -- which are built on an old Zeiss design -- show the yellow cast uniformly, from unit to unit, although they are brand new. Cory adds that if the problem was in the Canada balsam that it probably would not be so uniform even in the same instrument. Bill Cook, Manager, Precision Instruments & Optics, Captains, Seattle =================== Subject: Yellow color in Zeiss binoculars From: \"Roger Davis\"\n> I have in the reject box in my shop, a number of yellow prisms that I > replaced from several 6 x 30 military Zeiss binocs Yep, got a few like that myself. I have about 4 trays of 80 prisms from a variety of old binoculars I have worked on over the years. The Zeiss ones are most notable, they have an orange/yellow tint to them. > After trying every available tool that is supposed to remove the > diopter scale ring on the above type binocs (without crushing it), I > devised an easily made tool that requires few tools, and works well and is > cheap.

Every 4mm I machined a deep recess onto the mandrel so that I could part off the pipe once I had externally threaded it. I can do up to ten at a time. You can then put a couple of slots in with a fine hacksaw blade. > Alii Service Notes, Adjusting and Repairing Binoculars, describes a > \"hand held collimating tool\" which is a prism pair with one tinted prism. > (p 41) Has anyone seen/used one of these? This rings a bell with me. But I am not sure where I saw the reference. If anyone finds out I'd love to see the article. Roger Davis, Binocular & Telescope Service Centre Pty Ltd PO Box 282, Heidelberg VIC 3084, Australia ========================================== Subject: Introduction From: HOldenburg@___m Hi all, I think it's about time to introduce myself to the list. My name is Hermann Oldenburg and I'm in Germany, in Hannover. I've been lurking for a few weeks now, and I'm very impressed by the quality of the discussion here. My own interest in binoculars arose when I first got into birdwatching more than 20 years ago, and ever since then I've tried to keep up to date with new developments. And like most birdwatchers I spend a lot of time trying out other people's binoculars, especially when there are no interesting birds about ...:) Even though I'm first and foremost a user of binoculars, I've acquired some interesting older binoculars over the years. And as I tend to keep all the binoculars I buy I've got quite a few by now (my wife says too many ...:)) My main birding binoculars are the Leica 8x32's at the moment, and in winter I use a pair of Zeiss 7x42's. Among the more interesting binoculars I own are a pair of Zeiss West 10x50's Porros (bought by my father-in-law in 1963) and a pair of Zeiss West 8x50B Porros (~1966). Hermann Oldenburg ====================== Subject: On the effects of phase-corrected prisms in roof prism binoculars From: HOldenburg@___m I'm sure everyone here knows that roof prism binoculars *without phase-corrected prisms* are optically quite clearly inferior to those with phase-corrected prisms. The reasons underlying this problem have long been known. Albert Koenig and Horst Koehler, for instance, mentioned this effect in their book \"Die Fernrohre und Entfernungsmesser\" (3rd edition, 1959). An excellent explanation was published by Adolf Weyrauch and Bernd Doerband in 1988 in the \"Deutsche Optikerzeitung\". I got my first pair of roof prism binoculars with phase-coated prisms, a pair of Zeiss 8x30B's, immediately after Zeiss started selling them, and I found the difference in direct comparisons to older Zeiss 8x30's quite marked. It was basically just as Weyrauch/Doerband had written in their paper - better resolution, slightly higher contrast, overall a \"more pleasing image\". Last autumn I finally had a chance to do a more detailed comparison. We (a couple of fellow birders and I) got together for a weekend trip, and as there wasn't much about we had the time to do a detailed comparison of three different Zeiss 10x40B's. The first one was bought in 1979. It doesn't have T* coatings and the prisms are not phase-corrected. The second one was bought in 1981, with T* coatings but still without phase-corrected prisms,. The third one was purchased in 1998, so it has both T* coatings and phase-corrected prisms. The interesting thing about this comparison was that all three binoculars were of the same make and had the same specifications, so all the differences observed were caused by the different coating technologies used. We compared the binoculars mounted on tripods, checking for their optical quality by looking at birds and a Zeiss standard resolution target in a variety of light conditions. Perhaps the most interesting result initially was that the differences between the two old Zeiss 10x40B's weren't all that great. Sure, the T*-coated pair had slightly better contrast with cleaner colours and a slightly brighter image, but the difference was nothing to boast about. Even under difficult lighting conditions the difference wasn't that great. The resolution was exactly the same (as it should be), and the image of both was slightly fuzzy. This was most noticeable when checking the resolution targets. The comparison with the pair with phase-corrected prisms was almost a foregone conclusion after these results. And sure, it had much better contrast and cleaner colours, a brighter image and quite clearly a higher resolution than either of the two pairs without phase-corrected prisms. In fact, the difference was nothing short of amazing. I believe this comparison puts some of the claims made about modern multicoatings into perspective. Modern multicoantings are nice, but they're not the most important thing to watch out for in roof prism binoculars. Based on this comparison I'd say the most important progress has not been the development of modern muticoatings, but rather the development of phase-correction coatings on the prisms. One other interesting observation we made was this: After we'd done our comparisons I got my old Zeiss West 10x50 Porros (~ 1963) from the car. My friends had got bored with testing optics by that time, so we only did a quick comparison with the new Zeiss 10x40B's, and the results were pretty amazing. Sure, the 10x40's had better contrast and a brighter image, after all, the old 10x50's only have a simple single-layer coating, but the resolution of the old 10x50's was quite noticeably *better*. In fact, the difference was so pronounced that we couldn't help but wonder why Zeiss doesn't make these binoculars with a modern T*-coating anymore. I'm sure they'd beat most (if not all) roof prisms hand down.

More on yellowing, Nikon 10 x 70, replies =================================== Subject: Yellow cast in glass From: DKUHNE@___m I have a comment about the yellow cast seen in the 25-40X100 m.m. Chinese binoculars. I have done ocular replacements on several dozen of these instruments. The yellow cast completely disappears once the original oculars are replaced, so it is not in the objectives or the prisms. The newer models have much less of a yellow cast. I can't help feeling that this yellow cast was planned as a built in haze filter, although orange filters are included with the unit. Also there are two large aperture post W.W. 2 military B&L binoculars that I know of, (one 100 m.m. and the other 120 m.m.), which suffer from this same malady, but in the extreme. The color has gone beyond the yellow and into the pumpkin range and seems to be getting worse year by year. This yellowing is claimed by some to be the fault of certain rare earth materials used in the manufacture of the glass. I have also seen this problem in several of the Schmidt prisms used in the Schneider 25X105 W.W. 2 anti-aircraft binocular. All the best, Kevin Kuhne. ======================================== Subject: Nikon Astrolux 10x70 From: rab\n.........Nikon design/workmanship isn't what it used to be (by comparison to my robust WF 10x70s): the vinyl(?) covering is not perfectly done and the seam shows conspicuously one side, and there are a few manufacturing blems on the vinyl. They make absolutely no difference to anything, but indicate sloppy work. The binoculars weigh just under 5# (straps missing, and I removed the eyeguards as usual) and are about 2\" longer than my older Nikon WFs. The binocs came with two sets of eyeguards: one with greater eyerelief, and another with \"wings\" with less eyerelief. Since the nominal eyerelief is only about 15mm, I removed them and set them aside. The eyelens is deeply concave, which holds promise of high optical correction, but only about 18mm clear diameter. I have attached my corrective spectaclets with model airplane cement in order to critically examine the imagery. The real FOV is marked 5.1 degs, and the distortion is low but not zero,so I'd guess the apparent FOV is somewhere around 48-deg, not 51-deg. Daytime image quality is excellent! Nikon advertises that they used ED glass in these 10x70's, and the residual image color, when you set the IPD wrong or deliberately moved your eyes around, appears much lower than it does in any 10x70's by any maker, that I've previously used! Second, the image quality does indeed appear critically sharp over the entire FOV; and you know I don't say such things lightly! This is really a wonderful 10x70mm binocular for daytime use, beyond doubt. As determined with a bright white-light flashlight, all the optics, prisms included, are multicoated in these binoculars, and the 'colors' of the coatings look about the same for the left and right sides. Not always the case with other Nikons that I've used. At night, looking downtown on Tucson's city lights, I was unable to see any ghost image for objects within the field of view. I looked at oncoming headlights and at stadium arrays, and I could see no ghosts, not even ghosts involving my cornea (the spectacles, incidently, are multicoated too). Nikon has done a super job on the coatings. HOWEVER, when a very bright object goes OUT of the field of view, top or bottom for sure, there is a strong glare image that comes INTO the field of view. One normally associates this with undersized prisms (and the prisms in these binoculars are small and not fully shielded) or wall reflections. I haven't determined what the source is. Fortunately, there are no 'leak images' that I could discern, those being the bane of many older binoculars, and even some newer ones, particularly the large aperture Chinese imports. Overall, the Astrolux Nikon 10x70's were splendid looking at city lights. Venus shows almost no color; star images are small and excellent over almost the whole FOV, showing only a small amount of aberration toward the edge of the field. The quality is among the best I've seen in binoculars, although it's easier to achieve in the comparatively modest 50-deg AFOV than it is for wide field binoculars. As mentioned earlier, the strong concave surface on the eyelens indicated that good field quality was to be expected, and such was indeed the case. There is a peculiar shading effect on a blank field, which I speculate is due to the combined effects of spherical aberration of the pupil + short eyerelief resulting in a vignetting effect that adds to the ordinary contrast effect (where the bright field abruptly runs into the dark area beyond the field stop). Moving the eye in and out significant affects it, but of course it isn't noticeable when the sky is very dark, although it may still have consequences. Such an effect doesn't seem to occur with my Nikko 10x70 with 7-deg FOV, nor my Nikon 10x70 with 6.5-deg FOV, both of which have more generous eyerelief as well as larger AFOV; yet a pair of aus Jena 'classic' modern 10x50's with 72-deg AFOV but short eyereliief that I recently owned and used showed the effect boldly...so it isn't simply related to AFOV. The effect is give the impression of a bright ring near the field stop. Do you guys have any info on this one? Todd Gross used to grouse about this effect in eyepieces for telescopes. Predictably, I'm sorry that the Astrolux doesn't have a wide AFOV, and dismayed that its eyerelief is short (yet long enough to allow corrective spectaclets to be attached to the eyepiece and still allow the full FOV to be seen thereafter), but I am very favorably impressed with its significantly improved color correction by means of ED glass, and by its extraordinarily well corrected image over the full FOV. The interior metal finish of the barrels and prism retainers could be improved; it's obviously being done on the cheap, and the problem with the out-of- field glare would ideally be examined and corrected. Overall, these are great binoculars! Regards, Dick Buchroeder. =================================== Subject: Parts, roof vs. porro prisms From: DeutOptik@___m (i) Regarding mechanical parts, please note that we have quite a large and growing selection of mechanical parts for old glasss, many in some quantity. We are particularly flush with parts for old US WWII 6x30s and 7x50s, plus assorted Carl Zeiss-Jena models. Anyone looking for retainer rings, diopter scales, etc., etc., might give us a call. Alternatively, try I. Miller & Sons in Philadelphia, another very good source for both optical and mechanical parts. Irv and (son) Harvey can be a bit, well, gruff, but they have an enormous selection of binocular parts. (ii) Also, to the comment regarding the current market bias towards roof prism glasses, we believe here that this is beginning to change somewhat. We understand Leica is working on a line of porro glasses (on the record, Leica is noncommital), and Zeiss is in the process of redesigning its well-known 7x50BGA T* porro model (in our view, the best contemporary porro on the market today). The commercial knock on porros has always been their relatively greater size and weight when compared to roof prism glasses, and roof prism glasses have certainly improved over the last years to the point where the usual advantages of porro prism glasses (e.g., wider and brighter field of view) have greatly lessened. Optolyth's Alpin series of porros has attempted to compete with roof prism glasses by offering a smaller and lighter porro glass with favorable optics, and other than the somewhat narrow field of view, they are a reasonable (and well priced) alternative. We are seeing more activity of late with this line. best/Mike =============================================== Subject: Various From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\n===== \"Does anyone know a technique to replicate lens retainer rings for,say, 50mm objectives? I use a Sherline lathe and have to support the thin ring on nylon 66 blanks.....very tedious\". I have just gone through this process myself. I could not find a thin wall brass tube that was suitable so I used a short length of thick wall tube that was closest and over/under sized in diameters. Turned it to a suitable size, cut the thread and after checking it would fit, parted it off. To true up the parted end and final finish to length I made a mandrel from aluminium round bar, threaded the same but female, to screw the ring into with approximately half protruding. No problems as it was supported all round in the mandrel. If the mandrel is marked with a punch at #1 chuck jaw it is easy to reset another time and a step on the side touching the chuck jaw means it should run pretty true, at least for cleaning up the retaining ring/s. ======= \" Alii Service Notes, Adjusting and Repairing Binoculars, describes a \"hand held collimating tool\" which is a prism pair with one tinted prism. (p 41) Has anyone seen/used one of these?\" I have not seen one but am contemplating having a go at making one similar, but using a semi-tinted/metalised mirror, 50/50 for the beam splitter and a top silver mirror for the other. The front lens's would need to be 63-65mm apart to fit to the binoculars eye lens spacing. The principle of operation, I believe is similar to a camera rangefinder, when all is adjusted the 2 images are superimposed. A coloured filter over one front lens would identify the images. As long as the tool would focus to infinity I see no reason why it should not work. ======= http://www.tranexp.com/intertran.cgi The above site may be of use to members who wish to translate info into english or vice versa.

Radioactive glass, Nikon 10 x 70 =============================== Subject: Radioactive Glass From: Peter Serafin\nYet one more question regarding yellow optics: All this discussion on yellow tinted optics has brought to mind an article published in Sky and Telescope a few years ago. One telescope maker mentioned that at one time military optics were made with yellow tinted glass as a built in contrast/haze filter. He went on to say that the tint was achieved when the glass was doped with radioactive elements. A check with a Geiger counter indicated that the levels could be harmful over years of use. The aqueous nature of the eyes makes them especially susceptible. Does anyone have any input on such a hazard? I have some 6X42 SARDs which are definitely tinted in the oculars but do not have a Geiger counter... Pete ======= Radioactive glass is found in a few optical systems from mid-century, including binoculars. I have a text file of clippings from on-line on this subject. Various heavy elements, including thorium, have been used to increase the refractive index of glass, which can cause measurable radioactivity. I have not yet seen any data on whether any binocular or telescope eyepieces contain a hazardous amount of thorium. Needless to say, any reader with information on this topic will find their input to be very welcome. --Peter Abrahams ========================================= Subject: Introduction From: \"John S. Platt\"\nAs a new member to the list I feel I should introduce myself. My name is John Platt and I live on the gentler side of the Atlantic i.e. the British Isles, in the county of Kent (bottom right hand corner of the island). I am married, have 3 kids, 48 y.o. and retired from a Government job. I have been a binocular enthusiast for many years now having been given a pair when I was 9 and never lost my fascination for them. I have a varied collection, the notable examples being Schneider 25 x 105, Leitz 7 x 50's and B&S tuna cans. I also have a pair with 6 inch objectives with interchangeable eyepieces. I have the Seeger books and am lucky to live close to Terry Vacani who services my binoculars for me. However, having time on my hands, I now intend to learn how to do my own servicing. I am staggered by the depth of knowledge available from all the other listee's and suspect that my participation will be passive for some long time. I look forward to receiving my postings and hope to learn much about this fascinating hobby. Two questions, does anybody on the list live in my part of the world? and second, do any of you have a set of rubber guards for the Leitz 7 x 50 as I have a brand spanking new unused example but with no rubbers guards and I am desperate to get some. Best wishes from a warm and sunny Brasted, Kent in the old country. John S. Platt. ================================================ Subject: Nikon 10 x 70 Astrolux From: \"Martin, Dick\"\nA non technical contribution to the 10 x 70 Nikon Astrolux review is in order: I enjoyed my glasses and recognized them as superlative image wise. However, using these fresh out of the box requires a supplementary gas mask to block out what seem to be toxic fumes due to the outgassing odor from the vinyl cover. It was so bad I could not keep them in my office without endless complaints from my spouse... what was she doing in my office anyway? This situation did improve somewhat over a period of 3 or 4 months, but I now use, and am very happy with the Fujinon equivalent and I do not need gas mask oculars. Dick Martin ======== Dick Buchroeder's message on his new Astrolux's contained a note on their stench, but I cut it along with some non-binocular content, thinking it wasn't relevant. But I guess that relevance is in the nose of the beholder. I personally find 'new car smell', vinyl outgassing, and related smells to be very offensive. --Peter ======= From: rab\nYes, the Nikons still REEK! At first I thought maybe somebody did a repair job and rebonded the vinyl, but as far as I can see, this is a factory-original. Just noted a slight problem last night: I've been fiddling with taping the rubber eyeguards over the corrective spectaclets, and maybe something came loose, but I discovered that on the LEFT EYE SIDE, the diopter setting is 'off' by more than a full diopter from its nominal infinity value! There are absolutely no signs of anyone having fooled around mechanically or optically with the binocs, which look pristine, but somehow that side is off much more than I would assume could have come from the factory. Nikon just ain't what it used to be, it would seem! Regards, Dick Buchroeder ============ From: Martin, Dick\n\"wondering if you got rid of your Nikons because of the lingering odor?\" Sold them on ebay for that reason. I had the Fujinons which I had planned to sell when I acquired the Nikons at a camera show for a microscope and a little cash. The odor was noticable before I put the money up but I thought they would stabilize after a few weeks out of the plastic bag. To me their performance did not warrant having to put up with the odor. The vinyl did seem to be different to the touch although I did not think it was sticky. Its a shame that Nikon has made such a subpar mechanical device; I would think that for the price they would have offered something to complement the optics. The large oculars on the Fuji's are a pleasure to use. Regards Dick ================================================= Subject: perceived brightness at aperture stop seen in some optics In the mail below, Dick Buchroeder discusses an effect seen in the eyepieces of some binoculars and telescopes. Some wide angle eyepieces seem to show a brightening in a ring shaped area just inside the field stop. If you're looking at the sky, it looks brighter at the very outer edges of the field. This has been a subject of discussion on amateur astronomy lists, but as far as I know has not been explained. --Peter ======== From: rab\nThe seller of my Astrolux 10x70 says he owned them for 1.5 years; this suggests its strong odor isn't EVER going to go away! He also said he did not adjust them in any way, so the approximately 1 diopter (negative) setting error on the left eyepiece is either due to something coming loose, or it was never set correctly by the factory. Steve may be able to tell if its the former or the later. I took out my Nikko 10x70 x 7-deg and looked at a blank daylight sky, and I do NOT see the bright donut that I see with the Astrolux and aus Jena binoculars. Also did the test with my 7x35 Swift UWA's, but the fields so wide that it's hard to see the field stops anyway; yet I don't believe I saw anything so pronounced as can be seen on the Astrolux. If you move your eye around the exit pupil area of the Astrolux, you can see the 'donut' of light move around with it; you can make the area (blank field) near the field stop appear to be uniformly bright. The Nikko 10x70 is so marvelously 'comfortable' insofar as knowing when your eye's at the right exit pupil distance, and because it was designed as a Military Glass, and because they may have had help from German optical designers who almost invariably corrected SA of the exit pupil, that it is reasonable to assume the Nikkos are properly corrected for pupil aberration and thus free from vignetting effects from the iris of the eye when it peers straight ahead, whilst the Astrolux, striving for ultimate IMAGE quality quite probably failed to adequately correct SA of the pupil, resulting in vignetting of the field by the iris of the eye, the effect being dependent on the eye's location along the axis. Note that I get cornea-prints all over my Astrolux's spectaclet's because the eyerelief is so short and because it is somewhat ill-defined as to where to put the eye. This too is symptomatic of the existance of SA of the pupil. Regards, Dick. =============== Subject: further on the DONUT From: rab\nSorry to be nibbling away at this thing, but it's great sport! I took a careful, closer look at the 'donut' of light in the Astrolux with blank bright sky. One's first impression is that there is a bright ring of light near the field stop. This is an illusion. There is a progressive darkening from where the 'donut' is first noticed in the inner field, increasing toward the field stop. The contrast of the central bright sky, plus the vignetting, plus the abrupt darkness beyond the field stop produces what at first seems to be a donut, but in fact it is a uniformly increasing darkening of the field once the vignetting begins. The combination of Spherical Aberration of the Exit Pupil and the comparatively small( 2 or 3mm) diameter of the human iris during daylight results in vignetting of the outer part of the field of view, and explains the 'donut' effect which is observed with the 10x70 Nikon Astrolux; but the correction of SA of the exit pupil in the older, military 10x70 Nikko results in that binocular NOT SHOWING a donut of light near the field stop. I'm going to take the 10x70 Astrolux to a comparatively dark sky site tonite, just west of Sandario Rd, approximately a 25 minute drive from my house. The sky looks clear, the moon is down, and Scorpio is up! I'm eager to see what these glasses will do with it! Regards, Dick. ========== Subject: dark sky tests with Astrolux 10x70 From: rab\nI did comparative observations with the Nikko 10x70x6.5-deg and the Astrolux 10x70x5.1-deg last night at a relatively dark site. Both binoculars had presciption spectacle elements, multicoated, attached so that optimum performance for my eyesight was obtained. During twilight, the Astrolux has sharper images, presumably due to its better color correction. Venus, Mars, and the stars appear more compact. As the sky became very dark, however, the difference in optical quality became negligible. I believe this is because my pupil opens up to 5 or 6mm, and its own spherical aberration becomes the dominant source of image degradation. Even in twilight, the 'donut' effect is distracting with the Astrolux, because it cues me to attempt to find a better place to put my eyes to minimize or avoid it; rubber eyeguards to hold the binocs exactly in place would have helped...but the eyerelief is so short that the guards the Astrolux comes with, which can be reversed and held on with tape, make it hard to eliminate the donut and to see the field stops. The Nikko's original rubber eyeguards had deteriorated and had given too little eye clearance for me anyway, so they have been removed and replaced with shallower winged rubber eyeguards bought from Orion. These give just the right amount of eyerelief for ME, and beyond that, they allow me to have some small amount of forward and lateral eye motion to swivel my eyes to peer at the edge of the field, which is difficult or impossible if the eyeguards are too restraining. The Nikkos are very tolerant of slightly inaccurate IPD setting, and of small gimballing of the eyes; there is no donut effect, and no cue to go hunting for a better place to put the eyes relative to the exit pupils. Under dark sky conditions, the larger field of view of the NIKKOS, 7-degrees, is far and away more enjoyable than the smaller field of the Astrolux, 5.1-degrees, and would be the principal reason for choosing one binocular over the other. The comparatively sharper axial images in the Astrolux are a moot issue because of the expanded eye pupil, but the absence of ghosts in the Astrolux is certainly a welcome improvement over the old, partly-MgF-coated Nikkos (cleaned and coated a few years ago, but prisms failed to get included in the coating run). I have not been able to include my 1978'ish Nikon 10x70x6.5-deg in this survey because I have lost my corrective spectaclets for them, will have to commision a new set unless I can find them. Regards, Dick. ============================================ ============================================= Binocular List #64: 29 June 1999. Yellow glass, cleaning, galilean optics ============================== From: \"Robert B. Ariail\"\nSubject: Yellow glass I was interested in Kevin Kuhne's remarks concerning the yellow tint in the 25-40X100 Chinese turret binoculars being a possible planned built in haze filter. From the comments made thus far it would appear that both the optics (prisms, flint elements) and the cement may both be the culprits in the older binoculars. The new Chinese binoculars, however could only involve the optics. It may be of further interest to note that the new 15x110mm Russian observation binocular has a distinct yellow hue. Conversly, the Soviet 20x110 Naval Ship's Bonocular provides a crystal, un-tinted view? Since Mike Rivkin has handled both, maybe he has some thoughts on this situation. Bob Ariail ---------- My original post on this subject concerned the very fine Zeiss binoculars from about 30-40 years ago with strongly yellowed images. I've since isolated the problem to the oculars in my 15x60, which is encouraging because it means that it could be a problem in the cement, more remediable than a glass problem. I am writing to Zeiss about this. --Peter ========================== Subject: 20x120 for sale in Florida I received some pictures of what looks like a standard Japanese 20x120, exterior rusty &dirty but not dented, no description of the optics.

As I start on my new career as a binocular mechanic may I please have your opinions and recommendations on how to clean glass. I have been informed that Isopropyl Alcohol should be used, another said Acetone and a third said a 50/50 mixture of both. So over to you please, what do you use? As I live on the gentler side of the Atlantic, commercial liquids available in the US may not be available here so could you suggest non commercial cleaners. Thank you very much. John S. Platt. ------ From: \"John S. Platt\"\nGood evening to the world Due to the increasing costs of using the Internet in the UK I have changed my ISP From now on would you mind using the address xpz67@___rnet.com as they are lot cheaper than the others. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Best wishes from a very dark and cold UK. John S. Platt. --------------- I use isopropyl alchohol, but when I get a new bottle I always pour some onto a mirror & let it evaporate, to see if there's any oil residue: some drug store rubbing alchohol has oil for the skin. This is not a simple subject, issues range from toxicity to which solvents damage rubber seals. ============================================ Subject: Galilean optics From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com A Russian galilean binocular has been imported recently, white enamel, chromed sheet metal linking barrel to axis, marked 2.3 x 40, 28 degrees. Field is indeed close to 28 degrees, apparent field is about 45 - 50 degrees. The eyecup has an 8 mm aperture. Focused at infinity, the distance between the ocular & the objective is about 40mm, so the objective is probably f1.5 or less, very fast. Mechanical quality is good, coatings look very good, images are good although 2.3 power gives nothing to compare to. I became curious about whether most of the light from the 40 mm objective is wasted when it hits the 5-7mm pupil in your eye. The question is, do galilean optics follow the same rule as the typical keplerian optics: exit pupil = objective diameter / magnification? If so, exit pupil would be 14.2 mm, and well over half of the light from the objective would not enter the eye. The answer is no, but not a simple 'no'. A reply from Steve Stayton follows. ---------------- From: Steve Stayton\nFunny situation in that the iris in the eye of the observer is the limiting aperture stop in the optical system -- therefore the iris of the eye must be considered to be the exit pupil as well. So the exit pupil is the same size as the eye iris whether it is 3mm or 7mm depending on object brightness (assuming the eyepiece lens on the galilean is at least a little larger than 7mm diameter to avoid clipping the light bundle to the eye). This is why galilean optics always have bright images even at night (also that they have no prisms to absorb light and very few air-glass surfaces). The size of the objective lens does not relate directly to the magnification times exit pupil dia as in a keplerian afocal system. The objective lens dia must be bigger than you would expect in order to have much field of view, in fact the FOV is limited by the objective lens diameter. In a galilean system there is no well focussed field stop to give a clear sharp edge to the field of view -- check it out by looking through one. The edge of the field is seen as the out of focus edge of the objective lens mounting cell. Conclusion here is that brightness is very good in galilean field glasses even uncoated ones (one of the reasons that they remained somewhat popular many years after the introduction of the prism binoc) and that the objective lens diameter must be very large (compared to prism binoc) to allow even a relatively limited FOV to get through. Resulting binoc has good image brightness but small FOV. Hope the above is useful! Steve --------------- I found very little on galilean optics in the optics books, in fact there is more on 'reversed galilean' optics, used in camera viewfinders. This is probably because most optical engineers have no interest in a visual instrument that is as limited in its potential as the galilean is. The problem of field of view is best described in Practical Optical System Layout: And Use of Stock Lenses (McGraw-Hill Optical and Electro-Optical Engineering Series) by Warren J. Smith 1997 $65. Magnification is, as usual, focal length of objective divided by f.l. of ocular. The field of view is limited by the f ratio of the objective. The largest possible apparent field of view is the angle subtended by the diameter of the objective, from the eye lens. The actual AFOV is that angle, divided by the magnification of the system. This makes the limitations very clear, and by drawing on paper the layout, one can see that an f1 objective will subtend 60 degrees of angle from its focal point, and even a modest 4 power will give only 15 degrees of apparent field. To pick an arbitrary limit to a practical objective, an f0.5 lens will give only 22 degrees apparent field at 4 power. These fields are doubled at 2 power, but to me a 2x instrument is more a vision aid for the nearsighted than a useful visual optical instrument. However, hope springs eternal, and there have been some historical highlights in the quest for better galilean optics. Circa 1920, Zeiss tried to optimize the design by making an objective with a low f#, a triplet, but I don't believe they even made a prototype. It was patented & described in Alexander Gleichen, Theory of Modern Optical Instruments, translated from German & published 1921, HMSO, London. He mentions that the calculations can be found in his 'Lehrbuch der Geometrischen Optik', 1902, but I don't think that has been translated.

DO super binocular; Fujinon Techno-Stabi; prices ============================================ From: DeutOptik@___m Subject: Super binocular Thanks for the latest, Peter. A few bits from this end: (i) we always understood the yellow tint on such glasses as the EDF 7x40 and 15x110 Russian glasses to be a high-contrast coating designed to maximize resolution in low or unfavorable ambient lighting. Regarding the influences of cement, types of glass, age, etc. on certain other glasses, I can only defer to your other readers with a more technical bent than I have. (ii) regarding the ideal cleaning solution, some of our OMs swear by a few drops of a mild dishwashing soap in a glass of warm water. (iii) finally, a bit of feedback from your readership about our developing \"super binocular\" would be most welcome. Our initial feasibility study indicates that about the best we can do while maintaining a 7x binocular would be a 10.3 degree fov, while a 6x glass like the Sard can deliver a Sard-like 11.9 degree field of view. We appreciate that the apparent fields are virtually the same, but we would be interested in any feedback regarding one vs. the other. Our sense is that a 7x glass is more palatable to American tastes, but opinions to the contrary are welcome. In addition, we are considering a design utilizing both mirrors and prisms to reduce the weight and flatten the field, and we believe such a system can be put in place while overcoming the chronic alignment problem of using mirrors. Any particular experience with such a system out there??? Any comments??? best/ Mike --------------------- I would guess that 7x would be more popular, personally I like 6x for the steadier images & wider true field, but only if the images remain sharp over that field. I also believe that at this point in time, mirrors can be effectively used in binoculars. Amateur astronomers routinely use 'diagonals' with aluminum reflective coatings, overcoated with very hard silicon monoxide that is cleanable. These are not very expensive, and quality is far higher than needed with low power binoculars. As noted, mirror can reduce weight; also physical size. Whether the optical properties of the binocular can be improved by using mirrors is an interesting proposition. Prisms used to reflect a fast light cone do introduce overcorrection for spherical aberration; but that is routinely compensated in the eyepiece. I don't know whether it is possible that better correction in the image can be obtained by avoiding the problem by using mirrors. Mirrors would help maintain imaging quality in a binocular that uses replaceable eyepieces to change magnification. The only mirror binoculars that I know of, are not of the quality that a new introduction would require. The Hensoldt Diarex 8x30, sold 1959-60, image is not sharp off axis. The Leitz Amplivid 6 x 24, 1956-1962, 2 mirrors & 1 prism, 12 degree field, good images but off axis not good enough for a 1999 model. The 3 new Bushnell wide angle models, not a model for an ambitious designer. --Peter ================================================= Subject: New Fujinon stabilized binocular Fujinon has introduced a 14 x 40 Techno-Stabi model. 4 degree field, waterproof, nitrogen purged, 13mm eye relief, weight 1300 gm., $1099.

DO Super binocular; Techno-Stabi, Broad arrow ================================ From: rab\nSubject: DO super binocular Mr. Rivkin, my original hope was that you would make an exact replica of the SARD 6x42, which has the merit of my knowing exactly what to expect, at a minimum, when I place an order for one. The concept of \"improving\" upon the SARD 6x42 (or 7x50 wide-angle analog) is fraught with danger. There are hundreds of half-baked binoculars for sale, many of them no doubt intended to improve in some manner upon earlier designs. My own observation is that things generally run down-hill when people try to 'improve' on an earlier design, despite good intentions. I've owned two SARD 6x42, and while they were interesting and even useful, the power is lower than I like. A wide-angle 7x50 such as B&L produced in WW2 would make me happier. I would be willing to review the optical design before you manufacture it, holding the details in strictest confidence of course. I would also be willing to comment on mechanical details, although there are others better qualified than I to do that. Sincerely, R.A. \"Dick\" Buchroeder, PhD (optics), professional lens designer. ========================================= Subject: DO Super binocular From: Nelson882@___m This is my first comment to your binocular discussion group, I will later introduce myself more formally, but I wanted to comment on Mike Rivkens' developing \"super binocular. Perhaps I haven't read all the comments up to this point, but the use of mirrors should be avoided in a binocular because of the multiple reflections required to invert the image and the consequent light loss. As far as I know, Aluminum reflects less than 90% (?) of the incident light which is not a problem in a one surface telescope diagonal but would be a problem with four or more reflections used in a binocular. Another issue is the spectral efficiency across the visible region. Most telescope users are more interested in resolving points of light rather than seeing an image rendered as close to reality as possible including all its color components - this is assured using glass prisms with total internal reflection between 400 and 700 nm. but is it assured with the use of metallic reflective films? As far as the choice of power, most buyers today unfortunately under rate clarity and sharpness in favor of numerical magnification and although I enjoy the use of 6x glasses the market would be increased if the power were 7 or preferably 8x. 8x glasses can provide wider fields with the same size prisms because of the shorter focal length of the oculars and the consequent use of shorter focal length objectives. Wouldn't it be wiser to make a 12 degree 8x glass and really push the apparent field to new and higher ground? Steve Nelson ------------------------ I had thought that modern aluminized coatings were well above 90 percent reflectivity, but when I read my references on this subject, I found that new, overcoated aluminum coatings can be 96 percent, after a year or more they degrade to about 90 percent or less. I'd appreciate a correction on this, if I'm wrong; and any information on the reflectivity of aluminum over the spectral range of visual light. There are dielectric coatings that are permanent and about 99 percent reflective, but they are applied in a very complex process and are very expensive. And PS to Mike: now's the time to name this puppy. Is it the Super Binocular? -- Peter ======================================== From: \"Loren A. Busch\"\nSubject: Fujinon Techno-Stabi Comments on the new Techno-Stabi 14x stabilized binoculars from Fujinon: We have them in stock at both Captain's stores for anyone to look at. They ship in a hardcase, Pelican. They are rated waterproof. Power is 4 AA cells in a sealed compartment. Has a standby mode, and run mode. Not nearly the windup time of the Stabiscope, but some small amount of whine. When turned on, does not require the button to be held down like the Canon IS bino's. They are slightly bigger and heavier that the Canon 15x45. Most notable feature and one that was a real suprise to me is that this is the ONLY binocular I have ever picked up that I can use without my glasses. My correction is more than -12 in one eye, about -9 in the other. No other binoculars I have ever tried had enough travel in the focus to accomodate, but the new Fuji does. Haven't really wrung out the optics yet, will at first chance and report. ============================== Subject: Ye Olde Broad Arrow From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com I was asked by a telescope acquaintance about the broad arrow mark on British optics. My only reference on this subject is William Reid, Binoculars in the Army, Army Museum, #81, 82, 83, 84, 1982-5; part II, pp25 & 30. The broad arrow mark was inscribed on all optics (among other equipment) bought by the Office of the Ordnance and was first used in the fifteenth century. It is a 'property of' indicator and a quality control mark, and instruments had to pass certain tests to be accepted. Two such three-pronged arrows point to point, indicate an instrument bought & then sold by the Office. If a glass failed the quality tests, it was marked with an arrow with the leftmost line collapsed onto the middle line, a two pronged arrow. Yellow might indicate naval use. 'NPL' indicates the testing was done at the National Physical Laboratory. Is this mark still being used, or when did its use cease? ============================================== =============================================== Binocular List #67: 23 July 1999. Super B, yellowing, roof glasses, European repair, Swift 20x80, Takahashi 22x60 ======================================== Subject: Super binocular; Yellow Glass From: Fan Tao\nRegarding the planned \"Super Binocular\", replicating the SARD 6x42 or B&L 7x50 widefield is an interesting idea, but I have to put my two cents in and say that I would be far more interested in a design incorporating a modern eyepiece design and modern glass formulations. If you are going to produce a binocular worthy of being considered a benchmark such as the SARD 6x42 was, you have to come up with an innovative new design such as Al Nagler did with his famous eyepiece. I'm not saying that you should stick a pair of Naglers on the binoculars, but I have to believe that one can improve on the nearly 100 year old Erfle design, by using a negative field lens configuration for example, to improve the edge of field performance. Such a design would have to have big, expensive eyepieces, but I don't see why they have to be much bigger than what's already on the SARD, and I'm willing to pay the extra $1000 or so for Nagler-like performance. I would prefer the 7x magnification over the 6x for the Super Binocular. I would also be happy with 8x. I took a look at my binocular collection for signs of a yellowish image, using a flat white projection screen as a reference. The following have a pronounced yellow or yellowish-green image: Russian 20x110 (1994), Soviet 10x80 (circa 1970), Russian 7x30 (1996) and 10x42 (1999) made by KOMZ, Romanian 7x40 (1993) and 10x50 (1996) made by IOR. Note that all of the above glasses are military designs. The following had lesser degrees of a yellowish image: West German Zeiss 8x50 (ca. 1960), Aus Jena 8x50B Super Nobilem (ca. 1980), Zeiss Jena 8x50B Nobilem (ca. 1990), Zeiss Jena 8x50B Octarem (1980's), French military SRPI/Puteaux 8x30 (1950s?), Russian 8x30 center focus (1993). Both samples of the SARD 6x42 I checked had a very slight yellow tinge also, but a B&L 7x50 wide field did not show much yellowing. I would guess that the yellowish image in the military glasses is intentional, for contrast enhancement or possibly due to the use of radiation resistant glass (see Seeger, p.112). I remember reading somewhere that some older high index glass formulations were yellowish.

Peter The Swift Satellite shown on eBay is an older model; if it is more than about 12 years old, it would have the earlier eyepiece design that has virtually non- existant eyerelief and I wouldn't accept it even if it were a gift. The ones made in the last 12 years or so, including current production, have changed mechanically over that time but still have comparatively long eyerelief and optimized optics (as opposed to cobbled optics, which characterize most cheap 80mm binoculars). While it doesn't have in-focus parasitic images, like some cheap binoculars, it does have some horrendous stray-light images which severely detract from night- time city lights viewing. I suspect this has to do with its undersized BK7'ish prisms. The use of BK7 prisms doesn't automatically cause such problems, but in this case I think it's at fault. Flexure of the bridge causes some 2 or more diopters of slop in focussing; this is flexure, not looseness of the shaft, so it's a design/manufacturing problem that ought to be fixed by SWIFT (if they care!). As an interim fix, one could tape the eyepieces in place at infinity, or make a foam compression washer. Daytime use is impressive; the Satellite has enough eyerelief that I can add spectacle cutouts and comfortably see the field stops. There is no apparent 'bright ring' effect, suggesting good correction for pupil aberration. The apparent field is indeed huge (70-degrees) and very pleasant. The image quality falls off, but is acceptible. Night time use is also pleasant, although the bridge flexure needs to be fixed; as an astronomy binocular, it's just fine. Bright stars will produce the stray light images, as will the moon. But the moon looked at directly is an awesome sight at 20X, and very sharp and comparatively color-free. In some respects, it can be compared to the Fujinon 16x70 FMTSX. It has comparatively large objectives which, with their respective AR coatings probably have similar total transmission, and similar magnifications. Both have very short eyerelief, but both allow corrective spectaclets to be attached. The axial image in both is good, but while the Fuji is sharp to the edge, the Swift deteriorates off- axis. Both have an apparent field of about 65 to 70 degrees. Mechanically, the Fuji is above reproach. The Swift acts like it's made of rubber and demands immediate kludging to keep its eyepieces in simultaneous focus. After handling some really excellent binoculars by Nikon and Fuji, I'm naturally dismayed by the 'cheapness' of the Swifts. But with a street price of under $350, about half that of the Fuji, and a third that of a Nikon, it's hard to hold a grudge against the Swift Satellite 20x80! Incidently, the Satellite has a solid steel tripod adapter included in its price. You pay extra if you buy this attachment for the Fuji or Nikon. Regards, Dick Buchroeder ============================== Subject: Takahashi 22x60 From an on-line astronomy group: Tak 22x60 flourite prototype....Texas Nautical rep that had a pair ....The optics were fantastic, unlike the Zeiss 8x56 that I compared them to sharp to the edge. And the rectilinear (sp?) correction was the best that I have ever seen. But.... 22X? It does come standard with a neat adjustable mounting bracket, but even still... It also looks really cheezy. It looks like someone took a cheapo pair of binoculars, cut off the EPs and the objective lenses, cut two 60mm refractors in half, then bolted it all together with some EPs. Since it was a prototype, this is probably exactly what they did . But to get $1k for a pair of binoculars they need to work on the fit and finish a little more. ==================================== ==================================== Binocular List #68: 27 July 1999. roof prism collimation, Chinese glass, Hayward ================================= Subject: roof prism collimation From: Cory Suddarth\nRegarding R.F. Bolton's question about roof binos, collimation is done by using the three-way push screws located under the skin below the eyepieces, the screws are typically brass. Then it's the usual swing method collimation technique. Takes about twenty minutes with frequent sips of java. Orion gets $45.00 which includes return shipping. It is a toss up at that price to repair or replace, I usually let the customer deside. Some folks just can't part with their camo-coated, floppy-hinged, tubes on a string. Cory Suddarth Senior Optical Tech Orion T&B Center ======================== Subject: glass, Super B From: Peter Serafin\nI took my SARD 6X42 to a friend who works in environmental engineering and has access to a Geiger counter. No radiation detected. About the DO binocular project. If they are going to do it I recommend they work on edge to edge sharpness and no kidney beans. A binocular with a sharp 10 - 12 degree field which I could sweep with my eyes and not my whole head. I have a scope made from an old large format camera lens which makes a wide flat field. Very nice when used with a modern wide angle eyepiece. Later, Pete ==================================== Subject: Help re.: Chinese big eye From: Atmj1@___m A few weeks ago, we received one of the 4-inch Chinese bigeyes in for repair. The internal optics were coated with moisture; it was out of collimation; and one of the eyepieces was broken. Upon contacting the importer, we found that, in order to promote his business, he was willing just exchange the instrument - as opposed to locating parts. Thus, the lady would have received a brand new instrument for next to nothing as opposed to paying two senior Opticalmen to execute the overhaul - a VERY substantial savings. Eric authorized the trade and life was good. Then, the woman went ballistic because they were not HER binoculars! She informed us that how no other were as good as hers. We tried to convince that she had a garden variety, current production, Chinese surplus binocular. However, logic and integrity would not sway her. The antique dealer she bought the bino from\u0085\u0085.. Need I say more? We again tried nicely to say that it wasn't so. She had to have HERS. We contacted Mr. Chin, the importer, who sent us a letter saying that there was nothing special about her bino. We have not routinely sold these things since the Vixens were made available. Still, I bought others so she could see 3 side by side and make her decision. While the story gets MUCH more weird, this is what I need. I would ask that you aficionados send me email messages to the effect that there is nothing special about these Chinese surplus instruments (barring vast optical knowledge from a small town antiques dealer) and that to your knowledge - citing your experience with binoculars (and these in general, if possible) - that they have been based on the same design for years. I would appreciate this very much, and thank you in advance for doing so. I cannot make any headway with logic and reason. Perhaps, numbers will do the trick. Kindest Regards, Bill Cook ========================================= Subject: Hayward binoculars From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com The USN Mark 45 Mod 0 binocular was introduced during WWII, a 7 x 50 with a very slightly wider field and a more waterproof housing. 'Opticalman 3 & 2', 1966, reprinted by Dover as 'Basic Optics and Optical Instruments', notes on p449 that the hinge joint is different, with a straight tube - not tapered - and an expanding bearing that tightens against the hinge lugs, with hinge locks to secure the bearing. A Zerk grease fitting permits lubrication without disassembly. On p462 is noted that weak or faulty hinge tension is corrected with oversize bearings. Some surviving Mk 45s do indeed have a floppy hinge that will not hold IPD. Navships 250-624-2, Manual for Overhaul, Repair, and Handling of 7 x 50 Binoculars, Nov. 1951, Bureau of Ships: p8, hinge is illustrated and described. p13, the hinge was designed so that lubrication did not effect the hinge tension, and the tension could be adjusted without forcing lubricant from the tapered assembly. p16, The Mk 45 is 'the most waterproof of all the binoculars', designed for underwater service on submarines & demolition teams. It was designed (!) and produced by Hayward Lumber & Investment Co., Chemical & Mfg. Division, L.A. Body is drawn aluminum, not cast. Prism clusters suspended from the cover. Rubber gaskets used on seats of eye lens, objective lens, and between objective & body; eyepiece sealed with O-ring. pp39-51, disassembly of Mk 45. 'Keep your bench clean'. Disassembly of this glass seems to require special tools, especially for the hinge. There are many gaskets, and presumably they would all need replacement after 50 years. pp84-98, reassembly, 'keep your bench clean'. Fitting and adjusting hinge takes 4 pages, a bearing press, and if it still doesn't work, 'use the oversize bearings that have been provided'. p92-3, a very nice prism squaring fixture with a reticle and a grid. That is a fixture that would be very handy. I've not seen one of these in use in a repair shop. These binoculars seem to require an intimidating amount of skill & fixtures to repair. I do not own one, and wonder if the elaborate waterproofing has meant that the optics on these have survived in a cleaner condition than the typical USN 7 x 50s. I have used them, and do not recall that the view was any better than the standard glass, but would welcome opinions on that as well. Hayward's full name was Hayward Lumber, which seemingly still survives, Corporate Office 1900 Garden Rd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950, 831-643-1900. A few of these 7 x 50s appeared at the Great Western gun show in LA recently, in excellent condition, with case and NASA markings. Any clues on how NASA ended up with them? ===================================== =================================== Binocular List #69: Message from England =========================== Subject: Introduction from the U.K. From: SCSambrook@___m I have just had a very quick look through the 'list' (it only took about ninety minutes !), and I must say I am impressed by the detailed knowledge and enthusiasm shown by your members. My research into the growth of the British binocular industry actually fits within a study of the development of Optical Munitions (OM) in Britain from the early 1890s up to 1919, as part of my studies for a History degree as a (very) 'Mature Student' here in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. I think the term for OM in the USA is 'Optical Ordnance'. I've been interested in binoculars from the mid-1950s, having had the good fortune to grow up in a house where there were always several good binoculars to be found. I can remember WW-2 Zeiss 7x 50s turning up in pawnbrokers and junk shops for about \u00a310 - \u00a315 ( hey ! that was expensive - $20 -$30 !). If a binocular had 'Zeiss' on it, it was automatically a U-boat commander's glass; if it was German and didn't say Zeiss nobody wanted it, there were just so many 'Zeiss' named ones about. Those marked 'blc' sold for less than \u00a310 ... we just didn't know any better. How times have changed. Thanks to Herr Seeger we now know quite a bit more, although full lists of German Ordnance Codes were available decades before his Big Book came out. I suppose we thought they referred only to guns etc. One minor irritation now is that so many of the dealers here who offer WW2 German binoculars for sale assume that anything marked with an Ordnance Code is worth a small fortune - I just can't accept that tatty and degraded 7x 50s are worth hundreds of pounds. Having said that, I'm not really a collector, and so it shouldn't bother me, I suppose. As you are probably only too well aware, records of early British binocular makers and their products seem largely to have vanished. No doubt any of your members who are interested in things British will have read the published items by William Reid and Fred Watson, which are illuminating, interesting and entertaining. I would be very pleased to hear from, and correspond with, anyone who has an interest in British binoculars or Optical Munitions. OM includes telescopic rifle sights, gun sights and dial sights for ordnance, rangefinders, and so on. Of particular interest to me at the moment would be ANY information relevant to Bausch & Lomb and the Crown Optical Company concerning their involvement in supplying binoculars to Britain during the First World War. It might whet your members appetites to know that the British inspectors responsible for accepting these binoculars constantly rejected a very high proportion of production, and that of those actually shipped to Britain, the bulk were finally deemed unsuitable for issue, and sold on to the Imperial Russian Government. (Although not directly connected with binoculars, it's interesting that a similar situation arose with the British rifle contracts placed with Remington and Winchester for the Pattern 14 rifle, in 1915. There, the orders were eventually cancelled through 'non-compliance' clauses in the contracts. Any military weapons enthusiasts in your members will know that the U.S. Govt subsequently bought very large numbers of exactly the same rifles (but in 30-06 cal as opposed to 303, of course) and was seemingly quite satisfied. I think there is an area of research there previously ignored by historians - 'The Duplicity of the British Purchasing Commission in the U.S.A in the Great War' !) The only Crown Optical binocular I have been able to trace here was in totally 'relic' condition, and beyond salvation. I do have a Bausch & Lomb US Army Signal Corps 'EE' model 6x, which is optically and mechanically sound, even down to to retaining its reticle (graticule). I am awaiting its return from cleaning. Even in its dirty state, it appeared to perform as well as the contemporary, and equally dirty, Ross or Watson 6x models which I own (in British Army terminology, Binocular No.2 Mk I, or Mk II if with reticle). I also have a No.2 Mk I in overhauled condition, so a more valid comparison can be made when the B&L comes home. I gather from scanning your List that B&L is now but a former shadow of its previous self. I have written several times to their corporate HQ enquiring if records survive anywhere, but have never had a reply. Their British company hasn't been able to get an answer either ! Maybe the lights are all out at B&L ... Does anyone know if any LARGE rangefinders survive anywhere ? I would love to hear that somewhere, someone has preserved a 30-foot rangefinder. I wonder if any of your preserved battleships still retain theirs ? And ... do any of your members have any knowledge of the Japanese company FUJII (sic.) making prismatic binoculars during the First world War ? I have a Nikko 7x 50 'Novar' serial nr. 42 729 (I know it's a Novar because the Japanese characters on it correspond to those illustrating such a binocular in my copied extracts from Nikon's Japanese-language company history published a few years ago. I neither speak nor read Japanese, but one of my fellow-students who does has translated some of the extracts for me ... This is the only pre-1950s Japanese bino I've ever seen. Its eye cups are slightly different to those shown in the Nikon company history, and it has a small anchor and another partly degraded engraving on the interocular setting plate. I think it's probably Imperial Japanese Navy, but don't know its date of production. It appears never to have been opened for cleaning (none of the screw-heads seem to have been attacked anyway !), and is a little misty inside. But, it looks like a very good binocular indeed, and I think I'll try to get it cleaned ( it isn't easy to find technicians here who are happy to work on these older things ) I wonder if it's substantially the same design as the Zeiss Binoctar ? I know Zeiss sent a team out to Nippon Kogaku in the 1920s, and this bino is certainly top class. Nikon's UK outlet have no knowledge of Nippon Kogaku's involvement with optical munitions, and when they approached their Japanese parent on my behalf, the only light the firm could (or would) furnish was the extract from their company history. I gather from that, that they made not only the big gunnery rangefinders but also submarine periscopes and mechanical fire control computers for both surface gunnery and submarine-launched torpedoes. Please do make my details and interests available to anyone and everyone...as I say, I'm happy to share any knowledge I have about British-made things. Best wishes, Stephen Sambrook ==================== Subject: U.K. From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com >Of particular interest to me at the moment would be ANY information relevant >to Bausch & Lomb and the Crown Optical Company concerning their involvement Yes, I read Williams, A.C. The Design and Inspection of Certain Optical Munitions of War. Transactions of the Optical Society, vol. 20, no. 4, pp97-120, 1919. p114 discusses some weaknesses in the tested instruments, without mentioning the maker. p116, The shock test required by the Turkish government is mentioned, whereby a rangefinder is dropped across a log without injury. This is a source of some amusement on this side of The Pond. It is a mystery to me why these two glasses were rejected. Obviously, some nationalistic pride could have been involved, but considering the loss of life at the time, that is hard to accept. I have used the B & L, & other binoculars from the U.S. of that era, and also some of the U.K. glass, and cannot see any justification for this opinion. If you have any other references that would help answer this, I'll look them up. >'The Duplicity of the British Purchasing Commission in the U.S.A in the Great War' ! Well, just as you might hesitate to ascribe duplicity to the US govt., I hesitate to say nasty things about the Brits. In Germany, the treaty of Versailles is called the 'Dictate of Versailles'. So, there is still an Old World, at least it seems such to us. Or maybe I'm making too much of terminology. >The only Crown Optical binocular I have been able to trace here was in >totally 'relic' condition, and beyond salvation.

I wonder if >any of your preserved battleships still retain theirs ? I believe no current US battleships use optical rangefinders, but the Navies of other nations still use them. I also yearn for a view through one.... but please remember that the long ones didn't focus closer than a mile or so, and so your actual enhancement of stereoscopy might not be any greater than a hand held model that focused to a few yards. But I agree that a mountain or a lake would be absolutely beautiful through one. >I have a Nikko 7x 50 'Novar' ........ > This is the only pre-1950s Japanese bino I've ever seen. You might have an unusual variant, but this general description fits a glass that is not scarce here on the west coast of the US. They are good but not necessarily worth an expensive repair. --Peter ======================================================== ========================================================= Binocular List #70: 08 Aug. 1999. Rangefinders ================================ Subject: rangefinders From: \"linda\"\nHello fellows, About large rangefinders. Some Years ago I read on the Italian Magazine \"Storia Militare\" about a coastal battery built by Germans in Norway during WWII. This battery composed by several guns of 280 mm of caliber was undamaged at the end of the war. Norwegian Armed Forces mantained in activity the battery until late eighties. After the dismission it has been tranformed in a museum with all its gear working or ready to work. There is also a rangefinder or more which, considered the caliber of guns, should have been 20feets long or more.If I well remember what i read this rangefinder is still working. I regret but I don't remeber where the battery was emplaced. Giancarlo Bozzano ===================================== Subject: rangefinders From: \"John W. Briggs\"\nJust as an aside, the WWII battleship \"Massachusetts,\" which has been a floating musuem in Fall River, Massachusetts, for some 30 years, may still have artifacts of its original rangefinders on board. Just thought I would pass this along, in reply to that excellent post by our new and very welcome friend, SCSambrook@___m! John W. Briggs =============================================== Subject: list stuff We now have 56 (very quiet, reticent, uncommunicative) people on the list. So, just to fill out this list, here is the first third of my article on rangefinders, published in Amateur Telescope Making Journal. The second third is in list #4, at http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list.txt For the last third, about a fellow in Arizona who's building something like a stereo binocular, with objectives about 18 inches apart....... go buy the ATMJ. -- Peter RANGEFINDERS AND STEREOSCOPIC TELESCOPES In 1893, Ernst Abbe, working for Carl Zeiss, applied for a patent on their new prism binocular, but it was denied because of the earlier Porro prism glasses from several European makers. A revised patent was submitted for a prism binocular with enlarged objective distance, with the increased separation between the objectives being the protected feature. This was approved, and for 15 years no other optician could make a Porro prism binocular with objectives more widely spaced than the oculars. The rapid development of prism glasses by other quality makers caused the energetic Zeiss publicity works to seize their unique characteristic and proclaim its advantages in advertising. There is a real, if minor, increase in sense of depth that follows this increase in inter-objective distance, which is probably perceptible at close focus with standard, hand held binoculars, although there is wide variation in individual ability in stereopsis. Zeiss used the term \u0091plasticity\u0092 to describe the enhanced sense of depth, and it is a very apt term, since nearby objects appear modeled or sculpted. This characteristic was quantified, with \u0091specific plasticity\u0092 being defined as objective distance divided by ocular distance, and \u0091total plasticity\u0092 as magnification times specific plasticity (higher magnification adds to the effect.) Increased perception of depth does allow the observer to distinguish between objects that might otherwise be of very low contrast, and this advantage was the subject of many studies, papers, advertisements, and brochures around the turn of the century. Zeiss also made theater glasses with closely spaced objectives for portability, and they were not shy about publicizing the advantages of this configuration. They claimed that in the theater, diminished depth perception is useful because the spectator will see the live actor as part of the painted backdrop. While these concerns are of minimal import today, the effects are real, and were a very important part of the introduction of binoculars to the public. The Zeiss prism binoculars of 1894 were the first commercially successful, the first mass produced, and the first high quality binoculars. At the same time, Zeiss offered 2 prism binoculars with objectives 12 inches apart (8 power,) and 16 inches apart (10 power.) A hinge between the oculars allows them to fold in half, leading to the generic term \u0091Scherenfernrohr\u0092 or scissors telescope. These were called by Zeiss, \u0093Relieffernrohre,\u0094 and were not successful. The 8 x 20 model was offered from 1894 to 1906, and the 10 x 25 from 1895 to 1908 and through 1918 for military use. They give spectacular views of terrestrial objects, greatly magnifying the perception of depth in a scene and the appearance of modeled relief in an object. Here there is no exaggerating the effect. They were used as rangefinders in both World Wars, by several service branches of most of the participants in the conflict. Hand held instruments were about 6 x 30, with objectives 18 inches apart, and a folding hinge to reduce the length for transport. Tripod mounted instruments could have 50mm objectives, for use at dawn and dusk. These were used by artillery forces to approximately judge distances. The smaller sizes were needed for quick judgments on shell bursts, when a large instrument or more complicated rangefinder could not work quickly enough. These \u0091battery commander\u0092s rangefinders\u0092 can occasionally be found at gun shows or military collectors\u0092 meetings, and there are a few optical repair shops remaining that can correct their typical out of collimation condition. ============================================= ================================================= Binocular List #71: 17 Aug. 1999. Ross 10 x 70, Note from U.K., Rangefinder. =============================================== Subject: Ross 10 x 70 From: Dick Buchroeder\nReview of Ross 10x70 Gun Director Fixed Mount Binocular I recently obtained this massive binocular from Deutsche Optik after the item failed to reach reserve on eBay. This item is shown on page 409 of Dr. Seeger's \"Fernglaser und Fernrohre\" (1996). The front wheel contains pairs of clear openings and dark filters; one of the dark filters is missing. There are additional individual filters at each eyepiece location. Focusing is accomplished with large outboard levers that indicate the diopter setting on two large sector disks shown near the eyepiece. Purge ports and battery holders are small bumps on the body. IPD adjustment is accomplished with a knob on the lower right side. Eyerelief is short, probably around 15mm, and while I found no markings as to field or power, the binoculars are indeed 10x70, and the field appears to be about 6-degrees (60-degree apparent). The optics are MgF AR coated, the transmitted light is substantially 'white', and the glass on this unit is all in good condition, free from fungus, significant cosmetic flaws, and shows no cement separation. I mounted them with duct tape on a sturdy Majestic tripod (worm and gear elevation to prevent accidental falls!). My first views were during daylight hours, looking toward downtown Tucson on an overcast day. My first impression was, \"there's something wrong with the optics!\". Focusing on the axial region, the image near the edge of the field was out of focus, blurry, and moved when my head moved in any direction. I could focus on the edge of the field, but then the axis was blurry. Night testing revealed more clearly what was going on: 'field curvature' . However, whereas the Japanese add deliberate astigmatism to flatten the 'tangential field', this British design apparently strove to reduce astigmatism to zero. The result is that unless one is hyperopic, virtually nobody can first focus the axis at zero diopters, and then expect to see the off-axis image, because that requires making your eye focus 'beyond infinity'. Presumably, the idea was that the user would be a young soldier, and he would first focus the image near the edge of the field, and then accommodate myopically (close up object) for the axis, by a couple of diopters. This works fine for young people, but is beyond the ability of people who have attained middle age and beyond. The advantage of eliminating the astigmatism (actually, just reducing it to as low a level as they could) and allowing the field to strongly curve toward the eyepiece is that complete detail could be seen in the off-axis image without needing to redirect the axis of the binocular to put the object in the center of the field. The disadvantage, of course, is that these binoculars are exceedingly annoying to older people! While we're at it, let me discourse on the 'optimum' state of aberration balance in an imperfect eyepiece. The Ross case, zero astigmatism, means that the eyepiece must be refocused inward toward the objective in order to see the field in focus. Since virtually all of the true field curvature (the Petzval surface) comes from the eyepiece (not the objective, which has ten times longer focal length, and therefore 1/10th the Petzval sum of the eyepiece), a simple 25mm EFL eyepiece has a Petzval radius of about 38mm. For a 60-deg AFOV, following the normal distortion formula, the radius of the field stop is EFL x sin 30-deg, or 12.5mm. The sagittal depth of a sphere of radius R and semidiameter y can be calculated with: x = R minus sqr root of ( R- squared \u0096 y-square). The focal shift caused by adding a thin lens of a given diopter value can likewise be calculated with simple formulas, and we find that 3 diopters would shift the focus by 1.75mm. So, in principle the Ross binocular would require that the viewer shift focus by 3.6 diopters to go from axis to edge focus. Judging from the dials on the Ross, the shift was about 2 diopters (where it ran out of adjustment), so higher order astigmatism was probably at work, or the design is more complicated than merely a singlet. Now, suppose that the tangential focus were flattened by adding overcorrect third order astigmatism. As is known to lens designers, the T-focus moves away from the Petzval surface three times faster than the S-focus. So, the effect would be to make the T-focus flat, and the sagittal focus 2.4 diopters out of focus. The sagittal focus would require focusing 'beyond infinity', and is therefore not attempted under normal circumstances. However, note that for complicated targets (daylight scenes), there is detail in all orientations of the image, therefore something 'sharp' is instantly viewed as the eye scans the field of view. I call this the \"GOTCHA\" effect. It makes such designs appear subjectively to be sharp all over. But, in fact, careful attention to detail, and especially observation on stars at night, reveals the truth: the image is only sharp in one orientation of the fine detail. The Flat T-field has additional advantages: the field stop is crisply in focus, and head motion causes no radial image motion: the true distance of an object from the center of the field is therefore correct at all times. However, lateral motion causes an object to wiggle 'tangentially' (parallel to the rim of a wheel; at right angles to the spokes. This is caused by the parallax induced by failure to focus the sagittal detail at infinity . Finally, it has been attempted from time to time to flatten the Sagittal field (as in the SARD 6x42, M43(?)). This has the advantage that now the eyes need never accommodate beyond infinity; one's eyes will be able to accommodate myopically (close up) for tangential image detail (the spokes of the wheel will be sharp, the rims will be fuzzy). The problem here is that from the 3:1 rule of tangential to sagittal movement relative to the Petzval sum, the tangential detail is out of focus by 7.2 diopters, far beyond the accommodative ability of most people. So, while it was a good idea in principle, it's a bad idea in practice. The designers of the Ross 10x70 apparently paid attention to ghost image rejection. Coated only with MgF, and employing several filters, I found it almost impossible to find any ghost images even when looking directly into stadium lights! On the downside, there are two parasitic image leaks but I found that if carefully positioned my eyes with the provided rubber eyeguard only hints of the leaks were actually observed. The Ross 10x70 seems uniquely different in many ways from the Japanese and German optics of that era. Regards, Dick Buchroeder. PS: This binocular For Sale, $550 + shipping.

This system included, guns, mountings, rangefinders and fire control computers, but at this stage I haven't discovered exactly how many guns were supplied, or any other details as to location. It must have been a substantial contract, because it took a considerable period to execute and Vickers encounted payment problems as the Spanish political situation fluctuated. About two years ago, I spoke with two elderly gentlemen who had been trainees at Cooke, Troughton and Simms Ltd, (CTS) York, England at the time. CTS were the division of Vickers which made optical instruments - eg Rangefinders, and the two gents clearly remembered what they described as Very Large Rangefinders being assembled in the works. I don't even know which coast, or coasts, the system was meant for. One day I hope to get to trawl the Vickers archives and discover what it all was ... unless anyone out there has done it already. On the same subject, I have been told by an acquaintance who is an Artillery & Fortification enthusiast, that there still exists a complete coastal defence installation in Finland, complete with its optics. But I don't know who made it. My acquaintance suggested that the author JON T. SUMIDA (author of In Defence of Naval Supremacy) might know something about it. Returning to a subject from Binocular lists passim: 'Leached' lenses -the University of York, England, has a small display of products of Cooke, Troughton & Simms, including a demonstration lens half treated by H. Dennis Taylor's chemical process, and half plain. There is a visible difference in transmission between the two halves, so Taylor's process obviously worked, even if there were problems mass producing it on different types of glass. If anyone's interested, more details can be obtained via Mrs Alison Brech, Vickers Archive, The University of York Borthwick Institute Peasholme Green, YORK, England. The last time I spoke to Mrs Brech, the Borthwick Institute (which is housed remotely from the university campus) had neither email nor website, so it will be necessary to write airmail. Has any member any experience of deterioration in Leitz or Zeiss binoculars using cemented prisms ? Those types are uncommon in the U.K., but there are still lots of Barr & Stroud ex- services 7x 50s knocking about, as well as a smaller number of Ross 7x 50s. The Barr & Strouds almost always have massive deterioration in the prism cementing - it sometimes becomes discoloured to a brown tint. This seems to happen on both service/war time examples, and also post-war civilian production. The cemented objectives and eyepieces don't exhibit similar problems. It's been suggested to me that poor quality cement or slovenly workmanship may be the reason, which I can readily accept for the war-time glasses, but I'm no technician and don't presume to offer an answer. It's also been suggested that stresses in the cemented prism/field lens assembly could cause the cement to fail. I wonder if the German types using similar construction suffer in the same way ? My thanks to John Briggs for the suggestion that BB Massachusets might still have some optical fire control gear in situ. I shall now try to contact all the U.S. preserrved battlerships ! The U.S.A. seems to take more care of its heritage than Britain does ... especially in respect of naval vessels.

A prism on the right side as been knocked way out of line. Is anyone on this list familiar with this particular model? It's not obvious to me how to open them up, though I notice some sort of adjustment screw, under a small glued-on plastic cover. If anyone knows details, or can quote on trying to fix these, please e-mail me directly: jwb@___erkes.uchicago.edu John W.

Contact Larry Gubas, list member & editor of their periodical: Lngubas@___m ) Zeiss and the Teleater Those of you who have followed the various articles in Zeiss Historica over the years are aware of just how magnificent was the original binocular design by Zeiss. It is possible to pick up one of these very first models from 1894 and immediately feel comfortable and familiar with the instrument. Amazingly, with the possible exception of field of view, these first binoculars perform on a par with many of today\u0092s glasses. Unable to claim patent protection based on the porro prism design, Zeiss came up with the idea of patenting the \u0093plasticity\u0094 or enhanced stereo effect produced by objective lenses which were placed wider apart than the oculars. This in turn forced most competitors to design binoculars with closely set objective lenses so as to not violate the Zeiss patents. This curious twist of fate subsequently led Goerz, in 1903, to introduce an interesting 2\u00bdX12 theater glass whose design lived well beyond the life of the Zeiss patents and in fact became the basis for the wonderful little Zeiss glass called the Teleater. As it happens, the Teleater was my very first \u0093collector\u0094 binocular, acquired in 1963 at the expense of a slight delay in the purchase of my future bride\u0092s engagement ring. This design is not only characterized by objectives which are placed closer together than the oculars but focusing is almost always accomplished by moving the objectives rather than the eye pieces. According to Hans Seeger, the Teleater first appeared in 1909. A sample from my collection carries serial number 184044 which dates it from about 1910. It is a center focus binocular, does not have an adjustable eyepiece for diopter adjustment and is plain by comparison to the later versions. By 1912 the Zeiss catalog lists a basic black Teleater binocular, a gold plated with lizard skin version and another gold plated design with mother of pearl. Diopter adjustment is featured as are a number of accessories including a \u0093silk plush bag\u0094, \u0093soft leather pouch\u0094 and \u0093crocodile leather flap case\u0094. By 1914 the catalog also lists a detachable collapsible handle for the mother of pearl model and by 1923 the handle was available for the lizard skin version as well. Production of the Teleater continued until at least 1931. A similar model, the 6X15 Teletur was produced from 1910 through 1924. Almost identical in outward appearance, the Teletur was never offered in \u0093deluxe\u0094 trim, probably because it was considered too powerful for the theater.

One of the more interesting aspects of this design is the degree to which it was copied by various manufacturers. The proliferation of copies is indeed amazing. In my collection alone, I count examples by: Goerz, Zeiss, Oigee, Leitz, B&L, Busch, and at least two unknown makers. In addition, Huet, Voigtlaender and Ross also offered their version. Even into the 1950\u0092s and 60\u0092s, remnants of this famous design can be found in binoculars from Hertel and Reuss, Hensoldt, Rodenstock, Hoya and the popular Bushnell Custom Compact 6x24. The fact that Zeiss\u0092 design of the original binocular has remained almost unchanged after 100 years is a remarkable engineering accomplishment. Zeiss\u0092 ability to recognize and respond to a competitor\u0092s creative alternative to the patent protected design is certainly a compliment to Zeiss\u0092 marketing skills.

Deltars, 8 x 60s, rangefinders, prism cement ==================================================== Subject: List 'archives' I split the 'archives' of this list into two files -- it was getting to be a pretty big download. --Peter http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list.txt lists 1-49, 435 kilobytes http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list50.txt lists 50-72, 200 kb ===================================== Subject: Deltars, 8 x 60s From: rab\nSteve Rohan showed me a pair of BLC 8x60 binos of the kind shown on the upper- right-hand corner of Seeger, pg.319. Long eyerelief (about 21mm) and wide angle, in excellent condition and wonderful to use. He also brought, at my request, a pair of Deltars. Because the distortion IS corrected in the Deltars, the extremely wide angle view will give you nausea as you scan the binoculars across a field of view. They are living proof that zeroing out distortion is a BAD idea in handheld binoculars. I think we can dismiss the Deltar as being of any further interest. The BLC 8x60, however, creates a longing for a pair of my own. The things that distinguish it are: long eyerelief, wide angle, excellent pupil correction, low ghosts, coatings, and of course, fine Zeiss quality. It probably has an aspheric eyepiece; Rohan thinks so, and there were slight manufacturing artifacts in the full-field image that suggest that be so. That Zeiss 8x60 with about 21mm eyerelief and a 34mm clear aperture on the eyelens is one of the best binoculars in the world. It sure would be nice if somebody like Zeiss, Leica, Nikon, or Fuji would consider remanufacturing it. If it is aspheric, that poses serious complications, and would probably preclude its profitable manufacture. However, Docter Optiks, which has probably been purchased and renamed by somebody by now, sold aspheric eyepiece binoculars (which I used and thought were inferior to normal binoculars...I think the game was to lower cost, not to improve quality) AND sold molded aspherics of various qualities and complexities as OEM products. They had an office in the Phoenix area. It would be nice, if we got a reverse-engineered design, to go to them and see if they could make the requisite aspheric lens for a reborn \"Zeiss\" 8x60. The eyepiece from the sheet you gave me, Steve R, is NOT the eyepiece used on your BLC. Maybe on somebody elses, but not yours. The drawing itself shows the eyerelief to be about 10mm. We measured your eyerelief to be about 21mm. I experimented with modifying an Abbe, forward and reversed, and it is simply not likely to do the job. Your binocular's eyepiece is something quite different. It does seem to have an aspheric; there are advantages to having aspherics, and if the game was to replicate the Zeiss 8x60 WA LER, then we should certainly TRY to produce the same aspheric. (It would also be possible to design an all-spherical eyepiece, but it wouldn't be quite the same...and that could have unforseen consequences when it was built and tested). Any help you can render would be greatly appreciated! Regards, Dick Buchroeder. =================================== Subject: Rangefinders From: \"linda\"\nNorwegian Batteries. After a rapid search I found two Norwegian Batteries The first at Harstad where is one turret with one 406mm(16 inches), built by Germans during WWII and still managed by Norwegian Armed forces.The gun is called Adolf's cannon and has a range of 55km. If there is a rangefinder it must have a span of 10 mt. at least. The second is at Senjehesten Follows the description Coastal Defence Museum Senjehesten by Skrolsvik, is an old farm in Tran\u00f8y, previously the Bjark\u00f8y Municipality. Senjehesten is situated near the fishing station in Skrolsvik. It is here we find the earliest traces of settlement in the central Troms province. Archaeological findings from the Skrolsvik area reveal settlements dating back 7000 - 9000 years ago. German occupation forces came to Senjehesten and built a coastal fort there in 1941. After the war, Norway and NATO expanded the facility and used it until 1990 when the fort was shut down. Today it has become the Senjehesten Coastal Defence Museum. Senjehesten, also known as Fort Skrolsvik, was a link in the gigantic coastal defence system developed by the Ger-mans in Norway from 1940 to 1945. They built over 300 coastal installations throughout the country, of which 45 are located in Troms province. The first coastal fort was built during the spring and summer of 1941. At that time, a battery with four 10,5 cm cannons was constructed and operational by June, 1941. The battery received the name, \"HKB 16/973 Senjehesten,\" and was commanded under Har-stad's jurisdiction. At first, such a fort was manned by to officers, thirteen petty officers and fifty-two troop men. In the winter of 1942/43, an expansion of the fort occurred. The workforce was composed of Norwegian civilians and Russian prisoners. In 1943 the 10,5 cm battery was dismantled and replaced by a new battery with four 15 cm cannons (still in the fort). It was commanded by the V\u00e5gsfjord Artillery Group, MAA 511, with its headquarters in Ringberget, near Harstad. The V\u00e5gsfjord Artillery Group of 6 forts had as its main goal to defend the entrance to V\u00e5gsfjorden and therefore the entire inner Troms region. Fort Skrolsvik was never under attack. But in 1940 there were skirmishes between German and British naval and air forces in V\u00e5gsfjorden, just outside of Skrolsvik. One German submarine was bombed and sunk. The four 15-cm cannons in Skrolsvik have a range of 22.000 metres. They are of German construction and have the designation: SKC/28; length: 8,25 metres; model 1928; grenade weight: 45,3 kg.; delivery speed: 875 metres per second. They could shoot 6 - 8 shots per minute. After the war, Fort Skrolsvik was taken over by the Norwegian Defence. It was expanded and modernised with new fire control equipment and better housing for the soldiers. The fort was then manned permanently until 1989. The Senjehesten Coastal Defence Museum is unique in that it contains the four cannons in the main battery, preserved since 1943. I will continue the search and I will inform member.

It was equiped with 3, 28cm Schiffs Kanone C/34 (28cm S.K. C/34) in a tower. This tower (and the three guns) come from the German battle-ship \"Gneisenau\". The M.K.B. Oerlandet was manned bij the 4./M.A.A. 507. In July 1943, the battery was ready for action. The battery never saw action during the war. After the war, the battery was used by the Norwegian army.

Cementing prisms, Moeller and Zeiss binoculars =============================================== I will be at the Oregon Star Party, 60 miles east of Prineville in the Ochoco National Forest, and away from e-mail Wed. Sept. 8 to Sun. Sept. 12. After years of using various 50 mm binoculars, I finally have two excellent astronomical binoculars: a Beck Tordalk 11 x 80 and a Nikon Astroluxe 10 x 70, with ED glass. I look forward to hours of use under these truly dark skies. Preliminary comparisons of the Nikon with the Beck and with a Fuji 16 x 70 showed that the Nikon had considerably better contrast, the others had grey, hazed backgrounds in comparison. With the Nikon, stars & nebulae were stark white against a velvet black, and sharp nearly to the edge. The narrow 50 degree field of the Nikons was a small price to pay for these beautiful views. --Peter =============================================== Subject: Cementing prisms From: Cory Suddarth\nTo answer Rod Bolton's question about what to use to secure prisms after adjustment is complete, most any two-part epoxy will work. The consumer grade epoxies are available in most any hardware store, K-marts (or equivalent). If you decide to use the clear type, it is a bit drippy at first and you must take care as to not let it run down under the prism and the prism collar or plate. Nearly all the original color that is used at the factory is grey. If you can find it (in grey) get it. It stays put so as not to complicate the process. I'm currently using a dual syringe that has white on one side and yellow on the other. Squirt equal amounts on a small piece of paper, mix, and use. I then hang on to the piece of paper, I leave the tooth pick (or what ever) in the epoxy so I can monitor it's adhesion and have an accurate idea as to when the epoxy is hardened. Cory Suddarth, Senior Optical Technician, Orion Telescopes & Binoculars ================================================= Subject: Moeller and Zeiss binoculars. From: Jack Kelly, binocs@___m (Those of you who are not members of Zeiss Historica are missing out on some good coverage of binoculars, including the article below, by Jack Kelly. Contact Larry Gubas, list member & editor of their periodical: Lngubas@___m ) Moeller and Zeiss Compact Binoculars \u00a9 1999 Jack Kelly When Ernst Abbe patented the first prism binocular for Zeiss in 1894, he coincidentally used the same erecting prism system developed by Italian artillery officer Ignazio Porro in 1854. The design is simple and functional, utilizing two 90 degree prisms arranged to erect the image and shorten the length of the objective tube. The same Porro prism design is still used today and in the author\u0092s opinion still produces the best images for the lowest cost and complexity. Almost immediately after the introduction of this new binocular, creative optical technicians began to develop alternatives to the Porro prism design. Variations abounded and Ernst Abbe is noted as one of these inventors with his Abbe-Koenig roof prism. Hensoldt was the first manufacturer to utilize a variation of the roof prism design in a production binocular, which they introduced in 1905. The primary purpose of all of this prism development effort seems to have been aimed at improvement in binocular size, shape, and compactness. However, prior to the advent of lens coating, a roof prism, which has fewer glass to air surfaces, yielded a binocular with significantly reduced light loss and improved contrast. Over the years, roof prisms have allowed designers to reduce the size and weight of the binocular and, until quite recently, generally have been associated with higher quality instruments. Development of roof and other prism designs continues to this day with recent \u0093phase correction\" P40 coatings claimed to significantly improve image quality in the third generation Leica Trinovid. By the early 1920\u0092s, J. D. Moeller Optical Works, a small private optical shop in Wedel, utilizing this newer prism technology, designed and patented a series of high quality, compact and optically superior binoculars. The first to come to market was the 3\u00bdx15 Theatis in 1920 followed by the 6x22 Tourix and the 8x24 Turox in 1923. The Theatis utilized a Sprenger-Leman prism while the two larger glasses incorporated the Moeller prism, a modified Abbe-Koenig design. The Moeller binoculars were available in either individual or center focus models with the focusing arrangement of the gilt and mother of pearl 5x15 Theatour an interesting combination of both (see photo). The unique and functional design of the Moeller glass was immediately apparent and Moeller further promoted the glass by drawing attention to the inherently superior optical efficiency of their design, claiming better light transmission and improved contrast over porro prism glasses of the same size. By 1923, Zeiss was the dominant manufacturer of precision optical equipment in Germany and actively engaged absorbing competitors. Recognizing a potential threat to their dominance of the marketplace because of Moeller\u0092s unique design of these compact binoculars, Zeiss initiated legal proceedings challenging Moeller\u0092s design rights, while at the same time organizing a boycott of Moeller Optical Works products and services by members of the German optical industry trade association. Although information is sketchy, it appears that while Moeller\u0092s design rights were upheld, by 1925 Moeller was forced by the realities of their economic position to seek settlement with Zeiss. In June of that year Moeller submitted a proposal whereby Zeiss would be licensed to manufacture and sell products based on the Moeller design. After indicating preliminary agreement with the Moeller proposal, Zeiss announced that they suddenly had \u0093discovered\u0094 an old design of their own which would dispense with any need for the Moeller patents. Financially strapped and faced with the prospects of a protracted and expensive legal battle, J. D. Moeller Optical Works was forced to cease operations on October 21, 1925 to be succeeded on the same day by a \u0093new\u0094 company, J. D. Moeller Optical Works, GmbH, a stock corporation, owned 52.5% by Zeiss and the remainder by Moeller. This new company acquired all of the patents and design rights of the old Moeller company and shortly thereafter Zeiss commenced series production of their own compact binoculars utilizing the Moeller designs and technology. The J. D. Moeller Optical Works, GmbH continued in the binocular manufacturing business into the 1960\u0092s, producing a line of quality binoculars including the Cambinox, which incorporated a precision miniature camera into a 7x35 binocular. In the1923-1925 time frame, Zeiss introduced a flat compact 6x18 binocular called the Telita. Visually different in design from the Moeller and later Zeiss binoculars and using a slightly different prism design, the model is not depicted in the author\u0092s 1923 or 1926 Zeiss catalogs. This Telita might in some way be associated with the Zeiss strategy of maintaining economic pressure on Moeller during the design dispute. The design was very short lived but exists in at least two variations. The earliest in the author\u0092s collection (s/n 1250147) is finished entirely with glossy black enamel while a later sample (s/n 1252259) is finished with black enamel on one side and synthetic leather on the other. . By 1926 Zeiss offered a new compact 6x18 Telita binocular which, while not a direct copy of the Moeller glass, shows a distinct connection with the original design. In 1928, this model was augmented with the 8x24 Turita followed in 1929 with a 3\u00bdx15 design which not only looked like the original Moeller, it even carried the same Theatis name. All three of the Zeiss glasses were available in center focus only. Production of the Telita and Turita continued into WW II and the Theatis was still in production in Jena until 1980. One interesting feature of the Theatis is its ability to focus as close as eighteen inches. The Telita and Turita were available in black finish and the Theatis was offered in standard black as well as gilt or silver plated versions with red, green or brown lizard leather. Available cases included the standard snap fastened hard leather version as well as an assortment of zippered pouches and fancy opera cases with vanity mirrors for the Theatis. . . Photos: . Original Moeller Theatis . The first successful compact binocular design from J. D. Moeller, Wedel, the Theatis, was introduced in 1920 and continued in production by Zeiss Jena until 1980. Originally finished in crinkle black enamel (left), later versions had leather inserts on the body of the binocular. From the collection of Fred Schwartzman. . Zeiss Marked Theatis . This Theatis from the collection of Peter Serafin is of the earliest design with small center hinge and the ability to fold completely in half for convenient storage. It was most likely painted with a textured black finish, long since lost. An interesting note is the Carl Zeiss Jena logo engraved on the prism cover. Whether this was done by Zeiss or a local distributor is open to interpretation but the example shown was manufactured prior to Zeiss\u0092 association with Moeller and the lettering in the logo is just slightly different form that used by Zeiss on binoculars of that period. . Moeller Theatour . A gilt and mother of pearl variant of the Theatis, the 5x15 Theatour has a unique focusing system. The viewer first sets the small middle lever to the center position and then adjusts the individual eyepieces to bring the subject into focus. From that point on, the lever is used to focus both eyepieces simultaneously. The choice of the Theatour name is an obvious attempt to convey the impression that the 5X glass could be used for both theater and touring purposes. From the collection of Fred Schwartzman. . Original Moeller Tourox . The 6x22 Tourix and 8x24 Tourox were built on the same platform, identical in every respect except for the diameter of the objective lens and the magnification of the oculars. . Moeller Touroxmo . This purpose-built monocular is derived from the Tourox but was clearly designed as a monocular with unique strap mounting method, special top plate and its own model identification. . Zeiss Telita I . The original Zeiss Telita utilized a different roof prism design than the Moeller glasses and was manufactured for only a very short time. Note the rectangular shape as contrasted with the trapezoidal shape of the earlier Moeller glass and later Zeiss Telita design. The glass on the right is finished in black enamel with no provision for textured coverings; the prism covers are recessed into the binocular body and the size of the glass (6x18) is inscribed immediately below the Telita model designation on the left prism cover. On the left is a glass identical in shape to the early version Telita. The only differences appear to be the presence of textured coverings on the body (but not on the prism covers); the size designation (6x18) has been moved to the center top hinge cover; and, the bottom hinge cover is larger to cover the edge of the textured material. . Zeiss Telita II and Turita . This photo shows the Telita II and Turita in the flat carry position. To the right is another Telita folded for viewing. Note that the shape of this Zeiss binocular has assumed the look of the early Moeller glass possibly as a result of Zeiss\u0092 access to the Moeller design. Unlike the Moeller Tourix and Tourox, the Zeiss glasses are of two distinct sizes but clearly retain a common design. . Zeiss Theatis . Example of a Zeiss Theatis from the early 1950\u0092s in gilt and lizard finish with a fancy case suitable for the opera. While the Zeiss Theatis carried the same name as the original Moeller glass it is clear that there is only a family resemblance to the original. . Post War Moeller Tourox Notes: Seeger, Hans T.:Feldstecher, Fernglaeser im Wandel der Zeit, Bresser Optik, 1987 Schumann, Wolfgang (as head of author\u0092s collective), Carl Zeiss Jena, Einst und Jetzt, Rutten & Loening, Berlin, 1962 ========== Binocular Prism Systems by Peter Abrahams An objective lens paired with the standard eyepiece gives an image that is upside down and reversed left to right. The Porro I prism system uses two prisms, the first to invert the image and the second to reverse it. There are other strategies to accomplish this. One of the reflecting surfaces in a prism can be modified into a V-shaped \u0093roof\u0094, which splits the image into two halves and reflects the two halves off of both sides of the roof. This allows the image to be rotated in two directions, using only one prism. There are several advantages to this. Fewer optical elements make it easier to maintain alignment, and meant a brighter image in the era before coated optics. Roof prisms also allowed the use of larger objectives, and the first binocular with a 50mm objective was a Hensoldt 10 x 50 roof prism design. ======================================================= From Seeger, _Feldstecher_: Zeiss introduced a model with Moller prisms, the Telita, fig. 62. This caused a patent dispute that Zeiss lost. In retaliation, there was a temporary (1925-31) takeover of share majority by Zeiss Co. The Telita and Turita were built up to the beginning of the 1940s. Neither Zeiss Jena (GDR) nor Zeiss Oberkochen revived these models after the war. [correction: The Telita II (and the Turita) did not have Moller prisms, as depicted in fig. 133. In these models, there was a roof prism with another attached prism. The Telita I had a Huet prism.] Figure 62 above: 6 x 18 Telita, Carl Zeiss, Jena. First and second models, 1923 & 1927. below: 8 x 24 Turita, from 1928 on.

[p56] Figure 63 8 x 32 Marox, Moller, Wedel, ca. 1960 A larger glass with Moller prisms, aluminum, coated optics. One of the last Moller models, in 1963 the production of civilian field glasses ceased. Moller built several different models with Moller prisms into the 1960s, including larger objective models as in fig. 63. These glasses, with closely spaced objectives, produced in the recent past, prove that the higher image plasticity provided by widened objective distance is no longer an advertisement or sales argument. [p57] 4.4.4 Field Glasses with Leman Prisms Like the Moller prism, the Leman prism is a roof prism with no silvered sides, see chapter 16. The Leman is made from one piece of glass and has no cemented surfaces. Also called the Sprenger-Leman Prism, it was invented in the 1800s and even used in some glasses, see fig. 136. Zeiss used it in an early sighting telescope. It is not generally known that M. Hensoldt briefly made, near the turn of the century, a glass with Leman prisms, shown in fig. 117. It is not mentioned in the Hensoldt writings 9, and was probably made in very small numbers. It is possible that this flat and efficient glass had to be pulled from production because of a protest from Zeiss, concerning the widened objective distance that resembled a Zeiss glass. It is also possible that Zeiss was inspired to produce the Teleplast because of the Hensoldt model. The Leman prism achieved practical significance and a long production history only in the Theatis. Except for the Hensoldt model (fig. 117), the first mass produced glass with a Leman prism was the Teleplast. This was built in a 3x and 5x version in 1906-1907 by Zeiss Jena, see fig. 64. These flat but otherwise clumsy glasses seem to have been designed around an exaggerated objective distance. They had little success, and the focusing was difficult because of the imprecision of the joints. They are rare today. Zeiss used the name Teleplast for two different models: This one and a later miniature \u0091hand-scissor\u0092 glass [rabbit ears]. Fig. 64 3 x 20 Teleplast Carl Zeiss, Jena, ca. 1907. The first Zeiss glass with Sprenger-Leman prisms. Highly widened objective distance for greater plasticity. Zeiss had already used this prism in a sighting telescope. Hensoldt had used it in a binocular, see fig. 117. Optical Museum, Oberkochen. The \u0091hand-scissor\u0092 [Handscherenfernohr] glass was developed in 1897 and at first called a \u0091Relief Field Glass\u0092 (Relieffernohr.) There was an 8x and 10x model. Because of this duplication in names, one finds inappropriate naming and inaccurate details; an 8x Teleplast was built, but not with Leman prisms. From about 1912 another Leman prism glass was built, where the widened objective distance was given great importance. (fig. 65.) To use it, both halves are folded out of a frame. [p58] (Fig. 65 5 x 12 Stenor, Carl Zeiss, Jena, ca. 1914. Miniature prism glass with Leman prisms and greatly widened objective distance, introduced 1912. At rest, both halves are in a folding frame (above). For use, they are folded out of the frame (below). Aluminum, black paint. Because of the frame construction, individual focus only. Not produced after 1927. Museum for Traffic and Mechanics, Berlin) When it became obvious that the highly widened objective distance was not generally popular, but on the contrary the closer objectives were becoming prevalent, the Stenor was constructed differently, from 1925 on: the folding frame was dropped. With the usual folding bridge, this flat miniature glass with close objectives, called the Stenotar, is shown in fig. 66. The 5x Stenotar was soon replaced by the 6x Telita. Leitz produced the 3.5 x 15 Oberon, a Leman prism opera glass,from 1954 to 1957. The most successful Leman prism glass was the timeless and efficient Theatis, from Moller in Wedel, introduced in 1920. It was made in black paint, or gilded, but the gilt on a zinc background was not stable. See fig. 67. The center focus model was called the Tatisem. From 1927, the Theatis (using the same name) appears in the Zeiss product line. In Jena the last Theatis must have been produced around 1980, and in Oberkochen it was not produced. Fig. 66 (below) 5 x 12 Stenotar, Carl Zeiss, Jena, ca. 1928. Miniature prism glass with Leman prisms, successor to the Stenor. From 1925 on. Diminished objective- distance, unusual folding bridge.

Meeting in L.A. Oct. 28, rangefinders, comparisons ========================================== Subject: Meeting in L.A. Oct. 28 From: Peter Abrahams It appears that there will be a significant gathering of binocular enthusiasts in Los Angeles, Oct. 28-29. Steve Rohan is hosting a Thurs. 28 meeting, but it is important to note that his rooms are not designed for meetings & space will be short. Security concerns also mean that those interested in attending should check with Steve. The Great Western Gun Show will be open Oct. 28 & 29, but I would regard it as a real waste of potential if we all break up to hunt for junk; it is very unlikely that there will be more good binoculars than binocular nuts at that show. Hopefully, we can meet on Friday Oct. 29 as well. We would like to make this a productive meeting, not just a show off session. Several members of this list have taken the pursuit of binoculars far beyond a hobby, and it seems that some major writing efforts & other historical projects are on the cusp of happening. We could make this meeting where some significant progress was made, at least in learning of the resources that each of us possess, and hopefully also exchanging information & opinions. For example, I will be bringing down a few reams worth of photocopies of catalogs, etc., to pass out & use to solicit the same: if you have a manual, catalog, etc. that I don't have, I will certainly make it worth your while to copy it for me. I will also have my trusty notebook computer & take notes. Steve Rohan\nwrites: \" I hope to set up a large color monitor so that we may place specimens which are of special interest. With a digital video camera attached we can all see the item and discuss its properties. It would be nice if the meeting could have some direction. What do you think? Would a program for the meeting or at least an invitation for the participants to bring notes or specimens for all to examine or discuss be a better idea than just ad lib type of stand around and eat pizza and talk kind of thing? Would you care to send some type of suggestions to that effect to the possible participants (since you have their emails already)? I would appreciate any help you could give to make this a memorable occasion.\" It looks like Dick Buchroeder, Steve Stayton, Earl Osborn, Terry Vacani, Jack Kelly, and Peter Abrahams will be traveling to the meeting. I assume that LA / SD locals including Mike Rifkin, Bob Bibb, Frank Doherty, Dick Martin will be there. Maybe central CA residents like Randy Dewees, Cory Suddarth, Arch Owens, Fan Tao can come. It would be wonderful if we could call on the experience of some of the more distant readers of this list: Kevin Kuhne, Bob Ariail, Bill Cook, Bill Beacom (too many names to list). I would like to hear from anyone with ideas on how to make such a gathering the most productive one possible. I won't forward all the responses to the list, but will summarize them. --Peter ====================================== Subject: Rangefinders From: \"linda\"\nAbout Large rangefinders, Mr. Brescia, Historian of U.S. Navy, wrote me that the four battleships of \"Iowa\" class still have their optical rangefinders. BB Massachusset,Alabama and Texas have their rangefinders too. Iowa class,Massachusset and Alabama have 8 meters long rangefinders in the director's stations while each main turret still have one 14 meters rangefinder. Giancarlo ============================= Subject: Binocular comparisons From: rab\nBernard Merems was my gracious host at his residence in Patagonia, AZ, Sunday night 9/12/99. The skies were dark, clear, and windless. I took almost everything I had with me, and Bernie set up a large conference- type table so that things were laid out side-by-side; plus my ikon 10x70X6.5 was on a Virgo Parallelogram tripod mount, while his Fujinon 10x70x5 FMTSX was set up on his tripod. Everything else was either hand-held, or twisted and turned on foam rubber on the table. Binoculars on hand were: l. EUG 80-deg inclined eyepiece, 10x80 binoculars (about 72-deg AFOV) 2. BLC 20-deg inclined eyepiece, 10x80 half-binocular(about 72-deg AFOV with othoscopic eyepiece, possibly aspheric; with distressed objective cement) 3. Nikko 15x80 with 60-deg AFOV 4. Orion 16x80 cheapo with about 50-deg AFOV 5. Bushnell Custom 10x50 with my corrective spectaclets (70-deg AFOV) 6. Swift 7x35 with my corrective spectacles(76-deg AFOV) 7. Pentax WP roof prism 8x42 with about 55-deg AFOV. Bernie and I sat in lawn chairs and observed from about 8PM to 9:30PM. The Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy were the main attractions. Subjectively, my opinions were: l. EUG, which is AR coated and thought to have an all-spherical Erfle eyepiece, was sharp over the central 2/3 field and then degrades rapidly. Long eyerelief and wide apparent field was stunning. 2. BLC, which I believe is not coated, appeared to have similiar eyerelief as the EUG, and somewhat sharper images than the EUG. 3. Nikko 15x80: too friggen heavy to hand-hold, and with its uncoated optics, not comparable to the Zeiss stuff. 4. Orion 16x80 cheapo. Small apparent FOV, negligible eyerelief. Cheap. Out of the league of everything else at the party. 5. Bushnell Custom 10x50 with my spectacle correctors, AR coated. These are remarkably sharp optics with some SA of the exit pupil, so that they have to be held in the 'right place'. Nice images of Milky Way, but field deteriorates more rapidly than the EUG/BLC. Even at my advanced age (58), my exit pupil is apparently big enough that the 5mm pupil of the Bushnell is smaller, because the brightness of the Milky Way is clearly brighter in the larger exit pupil binocs. 6.Swift Holiday Mark II 7x35 with huge AFOV, AR coated, are more impressive during the daytime than at night. To my way of thinking, 7X is too low a power for most things, including star gazing. The sharpness of these leaves a lot to be desired, although they are well-optimized for the very wide field, and SA of the pupil seems corrected too (unlike the Customs above). 7. Pentax roof prism binoculars, current production, waterproof model which is totally different than the non-waterproof version. Long eyerelief (can wear your glasses with these 8x42's), highly regarded by Birdwatching Magazine. Comparatively narrow AFOV. Too small for serious Milky Way or Andromeda viewing. 8. Fujinon FMTSX 10x70. Long eyerelief, supercoatings; but the small apparent FOV, around 50-deg (they are distortion-corrected) makes them unappealing to me. 9. Nikon 10x70 with 6.5-deg fov, made around 1978, were clearly a milestone in superb commercial binoculars. Excellent image, excellent pupil correction. Shortcoming is that its MgF coatings are not really up to the ghost problem, but the ghosts are not visible on these starfields. The wide-angle field is wonderful, but as usual, eyerelief is too short for me so I attached corrective spectaclets. Regards, Dick Buchroeder. =========================================== ============================================ Binocular List #76: 27 Sept. 1999. Airship binocular, Japanese glass, Meeting in L.A. Oct. 28. ========================================== Subject: Airship Binoculars From: Marc James Small\nThe US Navy purchased a fair number of Carl Zeiss Jena 7x, 50mm binoculars between the wars for use as deck glasses on ship-board. The US Navy also built a copy of a German Zeppelin (ZR-1, SHENANDOAH), obtained a second from the Zeppelin company (ZR-3, LOS ANGELES), and bought two more built by a Zeppelin-Goodyear compact (ZRS-4, AKRON, and ZRS-5, MACON). I have a picture of one of the officers of the German Zeppelin, LZ-127, GRAF ZEPPELIN I, using a Zeiss spotting scope from her bridge. Surely, the German crew who flew over ZR-3 from Germany used Zeiss glasses. I am asking whether anyone can identify what make and model of binoculars were used aboard the US Navy's four operational airships during their Navy careers. I have asked this question, to no avail, on the Airship List. The Navy also operated dozens of non-rigid airships but, as most of these were built and operated during the Second World War, I would presume American B&L glasses were used on these. Marc ================================= Subject: Japanese binoculars It's about time we started paying attention to Japanese binoculars, and not just top of the line Nikons. My contribution of the day is this, which I bet no one else knew: binocular in Japanese is sogankyo telescope in Japanese is boenkyo If you already knew.....why not write in something else you know. I got a copy of a 208 page Japanese magazine, 'Telescope & Binocular Catalogue 1999', the only English is brief picture captions. There are only about 25 pages of binoculars, almost all are models familiar in the US, though I notice a Nikon 18x70 WF and a Nikon 15x70 HP. Most of the rest of the magazine is full of photos of very exotic looking telescopes, amateur and professional. It wasn't cheap at $23.65, but if you want one (shipping extra, they take visa), it is ISSN 4805205946, title Boenkyo Sogankyo. Kinokuniya Bookstores, 503-641-6240, but their English is marginal. email portland@___niya.com or the national office kinokuniya@___niya.com --Peter ====================================== Subject: Meeting in L.A. Oct. 28. The meeting of binocular history enthusiasts in Los Angeles Oct. 28 & 29 seems to be progressing well. There is some question about whether the gun show will be happening; it appears that it will occur, possibly as a military collectors show. However, there will be a gathering regardless of the fate of the Great Western gun show; and in fact for myself, the meeting will be far better without the distraction of miles of aisles of blued steel. Steve Rohan has invited us at 4 PM Thurs. and also Friday afternoon, and the depth of his collection is a major reason that people are attending. The following people are more or less confirmed attendees: Terry Vacani, Steve Rohan, Steve Stayton, Dick Buchroeder, Jack Kelly, Peter Abrahams. Others who have expressed an intention are Earl Osborn, Helmut Moeller, Cory Suddarth, Frank Doherty. Presumed to be attending are Dick Martin, Mike Rifkin, Bob Bibb. There are of course people who are uncomfortable when giving a presentation, and they are invited anyway. But it would be a far better meeting if everyone who was capable of speaking, gave a short, informal talk. There will be an opaque projector that can project up to 10x14 inch pictures or text, a 35mm projector and a VHS player. This could be either an enjoyable time of comraderie; -- or it could be that and also a really productive & informative meeting where we all learned a lot about binoculars. We will have repairmen, engineers, wholesale / retailers, collectors -- people with a lot of experience. But you don't need to be an expert to give a short talk, just someone who knows something or has an unusual binocular. Presentations will likely include these: --Jack Kelly-- The Zeiss Teleater and the many variations on this theme. --Terry Vacani, Steve Rohan, and Frank Doherty -- Comparison of different Zeiss 8 x 60 models, discussion of the types of eyepieces used in various models & visual observation to discern differences in use. --Steve Stayton-- Tracing B & L serial numbers; The Pioneer MK42 binocular compared to MK41 and MK43 --Dick Buchroeder-- Image parasites and image ghosts; further aspects of evaluating optical quality --Peter Abrahams-- Binocular telescopes of the 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s. If I can prepare something on another, more recent, historical topic, I will do that instead. --Cory Suddarth-- Perspectives of a repairman. --We invite all participants to bring a few favorite binoculars to discuss. Please bring photocopies of any unusual paper you own. The two closests motels are located on Huntington Drive about one mile from Steve's. Days Inn 626 303 4544 and Comfort Inn 626 358 0430. Both are comfortable and have reasonable rates. So far, the Days Inn seems to be HQ. Please let me know if you will be attending, so that we know if crowding will be an issue and so that I have an idea of the resources that will be at hand. I'll send directions via e-mail. --Peter ====================================================== ============================================ Binocular List #77: 11 Oct. 1999. Zeiss-B & L, Oct. 28 meeting ============================================ Subject: Blimp glass From: Lngubas@___m Based on Nick Grossman's article based on the Asst. US Attorney General's book \"Cartels\" - Zeiss had underbid Bausch and Lomb by a significant sum to do the binoculars for the US military in the early 1930s. The Cartels book is on a lot of the posted book finders sites for about $10. The Zeppelins also carried Zeiss aerial cameras on a grand scale and had detailed maps of many of our military bases and shore batteries well before WWII. Larry ======= Larry is referring to an article in vol. 21, no. 1, Spring 99, Zeiss Historica; 'The Zeiss Cartel' by Nick Grossman. It is based on: Wendell Berge. Cartels: Challenge to the Free World. Washington D.C.: Public Affairs Press, 1944. The relationship between Zeiss and Bausch & Lomb is very complicated, and I am not familiar with the details. One of the most difficult aspects of trying to learn about it is the tenor of the writing of the period on this subject, which I would describe as being between highly opinionated and hysterical. An undated article from 'Liberty' magazine entitled 'Germany's Grip on America's Defense' is illustrated by an ominous swastika-bearing figure looming over an American factory. The chapter in 'Cartels' on this issue is full of details that certainly might be accurate, but it is clearly written (during WWII) in a very patriotic fervor and is very harsh on B & L. It is difficult to see this book as critical, analytical, even-handed, etc. Berge does make the very good point that foreign policy should not be made via the commercial dealings of private companies. B & L is charged with making an agreement with Zeiss regarding military optics without the approval of the US authorities, and at the time was trying to defend themselves against legal action and strong public opinion. Their publicity machine, which has always been long on fluff & short on substance, churned out paper in defense. It seems equally questionable as a reference. This is a very interesting sidelight in the history of the binocular, and I hope that someone can pursue the story further. --Peter =============================== Subject: Telescope maker's binocular From: \"Clive Milne\"\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Paris/Cafe/7068/20ned.jpg http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Cafe/7068/20top.jpg =============================== Subject: Plans for Oct. 28 Meeting A swap meet was proposed, and our host Steve Rohan indicated that the idea was workable. I put all my extra photocopies in a stack, and it is a pile 22 inches high. I will be giving these away, but the idea is that it will motivate people to make copies of the paper they have. In addition to the presentations listed in the last b-list, Dick Martin will talk on photographing binoculars, & documenting your collection using your computer. What we're trying to do: I got the following message from Steve Stayton. It shows what we might be able to accomplish in the future, with the cooperation of collectors, repairmen, and optical engineers. \"Spent most of Sunday taking apart one one of Steve Rohan's blc 10X80 (20 degree fold model) for Dick so he can reverse engineer the optical prescription. Should be interesting. A local optical shop (Phil Lam at Lam optics) will decement the lenses. The eyepiece in that binoc is a work of art, optical and mechanical. Cemented quadruplet field lens with radical curve on one side and cemented doublet eye lens. Very finely machined non-rotating (best kind!) diopter focus on the eyepiece assy. Machined parts that would be hard to get made today at any cost.\" ============================================== ================================================= Binocular List #78: 19 Oct. 1999. WWII Australia, Sans & Streiffe ================================ I found several excellent articles on the web about optical work in Australia during WWII. 'Optical instruments in Australia in the 1939-45 war: successes and lost opportunities': http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/papers/bolton2.htm 'Some themes in the development of optics in Australia': http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/papers/bolton1.htm#c7 'Optical Munitions': http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/papers/mellor.htm There is also an 'optical munitions exhibition', but it is arranged as a page by page tour & is rather slow to wade through: http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/omp/main/main.htm And for those interested, I've searched the web many times for 'binoculars', today I used a newer search engine called Google & it seems better than the others. http://www.google.com/ --Peter ============================================= Subject: Repair Jim Rose has left Captain's Nautical and established his own business in binocular, telescope, & instrument repair in Vancouver, Washington. 360-882-1853. Phone/Fax 360-882-1858. ====================================================== Subject: disassembly of Sans&Streiffe 7x35 binocular From: rab\nI have started the process of reverse engineering a 60's vintage commercial Japanese binocular, the Sans & Streiffe Model 910 \"Sightseer\", with 11-degree field of view.This one's a junker I got on eBay for peanuts. I suspect it is a 'crippled' version of an almost identical appearing S&S Model #999 \"Extra Wide Angle\", with 12.5 degree field of view. I purchased this one from Bob Mortimer, and it's in good condition. Model 910 has squarish pupils. Model 999 has round pupils, at least on axis.Model 999 has good pupil correction, and a bit more eyerelief than similar 11 to 12.5 degree 7x35's. I have a Sears model 6287 \"Super Wide Angle\" with 12.5 degree field, but it is a pale imitation, optically, of the S&S #999. The Sears has round pupils but inferior image correction. I think the only difference between Model 910 and 999 is that they used a smaller field stop (replaceable) and switched BK7 prisms for BAK4. Except for the reduced field, the behavior of the Model 910 is very similar in all respects to that of the 999. The eyepiece consists of 5 elements in 3 groups. That is, it has a plano- convex eyelens, a plano-convex doublet, and a double-convex field doublet. The construction is like that in the Nikko 10x70, but is not a direct scale copy. This same construction was found in the Bushnell Rangemaster 7x35. The objective is a cemented doublet, about 37mm diameter, with convex surfaces at both ends. Incidently, the MgF coatings on all lenses were very nicely done. The two RA prisms in the porro-type-I cluster are different in size and different in sculpting, but the ground faces are parallel rather than tapered, as they are in the Nikko 10x70. The Porro frame separates the two prisms, and has circular apertures front, middle, and end of the assembly...as in the Nikko. Good practice, but evidently not carried out perfectly since there are parasites in the complete binocular. The Nikko had slotted prisms, these S&S do not. The porro cluster can be tilt-adjusted: it has three pushing set screws, and three clamping screws. The objective is mounted in what looks like was originally intended to be a double eccentric cell. However, there are spanner holes in only one of the rings now, so perhaps collimation eventually ended up being done by just tilting the porro clusters. Or maybe I don't understand how they would have adjusted this particular double eccentric. The cell has experienced quite a bit of corrosion, which has seriously stained the prisms, and one of the prisms is chipped such that it would have to be replaced. I'm going to ask Phil Lam to separate all doublets and measure all components so we can figure out the optical prescription to run on ZEMAX. Pete has a 12.5-deg 7x35 similar to the Sans & Streiffe and speaks highly of it. Mortimer thinks its the best 7x35 he's ever used, and it appears to me to be a professionally-designed optic, as opposed to so many that are not. The WARDS 7x35 with 11-degree field is also on my list of things to disassemble, measure, and run on ZEMAX. Regards, Dick. =================================== ========================================================== Binocular List #79: 02 Nov. 1999. Parts, Warner & Swasey, Meeting in L.A. ========================================================== Subject: parts From: \"R.S. Terry\"\nIs there a place to look for the rubber boots(for lack of a better word)for Leitz 7x50 German WWII glasses. I have bought a mint pair with the rubber on the end of the eyepiece is gone. The front and middle armor rubber is flawless. I tried to buy a pair today so I could have two pair of binocs with 5 not 6 pcs of rubber but the price got to high for less than perfect glasses. Also: Do you know of the existence of eye cups(threaded) for Spencer binoculars. They are a bit larger and different from B & L. Thanks as usual, Bob Terry//pookiet@___ring.com// ================================== Subject: Warner & Swasey binocular From: \"John W. Briggs\"\nIn Volume 10 (1902), issue 6, page 281, of the old journal \"Popular Astronomy\", Worcester Reed Warner writes on \"The How and the Why of the Porro Prism Field- Glass.\" This nicely illustrated article was originally presented at the New York meeting (December 1901) of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and was published in Vol. 23 of their \"Transactions.\" John A. Brashear also comments in a discussion that is published as part of the article. The article sheds light on the earliest American Porro prism binoculars. As Warner implies in the article, the earliest were made by the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., in collaboration with Zeiss. The B&L design followed very closely that of Zeiss (and the Warner credits Zeiss as the first firm to \"[apply] the principle practically in bringing out a successful Porro prism field-glass....\" This was done under Dr. Abbe's management in 1895. (The earliest Zeiss \"field-glasses\" cost the equivalent of $40; Warner had bought one himself in Germany just after they became available.) By 1899, the Warner & Swasey company was manufacturing its own version of field- glasses, and that is what the article is mainly about. Clearly Warner was proud of this product. I've seen a number of Warner & Swasey binoculars in the collections of members of the Antique Telescope Society. Especially after having seen this old article, I hope to find my own pair sometime! --John W. Briggs. ===================================================== Subject: Meeting in L.A. From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com On Thursday, Oct. 28, a group of binocular collectors met at the home of Steve Rohan. Present were Steve Rohan, Terry & Anna Vacani, Steve Stayton, Dick Buchroeder, Jack Kelly, Peter Abrahams, Fan Tao, Dick Martin, Mark Norman, and Stu Johnson. We opened with a viewing session on a lawn overlooking the valley below, with a small swap meet, and the distribution of photocopies of manuals & catalogs. Peter Abrahams gave a talk on German military 8 x 60s, consisting of translated excerpts from Hans Seeger, Militaerische Fernglaeser und Fernrohre. This talk will be posted in the next list. Steve Rohan had a display of these 8 x 60s in chronological order, and discussed their evolution and the varieties of eyepieces used; a summary of this talk will also be posted. Jack Kelly displayed a variety of miniature binoculars, including a group of Zeiss Teleater models & similar by other makers. The basis for this talk can be found in Binocular List 72. Steve Rohan showed a video he made while visiting the military museum in Koblenz, Germany, which has a large number of optical instruments on display, including enormous devices not found elsewhere. There were several other talks that had been prepared, but we ran out of time. Of course, there was a wealth of experience in this group & there was much exchange of information. Terry Vacani is a repairman who is one of the most experienced with European binoculars, and was very helpful and informative. On Friday Oct. 29, some of the attendees returned to the Great Western show to search for binoculars. Ebay and other causes have greatly reduced the number of instruments found at this show. At the Great Western was an example of a very unusual binocular, the second one I've seen. Marked: US Navy, Bur. of Ord., NGF 1930, 6 x 30, Binocular, MK XI-2 No. 1074. Brass body, prism housing covers are cast aluminum, the upper covers are cut away in a sloped shoulder (like the Bushnell Rangemaster). It appears to be helical focus, though it was frozen. It was in very rough condition & offered at $650, so it went home with the dealer. The Mark XI appears in a WWII schedule of USN binoculars but is totally unlike any other & is a real mystery. Dick Buchroeder had arranged an interview with David Bushnell and I accompanied him to Laguna for this visit on Friday. We had a truly memorable visit with David & Nancy, a summary of which will be posted soon. On Friday afternoon, a small group met again at Steve Rohan's, for an informal comparison of some of the best modern binoculars, a discussion of various historical topics, and some plans for future meetings and the course that this group wishes to take. We decided to meet yearly, and move the meetings to the spring. For now, the meetings will be linked with the Great Western. We also plan to meet in San Diego (Deutsche Optik, Frank Doherty, Bob Bibb, Brian Osterberg at Baker Marine), possibly Portland (Jack Kelly, Peter Abrahams, and Leupold & Stevens, the only remaining binocular manufacturer in the U.S., assembled in Oregon using imported optics), and the east coast. Saturday found a group of four survivors: Jack Kelly, Peter Abrahams, Steve Stayton, and Fan Tao. We stopped by the Great Western in the vain hope that some new glass had appeared, and to inspect the 25-40 x 100s that Earl Osborn is marketing. I had a productive conversation with Mike Rifkin, who offered use of the Deutsche Optik facilities and resources. We then drove to San Diego to visit Frank Doherty and inspect his collection of binoculars. Frank loaned us some photocopies of military publications that will be useful references. Steve Stayton borrowed an original copy of Navord 436, Optical Quality Studies of Instruments of Naval Interest, 1948, which he plans to reprint as the first publication of our binocular group. At Frank's, we viewed through the Zeiss 25x100 from WWII, with a field of about 80 degrees, a very fine image that was rather soft about halfway to the edge. Steve Stayton explained how the complex interpupillary adjustment worked, which he deduced from inspection of the 12 x 60 that is similar. The objective is fixed, and eyepieces and Schmidt prisms are moved by a lever arm mounted on a cam. The eyepieces need to travel twice as far as the roof prism, due to the 'optical trombone' effect of moving a prism: the light path is doubled in the prism assembly, so moving the prism increases the optical path by twice the movement of the prism. This version of the explanation is mine, which is why it makes little sense. Saturday evening, the four of us drove to an ocean vista to use the Leica 7x 42, Nikon 10 x 42 SE, and Nikon 8 x 30 SE to view the sights as the sun set, remaining visible for several minutes after it dipped below the horizon, ending in a double lens shaped, bright green light. We need to discuss the name of this group. Steve Stayton's plans to reprint 436 with a byline of our group means that the name needs to be decided. We have used a variety of phrases that resemble 'Binocular Collectors'. I am not sure that this is the best name, but I am only placing my opinion on the list & am only one vote. Here are my reasons: 1. I am active in the Antique Telescope Society, and it very frequently happens that we need to explain that we are not a bunch of brass polishers or furniture dealers. If the Binocular Collectors were to approach a museum or military office, I'm not sure that 'collectors' would be the best name. 2. Security of collections from theft, naming a group 'collectors' is advertising the collections. 3. I believe this group has the potential to grow tremendously (not that I necessarily think that would be a good thing); for example the Leica groups are very large even though very few people ever owned Leicas, and huge numbers of people owned binoculars from their early days. We certainly want to encourage input from non-collectors. My feeling is that 'collectors' isn't the best name for a large group. A few of us discussed this issue, and thought that the name should include 'binocular' and 'history'. Should it be a club, association, society, group, or some other term? The best we could come up with is 'Binocular History Association', though that does sound rather dry. ================================================================== ================================================================== Binocular List #80: 08 Nov. 1999. Dessicant, group name, German 8 x 60s ==================================================== Subject: dessicant From: \"Norman Paradis, MD\"\nI recently purchased a Japanese battleship binocular and have been wondering about appropriate maintenance. Specifically the issue of the desiccator cartridges. Should these be refilled? I am about to move to Denver, so the binocular will be living in a relatively dry environment. Norman Paradis, MD ----------------- I have an uninformed opinion of dessicants, that they are a mixed blessing. No doubt they are effective over months. But once they get saturated, does the water stay locked in the grains, or are they a permanent repository of moisture in the optical system? --Peter ========================================= Subject: Naming the group In the past week, we've gotten two suggestions for naming a group of people who have in common an interest in old binoculars: Optical Historians Society Binocular Historians Club These could be combined into: Binocular Historians Society I agree that the name should include 'Binocular'. So it could be historians or history; and could be society or other. Or a completely different name. - -Peter =========================================== Subject: German military 8 x 60 binoculars From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com Here are some relevant excerpts from Hans Seeger, Militaerische Fernglaeser und Fernrohre, Chapter 4, translated by Ilse Roberts and Peter Abrahams. Seeger retains publication rights for this book. A Goerz 8 x 60 for the German Air Force is mentioned in a 1921 publication by G. Gehlhoff, \"Die Ursachen der Verbesserung des Nachtsehens durch Fernglaeser\", Zeitschrift fuer technische Physik, No. 9, p245-250. Seeger has no further references for this WWI glass, no photos, and it is unknown what prism it used. [p290] Leitz produced Porro II binoculars since 1910, and an 8 x 60 Porro II [fig. 200] from about 1944-45 for the Navy, designated for use on motor torpedo boats and patrol vessels, with a reticle with a sighting line, crossed by a short horizontal line, for aiming or torpedo sighting mechanisms, which was partially coated, & inferior to the 8 x 60 Zeiss. The optics of these Leitz models are prone to hazing, caused by the porous cast housing, which can be waterproofed in repair, and was probably due to inferior materials available for manufacture during wartime. [p295] The 8 x 60 was one of the first Zeiss military Porro II glasses, [fig. 203], circa 1919-20. The early design had an ocular with a smaller eye lens and a negative meniscus, & was probably used for anti aircraft purposes, but most of the surviving examples have naval markings. This glass is seen in military papers from the thirties [fig. 137] and in photos showing hand held use, from the second World War [fig. 204]. [p298] Seeger transcribes an undated paper, circa 1930, on the Zeiss 8 x 60 in fig. 203 (right): \u0093The binocular 8 x 60 is definitely a night glass, mainly designed for searching and tracking airplanes.....The model in the following picture is a special edition of the 8 x 60 binocular, delivered upon request, which is specially designed for the Navy and contains the following changes: Interocular distance: is adjustable by a device in a special partition under the right ocular. Tinted glasses: For protection against blinding and for increasing the contrast of light, several colored glasses are built in, which can be positioned in front of the right ocular with a lever. Head rest: Made of soft rubber, facilitates lengthy observing. Sight: A ring sight is mounted over the field glass. Special devices: detachable sunshades with covers are mounted in front of the objectives.\u0094 This text describes the first Zeiss Navy 8 x 60, in fig. 203 the ring sight is missing and a gunsight is fastened on top of the bridge, that model is older than described in the brochure. This design was at first only available by request, but became the standard construction from the mid 30s, and is described in the \u0091Spezialprospekt\u0092 of 1939 (with the same picture): \u0093Special: the 8 x 60 binocular, which is mostly used by the Navy, is decidedly a night glass and mainly has the purpose of searching for and pursuing objects and airplanes in the night.\u0094 During the thirties, the Zeiss 8 x 60 added a rubber head rest, and glass filters, the filter levers are coupled by a horizontal lever in earlier models, and in later models they are independently moveable. The interocular can be adjusted by a screw in some examples. Some models have a mounted ring sight (cross and concentric rings), [fig. 204, 205a]. A later standard accessory was the removable sunshades with covers, see fig. 205b. These were sometimes mounted on torpedo sights. Fig. 205b was exported to Scandinavia & is different from the models used by the German Navy. [p299] These deck mounted 8 x 60s were made with the \u0091blue-coating\u0092 or T- coating\u0092 from an early date, & most of the surviving specimens are coated, those built before coating was introduced in 1936-37 were coated during WWII. Zeiss H models: [p311] The construction of Porro II prism glasses with a field lens cemented onto the prism began in Great Britain and was then adopted by Zeiss for a 7 x 50 and the 8 x 60 H. Both were probably also used in the Army, but the only photos that Seeger has seen of wartime use show them on board warships. The D.F. 8 x 60 H [fig. 215] probably shows the first design, with a first series of 20 made of Elektron alloy built after September 1935, with objective tubes that have a conical form from the prism housing to the objective, distinct from later models [fig. 216] that have a cylindrical housing for the objective. The \u0091H\u0092 in 8 x 60 H stands for Helligkeit [image brightness], since cementing permits each side to have only three optical groups. [p312] Field of view is 154m/1000m, 8.8 degrees real field, and 70.6 degrees apparent field. Some of these 8 x 60s had rubber eye shields with ventilation holes, permanently attached with a metal ring that allows them to rotate. From a Zeiss brochure for military models including the 8 x 60 H, in the section \u0091focus\u0092: \u0093The binoculars can also be delivered with a center drive for the simultaneous focusing of both oculars.....Only deliverable upon request.\u0094 Seeger thinks it unlikely that a center focus 8 x 60 H was actually produced, or that this expensive model was actually retailed before the second World War. The 7 x 50 Septar and Septarem were very short lived. [p314] Some 8 x 60 H models had illuminated reticles. Since the reticle is cemented to the prism, between prism and the field lens, the illumination device is mounted to the prism housing at that point [fig. 216]. [p316] In about 1939, the 8 x 60 H was retired, and replaced with a D.F. 8 x 60 of similar appearance but different optical design. The field lens was not cemented to the prism, but was placed back in the ocular, which allowed the reticle to be placed in the ocular tube, closer to the illuminator mounted outside the tube [fig. 217]. However, few of these 8 x 60 models actually have illuminated reticles. These models are a little heavier than the \u0093H\u0094, about 2200 grams and 1875 grams in the brochures, but when actually weighed, the weight for the H model is 2500 grams [left fig. 215], 2100 grams [right fig. 215], and 2100, 2250, 2300 and 2450 grams for their successors. The differences are the result of the use of different combinations of materials (Hydronalium, Elektron, Brass). Zeiss brochures for military binoculars circa 1937-40 list two weights: \u0093normal\u0094 and \u0093light\u0094. A 1939 ad about this model: \u0093Binocular 8 x 60 (with special ocular for use with gas masks, with night illumination)....can either be used hand held, on a tripod or also as a direction finder telescope for night time air defense, for example in co- operation with sound locators as a direction finder for searchlights, for command instruments, etc. The use of a gas mask is possible after removing the soft rubber eye shields.\u0094 These later 8 x 60s have remarkable image brightness and resolution; and also something special, which is very hard to describe and is seldom found apart from marine binoculars: a pleasing, wide and steady image which makes the observation a pleasure and an event. Such a glass gives impressions and images which remain in the inner eye of the observer for many years, like a photograph. There are several versions of these 8 x 60s [fig. 217]. Some eyeshields are of ventilated soft rubber; hard rubber or bakelite eye shields have an accessory bakelite cover, held by a rubber band. Most of these covers have a roughed up area with the inscription \u0093Benutzer\u0094 [user], the name of the user & his individual focus settings could be written in this area [fig. 257]. Rare models have an illuminated reticle in the right ocular. More common is a reticle with a perpendicular sighting line, used in air defense, torpedo shooting, or Kommando devices. Many wartime photos show them used on submarines, torpedo boats and larger warships. It is sometimes heard that the 8 x 60 models which have \u0093M.S.S.\u0094 markings have a different ocular with a larger eye lens, but this is not correct. All 8 x 60 Porro II models (of the type known as \u0093Slim One\u0094) have identical oculars, similar to fig. 162 In the Museum of Optics in Jena, from the postwar production of VEB Zeiss Jena, are parts from a Porro II prism system that resemble the 8 x 60 in fig. 217 as it was built until the end of the war. It seems that after the war, similar binoculars were produced in Jena for the Navies of the GDR or the Warsaw pact, since civilian models with these prisms were not produced either in Jena or Eisfeld. [p317] Comparing the image of the 8 x 60 H with the later 8 x 60 Porro IIs, where the field lens is not longer cemented onto the prism, reveals two differences. The H model has more pincushion distortion, which gives the image in the H model a steady quality, while the same image seems to \u0091roll off a spherical surface\u0092 in the other glass. This effect is called \u0093Bildverbiegung\u0094 [\u0091image bending\u0092 or distortion], not to be confused with \u0093Bildfeldwoelbung\u0094 [field curvature]. In the third edition of Koenig & Koehler, Die Fernrohre und Entfernungsmesser, 1959, p121, Koehler writes: \u0093Image bending [distortion] is by far the most disturbing fault with subjects which are suitable objects for observation with hand held binoculars\u0094 (because objects in the center of the image appear to be closer, but become smaller as they move towards the rim when moving the glass, whereby the whole image loses steadiness). This was almost certainly known to the designers of these two models, though no indications to that effect have been found in the literature. [p320] It can be assumed that for marine glasses a diminished pincushion distortion was chosen, while accepting a small amount of bending of the image. For marine use, it seems to make sense to use glasses with little or no distortion, because here the bending of the horizon line, caused by a swaying stance, is quite unnatural.

Dessicant, Sales, Zeiss repair =============================================== Subject: Dessicant From: Cory Suddarth\nUS Navy OM3&2 tells just when and how to maintain the dessicant of an optical system. Cory === From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nI presume the desiccant referred to is 'silica gel'. If so it is the same as used in photographic applications. It's function is to absorb moisture from the atmosphere. I am used to seeing it in two forms, crystals that stay one colour, usually pink or white. And the same colours but with an indicator crystal mixed through. Usually blue crystals that turn pink as moisture is absorbed. Both types can be re-activated by drying. The easiest way would be to spread the crystals on a metal tray and place in a warm-hot oven for a while. With the indicator crystals, until they turn back to blue. The silica gel does not wear out, only becomes saturated and unable to absorb more moisture. It is possible to buy it here in loose form and pack into either bags or perforated containers. No matter how clean the desicant may be to start with there will be some dust, chips, etc that will appear. I would suggest using/making small bags, using the finest weave material available to act as a filter, but to be porous to moisture. If a cotton material is used the bags can be put in the oven to dry out the silica gel, provided it is not too hot so as to burn the material. Rod. === From: \"Eastman, Jack F\"\nThe stuff is most likely silica-gel, it looks like pink crystals. We used to heat the stuff in the oven, one of the guys out here recommends ~125F, until the crystals turn blue, then they are ready for use. I think the H2O is locked in, but when the crystals are full, (pink) they won't work anymore until they are baked out. When I was a kid, my dad seemed to get lots of that stuff, and we lived in California, where there was humidity and had fun watching it turn color. Makes sort of a humidity meter. If what you have is not silica-gel, then ignore the preceding, and I'll plead ignorance. === To replenish or not depends on the climate where you are, the metal used in the binocular, and on whether you will be renewing the dessicant over time. I personally inspect & remove dessicant; I live in a very damp area but not salt air and do not renew dessicant regularly; but really I can't support my actions, they're just a guess. --Peter Abrahams ===================================== Subject: For Sale From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com Wild 6 x 32, mfg. for Iraq in 1980s, field of view of about 12 degrees, objectives on extensions about 6 inches up from prisms. These were made for Iraq in the 1980s & sold to them for over $10,000. Outstanding optics with extremely wide field. $900. + shipping, will consider offers. Image at: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/wild6x42.gif Also for sale: Brass binocular twin telescope, amateur built, lens erecting system, each tube has similar construction to that shown in books from Edmund Scientific on making your own telescope, but looks pre WWII. 47mm clear aperture, about 650mm focal length, estimated magnification about 15 power. Each tube supported in a copper harness, held in a brass frame. One tube has three screws to adjust collimation, one of these screws is bent but functions. No adjustment for interpupillary distance but it works for people with between about 60 and 70mm interpupillary distances, I am a little under 60mm IPD & it works, upper limit is an estimate. Optics very good, sharp & wide field for a lens erecting system, collimation works very well. Lenses are secure but not held in place with threaded cells but pressed into place & secured with tubing of some hard pressboard or cardboard (as illustrated in Edmund books). When I bought it, it had been dropped in shipment & one lens had slipped slightly out of place, this was easily fixed. Purchased on ebay from North Carolina in early 1999 for about $180, I had to see how it was constructed & now I need to clear the shelf space. My price $150 / offer + shipping. Image at: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/atmbinoc.gif ========================================================= Subject: Zeiss repair From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com A few months ago, I discussed my Zeiss 15 x 60, circa 1960, with yellowed eyepieces. I called the 'official' U.S. Zeiss repair shop: Carl Zeiss Optical, 13017 N. Kingston Ave., Chester, VA, 23836. Catherine Bishop answers the phone in repair, 800-338-2984, ext. 5818. She relayed an answer from the repairman, that they had parts for many of the 15 x 60s, but there had been many modifications over time, and they couldn't be certain if they had parts for this one or if they could repair it. I never did get an answer about whether it was the glass or the cement that yellows, in spite of repeatedly asking over two phone calls. I sent them the binocular, in a large, sturdy box lined with thick upholstery foam; and was told to wait for an estimate. Instead, I received the binoculars via UPS, shipped in a much thinner box in which the binocular case barely fit across the diagonal, packed in 'peanuts' (completely inadequate packing). They were fixed, the glass is clear, and the invoice reads 'repaired under warranty'. It also reads 'labor 1/4 hour', and these oculars have thin rubber sleeves as seals, so I cannot imagine the job taking 15 minutes but perhaps that's just bookkeeping. There are streaks of cleaning fluid across both prism faces opposite the objectives, and one prism face shows a swirl of a half dozen very fine scratches. These streaks & scratches are only visible when shining a flashlight through the objective, and are not a major defect, but they certainly were not there when I sent it in. Furthermore, when I mailed it, the objective tubes could be unscrewed from the body; but they now are apparently joined with sealant, and I cannot remove them to clean the streaks or inspect the scratches (which just might not be scratches, but might clean off). Overall, I am certainly grateful for their warranty support, and I don't want to ship it back to Virginia for a cleaning. I've been told that Zeiss refuses to supply parts to any other repair shop, and so in the U.S., it is this shop or nothing. --Peter ================================================== ================================================ Binocular List #82: 13 Nov 1999. 3 Mystery Binoculars, Heinrich Erfle ================================================= Subject: Mystery 1: B & L binocular There are two known examples of an early Bausch & Lomb Porro I, center focus, 8x binocular, 18mm in aperture. The objectives are have the same spacing as the eyepieces, as was common from 1894 to 1908 to avoid infringement of the Zeiss patent of 1894. B & L had a license from Zeiss to manufacture binoculars of the Zeiss pattern. There is literature from B & L that states that they began making binoculars under license from Zeiss, so if this glass predates the agreement, it was overlooked by B & L catalog writers. It is possible that it was an import. Country of origin might be settled by details of construction. The eyecups and center focus parts resemble B & L. The brass prism housing covers are flat & extend past the housing to form slots for the strap; this feature is seen in Ross binoculars. Marked: Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. Rochester N.Y. (gothic script) All metal parts including prism cover plates are brass except prism housings which are light metal (probably aluminum), Leather covered housings. Serial numbers of the two examples are 4429, and 7770, marked on hinge axis cover disc, across from IPD settings marked 1 to 5. Here are seven images of Steve Stayton's example, some views are the same but the larger files are sharper images: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b&l`8`x1.jpg from above (plan), 116kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b&l`8`x2.jpg from above eyepiece, 193kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b&l`8`x3.jpg profile from side, right diag., 121kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b&l`8`x4.jpg from objective, 101kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc1.jpg from upper R, 59kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc2.jpg from above (plan), 70kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc3.jpg from obj., 66kb This is my example, with the prism housing cover removed. I'm asking those who have disassembled early binoculars to take a look & see if the construction seems similar to any particular manufacturer or nation of origin: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b-lopen.gif This binocular appears in no known B & L literature, and is quite unlike other B & L models. Any information would be greatly appreciated. --Peter ======================================= Subject: Mystery 2: Giant Japanese binocular Chabot Observatory in Oakland, Calif. owns a very large Japanese WWII binocular. It is about 6 feet long, double oculars on turret. Yes, people have tried to buy it; no, it is not for sale. Has anyone seen anything like this? http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binchabt.gif ======================================== Subject: Mystery 3: The Joico 6 x 42 A very interesting binocular is shown in these images: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/6x42~cz.jpg http://www.europa.com/~telscope/6x42~cz2.jpg This binocular was sold on ebay at this sale: http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewItem&item=180208506 It is stamped 'Joico', 6x42, 60 degree; and there are other characters that are scratched into the housing cover. Joico has no known meaning. It has a wide angle eyepiece, and shows some signs of being a German binocular, possibly as early as 1914. This was partially deduced from the case, which seems to match the binocular, and has details identical to Zeiss cases that appear in the 1914 catalog (page 44), but not the 1920 catalog. (The strap has a loop on each end, the loop passes through a D ring, crimped onto a shield riveted & sewn to the case. The shield is pointed at the bottom, like 5 sided pentagon with one side elongated, about 2 inches long by 1.25 inches, and the D ring spans .75 inch. The later strap, 1920 or before, has no loop but continues to a button on the case). Also, the large knob to lock the hinge axis looks like knobs found on a Goerz binocular of this vintage, and materials and 'feel' might indicate this era & country. There is another known example of this binocular, similar markings (but with 854 stamped in 3 places), and identical construction except there is one eyecup present, which is identical to that used on a Zeiss Binoctar from 1915. The ebay example has a groove for a rubber eyecup, but otherwise the eyepieces are identical. If this dating is correct, we have a wide angle binocular that predates the introduction of the first Erfle. At the present time, it is unknown if this eyepiece is an erfle type. It is possible that the Treaty of Versailles (in German the term literally translates as the Dictate of Versailles), which banned export of any military equipment by Germany but left Germany in desperate need of currency, forced Germans to take military equipment & re-label it to enable it to pass for civilian products. ========================================================= Subject: Heinrich Erfle From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com Erfle was a very important designer who is surprisingly obscure at this date. I have searched the standard telescope references, many optics books, Zeiss histories (Schomerus, Auerbach, Hermann), and German texts (Riekher, Koenig / Koehler, E.H. Schmitz). However, I can find only brief paragraphs on Erfle, and have found only a few words that precisely dates the introduction of the first Erfle eyepiece (he did apparently introduce several versions); Auerbach (1925) notes that Erfle invented the 70 degree eyepiece in 1917, and it was introduced in 1920. Schmitz has an informative paragraph and a portrait, but nothing on the eyepiece. Here is most of what I have found: http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/c_a_plicht/NAMES.HTM Heinrich Valentin Erfle was born on 11th April 1884 in Duerkheim, Germany. His father was Heinrich Johann Erfle (1848 - 1896), his mother Marie Erfle, nee Stolleis (1849 - 1923). H.V. Erfle married Ilse Rittner 1914 in Koenigshuette. They had a son and a daughter. Erfles studies in Munich were finished with his doctoral thesis, dated 1st August 1907. He worked with the optical shop of Steinheil & Soehne until 1909, when he moved to Jena for the Carl Zeiss firm there. In that company he joined the telescope departement. He was promoted head of this departement in 1918 and his work improved the performance of the various optics then manufactured, mainly for military use. His published papers were on prisms and on algebraic formulae, but he also tried to broaden the knowledge of optics for all interested. His last work was mainly as a co-editor on the third edition of the 'Grundzuege der Theorie der optischen Instrumente', (Basics of the theory of optical instruments) published in 1924. Today the name Erfle is well known to amateur astronomers for the wide field eyepiece he constructed. Erfle died 8th April 1923 in Jena. by Chris Plicht 100277.1136@___erve.com ----------- Seeger, Feldstecher: Fernglaser im Wandel der Zeit. (excerpts) p74: In 1921-1922, an argument arose in the 'Central Paper for Optics & Mechanics' about the priority of the first wide angle glass. In November, 1921, Erfle introduced his new development. Leitz then announced that Leitz was \u0093the first, before all others, to create a practical, really useable ocular or binocular.\u0094 This caused Erfle to reply, \u0093that the contribution...neither completed nor corrected the real history of the ocular.\u0094 At Goerz, von Hofe immediately spoke out, \u0093According to my notes at the time, only the Firm of Goerz made a field glass with 70 degrees for the first time\u0094 He pointed to his own 8 x 56 field glass with a FOV of 150m/1000m, similar in appearance to the Delactis, but with an imposing weight of 3500 grams. Erfle then wrote that in 1917, Zeiss already had an 8 x 60 field glass with an 8 3/4 degree FOV in production. After another word from Goerz, Erfle ended the succession of memos and articles with the statement: \u0093Besides, now even Dr. von Hofe admits at least by his silence, that Zeiss is the first firm who manufactured wide-angle field glasses for handheld use.\u0094 p98: In 1917, Heinrich Erfle at Zeiss, with Albert Konig, made a wide field ocular. After the end of WWI, 3 civilian glasses were introduced at about the same time, that set new standards for FOV: the Deltrentis 8 x 30, the Delactis 8 x 40, and a little later the Delturis 8 x 24, all with a FOV of 154m/1000m. ------ Hans Seeger, Militaerische Fernglaeser und Fernrohre, includes the following references that might provide some answers: Erfle, H.

Yes, have worked on a pair just like them. This is the smaller model of the 250 m.m. Nikko, (see photos in my chapter in the Seeger book). This is the 200 m.m. model with dual magnifications. You will notice that the trunnion assemblies are the same. Have never seen one with the aiming telescope however. Condition looks to be as new, unless they have been restored. The 250 m.m. originally had a dual magnification turret also but for some unknown reason it was converted to single. Following information pertains to the three largest binoculars maunfactured by NIKKO for the war effort. Also enclosed is an image, (although not a quality one), of the 250 m.m. tripod mounted. The 200 m.m. was tripod mounted also. Both the 20 c.m. and 25 c.m. binoculars were used for artillery spotting and for forward observation. I would like to know the serial number of the 20 c.m. pictured if you dont mind. All three binoculars described below utilize a triplet obective of the Cook-Taylor type. I have never seen an instrument of this size of Japanese manufactured with coated optics. 180 m.m. Nikko dual magnification. 22.5X - 2.4 degrees 30X - 2.0 degrees ------------------------------------------------------------------ 200 m.m. Nikko dual magnification 25X - 1.22 degrees 80X .45 degrees ----------------------------------------------------------------- 250 m.m. Nikko dual magnification 50X - 1.12 degrees 83X - .44 degrees I hope this has been of some help. Any more questions from you or from the folks at the observatory are always welcome. Do they plan to use this instrument??? Best regards, Kevin K. Kuhne ======= This binocular is at Chabot observatory outside Oakland, Calif; which has almost completed construction of a new facility. They told me this summer that they do plan to mount the binocular on their hilltop site for terrestrial viewing, but I gathered that it isn't a priority. I mailed a request for details, but have heard nothing yet. --Peter ======================================================= Subject: Where's that web site From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com I have heard from two people who are unable to download the images & text at my web server. Others have been successful. I would like to hear from all those who have failed. I am currently unable to deduce the source of the problem. Incredibly enough, there is still no web site on the history of binoculars. The first person to create a site and get it linked to relevant sites & indexed on search engines, will get a lot of traffic and probably a lot of offers of glass for sale. Let's just hope that the first site is good enough that it deserves the attention it will get. Meantime, there are a bunch of files & images available at my internet server: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list.txt lists # 1-50, 435kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list50.txt lists 50-72, 200kb http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binohist.txt a brief history of binoculars to 1900 http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binotest.txt using & testing binoculars for astronomy http://www.europa.com/~telscope/civwarmd.jpg I can't remember what this & the next are, probably from ebay, described as a 'civil war model'. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/civwarmk.jpg http://www.europa.com/~telscope/monoclr1.jpg This & the next 3 are a monocular, probably a replica circa 1890 by Secretan of the Hofmann model from the 1850s. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/monoclr2.jpg http://www.europa.com/~telscope/monoclr3.jpg http://www.europa.com/~telscope/monoclr4.jpg http://www.europa.com/~telscope/stoker1.xls The list of WWII era Army & Navy binoculars put together by Jim Stoker, updated & converted to Excel by Dick Martin; posted with the idea that the collective wisdom of the list could provide updates. =================================================== Subject: Proper grease for binoculars From: Randy Dewees\n....The cause of the yellow tint: I'm sure all Zeiss did was clean the outgassed oil from all the optical surfaces. This brings up another discussion thread - instrument greases. I imagine greases are far better now than those of 40 years ago. I've been playing around with American and German binocular microscopes and the prisms are usually coated with outgassed oil. This adds a mellow brown tint to the image but the contrast is still pretty good. Cleaning all the prism surfaces produces much whiter images that are at least twice as bright. I get the feeling that cleaning these prisms is not part of a typical service routine. So, I suppose sales brochures are a place to start. I've read some basic reference material on lubricants but nothing specifically on instrument grease. I know from experience that modern greases can have the proper viscosity yet be too slippery. I can touch base with Max Erb Instruments on the microscope side of things and maybe the OM's have some history on this subject (mil-specs?). Randy Dewees ------ I've got some 'Nyogel' greases that are 'low slip' or something like that, they work very well but are not sold in small quantities. For a binocular, important qualities would be: no solvent or other substance to outgas; proper viscosity (no creep from gravity, releases parts into motion when force applied but stiff when parts are moving); stable under temperature range encountered. OM 3 & 2 (1966) says only, 'apply approved lubricants', 'apply eyepiece grease'; OM 3 & 2 (1989) is a little more helpful but still describes the lubricants only as 'Navy approved'. --Peter ================================================= Subject: Re: Zeiss repair From: \"Bill Cook\"\nI am sorry to hear about the problems you had in getting your Zeiss repaired. I have never been pleased with the idea that getting parts from them is sporadic at best. But, in all other ways they have been GREAT and easy to work with. As far as the scratches and smears go, I will only say the following. Their REAL OM (Warren Nuckles) retired ~ 5 years ago - after 25 years - and new OMs do not grow on trees. Perhaps it is my misplaced pride in the brotherhood, but I just don't think many others have the concern for detail that dedicated Navy OMs do. As Earl would say, \"Tolerances are for those who can't get it right.\" Just a thought, Bill Cook, OMC-USNR-Ret. Mgr. Precision Instruments & Optics, Captain's, Seattle editor / publisher, Amateur Telescope Making Journal ======================================================= Subject: Materials & tools From: \"John S. Platt\"\nI hope the following may be of use to you all but on the other hand you may already be streets ahead of me. I have found a cleaner for the exterior of modern binoculars which works a treat especially on rubber coatings. \"Armor All\" is made by \"The Armor All Products Company\" of Oakland, CA 94612 for cleaning car dashboards. It removes all stains, muck, grease and leaves the binocular sparkling clean and leaves no residue that I can observe. The second useful item is a small tool called the \"Baby Boa Constrictor\". It is a tool for removing oil filters, jam jars lids etc . It is small rubber implement for removing stiff rotating objects and used extensively by people with weak hands. It is made of rubber fits anything from 1/2 inch across up to about 6 inches. It is ideal for dismantling or reassembling binoculars. Made of rubber, it leaves the barrels unmarked and only costs about \u00a35-00, much cheaper than optical wrenches. I hope that is of use to one and all. Best wishes from a very cold and wet UK. John. ==== From: \"Bill McCotter\"\nPeter, A number of the group members have asked me about the homemade diopter ring tool I mentioned in a earlier letter. Let them know I will send directions and images in a few weeks. Eastern North Carolina was flooded after Hurricane Dennis with up to 20 feet of water. We are rebuilding and I am moving to a new home. After that, I will be on the net more often. I have 18 boxes of binocular stuff...where did it all come from? Also, several members have asked for the address for Zack White Leather Company. They are located at 1515 Main Street, Ramseur, NC 27316, 336-824-4488.(nice folks that can help with any manner of leather questions/supplies) Bill McCotter ========================================= Subject: Erfle. From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com A few more clues on Erfle: Schmitz, E.H. Handbuch zur Geschichte der Optik. Bonn: 1984. vol. 4A, p341. Erfle born 11 April 1884, Duerkheim. Studied in Munich, high school & university, to doctorate in technical science. Worked for C.A. Steinheil & Sons. 1908, moved to Zeiss, telescope department, also in binoculars, during WWI in submarine periscopes & variable magnification telescopes for ship guns. At war's end, he was director of the telescope works, and worked on hunter's rifle sights, and improvement of field of view in binoculars. Erfle died suddenly & unexpectedly 8 April 1923 of blood poisoning. -------- From: Lngubas@___m I have only a few references to Erfle. I got this from an audio tape of memories from Max Hertzberg who worked for Straubel in the 1920s and who talked about the way Erfle died from blood poisoning from an accidental jabbing from a fountain pen. Dr. Heinrich Erfle [1884-1923]: A very enterprising and brilliant optical designer who, among other contributions, developed the first successful wide angle binocular eyepieces that appeared on the Zeiss breakthrough instruments after the First World War and was a major contributor to the firms writings on optics. While still in his prime, he accidentally stabbed himself with a fountain pen and died soon after as a result of blood poisoning in connection with this injury. Dr. Straubel was very careful to prepare his patent applications that were in progress with benefit to his estate and family. ================================================ Subject: German military 8 x 60 binoculars At the LA meeting on Oct. 28, Steve Rohan displayed a sequence of Zeiss 8 x 60 binoculars, circa 1920 to 1950. Below is a synopsis of his presentation, noting that this information is preliminary and should be used as a general guideline, not scripture. ------------- --\"Deck Mounted\", Porro II, 8 x 60 binoculars by Carl Zeiss. --Serial numbers 900,000 - 1,200,000. Small, 4 element eyepiece. 1919-1920, possible use during WWI. --S.N. 1,250 - 1,300,000. Larger eyepiece. --S.N. 1,400,000 - 1,900,000. Eyepiece is a 6 element Erfle, of 3 cemented doublets, no aspheric element, 34mm in diameter; the same eyepiece used in the 80 degree 10 x 80. This Erfle, matched with the objective & prisms as a system, delivers outstanding performance, about 75-80 degrees apparent field. --1,900,000 - 1,950,000. Large diameter eyepiece, ?(6 element, 3 group), binoculars marked 'blc'. --1,950,000 - 2,050,000. Zeiss built, under contract. --U boat binos. Zeiss made blc coded binos (as represented in collections) were not in the standard series of serial numbers. They start around 42xxxx. cxn made ones are basically the same binocular but with minor modifications in the way the prisms are mounted to the body. The serial range also is not in sequence with the blc made ones and the serial range for cxn I have seen is in the 425xxx to 426xxx range. --Leitz (beh) 8 x 60. 6 element eyepiece in 3 groups. Telephoto lens objective. Very wide field but optics not as good as other makers, especially contrast. Outgassing causes hazing of optics in all examples. --Zeiss 8 x 60 H, early model 1935-1939, tapered tubes with no 'step'. 3 lens eyepiece, 2 in the top group, 1 glued onto the prism (cemented field lens). Later model with 'step' in objective tube (a small cylinder at the end of the tapered tube at the objective), same eyepiece. --Zeiss 'blc' MSS (possibly German language 'Marine Signal Station'): aspheric eye lens, 3 lenses in second group; an orthoscopic with an apheric singlet and triplet field lens. --Lightweight model, alloy, prism housing cover overlaps edge of housing, circa 1940-41, serial numbers under 2,000,000. --U-boat 'blc' possibly has same eyepiece (not certain it is aspheric). To focus, field lens of eyepiece moves, but the eye lens is stationary. --West German 8 x 60 Porro II, resembles earlier deck mounted models but eyepiece does not have as good definition as earlier models. ==================================================== ===================================================== Binocular List #84: 24 Nov. 1999. WWW, mounts, disassembly, tools - materials - greases ===================================================== Subject: Boring web details I found one cause for the difficulty some listees have been having in trying to reach images & files on my server. When you use the simple 'click on it' method of cruising the net via e-mail, you have to be sure that you're clicking on the whole file name. Email will 'word wrap' the file name, breaking it in two with a 'carriage return'; and if you click on the first half of the name, it won't read the second half. If a link is broken in this way, you have to copy & paste the whole file name into your browser. I deduced this because when I went to check activity at my server, I found that some group of people had tried 29 times to download this file: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b which is non-existent, but is one half of the name of this file: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b-lopen.gif This is the 'mystery' early B & L binocular that I asked about that appears in no catalog. Those who have disassembled early binoculars please take a look at it, & see if the construction seems similar to any particular manufacturer or nation of origin. I forgot to mention that there are two arrows on the left side of the upper image; these point to two setscrews through the housing that adjust & secure the prism at its base. We've also received no information on the mystery 6x42. The list 'archives' are now updated to list 84. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list.txt lists 1-49, 435 kilobytes http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binoc_list50.txt lists 50-84, 323 kilobytes ------------- I ftp'd an image from Kevin Kuhne, of a Japanese 200 mm Nikko on mount, to my server: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/25cmni~2.bmp But this is a 275 kb bitmap file that downloads as code in my browsers; probably someone who knows what they're doing can get it.. --------------- I assembled the bibliographies from Seeger's books into one alphabetized list. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/seegrbib.doc =================================================== Subject: Modern mounts for astronomical binoculars From: Peter Abrahams, telscope@___.com Many amateur astronomers mount their large, high power binoculars to give steadier views. Here are some web pages that describe home-made mounts. These are all tripod mounted, parallel linked, wood or metal arms that allow the binocular to remain on a target while it is raised or lowered. http://www.atmpage.com/binomnt.html By Scott Wilson, with measured drawings, http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pharrington/crutch.htm A design that uses two crutches for the arms, by Glenn Warchol, with labeled photos. http://www.fore.canterbury.ac.nz/euan/bmount/bmount.htm Euan Mason of New Zealand, all wood, bulky design. http://members.aol.com/scottw8088/binoc.html Many photos, no text, by Scott Wilson. Commercial models: http://www.gis.net/~astronut/page6.html The Unimount, made in Worcester, Mass. See page7, page8, page9. They make light & heavy capacity models, in standard & deluxe. Their lightweight model uses straps to hold the binocular, which is versatile & can hold other instruments, I'm not sure I would like that but I do like the layout, with the binocular to the side of the arm. Page 9 shows a very nice model with a more secure fastening. Prices are $150-400 without the tripod. http://astronomy-mall.com/regular/products/virgo/ Virgo Astronomics These can be used in front, rear, or to the side of the observer. Prices $175 without tripod, $400 for the better model with tripod. The suregrip is a vise for holding binoculars; and they also sell a platform with straps for this. Also adapters for Bogen tripods. http://www.starchairusa.com/ http://www.starchair.com The Starchair A swiveling, fully reclining (horizon to zenith) chair; motorized, variable speed for slewing at 6 degrees/second & fine adjustments at 1 arcmin/sec, powered by a 12V battery that will last 5 nights of continuous use, & controlled with a joystick. Supports 1000 pounds, weighs 93 pounds in 3 parts, weatherproof in all seasons. Incorporates some electronics that allow you to add 'digital setting circles' to read out where you are looking & what objects are in view. Their binocular holder is shown in gallery photo 3. Will hold up to 150mm binoculars. $1950. By Chris Floyd, from Gawler, Australia. ==================================================== Subject: Disassembly of Ultrawide 7x35s From: rab\nHad some idle time on my hands today, so took out the jeweler's screwdriver and a hammer and partially disassembled two binoculars, and compared parts from a third: a good Sans & Streiff 12.5-deg 7x35, an inferior Sears 12.5-deg, and a parts S&S with 11-deg FOV, all 7x35. The Sears Model 6287 has 657' at 1000 yds, which is 12.5-deg. It is a stout unit, round pupils, but you can't see the field stops when looking directly forward, and the image quality off-axis is not as good as it is on either of the S&S. It is corrected for lateral color, meaning the entire optical train is professionally computed. Or they simply got lucky if they assembled random parts. It has B146 stamped on the front frame, meaning it was made by Warabi Kokisha Inc. (yes, the list says \"Inc\"!). I removed the framework that holds the right eyepiece from the Sears and replaced it with the corresponding framework from my parts S&S, Model #910, Sightseer 11-degrees. The parts interchanged nicely, although the magnification might have been a tad different. The eyelens for both eyepieces is plano toward the eye, while the field lens is convex toward the field stop. Both the Sears and the S&S eyepiece look the same to the casual eye, however whereas the Sears eyepiece gave no lateral color with the rest of the system, the S&S eyepiece shows significant residual lateral color when used with the Sears system. Thus, they are not identical eyepieces. I then disassembled the left eyepiece framework from the 'best' Sans & Streiffe Model 999 (not cutesy name), 12.5-deg. It had B52 stamped on the forward mechanisms, same as on the Model 910, meaning both made by Kanto Kogaku Kogyo Co.Ltd.. (incidently, I took this eyepiece apart because it had some corrosion crud that was annoyingly in view; I forgot to insert the OTHER S&S eyepiece in its place to see if the lateral color was or was not correct). The unique thing about Model 999 is that while it looks the same from the outside (the body casting and eyepiece cell look virtually the same on both models), its field lens is CONCAVE, significantly so, toward the field stop. This is what enables it to have longer eyerelief than the Sears at 12.5-deg, and to give it higher image quality as well. I had intended to disassemble just the Parts S&S eyepiece, but now it looks like I'll have to tear apart the \"good one\", from Model 999, and be careful about it since it is one of the very best 60's vintage wide angle binoculars...from any part of the world. Model #999 has just enough eyerelief that I can squeeze a spectacle cutout onto the eyepieces to see the full field in spite of my astigmatism. The Sears model, and many other models I've used, don't have enough eyerelief to see the field stops even with spectacles removed. Time Magazine for Oct. 11, 1999, page 59, states that \"160 million people in the US wear contacts or spectacles...\". That's about 65% of our population. I don't have any up-to-date information on what fraction of those have astigmatism, but school measurements from the 30's indicates a large fraction do. While eyeball power errors are fixed by adjusting the diopter settings (which can alter the magnification differently for both eyes), astigmatism requires either spectacles on the eye-side, or as-yet unavailable correctors on the objective side. Hope to make some progress on those in the near future. Regards, Dick Buchroeder. ============================================================ Subject: Tools, materials, greases -------- From: \"John S. Platt\"\nGentlemen I have had numerous requests for information on the Baby Boa wrench I mentioned in List No: 83. The following will, I hope, answer all your questions and how to obtain one. The Baby Boa is the equivalent of a car oil filter wrench. However it is made of plastic and rubber and can not damage or scratch a binocular. Two sizes are available, the large one is big enough to unscrew the warhead from an ICBM. The smaller is perfect for binocular barrels. It is made in the UK and not exported to the US. However I am willing to buy them and send them to anyone who wants one. (I am not connected, in any way, to the company that makes them) Costs are as follows: Baby Boa - \u00a36, postage and packing - \u00a35. The only other expense is changing the Dollars to Pounds at the bank, which will be about \u00a33 a time. Total cost therefore being \u00a314, about 23/24 Dollars. If you are interested, send me an e-mail and I will send you an image of the instructions so that you will have a better idea of what I am talking about. I will wait a couple of weeks and then send them all off together. When you receive the wrench, send me the cash. It may be worth enquiring at disabled shops as the wrench is ideal for removing jar lids for those with arthritic hands and you may be able to get something similar. If any of you entrepreneurs want to import them to the US let me know and I will facilitate it. Best wishes John. ----------- From: \"Loren A. Busch\"\nArmor-All has a reputation for causing drying and cracking in leather and vinyl, so I suggest it be used with caution. --------- From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nJust some comment and thoughts on a couple of things in the latest list. I have used 'Armor All' to clean the covers on cameras and while it does a very good job of cleaning and rejuvenating the appearance of the cameras it does leave a very clean, polished, ie, slippery surface. This caused some owners to actually drop cameras that were too enthusiastically cleaned. I still use it but very sparingly. Where the dirt is deeply engrained into the surface, scrubbing with an old tooth brush and wiping off while still liquid on the surface will remove a lot of the deeper dirt. 'Armor All' is water based so no damage, other than a too shiny surface, is done. I have only recently obtained a selection of damping greases, 7 in all, made by 'Nye' I got my selection from Fargo Enterprises at:- www.micro-tools.com If you check out the online catalogue there is a description. I have not used them much yet so can't make any real usefull comments. They come in 2oz containers and cost $39.95US for the kit. I have used for a long time now a brand of grease made by 'Losimol' called 'Losiod' its made in Hannover by a very small company that I can't find on the net.

The properties of all the listed grease types have been established in practice. Demands made on these lubricants are met by the: \"R\"-type greases for the room temperature range of +50C to 400C (e.g. optical- medical instruments, microscopes, etc.) \"N\"-type greases for the normal temperature range of -250C to 850C (instruments exposed to non-extreme conditions, also for outside use, e.g. binoculars). \"S\"-type greases for the special temperature range of -400C to 1200C (instruments exposed to extreme conditions). The listed greases have been divided into the following four groups. 1) dovetail guides or similar surface lubrication e.g. on microscopes. 2) helical threads (on lens barrels). 3) ocular threads (on field glasses). 4) bending bars (on binoculars). because more than 80% of the lubricating points in optical instruments only refer to these four applications. In addition, we have stated whether the said grease type is suitable for high or for low statical and/or dynamical load at the lube point. Details the apparent dynamic viscosities (from about 1,250 to about 65,000 mpa. s/cP) and other technical information can be found in the blue and white LOSIMOL brochures. =================================================== ====================================================== Binocular List #85: 04 Dec. 1999.

According to this, the Maison was established by M.E. Krauss in 1882, and specialized in \"optique et mecanique de precision.\" Noted particularly was their \"Licence de fabrication des stereo- jumelles Zeiss-Krauss.\" Note also that the firm showed their wares at several international exhibitions: Melbourne 1880 (Grande Medaille)--I know, this conflicts with the date given above; Anvers 1885 (Medaille d'Argen); Chicago 1893 (Diplome Commemorative); and Paris 1900. \"Messrs.

The firm sold \"Jumelles Galilee et prismatiques.\" --Deborah Jean Warner ============================================== Subject: A perfect modern binocular? Concept. From: rab\nIgnoring issues of size and weight, the optical things that are wrong with existing binoculars are: deplorable off-axis image quality, insufficient correction of residual chromatic aberration, comparatively narrow fields of view, and too- short eyerelief. The deplorable off-axis image quality is caused by the eyepiece, which is doing its best with a hopeless situation: too much intrinsic field curvature. The residual chromatic aberration is, quite simply, that a simple achromatic objective has noticeable color, even at low power, and especially at high power. The restricted fields of view are caused by inability to produce a well-corrected wide field of view with all conventional eyepieces. The short eyerelief is driven by many factors: need to be able to fit observers with small IPD, desire to keep optics small thus cheaper, and just plain failure to appreciate the importance to many observers that require more eyerelief than found in most binoculars. The solution is to take a long-focus twin telescope, replace its objectives with apochromats, and use Nagler-type (integrated, built-in barlow) Radians or Pentax XL type eyepieces. Ideally the prisms should be replaced with mirrors, since the objectives and eyepieces for telescope use assume no prism glass which causes aberrations. As a partial test of this theory, I went over to Frank Lopez's Stellarvision shop and use a pair of 60-mm Pastoral binocular telescopes (probably Vixens). I tried a pair of Nagler-II 16mm eyepieces. Surprisingly, they do reach focus! The eyepieces have too little eyerelief, glasses are out of the question, but with spectacles removed I could judge the quality. We've got about 30X on 60mm objectives, about 2mm exit pupils. Images are reasonably sharp over the entire field, but reeks with secondary color from the objectives, and possibly in part from the prisms. Also tried Panoptic eyepieces of similar power. Somewhat smaller, but huge, field of view with better eyerelief but still not enough. Wanted to try 22mm Panoptics, but the dual 2\"-1.25\" built-in adapter kept it from reaching focus. Some trivial mechanical modification would let it reach focus. As expected, apochromat objectives are DEFINITELY de rigeur if you plan to use this kind of power, and you must since longer focal length eyepieces cannot fit the 1.25\" eyepiece holder of this twin telescope. Remember, the IPD is restricted eventually by the eyepiece diameter. So, should you wish to see what the image in a 'next generation' binocular could look like, with all the limitations of present-day and prior art binoculars removed, simply get one of these cheap twin telescopes, add a green filter (or tolerate the color until you can afford to replace the achromats with apos!), add a Pentax or Radian and take a look! Reflective and catadioptric objectives would eliminate the color, but are impractical for small apertures and wide real fields of view. Regards, Dick. ===== From: Peter Abrahams I owned one of those Pastorals, and the color was noticeable at low powers. The 80mm model by Vixen sold by Orion is better. I certainly agree that replaceable eyepieces would be ideal; a really major advantage. Nagler has said that some of the design of the radians & some panoptics was directed towards use with binoviewers. There'd be more suitable eyepieces if eye relief weren't desired, and there's also those who feel that you need more than about 65 degrees AFOV in a binocular, which is interesting in a telescope , when you can move your head, but not of value to me in a binocular. Without a dedicated set of eyepieces designed for the system, I believe you do need mirrors instead of prisms. Repair guys don't like mirrors. But I'd really like a swappable eyepiece binocular. --Peter ================================================ Subject: Tools & materials John Platt offered to buy the 'Baby Boa' wrench in the UK & ship to listees.

B&L Mk5 Mod1, WWII letter codes, focus, tools & materials, Schomerus =================================== Subject: B & L Mk 5 Mod 1 From: Peter Abrahams Another 'only known example' binocular has turned up, a Bausch & Lomb Mk 5 Mod 1, circa 1920s. If any list readers have any paper on this one, or any other examples, please let us know. Here is a 12kb jpg image: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/b-l7x50.jpg It looks like a Zeiss Noctar or Dekar, but is taller, has 4 screws in each prism housing cover,and has a larger eyepiece with larger eyecups & rubber light shields. The sunshades are about 1.5 inch longer, the objectives are recessed in the tube, and the case is about 2 inches longer than the Zeiss. It has the B&L / Z / S logo; marked Bur Ord 50mm Mk 5 Mod 1. The front of the case has an old sticker \"Mark 5 Mod 1 #106 Feb 1922 Glass\" and the normal B & L logo. Inspection by viewing through the objective reveals no prism roof line, so there is a possibility it is a small Porro II prism. A 1944 USN schedule of binoculars lists: Mark 5 Mod 0 (and also Mod 1) B & L 7x50 6 degrees Bureau Ord, obsolete. ============================================ Subject: WWII German letter codes From: Peter Abrahams I was asked: >> At what point did they stop marking things \"Carl Zeiss Jena\" and go to BLC? A law was passed 8 July 1939, mandating arms makers substitute a numeric code for their trademark. The first allocations of code letters were probably from 1939, using a to z and then aa to zz. An improved alphabetical system was introduced 1 July 1940, the first mimeographed list of codes 'aaa - azz' was in Nov. 1940, 'baa-bzz' Feb. 1941, the first publication of the Liste was in Oct. 1941. But even the 'raa-rzz' group may predate 1938. Walter, John. German Military Letter Codes. Hove, England: Small Arms Research Publications, 1996. --------------------- From: Stephen Rohan\nI have alwas used November 1941 as the date that Zeiss changed from commercial logo to blc. I only used the date from the code book. As far as I can tell (but not going from exact serial number) this is a pretty good estimate. How about the date and circumstances for the change over from blc to rln? Did they run concurrently? I have unscientifically deduced, if that is possible, that the change over was due to the bombing of Jena. And following that bombing damage that the instuments made by the Zeisswerk were shipped out to a more secure assembly point. That is pure speculation really, but it does jive with the approximate time, the end of 1944, that the big air raid of Jena happened and we see most all rln marked optics made from very late in the war. Make your own guess. We may never know for sure unless someone can dig up records from Zeiss. I will continue to look, but perhaps Hans can also continue his research and will eventually come up with the answer. Yours truly, Steve ================================ Subject: Focus From: Peter Abrahams The following is an edited exchange from the sci.optics newsgroup. It is something of a violation of net etiquette to re-post messages without authorization, but these are publicly archived & I figure it is easier to seek forgiveness than ask permission. --------- Subject: Binocular Optical Scheme Some binoculars on the market (e.g. Steiner) feature the capability to keep the focus on a wide range, e.g. from 20 [m] to infinity, without refocusing. I would be very glad if anyone would be able to explain to me which optical scheme allows for such a behavior. Moreover, if I focus them to 10 [m] instead of infinity, for instance, what would be the focus range, supposed a given confusion circle ? ===== From: Lou Boyd\nThu, 09 Dec 1999 A normal human eye can focus from 1/2 meter to infinity. Run that through a 10X magnification focused at infinity and it should be in focus from 5 meters to infinity. All binoculars do that. Some just have better advertising hype. Lou Boyd Fairborn Observatory ====== From: Tom Hubin\nThu, 09 Dec 1999 > A normal human eye can focus from 1/2 meter to infinity. This is for adults who are not yet wearing bifocals. Children can focus closer. Those who need bifocals probably cannot focus as close as 1/2m without looking through their bifocals. > through a 10X magnification focused at infinity and it should be in focus from 5 meters to infinity. Actually, the longitudinal magnification is the square of the lateral magnification. So the range should be 49 times the eye range with 7x binocs. That would be 24.5m to infinity. For 10x binocs it would be 100 times the range or 50m to infinity. > All binoculars do that. Some just have better advertising hype. Not true. It is not the hype that matters. It is the design. I have $300 binocs that work very well over a huge range once set for my eyes. Everybody who tries my binocs comments on the clarity. They are astonished that they do not need a focus control and still see well over a great range. They are accustomed to using less expensive binocs. Those that require a focus control. I think that the less expensive ones are just not optimized for all ranges. They focus well at some range but have excessive aberrations at other ranges. They get around this by giving you a focus control to make up for an otherwise poor design. That is not meant to be critical of the designers. It is just a matter of cost. Tom Hubin, AO Systems Design thubin@___net ===== From: Elliot Burke\nThu, 9 Dec 1999 Question: why do some binoculars claim that they can be used over a great depth without refocusing? The longitudinal magnification of an optical system is the square of the transverse magnification, so low magnification is the friend of good depth of focus. Another factor on depth of focus is pupil size or system f/#. A binocular with a small exit pupil will have a greater depth of focus than one with a large exit pupil, other things being equal. I am 46, can focus from infinity to 200 mm. Take for example 7x binoculars. If the binoculars are afocal (focused at infinity) then an object at infinity still appears to be at infinity, an object at 10 m. This correspond to experience. The binoculars are more comfortable when focused so that my eye is relaxed, but I can focus on objects over that entire range without refocusing the binoculars. A good pair of binoculars with low magnification and small exit pupils will be very satisfactory over a large depth of field, compared with, say, 10x50 binocs. A good pair of binoculars will look much better than a poor pair for several reasons. 1. low contrast because of poor or no coatings, poor control of stray light. 2. roof prisms are rarely made well enough for critical use. The roof angle has to be held to arc seconds. This is hard to achieve in low priced optics. Get binoculars with Porro prisms instead. 3. poor accuracy of polished surfaces 4. inadequate optical design. Elliot Burke HighTide Instruments ===== From: Mark W. Lund, PhD\nFri, 10 Dec 1999 This is an analysis that I have been meaning to do for years, but haven't got around to it. I still don't see the connection between longitudinal mag, transverse mag and depth of focus, but I'm too lazy to look it up, will you explain if you have a minute? The main purpose of my writing is to emphasize your conclusions. If you are right, then the \"no focus\" binoculars should be LOW POWER, and LOW LIGHT COLLECTORS. So, like all of optics you have to give up something to get something. If you want high magnification, and/or good light collection (I find large exit pupils to be more comfortable), then you will have to focus your binoculars. It has nothing to do with whether you got a better design, or a more expensive set. Right? best regards mark ====== From: Tom Hubin\nSat, 11 Dec 1999 Assuming that the lenses are AR coated and the manufacturing is flawless it will still depend on the design. The choice of glasses and surface curves. You can design a 7x afocal system that takes an object at 9800 feet and images it perfectly at 9800/49=200 feet. But it may do a poor job of taking an object at 980 feet and imaging it to 20 feet. That system would need a focus control to move the clearest image to where it is needed. An excellent design would take any object at any distance far away and make a very sharp image. This may require more surfaces and more glass types. The designer must be more thorough and the result will be more expensive. BTW, a 7x binocular actually makes the image 1/7 as large as the object. But it is located at 1/49 the distance. So a 7 foot tall post that is 980 feet away is imaged as a 1 foot post that is 20 feet away. So it looks like a small model that is too close. Consequently, it appears to be 7 times as large. My $300 binocs are great over a huge range once you focus the eyepieces. They are well coated for good night vision. But this does not matter in the daylight. They are 7x angular magnification with a 50mm diameter collection lens. Same as all other 7x50 binocs. They have good eye relief but that is because the eyepiece is large (17mm diameter). All of this is possible in a cheap pair of binocs too. What makes my $300 binocs work well over a large range is that the lenses are close to ideal lenses over the range for which they are intended. In short, the lenses are well designed and well manufactured. Tom Hubin thubin@___net AO Systems Design ===== From: Joachim Wesner\nSat, 11 Dec 1999 That system would need a focus control to move the clearest image to where it is needed. No, I think the POINT here is NOT on achieving optimum focusing at several distances according to magn^2 (YES, a design question, but somehow finally limited for large apertures on the question if you go for the \"sine-condition\" or the \"herschel-condition\", you cannot do both), but what they seem to claim is that those extended focus binoculars in some magical way focus all objects (even those much nearer than 980 feet) into the (nearly) SAME image distance, say all at 20 feet, to not be limited by the focusing range of the human eye, which seems to be impossible, or can only be approximated by pretty low power systems. There was a thread here on this already some time ago. Joachim ===== From: Robin Hull\n13 Dec 1999 > What makes my $300 binocs work well over a large range Another way to get apparent extended depth of focus is to leave some uncorrected spherical and longitudinal chromatic aberration :-) The image will not be as good as a well corrected optic at best focus, but it won't fall off as fast. robin.hull@___om ================================================== Subject: Tools & materials -------------- From: Dohertyfe@___m Are you aware of anyone who has reproduced and is selling the rubber for beh 8 x 60 binocular?

There is a firm belief that constant and heavy use on parts like vinyl dashes and other vinyl parts of the interior will cause drying and cracking. Notice I said the reputation is associated with heavy and repeated use. Because of this admonishment from two different sources, I have always used it sparingly and have had no problems.

Manufacturers and retailers are parties to a conspiracy of enormous proportions, involving campaigns of motivational propaganda and commercial advertising, that induce spasms of inadequacy and greed in persons of low resolve or feeble self determination; and so effective is this propaganda that young persons typically become parties to the worst sort of avarice. Normal parental resolve is often muted by quantities of wassail (the \"Spirits\") and thus the close of the year can find the head of the household in debt to the merchandise pimps and in trouble with relatives. I'm sure this all sounds very peculiar to readers overseas, but these eccentricities are part of life in the States. In a rough approximation of this odd notion of 'giving' or 'sharing', I present to the list one of my translations. This text was translated by Ilse Roberts & edited by myself. Friedrich Schomerus.

Leupold review, B & L parts, Mark V ======================================== Subject: Review of the Leupold Gold Ring 10 x 40 and 9 x 25 binoculars. From: Peter Abrahams Leupold Gold Ring 10 x 40 and 9 x 25; both are roof prism & described as waterproof in immersion, nitrogen filled, & exceeding mil specs for ruggedness. 10 x 40, 5 degree field (257'/1000 yards), 17 mm eye relief, close focus 16', 28.5 oz. $778. Eagle Optics. Comfortable to hold. Rubber eyecups include eye guards that fit outside of eye sockets, forming an effective light shield that causes some condensation problems on the eyepiece of a cold binocular. Focus knob is offset towards right side, a bit small & buried in the body, easy to use but would be difficult with a glove. Diopter adjust is a smaller wheel just forward of the focus cylinder, easy to inadvertently move off zero when focusing. Strap loops are placed well to the outer edges of the body, a much better place than the standard 'bottom' of the binocular which causes the objective end to tip in to the chest. Eye relief at 17mm is not enough to see the entire field when wearing spectacles, but is close to sufficient. All glass surfaces appear to be coated, with an assortment of blue & green reflections. The prism mounts, as visible from the outside, seem solid & well designed for ease of disassembly. Inner surfaces are black but not flat black & there is stray light visible in use. The eyepieces in particular seem to have lenses that need blackened edges. The roof prisms introduce diffraction spikes off bright point sources of light (flashlights, streetlamps), not visible off stars. At night, there is also some glare from bright objects in the same directions as the spikes. Image quality is very good. The balance of aberrations results in a binocular that gives a good impression. This is in spite of the fact that an enumeration of all the noticeable faults sounds less than very good. The image softens just off mid field. High contrast objects like a fine grating remain resolvable to near the edge of the field. Low contrast objects like the full moon or a weathered board become soft just off the middle of the field. There is noticeable pincushion distortion; not only do lines appear curved at the edge of the field but there is a slight sensation of rolling motion as the binoculars are panned across a landscape. The distortion is not in the same class as cheap wide field binoculars, but for a 50 degree field, it is significant. Some color is visible on objects like the moon, but no worse than other very fine binoculars. This binocular is notable for having been designed by Wright Scidmore. 9 x 25, field 5.3 degrees (278'/1000 yds), 14 mm eye relief, 10 oz. $358. Eagle Optics. This individual focus glass has the easiest focus adjustment I've used in an IF, there are two knurled rubber cylinders that lie just below the index or middle fingers. Collimation accomplished with eccentrically mounted oculars. Eye relief allows view of most of the field while wearing spectacles. Stray light is very well controlled. There are diffraction spikes visible off bright point light sources. The image is overall very good, with a good balance of aberrations. The image gets soft about halfway to the edge, probably equal in this regard to most of the 'top of the line' pocket binoculars I've used. I find 9 or 10 power mini binoculars to be very difficult to hold steady enough for this to be a factor, and greatly prefer lower powers. Distortion is noticeable, probably worse than other top miniatures. Color is just barely visible. =========================================== Subject: Naming the group (yawn) As might be expected, we did not achieve a consensus on the issue of naming a group of binocular nuts. Bill to Pete. When asked: I call myself a binocular historian. How about the Binocular Historians Club. May sound a little dry to the outsider, but sure wouldn't attract thieves. Bill Beacom Peter--I think you are on the right track with \"Binocular Historian Society\". It is specific enough to adequately define the group and sufficiently academic sounding to be respectable. It sounds like something I would like to join. Don Wilson Club sounds juvenile, and society sounds like gray poupon, but the bino and history gets my vote. Cory Suddarth I would like the name to not exclude any form of enthusiast of binoculars. That would include users of modern binos to collectors of opera glasses to serious researchers. Also those people who wish to study and build binoculars should be included. The names I have seen proposed all seem to rule out certain of these groups. How about a simple \"Binocular Society\" ? I was going to suggest Binocular Enthusiasts Society, but that doesn't have a good \"ring\" to it. Maybe we should hold off on giving a name to our group until we think it over further. Steve Rohan Regarding a name for our association: Some on the list may be into collecting but not historica. I for one have no problem with history.

It reads: 6x30, 8x30, 9x35, 8x40, 7x35: all use the same prism eyepiece: 6x30, 7x35, 8x40: are all 21.8 mm 8x30 & 9x35: 5 element erfle, 16.625 mm 7x50: 27.54mm 8x56: 27.54mm 7x50 special prism 8x56 special prism, will interchange with 7x50 6x30 & 8x30 131.228mm (no explanation, presumably focal length of objective) 7x35 & 9x35 153.27mm 8x40 177.25mm 7x50 objective: 192.988mm 8x56: 215.00mm =================================== Subject: Mark V 7x 50 From: \"William M. Beacom\"\nI disassembled the Mark V's this morning also my Dekar. The prism system is identical, but the prism covers are not. The Dekar uses a three screw, very shallow cover plate. The plate underneath that holds the prism cluster in place has four screws. The Mark 5 uses a four screw very deep plate that uses longer screws to access the threaded area used by the Dekar to hold the prism assembly. The mounting that the ocular screws into is different because of this. It is indeed a roof prism. Happy Holidays Bill ======== From: \"Frederick Schwartzman\"\nIt truly is an interesting glass, but I think it is certainly earlier than the 1920's because of the \"Z\" in the logo which would have been gone by the time the U.S. entered the First World War. I think it is a German glass, probably sold through B&L. In an event, the case does not look like any B&L case, but very definitely looks like a German case, particularly the closing device which I have never seen on a B&L case. Regards, Fred. ========= From: \"William M. Beacom\"\nMy conclusion was quite similiar, with the following explanation. In the translation you provided of the Zeiss-B&L Agreement, It was explained that the reason Zeiss entered into the agreement was because of the high tariffs. Near 50%, if memory serves me. B&L could not just market the Glass with the Zeiss name on it, because it would then be subject to the tax. They therefore ordered in Parts to make the Glass and made a few changes, so as to satisfy customs, and put the B&L name on it. I would place it around 1915. I don't know how often this was done, but there may have been something written into military purchasing contracts, as there is today, that had an effect, or maybe a Senator from New York was head of Military procurement. Any of these scenarios would explain this glass, but I favor the first one I gave. The case was custom made in Germany for this Glass. To my knowledge, there was no Tariff on leather goods. Bill ================================================ ================================================== Binocular List #89: 12 Jan 2000. Web pages, group names, Joico ========================================= Subject: Web pages. Names, respectful. Names, irreverent. From: Peter Abrahams I finally got all my files together under the umbrella of a web page. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binotele.htm ========= From: DaveTrott@___m I have recently updated my web-page with current results of my experiments with giant binoculars. Readers can get to it from http://hometown.aol.com/davetrott/ And on the NAME question...there are probably a few of us who have only a passing interest in the history of binoculars, but are fascinated with building binoculars. Some kind of a broader name would include people like me: The Binocular Society or The Binocular Optics Group. Thank You! Dave Trott ============== From: Stephen Rohan\nPeter, I know that the naming of our new group is becoming a boring topic so I have been attempting to come up with a serious name which will include all aspects of our common interests and sound like an a socially acceptable entity. Therefore may I propose: The National Association for the Study, Preservation and Advancement of Binocular Optics. That would be: NASPA of Binocular Optics. I would just call it NASPA for short. (I had thought of Society of Advancement, Preservation and Study for Binocular optics), but that came out to read SAPS which doesnt make us look like a serious group. Let me know what you think. Then we can have a vote. Will it be SAPS or NASPA? Yours truly, Steve ==== Hello Steve, When you first suggested 'Binocular Society', I thought it was a little vague. But that's been the one closest to what most people have wanted. I'm currently leaning towards that simple name. I'll post your note to the list, unless I hear otherwise. But it has a couple of what seem like problems to me - not major problems, just nitpicking. First, the length. Second the 'national', when we would want to make a point of inviting people overseas. Third, by being so specific, those who are into other aspects like construction or use, might feel out of it. So....you asked my opinion -- that might have been a mistake! --Peter ===== From: \"John W. Briggs\"\nHow about, \"Binocular Technology Society\"? I prefer \"Binocular History Society\" to \"Binocular Historian Society\". --JWB. PS: How about \"Society for the History of Interocular Technology\" (the activities of which are conducted principally on the SHIT list). --(Forgive me.) ========================================= Subject: JOICO The unusual 6 x 42 discussed earlier are still a mystery.

From INFANTRY magazine, March-April, 1995. SWAP SHOP: OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE By Mike Sparks, USARNG, Redford, NC The shine from binoculars, scopes, infrared viewers, night vision goggles, and even individual sun, wind, dust goggles (SWDGs) can give away your presence, especially in the open expanse of the desert, and draw enemy fire. Glint from an officer's binoculars gave away the Confederate attack at Gettysburg, killed the German Army's top sniper in WWII, cost an Israeli general an eye, and allowed a Marine gunnery sergeant to take out the Viet Cong's top sniper. Visiting paratroopers from the former Soviet Union said recently that looking for reflections from our optics was a major scouting tactic in the Cold War. And during major U.S. Army exercises, at least one scout helicopter is usually assigned the sole mission of looking for optic reflections from ground forces. You can shield binoculars by cupping your fingers around the outer lenses. But you can't cup your fingers around a weapon scope or around the SWDGs you're wearing or resting on your helmet. A field expedient solution is to make lens covers from a pair of women's brown nylon pantyhose, preferably a pair with the thicker nylon in the upper part. this technique will give you immediate camouflage for your optics while preserving their normal use. FOR BINOCULARS AND SCOPES: 1. Cut off the ends (toes). 2. Stretch fabric over the lenses. 3. Secure with a rubber band and tape. FOR THE SWDG LENS: 1. Lay the lens on the thicker nylon. 2. Outline shape with a pen and cut out. 3. Stretch fabric over the lens as you return it to the frame, leaving a little overhang. 4. When lens is back in place, trim excess nylon from inside the goggles. Industry has developed special lens covers that can be retrofitted to issue binoculars, vehicle headlights, sunglasses, sniper scopes, and infrared thermal sights such as those used on the Dragon and Javelin missiles. Hopefully, similar covers will also be developed for use on SWDGs and prescription eyeglasses. --------------------- (Where do you find pantyhose in a battlefield? I thought the rule was 'don't ask, don't tell.) ================================================ ============================================================= Binocular List #90: 21 Jan 2000. Books from Seeger, Names, Glare ======================================= From: hans.t.seeger@___ne.de (Seeger) Subject: Hans Seeger/books Prof. Koehler Today, I have an offer: I have been able to acquire a substantial part of Prof. Koehler\u0091s library (he died in 1999 and - as you will know - he is the author of 'Die Fernrohre und Entfernungsmesser' and was after WW II the leading Zeiss constructor of binoculars). Several of his books were important additions to my documentation, but there are books left and I want to give these to other binocular friends or people who are interested in special questions of optics. I attach this list (Excel 3. for Macintosh) and hope that you can open this document. If someone has the Navord reports 77-46 (1947) and 436 (1948) in original (!) and complete (maybe other literature too?) he can get the complete lot of books in my list. (I have copies of the Navord reports, for details see 'literature' on page 448 in my 'gray' book - military binoculars). As an alternative I would suggest a part exchange of books of this library against other original binocular brochures, books or binoculars. Another point: Recently, an attachment was sent to me containing 3 MB. It was not possible to open this and this mail blocked my e-mail completely. My programs are very old and I cannot read attachments in modern programs. Therefore each text addressed to me should be copied into the normal e-mail text and not be sent as an attachment in a modern program. I am writing another book and sooner or later I will be able to receive illustrations or photographs - but this will be not within the next months. With my best regards yours Hans ----------------------- There isn't a lot here for binocular nuts, but there are some good telescope & optics books. I posted two versions, identical except for formatting: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/seegrbk.txt and http://www.europa.com/~telscope/seegrbk.xls This is in excel for the macintosh, but excel 5 for windows opened it in my computer. ================================================== Subject: web site I've posted most of my files on binoculars to my web site. This includes some translations from German of important papers related to this subject. I want these files to be distributed & used, so download everything you want. I'd like this page to be a lot more than just my writings on binoculars, and if anyone has any electronic text they'd like to share, please send it to me. If there are copyright problems, or it badly needs editing, or is inflammatory, we'll have to discuss it. Images are also welcome, though they take up a lot of space & I'll have to limit or delete some, at some date. I'm going to focus on instruments, not on birding or astronomy, except on how these observations can test binoculars. I'm not going to limit what a 'binocular' is, except to binocular telescopes, including: large astronomical telescopes, surgeon's telescopes (eyeglasses type), old, & new. http://www.europa.com/~telscope/binotele.htm --Peter ==================================================== Subject: Names, ATS From: \"Bill Cook\"\nFor my two cents on the name of the organization: I do not think that \"Historical,\" \"Historica,\" or \"History should be left out of the name. As an \"official\" - though not professional - historian, I am obligated to feel that way. However, there is a practical side as well. Models change these days at the drop of a hat and a given binocular that is new in March may be retired by the end of the year. That being the case, the interval between innovation and artifact my only be a few months. Therefore, \"history\" is a very appropriate word. Observing such motion in the world of binoculars - and having Peter as a mover and shaker therein - makes me wonder if your efforts will, in the next year or so, wind up being merged with work of The Antique Telescope Society? Considering the nature of the hobbies - and the fact that they have many members in common - it would seem a natural marriage. It seems that the newsletter for each could pack more punch for each group and lend additional credibility to the historical research of individuals in either group. And then there would be at least some savings in printing. Anyway, just a wonderin'. Kindest Regards, Bill Cook, Opticalman Chief, USNR-Ret. Mgr. Precision Instruments & Optics Group, Captain's, Seattle www.atmjournal.com ------------------------ The ATS is a more organized & productive group, with a Journal, annual meetings, etc., and I am active in the ATS & support it any way I can. They have been more oriented towards observatory instruments & astronomical telescopes than towards spyglasses & hand held scopes; mostly because of the interests of the original members, but also to retain some focus, since the subject is vast. Some of the ATS members share an interest in binoculars, but there are a few essential differences between the fields. The development of astronomy, the expanding horizon of the 'universe', is driven by improvements in telescopes. This is what makes the history of the telescope so interesting, compared with microscopes or other instruments. Binoculars are equally interesting but have little place in that history, nor do spyglasses. --Peter ========================================= Subject: Names From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nJust a bit more fuel for the name fire, Rod.

X-rays of binoculars, rangefinders, German army codes 1944. Subject: X-rays of binoculars During my visit to Leupold, we discussed the use of an industrial x-ray machine to help reverse engineer old binoculars. I had been told by a lens designer that x- rays could be used to help determine the type of eyepiece in an instrument, and instrument makers use it for similar purposes. I loaned Leupold a Hensoldt 8 x 30 Diarex (uses mirrors instead of prisms) and a Minox T8 Taschen-Teleskop (folded optical path to produce a low power telescope the size of a stack of 10 credit cards), which they had radiographed. The electronic scan of the x-ray is not particularly successful, and little detail is visible, but perhaps this will encourage others to pursue this field. Any city has an industrial x-ray business. I am grateful to Leupold for providing this image.

I replied, mentioning my site, and subsequent mails brought a very interesting file. (This will also be posted on the web site) \"It contains abbreviations of German optics known in the German army logistic system in 1944; from a German magazine, Waffen - Revue 88; Von Pawlas Verlag, Herausgegeben von JournalVerlag (meaning the distribution is done by Journal Verlag, same company makes Deutche Waffen Journal, DWJ). The number 88 is the issue number. It's a small magazine that comes 4 times a year. I can try and make english translations for most, when I get the time. What it can do for people: they can get info about the abbreviations, which are marked on items in their collections. Not very informative, BUT it can show them, where some odd optic might belong in the military system.

Russian 12x60s, German mil abbrev., Repair, new Canons. ===================================================== Subject: Russian 12x60's From: Fan Tao\nI recently obtained a couple of military surplus Russian 12x60 binoculars (they were available from Deutsche Optik and Surplus Shed). These look like direct copies of the WWII blc (Zeiss Jena) 12x60's used on 4m rangefinders. Actually, they look to be based on the Kriegsmarine version shown in the rightmost photo of figure 140 in Seeger's book. This model can be distinguished by the sunshade, which has a side-to-side rotating aperture stop (rather than the flip-up type with the \"Mickey Mouse\" shade). I didn't have the Kriegsmarine model for direct comparison, but compared to the normal model, I could find only a couple of minor differences. For one thing, all the markings, such as for the filters and air recharge ports, are in Cyrillic instead of German. One of the specimens has a name plate marked \"Binocular Magnification (in Russian) 12x\" and \"B\". The \"B\" could indicate that this model was also used on a rangefinder, as one out of a set of two or three. The coatings have a purplish tint typical of Russian military optics. I would guess from the coatings that the binoculars were manufactured around the 1960's. The view through the Rusian units are nearly identical to the blc's, with the same 60 degree apparent field of view and similar correction. It almost seems as if the Russians got a hold of the plans and tooling from Zeiss Jena. It doesn't appear though, that these are remarked German units or made from German parts because one of the castings has Cyrillic characters, plus there is a bulge on the left side near the eyepiece (apparently a weak point in the casting) which I haven't seen in any German units. In a way I was disappointed that the Russians didn't try to make any significant changes, but I suppose it is hard to improve on such a fine design, one of my favorite optics from WWII. Fan Tao fantao@___et.att.net =================================== Subject: abbreviation list numbers From: mikedenmark@___ele.dk (B-List # 91, German army numbering & abbreviations on optics, 1944. This was posted at: http://www.europa.com/~telscope/mil%60ger%23.txt ) hello, just remembered something: Those numbers in the abbreviation list: Its Geraetnummer.....equipment number. This is the first serious attempt by the german military to establish a logistic system for procurement. Each factory in germany had a contract to deliver what goods they could or wanted to deliver. This resulted in grotesque supply problems: 300 different types of lorries, 13,000 (thirteen thousand) different types of military radios.....and the problems to get spare parts.... So as Albert Speer became R\u00fcstungsminister, he set out to clean up this mess. never succeeded, but these numbers was a start.....now a company had an order of equipment item number something, and had to produce to common specs.... This meant for lorries that the drivers compartment was the einheitscompartment (cannot recall correct name) same for any model of lorry, (truck), and that for radios standardisation narrowed model types to about 300. ALL the rest was discontinued.....meaning that the output of the german industry was cut in late 43....until production had adjusted....then the output went through the ceiling..... for some equipment.....oil never was plentifull and as the US strategic bomber command focused on oil industry, more and more goods stood ready everywhere, only transportation was halted.... Another less known material in short supply was cows!!!.....too little hide for the armys need.... So, webbing came into general use....until cotton came in short supply....then plastics was used..... Not Nylon, but something very close to it.....and THEN oil supply shortages halted THAT too. well this was really just about those numbers..... regards mike denmark ========================================= Subject: German codes From: Lngubas@___m Thanks for the listing in your latest posting. Here is something that you might want to check out. I found it by accident but then you may have posted it before I joined the group. http://www.radix.net/~bbrown/codes_full.html It is a good quick reference. I know someone who owns the \"complete\" listing that was published in Germany in book form some 15 years ago, I believe that it was Pawlas as well. It is huge and you cannot pick things out without reading it page by page and it does not go as far as the rln for the later Zeiss items. I have a theory about rln that I have not heard elsewhere. Zeiss did prepare some \"cave\" and underground locations for \"emergency manufacturing\" and after the bombings in late 1944 and 1945, they may have moved things there and listed this as a new location. I did come across some documentation on a number of these sites and the Polish and Czech locations taken over by Zeiss somewhere and if you are interested, I can forward to you in an Excel Spreadsheet.

Seeger page 245. Giancarlo -------------- From: \"Anna Rozek-Vacani\"\nHello Jean, I have seen the picture of binoculars \"12x80\" on the list of Peter. I am sorry to tell you it is not like do you think. I am absolutely sure it is Polish 10X 80 TZK. The plate on the binocular is a \"fake\" included an eagle, which is situated on position of original place of block of finder. I have much experience of this model. I have 3 new complete sets (in boxes) in my own collection. The first model was produced in 1953-1954. The magnification of it is 9.9x78. I have the original technical documents for it. If you wish, please ask me another questions I give you answer with pleasure. Best regards Terry Vacani ==================================== Subject: Re: Roof or Porro From: Thomas Press\nAmong the many subjects of interest [in older lists] is the discussion of porro vs. roof. Unlike the rangefinder vs. reflex 35mm camera debate of the late 50's and early 60's, I find that this is not an easy choice. Perhaps the source of the problem is the availability of so many excellent (although costly) roofs, and so few truly excellent porros. Even the much ballyhooed Nikon Superior E Series glasses seem, to my eyes, less satisfying than comparably sized roofs from Leica or Swarovski, or even late lamented porro examples from Zeiss and Bausch & Lomb. I am still puzzled why the Bausch & Lomb one piece body and porro prism mounting methods have largely disappeared. Even Swift, once a keen proponent of the B body binocular, has all but abandoned the style, with just the 8.5 x 44 Audubon and 10 x 50 Kestrel models remaining (although I understand that the Swift glasses actually use a far simpler and less costly method of prism mounting). I was also interested in the praise of phase coating of roof prisms, and agree wholeheartedly with the various comments. As the process finds its way into less costly roofs,the price differential between porros and roofs truly narrows. In that regard, I couldn't resist purchasing recently the Minox 8 x 32 BD model, a phase coated (and multi-coated) roof, with optical performance to the casual observer suprisingly close to the Leica 8 x 32 and Zeiss 8 x 30 BGA (my favorite compact glass). The Minox model sells for just under $400, is rubber armored with a soft (and actually useful) leather case, intelligent accordian-hinged rainguard and cork type objective covers. Peformance and apparent build quality seemed noticeably better than the Pentax 8 x 42 phase coated roof, and I remain mystified how Minox is able to hold down the price. Best regards - Tom Press ================================== Subject: The List From: Peter Abrahams There are now about 80 people on the list, and since my web site was established, new contacts have been regular. E-mail to me has become quite frequent, and I no longer acknowledge all input to the list. It is time for another notice that we need someone to set us up with listserv or majordomo software. This would mean that your e-mail to the list would be automatically distributed to all, one at a time or combined into digests. There is the alternative of a commercial list, that places an advertisement at the end of each message, but I'm not in favor of that right now. --Peter ============================== Subject: First World War Optical Munitions From: SCSambrook@___m I should apologise for not being much of a contributor to your excellent newsletters - to be truthful I am sometimes overawed by the technical knowledge so many of your members show ... and ever conscious of my own ignorance of so much. Nevertheless, I am learning all the time and should say Thanks Very Much to all the members who so cheerfully share their wealth of information. Dare I ask for yet MORE information ? I am presently working on the British optical munitions industry in the Great War (World War 1) and am trying, amongst other things, to formulate some idea of the numbers of 6x 24 and 6x 30 binoculars actually manufactured to government contracts by the assortment of makers who actually produced them. As I haven't yet found any Official Statistics I am pretty much reduced to collecting numbers from instruments - not particularly academic, but it's about the best I can do in the absence of the figures. I wonder if this makes me a kind of Optical Archeologist ? I would be very interested to hear from anyone who has either model as to details of maker and serial number ... the models that concern me are the ones marked 'Binocular Prismatic No.2 Mk I , (or Mk II)' and Binocular Prismatic No 3 Mk I, (or Mk II)' . Mk II models were fitted with graticules, as the top-plates will also say. The British government also bought or begged lots of binoculars from the Trade and public, and from French and U.S. makers, but what I'm after are the details of the 'G.I.' type models actually made in Britain. (Actually, I think they were all made in England, but someone out there might know better ... and I wouldn't want to offend the Scots.) All the 'official' ones will say No. 2 or No. 3 on them, and will have WD arrows ('Crows Feet') as well as a date of manufacture. If they don't have all this stuff, then they're commercial ones pressed into service. Ironically, the numbers of those taken up or donated in Britain are well documented. Those with two arrows pointing tip-to-tip are the ones officially declared surplus and disposed of through proper channels - if you have one with only a single-arrow (like all mine !) then really it is still the property of His Late Britannic Majesty King George V, and please can he have it back ... It would also be good to know if anyone has a British-made Stereo-Telescope (Donkey-ears) of WW1 manufacture. Best wishes Stephen Sambrook. ============================== Subject: restoration From: SmashMN@___m A question for the group--minor and cosmetic, but maybe of use to others. I have a number of WWII US 7x50s with rubber eyecups. In a number of cases, they were stored in their cases carelsssly, and the tips of the eyecups were crushed--giving them a permanent bend, or \"set.\" I wonder if there's any way to take that bend out and restore their shape? Best, Marc Norman ============================== Subject: caveat emptor From: Peter Abrahams I scanned ebay yesterday & found these two descriptive gems: ------- \"This is a decades old French forgery of Carl Zeiss binoculars, from the late 1920's. These were made by a French optical company with Zeiss markings. Zeiss made millions of binoculars, but there are only about 2,000 of these fakes\" ------ \"feature broadband multicoating on all glass to air surfaces optimized to the eye's twilight vision. This binocular is one of the extreme few porroprisms binoculars available which feature PHASE CORRECTION COATING, a feature developed for the absolute best roof prism binoculars, but not thought of as critical in a (more efficient (mid 90% vs. lower 80%) roof prism model. \" ===================================== ======================================================== Binocular List #94: 29 Feb 2000. Forgeries, codes, marketing, 910, =============================== From: hans.t.seeger@___ne.de (Seeger) I want to comment some letters of the group. The \u0084German 12 x 80\u0093 is apparently a forgery. I have told Jean Laurent so. The question of forged Zeiss glasses has been discussed in the group. I think each binocular collector has at least one forged Zeiss glass. Ihave never regarded these as more valuable than an original Zeiss - but the fact is true that these are rarer than an original Zeiss. One thing may be of interest: On 17. June 1959 a 6 x30 was repaired in Jena and got the serial number 2977186 (internally called Fabrikations- Nummer).This glass is declared as \u0084F\u00e4lschung\u0093 (forgery, fake)! Peculiarly enough, the Zeiss factory repaired a fake and allocated to this an ownnumber - in this way the glass has been raised to the nobility.... Maybe that someone detects this glass - I would like to see it. To the question of British WW I optical munition: Please see Bill Reid\u0091s publication \u0084Binoculars in the Army\u0093 (cited in my \u0084gray\u0093 book, page 445). Unfortunately, Bill has no e-mail. He is preparing a monograph on Barr & Stroud Binoculars. I have no British Stereo-Telescope (only theZeiss one for British use on page 198). In the Handbook of ArtilleryInstruments (London 1914) a Stereoscopic Telescope is shown on plate XIand XII (page 31). Another point: The physical scientist Joachim Rienitz has published a new book dealing with binoculars, mainly the early history of these (the ElisabethanTelescope etc.). The title: Historisch-physikalische Entwicklungslinien optischer Instrumente (translated: Historicalphysical development lines of optical instruments). The book is in German and the result of conscientious research. (Paperback, 306 pages,ISBN 3-934252-13-3). There are some beautiful colour photographs of early monocular perspectives. Aspects of rln have been discussed too: I have heard about the rumors of an underground production. The Rothensteiner H\u00f6hlen (or similar) (H\u00f6hlen= caves) are near Jena - but until now, nobody was able to state that there or elsewhere was an underground production - or that rln was allocated to these productions. The book with the German codes like blc etc. has been published by Pawlas in 1977 - but to my knowledge you cannot buy it. The old edition is sold out and a new edition has not been published (?). The last entry in this book is \u0084ozz\u0093.Has somebody a 100 % sure proof source stating that rln is Zeiss Jena? There is no question that this is true. In an internal Zeiss paper serial numbers are listed which belong to rln glasses. All these is indirect evidence. ------------ From: Peter Abrahams I will find a source for the Rienitz book, and post it to the list. ======================================== Subject: WWII code From: SrsIII353@___m with regard to the \"wpb\" and \"hmr\" markings on certain wwii binoculars; i believe that\"wpb\" stands for \"war production board\". this was an agency set up vary early in the war to coordinate all industrial production for the war effort. as to the \"hmr\" marking; is this not associated with, primarily, instruments supplied to canada? if this is the case the perhaps \"hmr\" stands for \"his majesty's....(something-or-other). just a thought. ======================================= Subject: Inquiry for Marketing Information From: Nelson882@___m Hello, I have not formally introduced myself to this esteemed group so I will try to remedy that now. My name is Steve Nelson and my present occupation is as a sales representative for analytical instrumentation used primarily in commercial and industrial laboratories. My interest in optics and binocular optics especially stems from my childhood when my Uncle gave me a pair of Military 6x30's (US Naval Gun Factory - Rochester, NY), well, of course, I had them apart immediately (and back together again in working order I might add) - the seeming magical image forming capabilities of this device fascinated me then and do to this day. My formal training was as a Microbiologist coupling my interest in the natural world and a desire to understand what makes it tick. The use of optical microscopes in this field reinforced my already developed fascination with optics and brought me to a better understanding of the concepts of resolution, and the geometrical optical properties. My quest in this study is to find the \"perfect\" binocular, one that reduces the separation of the viewer to the viewed. Perhaps the most enjoyable recent trip I've made was a visit I made to the Zeiss Jena works in 1993. For years I had poured over literature showing the Zeiss Pentacon tower and the famous achromatic doublet - Well, after about 4 hours on the former East German autobahn, leaving from Dresden (a trip of only 60 miles) we arrived at the fabled city of Jena and turning a bend in the road the huge doublet logo and tower came into view - wow - it's really as pictured! exactly as pictured! When I was there the planetarium and all the buildings associated the the brand were operational and in good condition despite the political separation endured by that region for so many years. I was also able to drive another 50 miles south past Saalfeld (where many of the optical glasses and precision lens assemblies were developed) to the \"new\" binocular assembly plant at Eisfeld. Harold Roos, the Operations Manager at the time, was kind enough to give me a complete tour of the facility. He proudly showed me the new computer controlled milling and boring machine the plant had just acquired after the Docter acquisition - at the time it was turning out Deltrintem bodies but was also capable of machining rifle scopes and just about anything else they wanted to produce. I had an interest in the aspherical lens technology they were introducing at the time and was shown the ocular cells prior to assembly, noting that the aspherical lens is the field lens in the 8 and 10x models. After a discussion of waterproofing techniques and the precision to which the zoom tubes (for the rifle scopes) are fabricated to - most production is still to a great extent hand work - we left over the Thuringengian hills toward Bayreuth and a Wagnerian Opera - but that's another story. If anyone is still reading, I did have a request for information. Does anyone have information about the total US sales volume of higher grade binoculars (over $200/unit) and riflescopes and a source for these figures? I am thinking of starting a mail order business in binoculars/scopes but have not been able to establish volume potential nationally. Can anyone help? Steve Nelson - nelson882@___m =========================================== Subject: Sans & Streiffe Model 910 measured/computed From: rab\nGentlemen, Phil Lam had a new spherometer base made that enables him now to measure lenses as small as 1\" diameter. He just finished measuring the radii and thicknesses on the S&S Model 910, whose optics resemble those in the Nikko10x70. This morning I went over to his shop and together we measured the specific gravity of the lenses, and the glass types fall into expected common types. We did not measure the specific gravity of the prisms: the powder scale we used for the lenses won't measure something as heavy as these 36 to 38mm prisms, and I didn't want to take the prisms home with me to weigh on the larger Ohaus scale I have. Set the design up on ZEMAX, and the results are self-consistent and good. The computed magnification is 6.88X, close enough to 7X. According to my measurement of the field stop, S&S probably cheated on the actual field of view...it will be smaller than 11-deg. The exit pupils are 'square', indicating they used low index, presumably BK7 glass rather than the customary BAK4. The prisms are mounted on a single plate with three holes in it. I measured the hole diameters and put them in ZEMAX. There are no slots in the prisms, as there were on the Nikko 10x70, but the prisms are greatly oversized compared to the size of these three apertures. SA of the pupil is nicely corrected. Image quality is optimized: flat tangential field. I tried substituting BAK4 glass in the prisms, and it scarcely makes any difference to the nominal image quality, so judgement of the image quality isn't impaired by having not measured the density of the prisms to guess their composition. Had they used BAK4, however, they probably would have achieved better unwanted light rejection. Overall, the design clearly looks like a derivative of the Nikko 10x70, although it is not just a scaled version of the Nikko. Regards, Dick Buchroeder. ========================== There is a large selection of binoculars for sale at a German retailer in Augsburg: http://www.intercon-spacetec.com/fernglas/ Including a couple of unusual models: Miyauchi 26x100 (2.5 degree) & 37x100 (1.8 degree), with 45 degree or 90 degree offset. =========================== From: DeutOptik@___m A few things from our end. New catalogue (Spring 2000) now in mail. Of particular note is the new wide angle 10x45BGA from Optolyth. Early indications are excellent, and pricing is well within the reasonable range for this type of premium quality. Also noteworthy is an interesting circular published by the Koblenz Technical Museum detailing its collection of wartime optics. Not surprisingly, it's all in German, but it includes some very helpful data sheets and an excellent variety of photos quite useful for identification purposes. Another noteworthy interesting contact: an individual in Sarajevo representing himself as associated with the Bosnian optical industry. In addition to alot of assault rifle scopes, they make a spitting image of the porro prism DF 7x40 binocular made by Carl Zeiss-Jena and much lauded by almost everyone. Evidently, this plant must have been set up back in the good ol' days, and plans for this instrument (and others) were handed over to the then-Yugoslavians at that time. Anybody know anything about this facility? Finally (and back to the Website), we've recently added an auction capability, and I'm wondering whether there is any reason to make this service available at no cost to your readers. While still occasionally productive, ebay has become rather sluggish with much clutter to wade through, descriptions that are almost comical, and estimates of condition that are unreliable at best. If anyone is interested, we'll be happy to test with a few nice pieces we have laying around and see whether the response justifies the effort. Please let me know. Anyone in the group interested in these (below)? I will order on everyone's behalf if there is an appetite. --Mike .....

Delft, reviews, Australia ======================================================= From: SCSambrook@___m Subject: Old Delft Ware Thanks for posting out my request for info on WW 1 British optical munitions, and thanks to all those who have so kindly responded. An acquaintance has just shown me a 20x 50 mirror-telescope by OLD DELFT. Although obviously not a binocular, I thought members might be interested, or might even know all about it ! This is about 10.25 inches long when focused on infinity, just over 2 inches diameter, with sliding-tube eyepiece focus.Although I wasn;t able to weigh it, it was very light - I guess no more than 12 ounces, or ca. 350 grams. It was still quite bright and sharp, although having fungus growing merrily inside it. It was in what looked like an original (but unmarked) case with a metal re-inforcing collar at the objective end. I've never seen one of these, and don't ever remember seeing them advertised in the U.K. Serial number was 524,775 and it didn't appear to have coated lenses, so perhap's it was made pre-1950 ? I do remember that the firm was Dutch ( mmm, now that's not too hard to keep in mind, is it?), made camera lenses, and was also known as 'OUDE DELFT' Somewhere in my mind, I think I remember that they made astonomical telescopes. I suppose this 'spotting scope' is a junior relative of their astro scopes. Although it's an unkind thing to say, despite its quality it looked, well, 'cheap'. The sort of thing you might buy at a militaria fair for very little money ... ! Which I suspect was what its new owner had just done. But back to binoculars ... modern ones, which is a change for me ! Has anyone any experience of the Russian 7x 30 military type binocular which is presently seen in various eBay ads - at various prices. This one doesn't seem to be on sale in Britain. Looking at the advertisers' illustrations there seems to be two types of eyepieces - but that might just be the photos. Best wishes, Stephen Sambrook ------------------- Old Delft was associated with Albert Bouwers, who during WWII independently invented a telescope that became known as the Maksutov. He also made a few binoculars with his optical system. --Peter =============================== Subject: Various reviews There are some articles on using modern giant binoculars, including the Fujinon 25 and 40 x 150s and the Nikon 20 x 120; at www.cloudynights.com, a site by Allister St. Claire.

Professor Kerr Grant, the Elder Professor of Physics, founded a group to recondition binoculars for the armed forces. 1943 graduate Miss Mary Howie has kindly provided a photograph of the binocular cleaners: The group was formed by professor Kerr Grant in 1942 and rooms were allotted in the Physics Department for the work. The army sent the binoculars in after use, mainly from New Guinea as the lenses became mouldy so quickly there. The groups was formed mainly of University students with a few others who were accustomed to working with optical lenses. We were paid a nominal wage. I worked for ten weeks for a total of \u00a330/0/9! - Modified from an article originally published in the Adelaidean, 4 July 1994. ============================== Subject: More humor from ebay ------- http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280824719 zoom range...20x to 120x.

Russian 7x30s, fungus, Koblenz book, export taxes, giants =========================================== Subject: Re: Russian 7x30 binoculars From: Fan Tao\nI have one of the Russian military 7x30 binoculars you asked about. Mine is a recent one, with a 1996 date code. It is possible that the earlier ones marked with a red star as pictured in Seeger have a different eyepiece design, but I haven't seen one in person so I can't say. My comments apply to the model I have. I am very impressed with the eyepiece design. They have an apparent field of view of slightly less than 60 degrees and are very well corrected for linear distortion - that is, straight lines stay straight across the field. There is some debate on whether this type of distortion correction (versus angular distortion) is desirable in binoculars, but I like the nearly distortion free, flat field. You can adjust the focus of the eyepieces so that practically the entire field is in sharp focus - something I've rarely seen in binoculars. The eye relief is amazing at over 20mm, though the rubber eye shields don't really fold down, so they should be removed if you use glasses. As for drawbacks, the image has a yellowish tinge, and the coatings are not as good as the best I've seen. There is a very similar 10x42 model made by the same factory, (Kazan Optical Mechanical Plant) which I think is slightly better, though more expensive and harder to find. The Russian 10x42's have the sharpest edge performance of any binoculars with a 60 degree AFOV I've seen, and that includes the Nikon 10x42SE. The same drawbacks apply, plus the 10x42's are bulkier. Fan Tao ======================================== Subject: Fungus on lenses From: \"R.F.Bolton\"\nRecently I was discussing fungus on lens elements with a fellow repairer and he put forward the theory that what is commonly called fungus is result of the coating process. The theory goes that as Magnesium Fluoride is used for coating lens's there is 'something' left on the surface that mixes/reacts with the humidity and forms Fluoric acid and it is this that causes the physical damage (etching) to the lens elements. I plead ignorance in this area, but if correct it would explain why the damage to a lens surface is out of all proportion to the physical strength of the fungus on the lens surface. Would anyone be able to expand or shoot down this idea? Rod. ==== From: Peter Abrahams I have heard that coating can have an effect, but I have seen uncoated lenses with fungus (fine irregular lines on the lens surface that radiate from a central point and do not clean off). Damp environment certainly makes it worse. Yoder, Paul. Opto-Mechanical Systems Design. N.Y.: Marcel Dekker, 1986, p45-6: \"glass components...exposed for long periods to warmth and high humidity, films and localized deposits of mold may develop....degrade performance by introducing scatter...later they may permanently damage optical surfaces by etching patterns into the material....Mold fungi have been found to germinate and grow on glass surfaces even though the surfaces had been thoroughly cleaned to remove fingerprints, dust particles, and lubricants...spores seem to be able to supply sufficient nutrients internally to support limited growth. Some glasses with high resistance to climate and acid seem to resist fungus as well....The chemical compositioin of the glass plays a role in mold susceptibility....natural organic compounds condensed on surfaces of glass and steel could serve as nutrient sources....fungicides as mold preventive agents on optics...silicone films containing arsenic, mercury or tin resisted fungus tests for 3 to 4 months, whereas unprotected optics of the same glasses were overgrown with fungus within 1 month of the same test. U.S. Military Specification MIL-STD-810 defines tests for optics to determine their ability to withstand fungal contamination.\" ====================================== Subject: Koblenz book From: Fan Tao\nFor those interested in the booklet from the military museum in Koblenz (available from Deutsche Optik in the U.S.), it has 30 pages of binoculars and 40 pages showing periscopes, rangefinders, and telescopic sights, all used by the German military from WWI to the present. The text is in German but that is not a major problem for those who don't understand it because most of the information is given in the form of black and white photos and specifications. Although several important models are not present, such as the Zeiss 8x60's, I would recommend this booklet for the serious collector. Fan Tao ======================================= Subject: Japanese export programs From: Peter Abrahams The incredible progress made by Japanese optical manufacturers after WWII is due to many factors, including quality of product & willingness to work with buyers. Japan also instituted a tax system that greatly favored manufacturers of good for export. I recently found an American study that details this: Donnelly, George R. The Development of the Japanese Photographic Products Industry, 1954-1958. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Commerce, 1959. On page 8, the following figures are presented: During the period June 1956 through December 1957, exporters & manufacturers could deduct from total income, 80 (eighty) percent of income from export trade. This is for companies who derive all income from export, and deductions for companies with domestic sales are more complex. This deduction was limited to 50 percent until June 13, 1956. Japan had otherwise 'high corporate income tax'. Other benefits include establishing a tax-free export loss reserve account, of 1 percent of total export contracts. Overseas facilities could deduct 50 percent of the cost of land, machinery, and leased buildings; and depreciation of purchased buildings was set at 150 percent of 'normal'. Also noted: exporters must sell a camera at the price shown on the export invoice, and can not use rebates or similar to 'unfairly price' a unit, penalties are 30 percent of the value of the shipment. Domestic sales of cameras total about 60 percent of total output in 1956. ------------------------------- Donnelly, George R. The Development of the West German Photographic Products Industry, 1954-1959. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Commerce, 1960. West German camera makers sold about 60 percent of their total output as exports in the late 1950s. No governmental assistance is provided to manufacturers in promoting export sales. No tax concessions are given, except a refund of 4 percent of the 6 percent 'turnover tax' levied when goods change hands. Some of these differences are due to the 'General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade' and the rules of the European Economic Community. 48 hour work weeks were in effect until Sept. 1957, when they were reduced. =================================== Subject: Giant binoculars on the web: A retailer of Fujinons, Chinese models, and others: www.bigbinoculars.com or http://www.oberwerk.com/bigbinos/ A long review of the \"I.T.E.

Meeting in L.A. May 25; The List ================================= From: Peter Abrahams We are planning a meeting of binocular enthusiasts & collectors in Los Angeles on Thurs. May 25, or possibly May 29 if more people can come that day. This is Memorial Day weekend, and not the greatest time to travel, but these 2 days are adjacent to the Riverside Telescope Maker's Conference, when at least a few list members will be in the L.A. area. We will again meet at Steve Rohans, and again plan to have inspection of historic binoculars, presentations of papers, 'show & tell', a swap meet, and more. Please reply (soon) if you will attend or are likely to be there. =============== From: Peter Abrahams The list has been very useful to me, and I am happy with the status quo. However, it has not evolved as I expected. Most e-mail lists are plagued by endless discussions, big talkers, off-topic posts, and too much traffic. We don't have any of those problems. But we are not gaining from the expertise of our membership, which was the motivation behind starting the list (I didn't start it to practice typing but to learn from others.) I know that many people just aren't big writers; and of course we have heard from some list members. But a typical week sees no email to the list. We need to consider whether another format would cause members to participate more frequently. I have heard one opinion on this; that if we had an immediate delivery of e-mail, people would write more often. If we could find someone to assume the duties of running listserv software, we could have a 'normal' list. We could also have this if we went to egroups / onelist, which adds a small advertisement at the end of each post. I belong to a couple of these lists, and it does function well, but there are enough small problems that I'm not enthused about these commercial lists. I'm going to continue the list in the present format (and we've only had one person quit, out of 85 or so members). But let us know if you'd prefer egroups or another alternative. And remember that there are only a very few people who know very much about the history of binoculars; how could it be otherwise when there are so few books on the subject. Please don't be shy about questions, and feel free to post any scrap of knowledge that you have. ================================== ================================================ Binocular List #98: 12 April 2000. Meeting, Kershaw, Aberdeen ============================================== Subject: Meeting in L.A. It looks like we will meet at Steve Rohan's in the afternoon & evening on Thurs. May 25. Attendees include Steve, Dick Martin, Frank Doherty, Marc Norman, Peter Abrahams, and probably Jack Kelly. ========================= Subject: British binoculars From: SCSambrook@___m KERSHAW SERVICE BINOCULAR SERIALS: Bino. No.3 (6x 24) 1917 - low number 32,140; high number 34,667 1918 - low number 37,242; high number 61,024 Bino No.2 (8x 30) 1937 - only number 8,461 no date 102,705 1941 - only number 107,677 1942 - low number 130,605; high number 155,633 1943 - low number 174,654; high number 216,924 1944 - low number 239,563; high number 308,915 1945 - low number 314,688; high number 335,429 Some of these numbers came by other list members, which was very much appreciated. The dearth of numbers between 8,461 and 102,705 (which I guess is either late 1941 or 1942) may perhaps represent heavy losses and attrition during 1940, but then again, they may all be hidden away somewhere ! Kershaw was the most prolific maker of 6x 30s in WW2 Britain, with Taylor Hobson not far behind. If anyone comes across either type, I'd be pleased to have numbers for them, and of course, the dates. As you will know by now, I am plodding away at unearthing the story of the British binocular industry, along with finishing a thesis on the Optical Munitions Industry in Britain up to 1919. I wonder if any member knows anything about US binocular manufacturers' sources of supply of optical glass between 1914 and 1919 ? I have references to both Britain and France delivering optical glass, but wonder if shipments continued from Germany after August 1914 ? British Customs & Excise records show small deliveries of glass to Britain from Germany right through the whole of the Great War... And ... does anyone know of any information on the Crown Optical Company of Rochester ? Both Crown and Bausch & Lomb had British contracts for 6x 30s, but for as yet undiscovered reasons Crown were the preferred supplier ... although only peripherally relevant, I would like to trace any background information. Best wishes Stephen =================================== Subject: Optical Testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground From: Peter Abrahams A booklet sold recently that raises some questions: Ordnance School. Foreign Materiel, volume 3. (fire control instruments & sighting equipment, German & Japanese, B.C. scopes, range & height finders) Published by The Ordnance School: Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, July 1943. (OS 9-61, vol. 3) 100p. This has photos, breakdown photos, and brief descriptions of use for these instruments: German: aiming circle Rkr 31; B.C. type stereoscopic telescope; range finder EM 34; illumination lamp for fire control instruments; Z.F. antitank telescope; 81mm mortar sight. Japanese: coincidence range finder 75cm base; stereoscopic height finder 2m base. This is vol. 3 of a series, the first two concerned foreign small arms & artillery. They were written for use in courses taught at The Ordnance School. Subsequent volumes were planned. The question is: How extensive was the optical research done at Aberdeen? ----------------- The only information I could find on-line are these scraps: Since 1917, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) has been a military center for research, development and testing of Army material including vehicles, ordnance and weaponry. US Army Ordance Museum, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Building 2601, Interstate 95, Exit 85, East on Route 22, Aberdeen, Maryland 21005-5201, Phone: (410) 278-3602 (No Web Site found) The museum contains an impressive collection of over 200 tanks, artillery pieces, armored vehicles, etc. The museum is open seven days a week (except Federal holidays) from 10:00 am to 4:45 pm. I phoned the museum & spoke with their historian. He said that most optical firing aids were 'ordnance', but that binoculars would not be in that category. In 1962, Aberdeen's older records were shipped off to an archive or to 'Materiel Command'. He was not aware of any optical testing but the lab at Aberdeen was extensive & capable of such tests. --Peter =========================================== ============================================ Binocular List #99: 14 April 2000. US optical glass, Japanese J- codes ============================================= Subject: US manufacture of optical glass From: optical-repair\nWith the declaration of war, the European sources of supply for optical glass and for optical instruments to the U.S. were cut off abruptly. There were only three main sources of optical glass from 1914 to 1918. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. produced over 65%, the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. nearly 20%, the Spencer Lens Co. nearly 10%; the remaining 5% was produced by other firms, including the Bureau of Standards. In contract negotiations, it was determined that B&L quantity and quality were superior to that of Crown Optical. However, the Board of Optical Munitions felt principally opposed to dealing with Bausch & Lomb, both because of their German ties and their German sounding name! Take it easy, Earl Osborn Osborn Optical Systems/Osborn Optical Repair ============================== Subject: Japanese JB and JE code Most Japanese binoculars from the 1960s and several decades later carry one or two tiny marks on the body, about 2 mm in height, frequently adjacent to the hinge axis on the rear, between the objectives. 'JB' and two or three digits identifies the manufacturer of the finished binocular, and 'JE' identifies the maker of the body. The J symbol has a small horizontal line extending from the middle of the J, and is explained in a pamphlet from the Japan Binoculars Export Promotion Association, _'63 Binoculars From Japan_. \"Combining the letters L and J (standing for Light Machinery of Japan)......on the shoulder hinges or support strut of all approved binoculars manufactured in Japan since November 1959.\" The JBEPA had their US office in the Japan Trade Center, 393 Fifth Ave, NY. Collectors have owned paper copies of a list identifying the companies, but due to the many complicated Japanese names, no one wanted to type it into a computer.

Aberdeen, J-list, Reicherts ================================== Subject: Aberdeen Proving Grounds, U.S. Army Ordnance School From: Peter Abrahams In my bookshelf I found a publication from Aberdeen: U.S. Army Ordnance School, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. 'Elements of Optics and Optical Instruments', September 1959, ST 9-2601-1. 71 pages. It is a simple, general text, with nothing on binoculars, but it does show that the ordnance school did have an optical facility. There is an unusual binocular that was sold with the note that it came from Aberdeen. It is 15 power, but not so marked, and has 70 mm coated objectives mounted on long extensions. It is built on a Mk 21 body (B & L or Kollsman 7 x 50). The only mark is 3554-L, on both eye pieces. In addition to eye piece focus, both objectives can be focused by rotating, a groove is cut in the barrel to engage a screw through the objective cell. There is a third hinge between the objectives. This binocular is very well made, with a fitted wood case. It now belongs to Bob Bibb and can be seen at: http://home.europa.com/~telscope/15x70%601.jpg 81 kb http://home.europa.com/~telscope/15x70%603.jpg 77 kb Needless to say, any clues about the origin of this binocular would be greatly appreciated. ================================== Subject: The J-list From: Peter Abrahams In 1979, Bill Beacom wrote to the Japan Binoculars Export Promotion Association in N.Y., asking for information on imported binoculars. They referred him to their Japanese home office, who sent a copy of the JB list discussed in list 99, in the Japanese language. The paper was folded, and several names were creased & illegible, which is why we have no 65, 66, and 209. There is a small college for Japanese students nearby to Bill, where a student was found to translate the text. This is the copy that has found wide circulation among collectors and is now posted on the web. These J marks are usually found between the objectives, but are also found on the prism plate, visible through the objective. ============================== Subject: Question on the Reicherts From: Peter Abrahams Robert & Elsa Reichert found a compact binocular called the 'Mirakel' at a German sales show in 1923. They imported it to the U.S. and began their Mirakel company of Mt. Vernon, N.Y., which included a repair shop with a collimator designed & built by them, and which offered lens coating just after WWII. The Reicherts manufactured a binocular: computed the optical system, designed the instrument, produced the optics and body, and sold the product. What were the name & specifications of this binocular? Do we have any list members who knew them & can tell us something about them? ============================= Subject: 100 lists From: Peter Abrahams We now have 100 lists, and when printed out in small fonts & no margins the total is about 180 pages. The list was the basis for the first US meeting of binocular collectors. There are 75 recipients, from Australia to England, France, & Italy. Contacts at ebay have brought in 20 or 30 of the members. Apparently very few of them know how to type, but that's OK. There's always the next 75 members & the next 100 lists. I've had some feedback to my griping & most of the respondents like the low noise & absence of idle chatter. I belong to 8 email lists about telescopes, devoted to these topics: Astro- Physics, Questar, amateur astronomy scopes, telescope making, very large telescope making, buying & selling, large Dobsonian telescopes, and the history of the telescope. There are others as well. Not to mention the history of astronomy list & the scientific instrument list, which are quite valuable. Needless to say, I mostly delete messages, though there is enough education mixed in with the chatter & misinformation, that I stay the course. But it makes me very aware that any 'binocular email list' that was widely known would absolutely drown in idle questions & arguments, and the first thing that happens with increased traffic is that the most informed & valuable people make their exit. For some reason, binoculars haven't caused this kind of proliferation of lists. It's hard to explain, since there are many more users of binoculars than telescopes. \"Egroups\" has even established two categories for 'binoculars' (recreation equipment & consumer information), but no one has started a group within these categories: this despite the many thousands of groups that are in the egroups site. It is certainly a mystery to binocular enthusiasts. --Peter ===================================== 3\n"}], [{"score": 145.31361, "uuid": "05615696-c665-5786-b379-23a1d06c8a10", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-42-08475", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/albuquerque-journal-continues-its-stance-against-police-department", "page_rank": 1.2129338e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Albuquerque Journal continues its stance against police department |", "snippet": "If that figure is accurate, then the Albuquerque Police Department <em>should</em> be in <em>a</em> position to pick and choose the cream of the crop instead of the pig in the poke.

It doesn\u2019t take a legal scholar to determine that Officer Daniel Guzman was way out of line in arresting KOB-TV videographer Rick Foley.\nAccording to the editorial, Guzman makes a whopping $58,000 a year, which is an astronomical figure for a rookie cop in one of the nation\u2019s poorest states.\nIf that figure is accurate, then the Albuquerque Police Department should be in a position to pick and choose the cream of the crop instead of the pig in the poke.\nBelow is an exert from the editorial:\nThis is what we\u2019re forking over $58,000 a year for?

When a criminal is truly dangerous?\nOr when there\u2019s no camera to record everything?\nLast week, the Albuquerque Journal published an article saying that Officer Guzman \u201cattacked\u201d Foley without even using the word \u201callegedly\u201d, which is pretty bold for a mainstream newspaper.\nHere is the entire editorial. If the Albuquerque Journal requires you to give up your first born before it allows you to read the article as it sometimes does, just click the link below where I cut and paste the editorial.\nIs It So Hard for APD To Police Its Own?\nIf a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video of a rookie Albuquerque Police Department officer lunging at a news photographer on a public street is worth at least an unpaid suspension and consideration of criminal charges.\nKOB-TV cameraman Rick Foley was outside a police line early Thursday, covering an officer-involved shooting near Copper and Charleston NE. He says he asked officers repeatedly where to go for the official media briefing. His video shows that when he finally got an answer, he popped off to officer Daniel Guzman, \u201cWas that so hard?\u201d and asked for the officer\u2019s name and badge number.\nAnd that, apparently, was enough to earn Foley a hard shove and 90 minutes in handcuffs. Guzman claims Foley was \u201csticking his camera in my face,\u201d but the video only shows Guzman pacing like a panther around Foley, then lunging at him.\nKOB-TV news director Rhonda Aubrey says the station has been playing the video on its newscasts and Web site because \u201cof the way our photographer was treated. He was out on a public street, he was not interfering with a police investigation, and he was not behind a police line. We are airing (the video) so people can draw their own conclusions.\u201d\nOne conclusion is that APD isn\u2019t taking this seriously enough. Chief Ray Schultz says he wants the city\u2019s independent review officer to investigate the incident and \u201cif the officer is wrong, we will clearly take responsibility for it and address it.\u201d\nAs Foley\u2019s camera lens shows Guzman coming at him, then is knocked to focus on the ground, bounced up to show the surrounding neighborhood, then again down to show pavement, here\u2019s something APD can also address:\nThis is what we\u2019re forking over $58,000 a year for?

However, we need to remain diligent with our duties and contact them to obtain as much information as possible, without giving the impression we are interrogating them. Take the information and log it on your daily log with the reason they are taking photos. If they are acting suspicious complete a full 36 card and place it in my box. This will let the citizens know we are paying attention to this type of activity.\nThe memo was written last year, which explains why Phoenix police have been accused of being heavy handed towards photographers. But this memo was restricted to personnel working at Central Station, which is the bus and light rail terminal in downtown Phoenix.\nIt makes one wonder what is stated in the memo sent to personnel working the Sandra Day O\u2019Connor Federal Courthouse, which police and security guards believe is forbidden to photograph .\nSince the news reports about harassment at Central Station have surfaced, Phoenix police say they are going to draft a new memo that would be less intrusive for photographers.\nPhoenix police are in the process of softening the directive slightly since media reports about the photographer who was questioned, says Phoenix police Lt. Anthony Lopez of the transit bureau. Lopez says Central Station\u2019s supervisory officer, Sgt. Scot Gillespie, wrote the memo last year that spurred the municipal security guards to begin contacting more picture-takers.\n"}, {"score": 138.25858, "uuid": "5810425d-e030-5a19-8df3-832671b10f9c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0910wb-14-01922", "target_hostname": "www.pixiq.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pixiq.com/article/aperture-or-lightroom", "page_rank": 1.1818586e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Is Apple turning its back on photographers? | Pixiq", "snippet": "There are <em>a</em> couple of subjective reasons <em>for</em> that; Ultimately, <em>I</em> <em>prefer</em> the workflow tools offered up by Lightroom <em>over</em> those built into Aperture, and <em>I</em> like how well-integrated Lightroom and Photoshop CS5 are, <em>for</em> the times when <em>I</em> need editing that&#x27;s beyond Lightroom&#x27;s very capable hands.", "explanation": null, "document": "Is Apple turning its back on photographers?\nThe perennial Apple Aperture or Adobe Lightroom question takes a detour down philosophy lane\nTweet\nI've been thinking about this article for a very long time; I've been using both pieces of software for a while, and I think I've now conclusively made my choice: Adobe Lightroom it is.\nThere are a couple of subjective reasons for that; Ultimately, I prefer the workflow tools offered up by Lightroom over those built into Aperture, and I like how well-integrated Lightroom and Photoshop CS5 are, for the times when I need editing that's beyond Lightroom's very capable hands.\nApple always had the edge over Lightroom when it comes to pricing; but back in January, Apple took out their machetes and slashed the price even further: the price of Aperture plummeted from $199 to \u00a378.99 (when purchased via the App Store), whilst Lightroom is still retailing at $299.\nSo, it becomes very hard to recommend one piece of software over the other: They are both capable, and they both have their flaws. The price difference may sway some people (and PC users are out of luck altogether; no Aperture for Windows...), but ultimately, I think the question is very different indeed.\nApple doesn't care about its professional users.\nFor various reasons, I've been reading and learning more about the film and TV industry\u00a0 (What? Pictures? That move? I can barely get one photo per hour right, never mind 24 pictures per second. You must be out of your mind), and they've been burned by Apple several times now.\nYou may have spotted the phenomenal backlash recently when Apple launched their new Final Cut Pro, which set the film industry a-bristle. Instead of having two versions of the software; Final Cut Express for the 'prosumer' market and Final Cut Pro for the, well, 'pro' market, they consilidated the software packages back into one. For Express users, that was pretty good news, because for not-a-lot-of-extra-money, they got a lot of extra functionality.\nProfessional users, however, were not so lucky. Conan O'Brien's editors got a minute of prime-time to whine about the software , and both the app store reviews and the professionals have trashed it for being a monster-leap backwards. The\u00a0 reviewers for the mainstream media, however, generally reviewed it quite favourably. The message is clear: It's still one hell of a capable software editing package, but it's no longer fit for purpose for professional use.\nIf this was an once-off occurrence, we might have forgiven Apple, but it isn't. There was another piece of software that was of extreme importance; again to the film industry. Shake was aimed squarely at the professional market, and was used for visual effects and compositing - that is, putting the different pieces of digital footage together into a single frame. You know; adding explosions, and adding backgrounds to shots, that sort of thing.\nWhen Apple announced they were unceremoniously closing the doors on Shake , it shook up the market - several huge film productions - multi-million dollar projects - were completely relying on Shake to get completed. To this day, there are special effect studios who had their tools so deeply integrated with Apple's software that they haven't been able to disentangle themselves; including playing an important role in Weta's production of the blockbuster Avatar, for example. And this despite the fact that the last version of the software was launched in November of 2008 - that's 3 years ago. I'm willing to bet that most of us don't run any 3-year-old software, never mind one of the most popular entertainment industries in the world.\nThe other big entertainment industry - the music business - also have a software package covered by Apple; Logic Pro. The rumour mill is already spinning that the current version of the software (which was launched in July of 2009) is about to receive an update, reportedly labelled Logic Pro X. Perhaps predictably, current Logic Pro users are already in fear about what Apple might be doing to their beloved piece of software .\nBut, can't you just use the old software instead?\nOf course, a simple counter-argument to all of the above is \"if you don't like the new software, why don't you simply not upgrade\"? It is true that this is a workable solution for a while, but the truth of the matter is that software slowly loses its lustre over time: Competitors will bring out features and technology that doesn't exist in the old versions of the software, and without the updates, your software cannot benefit from technology advances that happen in the meantime.\nWorst of all, 'unsupported' software is just that - unsupported. So, if something should go horribly wrong with your files, and you are unable to figure out what is going on, nobody is able to help you: A simple query will be deflected with \"What version of the software are you using\". If your answer is \"an old version\", then they won't help you. And rightly so, I think: If you call up a web developer today to tell them their site doesn't look right in Internet Explorer 7, the only appropriate answer, in my opinion, is \"Why are you using a piece of software that was introduced in 2006, and has been obsolete since 2009\"?\nEr, aren't we meant to be talking about photography here?\nSo what does all of this got to do with photography? Well, when Aperture was first launched back in 2005, it was seen as a bit of a curious beast. Taking a look now at the news around its launch, it's funny to see how news writers couldn't quite make sense of it. http://bit.ly/nUSQox . For one thing, it cost a whopping $499, and it was aimed squarely at professional photographers. Six years ago, it made sense, when Apple were still the underdog; the go-to brand for graphic designers and photographers alike.\nSteve Jobs may well have saved Apple when they were at the brink of bankruptcy , against all odds. However, things have changed a lot in Cupertino since then. From being a fringe hardware manufacturer, they've gone well and truly mainstream: iPods, iPhones, Apple TV, the iTunes music store, not to mention the billions and billions of applications sold for iOS devices like the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\nIt's hard to imagine any company that is more mainstream than Apple these days; and the software the company is releasing is reflecting that. Instead of innovating, developing and launching industrial-grade tools for professional users, Apple are ramming home their 'simplicity' approach to things. Which is lovely if you are my mother, but not so much if you are a professional artist of any sort.\nApple are making powerful tools more available to the mainstream, which is a good thing for their stockholders: Obviously, it's better to sell a million copies of a piece of software at $80 per copy, than it is to sell fifty copies at $499. What does appear to be the case, however, is that the accountants have taken over the asylum at Apple, and that software engineers are no longer allowed to push the envelope onwards and upwards.\nIf you ask me, it's only a matter of time before Aperture starts looking more like iPhoto than a professional piece of photo editing software.\nAs much as I love Apple, I simply don't trust them not to turn their back on me, the professional photographer, and turn instead to the other 200 people who live in my block of flats. After all, why should they bother selling me one copy, when they can sell them two hundred?\nSo where does that leave Adobe?\nIf there's one thing you could never accuse Adobe of, it is to simplify their software. Lightroom will, over the coming years, undoubtedly slowly grow out of control with more and more features and more and more bloat. However, as professional photographers, I think we can handle the occasional hardware upgrade to cope with the additional load it'll put on our computers. As a professional, I can trust Adobe to leave all the tools where I need them; right at my fingertips.\nAnd for that 1400-word reason, I'll stick to Adobe Lightroom for the foreseeable future.\nDo you enjoy a smattering of random photography links?

For him, the craft and the art of photography are paramount, yet nothing is more important than presenting his beloved wilderness to viewers so that they might be moved to act on its behalf. For him, all of nature is a context, each tiny element of critical importance to the magnificence of the whole. It is this connectedness he seeks, an idea he presents in the book, Plateau Light. \u201cWhen photographing, I tune in to the natural rhythms and pulse of the land . . . to communicate and champion the stark beauty that is nature \u2013 its wildness, its opposites . . .\u201d As James Lawrence wrote in the text for Plateau Light, \u201cMuench\u2019s international reputation derives from an unflinching embrace of nature\u2019s nuances.

It is this connectedness he seeks, an idea he presents in the book, Plateau Light. \u201cWhen photographing, I tune in to the natural rhythms and pulse of the land . . . to communicate and champion the stark beauty that is nature \u2013 its wildness, its opposites . . .\u201d As James Lawrence wrote in the text for Plateau Light, \u201cMuench\u2019s international reputation derives from an unflinching embrace of nature\u2019s nuances. He engages the primal landscape across all the human fronts: as thinker, dreamer, seeker, lover, lifelong friend.\u201d Long intimate with America\u2019s wild places, in recent years Muench has expanded outward across the globe, photographing in Antarctica, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Japan, Morocco, South Africa, the Galapagos, Patagonia, Russia, Belarus. \u201cI am inspired by the power and beauty of the primal landscape,\u201d Muench says. \u201cIn the unending experience it offers of light, space and time, I engage in my equally unending search for sublime beauty.\u201d Muench\u2019s work has been exhibited in numerous museums and galleries, including the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and Mountain Light Gallery in Bishop, California.

This is a safety feature, because the only way to cancel the erase before it starts is to click the cancel button on that window.\nOnce you are satisfied that you have downloaded all the photos from the camera (or a specific folder), you can erase them and reuse the memory for new photos. Selecting \"Erase All Pictures\" starts a short countdown and then proceeds to erase the photos in the selected folder.\nDownloading & Troubleshooting\nClick on the \"Start Download\" button to download all the photos from the camera. The button will change to \"Abort Download\". Note that you can continue working on your computer while the download is progressing. Just leave Cameraid running and your photos will download in the background.\nThe status area will show you how the download is progressing. If it stops at \"waking up camera\", you should check the cables and connections and make sure the settings are correct. Most cameras also have to be turned on to be able to respond to the computer.\nOnce the download starts, you will be prompted for a location for the photos. All the images will be stored in the same folder. Cameraid will never overwrite an old file, so if you want, you can use the same folder over and over again and just add photos there. (Note that the Finder may become slower if you store a lot of files into a single folder.)\nNote: your computer may need the SerialDMA update from Apple Computer to be able to connect to the digital camera. A quote from the read me file for serial DMA 2.1: \"SerialDMA 2.1 extension works with U.S. English Mac OS 7.6.1, 8.0, or 8.1, and any of the following Mac OS computers: Power Macintosh 4400,Power Macintosh 5500, Power Macintosh 6500, Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, Power Macintosh 7220, Power Macintosh G3, PowerBook 2400,PowerBook 3400, PowerBook G3, or PowerBook G3 Series.\"\nIf you are not experiencing any problems even though you have one of the above machines (like me), you do not necessarily need to install the update. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\nTroubleshooting Checklist:\nMake sure the camera is turned on and has power (good batteries).\nVerify that the cable is firmly connected at both ends.\nVerify that the serial port you selected in Cameraid matches the physical connection.\nIf communications doesn't work at 230 400 bps, try 57 600 bps.\nWith Keyspan cards and adapters, use the default buffer settings for the serial port - they work best.\nYour machine may need the SerialDMA update (applies only to built-in Apple serial ports on certain PowerPC machines).\nIf you have problems using the printer port, try the modem port instead - it's often more reliable at high speeds.\nIf you are using USB, connect the serial port adapter directly to the computer instead of going through a hub (such as the keyboard on an iMac).\nNikon Coolpix cameras may sometimes appear to lock up after a download. If this happens, reset the camera by opening and closing the battery compartment.\nIf the program returns to idle status almost immediately, the download folder has probably not been set correctly. See above for details.\nMemory Card Readers\nA card reader is probably one of the best peripherals you can get, if you own a digital camera.\nMemory cards are getting larger, but serial ports aren't getting any faster, so download times are growing longer and longer.\nMemory cards readers are possibly up to 100 times faster than the serial port alone (YMMV). Instead of minutes, the time to copy images from the card is reduced to mere seconds (in most cases under a minute).\nCameraid supports most memory card readers through a set of items in the Shortcuts menu. To be compatible with Cameraid, the memory card reader has to be able to mount the card as a \"disk drive\" on the desktop.\nNote: If your camera doesn't have removable memory cards, you can't use a memory card reader to read the photos.\nNote: Card readers may require additional drivers. Make sure the card reader you get is supported by the operating system. In particular, MacOS X support may not be as widely available as support for MacOS 9 and older.\nFirewire\nFirewire card readers are probably the fastest way to transfer photos. If your Mac has a PCI slot available and is running a sufficiently recent operating system (some say MacOS 8.6, others claim MacOS 9, so this may be card-specific), you can add Firewire ports to your Mac. I have seen Mac-compatible Firewire PCI cards for as little as $10+shipping.\nUSB\nFor machines without serial ports, USB card readers are an excellent choice. They are available for all existing memory card types. Just like Firewire, USB ports can be added to Macs with available PCI slots. Combination USB+Firewire cards are also available at a somewhat higher cost.\nIn general, USB card readers tend to be cheaper than Firewire versions. For most needs, even USB 1.1 is adequate, since it provides a transfer rate of approximately 1 MB/s.\nSCSI\nSCSI card readers are extremely hard to find these days and tend to be costly. It's probably cheaper to get a USB or Firewire interface card (if you have a PCI slot available) and get an external card reader for one of those interfaces.\nOld information: For machines with SCSI ports, the Minolta CD-10 is a good choice. The product itself has been discontinued, so you may have to look for a used one. Note that it's a PC-card reader, so you'll need adapters for smaller memory cards. This is in addition to the cost of the reader itself (add at least about $10 for CompactFlash and about $50 for SmartMedia). It comes with a cable, but depending on your configuration, you may need an additional cable.\nPowerBooks\nMost recent PowerBooks already have PC-card (or PCMCIA) slots, so all you need is an adapter for the type of media that you use. CompactFlash adapters are very simple and cost only around $10 while SmartMedia adapters are more complicated and usually cost around $50. No driver software is needed - just insert the card and it should work OK. For this reason, most new PowerBooks are excellent companions to Digital Cameras.\nOperation\nWhen you insert the card into the reader, you can manipulate the photos just as if they were on hard disk. You could use the Finder to copy the files, but to make the card usable again, you need to delete the files. Dragging them to the trash isn't enough - you have to empty the trash as well or they will still take space on the card!\nWith Cameraid, you can use the three supplied shortcuts to make it easier to work with memory cards.\nStart cameraid and insert the memory card (in whatever order you like).\nIf you have the viewer window open, close it now so that no images are open.\nSelect the \"Open Images on Untitled\" shortcut (or hit Command-U).\nAn image should now appear in the viewer (all the others are there too, if you want to browse them)\nSelect \"Copy and Delete Images\" from the menu and specify a target folder for the copies. Cameraid will copy the images one by one and delete images it has successfully copied from the memory card.\nUse either the Finder or the shortcut \"Put Away Untitled\" to eject the memory card (keyboard shortcut Command-Y).\nIf you need to copy several memory cards worth of images, go back to step 1. Remember to close the viewer window before you open the images from the card: if you don't, you'll end up copying the same images over and over (no harm done, except it takes a bit of time to do the copy).\nIf you want to rotate the images using the lossless JPEG transforms, you should be able to do so at any stage. I recommend doing it after step 5 so that the rotated images are never stored on the memory card.\nCameraid will automatically rename the images when it copies them. If you want to add icons or previews, use another batch processor shortcut to do so after you have copied the images.\nThe memory card should be empty and ready for use after you eject it. It's still a good idea to reformat the card in the camera every now and then. (If you have any Digita scripts on the card, remember that formatting the card will delete them - Cameraid will not touch them.) It is my experience that cameras may not like the cards after they have been formatted on a Mac (even if you used the MS/PC-DOS format).\nRead the sections on batch processors and shortcuts to learn how to learn how to make changes to these shortcuts.\nNote: The shortcuts for opening the photos and ejecting the memory card depend on the card being named \"Untitled\". If you have renamed the card or it has some other name by default, you can simply redefine the alias used for opening the photos and rerecord the AppleScript for ejecting the memory card.\nNote: AVI video files are not supported in Cameraid 1.3. I plan to look into this in a future version, but for now, they need to be copied using the Finder. I usually also convert them into QuickTime movies, so that they can be browsed and used with Cameraid.\nNote: If you accidentally format a card that still contained photos or delete important photos, it may be possible to recover those photos from that card, as long as new photos have not been stored over the old ones that were deleted. Please contact me for details.\nViewing Images\nHave you ever been in a situation where you have a hundreds or thousands of images and you need to select a few good ones for a project? Or have you ever run out of disk space and decided that you should probably delete some of the less brilliant photos in your collection? That's exactly what the viewer in Cameraid was written for.\nThink of a slide projector: it takes a cassette loaded with slides and shows them on a screen one by one. That's how Cameraid works, except that the \"cassette\" can hold as many photos as memory allows*.\n* Note: Each file will require about 0.5 kB of memory from the Cameraid application. If the photo also has a thumbnail, additional memory will be allocated when the photo is first shown. Thumbnails usually require a few kilobytes, but this depends entirely on the program or camera that created the photo. If you are running the Carbon version under MacOS X, you can pretty much ignore the memory requirements, as MacOS X virtual memory takes care of allocating enough memory for Cameraid.\nOpening Images\nWhen you open an image file or drop one onto the Cameraid icon or viewer window, that file is added to the list of images. If you drop a whole folder or disk full of images into Cameraid, all the enclosed images will be added to the list.\nThe order in which the photos are added to the viewer can be controlled from the Preferences window . To duplicate the behavior of older versions, select \"After Current Photo\" and \"Show Last\".\nEach file is added only once into the viewer. This allows for some interesting tricks using grading, since files already in the viewer retain their old grade and the new ones get a grade of zero by default. It's an easy way to exclude a set of files: add those files to the viewer first, then decrease all the grades by one and add the complete set of files. The files you want now have a grade of zero and the ones you don't want have -1.\nSelecting Images\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. Here's the part of Cameraid that is probably the toughest to grasp, if you haven't read the manual.\nBelow is a screen snapshot of the Cameraid viewer window. The main area usually displays the image or a thumbnail view of it (in this case, my dog, Otto).\nThe top margin shows the size (in kilobytes), type (JPEG, PICT, TIFF, MooV) and name of the file (in this case 1006-13.37.\nThe number in the middle (zero) indicates the grade that you have given this image. I call this number the grade, because it's a little bit like a school grade. Anything less than zero belongs to one group (negative grades) and anything greater than or equal to zero belongs in the other (positive grades). You usually change the grade by using the + and - keys. Try it to get a feel of how it works.\nThe idea is that you can go through your images and give them grades and then use the grades to decide what to do with the images.\nThe two numbers at the right margin show the number of the current image and the total number of files that are open in the viewer.\nUseful tip: if you click on the top margin with the mouse, Cameraid will ask the Finder to reveal the file. If you are wondering where a certain file is located, clicking on the top margin is usually the fastest way to find out. Note that Cameraid doesn't switch you into the Finder, so this may happen underneath the Viewer window and may not be immediately visible to you.\nLet's say you have 100 images to start with and you can only print up to 20 of them. With Cameraid, you can go through the images and each time you see one that you don't like, you can hit the minus (or arrow down) key to give it a negative grade. Once you have gone through all your images, you can remove the negative scores and see how many are left.\nTip: Sorting by grade is also useful for grouping interesting photos together. If you want to flip between two photos, give them identical grades (different from any others photos) and then sort the photos in the viewer.\nThe bottom margin is used to display photo info. Most digital cameras store some kind of information about the photo in the JPEG file. The above example is from an Agfa ePhoto 1680, but it's very similar to what you would see displayed from many other digital cameras. In this case, you can see the exposure time (1/90 seconds), aperture (F8.0), zoom setting (x2.0), JPEG quality setting and the date and time when the photo was taken. The window isn't quite wide enough to show my full E-mail address (many cameras allow you to customize this string) or the camera firmware version numbers. The information shown depends a lot on the camera that was used to take the photo.\nMost of the data is self-explanatory, but if you see data like this: [5:2], the numbers indicate the metering mode and exposure program used for the photo.\nThe scroll bar does not scroll the image. In fact, there's no way in Cameraid to scroll the images: they are always centered in the window. The scroll bar selects the currently displayed image from all the open files. (Being able to pan zoomed images is a popular request and is very high on my \"to do\" list, when I redesign the viewer.)\nZooming\nUse the View menu to scale the photos.\nNote: With QuickTime Movies, return, enter and space start and stop movie playback instead of toggling the thumbnail mode.\nIf the photo is too large to fit into the viewer, \"Scale To Fit\" will reduce it so that it fits.\n\"Binary Scaling\" speeds up viewing of photos that need to be scaled down.\nIt has two effects:\nDisplay of photos at half, quarter or eighth size is accelerated significantly. Cameraid will display 50%, 25% or 12% above the top left corner of the photo to indicate that binary scaling acceleration was used for the display.\nCombined with \"Scale To Fit\", instead of making the photo just small enough to fit inside the window, it is reduced further to one of the accelerated sizes. These two modes combined result in very fast display of images. It's only slightly slower than viewing just the thumbnails and the photos are displayed at a higher resolution.\nNote: binary scaling uses more memory than normal scaling and may not be performed, if Cameraid is low on memory. Allocate more memory for Cameraid or disable binary scaling, if memory is low.\nTip: use the B key on the keyboard to toggle binary scaling on and off. This keyboard shortcut is used without the command key and does not appear in the menu.\nFor fastest viewing, use the thumbnail view. Most photos from digital cameras already have embedded thumbnail JPEGs. Thumbnails are lower resolution versions of the photo. Use \"tab\", \"return\", \"enter\" or \"space\" to toggle between thumbnail and full image viewing. Three different scale factors are provided for thumbnails.\nKeyboard Control\nYou can use the scroll bar and menu commands to navigate and use the viewer, but in most cases it's much easier to use the keyboard shortcuts. This may sound like something from pre-Macintosh computers, but in fact there's something to be said about simple, single-key commands when you want to accomplish something quickly. Here's a list of shortcuts (the same window can be opened from the Help menu in Cameraid):\nThe keys were chosen so that you can use the numeric keypad to browse the images and increase and decrease the grades. The enter key is also conveniently located so that you can switch between thumbnail view and full image view. Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys.\nTo quickly rename a single file, hit the R key. If you just want to add something to the file name, you can use the right arrow key to get to the end of the old name, then type the new name and enter to make the change.\nDrag and Drop\nIf you click and drag anywhere in the image area (even the white space around the image), you'll notice that a gray circle can be dragged around. This circle represents the image file and you can drag it anywhere just as if you were dragging a file icon in the Finder.\nThe control and shift keys on the keyboard are used to select more than one file at a time for dragging. The control key corresponds to all images with negative grades and the shift key is used for all the others. This means that if you simply want to move all the files into a single folder, hold down control and shift and drag from the image viewer window to the folder you want.\nIf you haven't touched the grades (they start out at zero), holding down shift when starting the drag will cause all the files to be dragged (since they all have zero grades).\nThe shape being dragged gives you information on what is being dragged. A large circle means that all the files are being dragged (control+shift held down). A square with a plus sign in the middle means that files with grades greater or equal to zero are being dragged. Similarly a square with a minus sign in the middle means that files with negative grades are being dragged. If nothing happens when you shift- or control-drag, there probably aren't any files with suitable grades. A small shape indicates that only one file is affected while a larger shape means that more than one file will be dragged.\nIf some of the files have identical names and you try to drop them into the same folder, the Finder will be unable to complete the operation. You'll get an error message and nothing will be done. The batch processor in Cameraid can be used to move or copy files into the same folder without having to worry about naming conflicts.\nThe same keys (control and shift) are also used in conjunction with JPEG transforms, shortcuts and (optionally) the batch processor.\nSorting\nThe photos in the viewer can be sorted. The original order is preserved when sorting entries with identical grades, names or sizes. If you first sort the files by name and then by grade, files with identical grades will be sorted together, but they will be in alphabetical order.\nSorting names numerically means that photos with names like J1, J2 and J10 will be sorted in their natural, numerical order instead of the straightforward alphabetical ordering: J1, J10, J2.\nIn addition to the EXIF-stored photo date, files can also be sorted based on the creation or last modification date.\nTo reverse sorting order (going from highest to lowest), select the \"Reverse Sorting Order\" item and then perform your search. You may want to uncheck the reverse option once the sort is complete.\nSaving Collections\nThe collection of open files and their grades can be saved into a document.\nA collection document will contain aliases (or links) to the files, so it takes very little space and can often find the files even if they are moved. Opening a collection will add all the files in that saved collection to the viewer. For instance, you can combine two collections by opening them both. Grades are saved with the collection.\nWarning: only aliases to the photos are stored in the collection. If you discard the originals or move them in such a way that Cameraid can no longer find them, they will be removed from the collection when the collection file is opened. Make sure you understand the difference between the original photo files and the saved collection before you use this feature.\nNote: MacOS aliases are used to used to track the files. Sometimes aliases will actually point to the wrong file or may they may fail to \"resolve\" at all. In these cases Cameraid uses the information it has on the file to try to find the best possible match. This involves searching hard drives and may take a while.\nFinding Duplicate Files\nAs a new function in version 1.3, Cameraid is capable of going through the list of opened photos and Quicktime movies and finding any exact duplicates. This is especially useful if some of the files on your hard drive have been accidentally duplicated or you have downloaded photos from the Internet and your collection contains multiple copies of some photos.\nThe Duplicate File Locator window opens from the Edit menu.\nCameraid compares the data stored in the files. It doesn't try to see what the photo or movie really looks like. This means that an optimized or progressified version of a photo will almost always appear different from the original. One way to avoid this problem is to keep all your photos deprogressified (for best viewing speed).\nIf a photo has been edited in any way, it will be considered different from the original.\nIf Finder icons or thumbnails have been added, these are stored in the resource fork of the file, which is not considered when the files are compared. A file with a custom icon will thus look the same to Cameraid as the same file without an icon.\nFilenames are ignored and do not have to match.\nHere's what the different options do:\nReordering will place any duplicated files first in the viewer and any unique files. For any file with duplicates, the first one found is considered the original and comes first, followed by the duplicates. The order is otherwise the same as it was before the operation took place.\nAs mentioned above, an original is the first file of a set of duplicates. It is assumed that you want to keep at least one copy, so you can set the grade of this file to whatever you want.\nDuplicates are the second, third etc file in a set of identical files. It's assumed that you want to get rid of these, so usually you would set a negative grade, like -1.\nUnique files are files without any duplicates. You could just as well use the same grade as for originals, but it's easier to tell when the duplicates end, if you set their grade to something different - like 1.\nIf you want to delete or move duplicates into the trash, set their grade to -1 and use a batch processor from the shortcut menu to move or delete photos with negative grades into the trash. Use the reordering functionality, if you want and easy way to find out which files were duplicates.\nThe Duplicate File Locator has been tested with up to around 100 000 files and while it took a while to do and required tens of megabytes of RAM allocated to Cameraid, it worked flawlessly. Cameraid displays progress information if it takes more than a few seconds to find the duplicates. The process can be stopped at any point with no ill side-effects.\nNote: Cameraid doesn't do a byte per byte compare of data. Instead, if compares files with equal size by calculating a 32 bit \"has value\" or \"cyclical redundancy checksum\". If the computed value matches, the files are considered identical. There is an extremely slim chance that two different files of the same length will have the same CRC value.\nRotating and Transforming JPEG Files Losslessly\nActual Transforms\nJPEG is what is called a \"lossy\" compression method. This means that when you compress an image with the JPEG method and then open that file again, you'll almost never get the same image back again. If a file is opened and saved enough times, the changes begin to accumulate and can visibly degrade the quality of the file.\nIt is possible to perform some limited operations on JPEG images without degrading the image quality. Cameraid incorporates special program code from the Independent JPEG group. This code allows you to rotate and mirror JPEG images in a way that preserves image quality.\nThe operations are also reversible. This means that if you rotate an image clockwise, a counterclockwise rotation will restore the image to what it was.\nThe letter F is used above to demonstrate the effects of the transformations.\nNote that the file size will usually change a bit. JPEG compression is done in two steps and the second (Huffman compression) step allows for some optimization to be done without degrading image quality. Cameraid will also perform this optimization on transformed images. (Or you can perform the optimization transform, which will not change the image pixels in any way, but will try to make the file a bit smaller.)\nAs mentioned in the drag and drop section of the manual, the shift and control keys can be used to apply the transforms to more than one image at a time. This is useful if you want to save a few KB of disk space and optimize the compression of many image files in one operation.\nCaveat: Cameraid will try to perform JPEG transforms on PICT files as well. If the PICT files is not compressed with JPEG or JPEG was used in strips (PhotoShop tends to do this), the operation will usually fail and Cameraid will leave the file unchanged. Under some conditions, Cameraid may fail to notice that the file contained more than a single JPEG compressed image and save the transformed JPEG and overwrite the original image. For this reason, if you plan on transforming PICT, make sure you have a backup copy to avoid losing data.\nCaveat: JPEG compression is done using 8x8 pixel blocks. If the image dimensions are not a multiple of 8, some incomplete blocks are used at the right and bottom edges of the image. Some of the transforms will be unable to operate perfectly on files like that. Fortunately, the imperfections were designed so that most of the image is transformed correctly and if the inverse transform is performed, the original image is restored without loss. All known raw digital camera image JPEG files have dimensions that are multiples of 8 and will transform perfectly. You'll usually only have trouble with cropped or scaled digital photos. You may also notice this when a JFIF preview thumbnail is rotated.\nCaveat: JPEG transforms require a lot of temporary memory to store the intermediate stages of the operation. Cameraid can use application memory, system memory and even hard disk space to store the intermediate data, but if the disk is used, you should expect that the operation can take a very long time (go take a coffee break or even have lunch while the computer is crunching). Megapixel class images (about 1280x960) will usually require about 6-8MB of free memory.\nOptimize, Deprogressify and Progressify\nIt's possible to reorganize a JPEG file so that the photo that it represents doesn't change at all, but the encoding of the data is changed.\nProgressive scan photos are stored as increasingly accurate representations of the photo. If downloaded over a slow link, a browser may first show a blurry version, then a slightly sharper version etc until the full photo resolution is reached. Because of the difference in encoding, most viewers will display progressive scan photos slower than the more common \"sequential scan\" JPEGs. In most cases though, it just happens that progressive scan photos will compress even smaller (without any loss in quality!) than there more sequential counterparts.\nThus, for the smallest possible files, you may want to use the Progressify command.\nThe Deprogressify command is excellent for restoring photos to sequential scanning and improving viewing speed by a factor of 2-3.\nThe optimize command will first deprogressify a photo and optimize the compression as well as it can. If the new file is smaller than the original, the original data is replaced. If it's larger, the original data is kept untouched. Optimize will usually not change progressive scan photos, as they are usually smaller than what what can be achieved with the sequential scanning order.\nTo put it simply, here's what you would do with these commands:\nOptimize\nReduce the sizes of your photos without making them progressive scan.\nDeprogressify\nSpeed up viewing by removing progressive scanning.\nProgressify\nMake the smallest possible photos with the cost of slower drawing speed.\nCustomizing Cameraid\nCreating And Using Shortcuts\nThe shortcuts menu is a bit like the Apple menu, but it's specific to the Cameraid application.\nTo add items to the Shortcuts menu in Cameraid, make sure there's a folder called \"Shortcuts\" in the same folder with the Cameraid application and either place an alias to the item or the original item itself in that folder.\nThe best way to learn how to use shortcuts is to try it out and see how it works.\nThe rest of this section gives an accurate description of how shortcuts work. If you don't like overly technical text, you may want to skip the whole thing and just go ahead and use the shortcuts folder and menu. Read the section on special characters (below), if you wish to add keyboard shortcuts to menu items.\nHere's how various items affect the shortcuts menu:\nFolders will not appear on the menu, but any items in the folders will be treated as if they were in the shortcuts folder itself and separate with gray lines from other items. In other words, use folders to group files similar items together.\nAliases to folders will be added directly to the menu, regardless of the contents of the original folder. When you select a folder alias from the Shortcuts menu, Cameraid will behave as if you had dropped that folder onto the Cameraid program icon: all the PICT and JPEG image files in it will be opened.\nFor all other items, the items are added to the menu and aliases behave just like the original item when that item is selected from the menu:\nApplication items can behave in several different ways, but in general the application will be launched and can open files from the viewer.\nPICT and JPEG files are opened into the Cameraid viewer when the menu item is selected..\nBatch processor files will either be opened or executed immediately without showing the settings window first. What happens depends on the \"Execute Immediately from Shortcuts Menu\" setting on the Advanced panel of the batch processor document.\nOther files will behave as if they had been double-clicked in the Finder.\nHere's what happens when you select an application item from the shortcuts menu:\nIf the application isn't running, it will be launched.\nIf the viewer window isn't the front window, no files will be opened by the application.\nIf the shift key is held down when you pull down the menu, files with grades greater or equal to zero will be sent to the application. The application will open them, if it can.\nIf the control key is held down, files with grades less than zero will be sent to the application. (Note that you can hold down both shift and control to open all the files regardless of their grade).\nIf neither the shift or control key is held down, the currently visible image file will be sent to the application.\nNote that AppleScripts are also applications, so if you are good at scripting, you can easily enhance Cameraid with your own scripts. An AppleScript called \"Trash Photos/6\" is provided in the \"Extras\" folder. This AppleScript will move the files given to it into the trash. It's works better than dragging the same files into the trash, because it can deal with multiple files that have the same filename. Move it into the Shortcuts folder and restart Cameraid to use it as a shortcut.\nNote: Applications do not unfortunately always come to the front when you first launch them. I haven't been able to get around this behavior. Once launched, applications will come to the front when you select the shortcut menu item for the application or for a document that belongs to that application.\nSpecial Characters in the Shortcuts Folder\nCameraid can interpret certain characters in the filenames to add keyboard shortcuts to the menu items and to disable others. If you end the file name with a slash and a single character, that character will become the keyboard shortcut for the menu item. You should avoid keys that already have a meaning (cmd-O, cmd-S, cmd-Q, etc.) and it may not be possible to use characters that require the option or control key to be held down.\nIf the file name starts with an opening parenthesis, it will be displayed in gray and you will not be able to select it from the menu. This is useful if you just want to add some text to the menu (such as a warning before items that could potentially be dangerous items).\nExamples:\nAn alias of JPEGView named JPEGView/J would add a shortcut for JPEGView. You can view an image full screen in JPEGView if you hit command-J from the Cameraid viewer. You can open all \u00840 grade images using command-shift-J. The control key can be used (to select negative grades.\nSimilarly, an item named PhotoShop/P might be used to launch PhotoShop.\nAn alias to your \"photos\" folder will allow you to open all your photos with a single menu command.\nYou can open Cameraid documentation directly from the Shortcuts menu.\nCustomizing Cameraid Resources (Advanced Topic)\nYou can customize Cameraid by placing a \"Cameraid Resources\" file in the same folder as Cameraid. It will override resources in the Cameraid application. This is useful if you have changed any resources in Cameraid and you want to keep those modifications separate from Cameraid itself. Some examples are given below:\nThe template for custom photo icons can be modified to your liking.\nCommand key shortcuts for menus can be modified by editing the MENU resources with ResEdit.\nLarger type sizes can be enabled in Cameraid.\nThere's is a sample \"Cameraid Resources\" files in the \"Extras\" folder. Move it into the same folder with Cameraid and restart Cameraid to use it. You have to quit Cameraid if you wish to edit or add resources within this file.\nLarger Type Sizes\nYou can easily modify Cameraid to use larger typefaces in the batch processor and digital camera control window. Just drag and drop the \"Cameraid Resources\" file from Larger Fonts for Dialogs in the Extras folder into the same folder with the Cameraid application. The next time you start Cameraid, a 12 or 14 point font will be used instead of the default 10 point font. Even larger sizes can be achieved by modifying the Cameraid Resources file with ResEdit.\nNaming Patterns\nCameraid file name patterns will always generate unique file names, so that old files are not overwritten. Even if you try to rename all your files \"Photo\", Cameraid will append numbers to the file names where necessary to keep them unique in each folder. In effect, if you like sequentially numbered files that all start with the same text, you can just type whatever you want into the pattern and it will work just fine. Most people find it convenient to name the files based on the date and time when the photo was taken, so that's what the default rename pattern will do.\nTwo systems of naming files exist in Cameraid: the old : and single character system and the new system that uses words within pairs of curly braces { }. In the table below, the new names are given first with the old style last, if it exists.\nEXIF or JFIF APP marker information in photos is used whenever possible. This means that the date and time information in the pattern is the exact time when the photo was taken. Make sure the clock on your camera is correctly set. If no information is available, the creation date of the file is used.\nPattern options (usually length) can be entered after a colon within the pattern. Use a length of zero to indicate that the length should be determined automatically.\nFor examples on how to use the old style rename patterns, refer to the quick reference on the rename panel of the batch processor. The most common new patterns are given in a pop-up menu next to the file name or caption field.\nDate and time related patterns:\n{day}\nDay of month, 2 digits by default, use {day:0} or :0D to eliminate leading zero.\n{month}{day}-{h}.{m}:({alpha}:)\n0211-15.13\n"}, {"score": 136.97083, "uuid": "4a233784-5702-5b30-8559-103b0f4d13bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-20-26752", "target_hostname": "personallifemedia.com", "target_uri": "http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/516-learning-digital-photography", "page_rank": 2.9933014e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Podcast: Learning Digital Photography -

I talk about the latest contest, (#3 for 2009), have a fun conversation with Jason Loucks.\u00a0 then tackle some tips on photography fireworks.\u00a0 Of course the show always takes care of a couple listener questions and answers, so it\u2019s 45 jam-packed minutes of photography fun.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a teaser on the show notes:\nWin a copy of Onone Software Plugin Suite 4.5 -

you guessed it - a copy of Photoshop Lightroom 2 going to the lucky winner.\u00a0 More detailed notes available on the blog.\nEpisode 21: Portraits, Promotion, and Planning\nThis week\u2019s podcast episode should be available shortly over at Personal Life Media. \u00a0 You\u2019ll want to listen when you really can dedicate the 25 minutes as it\u2019s a pretty rapid fire show this week.\u00a0 A couple learning opportunities presented themselves to me recently and I wanted to share these before they got too fuzzy.\u00a0 As a result, I didn\u2019t really get into the news of the last week, or address any listener questions.\u00a0 However, there are still some show notes and a sample portrait over at the blog, so be sure to stop there and pick up the feed.\u00a0 Diggs, reviews, and such (as always) are appreciated and encouraged!\nmore.\nEpisode 20: The Power of the Pen\nOn this weeks show, I take a look at the power of the pen - the artist statement.\u00a0 For those of us with aspirations of sharing our work with others via art shows, galleries, contests and competitions, the value of the artist statement can make the difference between getting into a show, gallery or other event and buying a ticket.\u00a0 So, if you want to learn what the artist statement is, how to write one, and things to consider, this is the show for you.\nStop over at the blog for the rest of the show notes, and don't forget to Digg above here at PLM, and review the show on iTunes if you like it!\u00a0 Thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next week!\nEpisode 19: Blur Baby, Blur!\nHey all, this week\u2019s show is done and boy are you in for a treat!\u00a0 Not only is there some pretty ground-breaking news from the computing world, but the theme for this podcast is blur!\u00a0 I take a (hopefully) clear look at different types of blur you can get in your images, what can work, what will not work, and how to correct for different types.\u00a0 Got some great listener questions and answers that tie in very nicely to the theme, and as, always the photo tip of the week.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a few of the show notes:\nNews Links -

the sound of shutters and how they can impact the feel of the camera, and how they can effect a moment is significant enough to warrant consideration.\u00a0 Make sure you tune in for this one from the good folks over at Personal Life Media to get all the news, info, and latest from Learning Digital Photography!\nListen in to the podcast right here at Personal Life for the answers and full details on all the show segments.\u00a0 In the meantime, what does your shutter sound like?\u00a0\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t even have to be a Canon camera, listen to your camera whether it\u2019s Canon Nikon, Olympus, Sony, Pentax, Panasonic, Leica, Hasselblad, etc! Find out why in the podcast up now over at Personal Life Media\u00a0 The rest of the show notes, including additional links referenced in the show are over at the blog.\nRemember to Digg the podcast page too - more listeners means more questions and answers, and more fodder for podcasts!\nEpisode 17: News, Artists, and Inspiration\nWelcome to the show notes for week #17 of Learning Digital Photography.\u00a0 Here's the show notes for this week's podcast...\nFirst off, I've done some further tweaking to give a little more consistency and structure to the show for your listening pleasure.\u00a0 The three segments that I am going to try to regularly stick to will be:\nNews, Events, and Information from around the community and industry - here I'll share nuggets, information, and other useful snippets from the most recent days and weeks of activity within the photography community.\u00a0 Sometimes I'll share information that's available elsewhere, and other times I'll offer my own perspectives on the news and events that shape the industry.\nAuthors and Artists from within and related to the industry of photography are also an area I would like to devote some time to since the Thursday Thoughts series has not seen much attention lately (not that I am planning to either - I think it's just on sabbatical!), and I had the good fortune of actually sitting down with an area professional recently which provided a source of inspiration for this weeks show.\nSources of Inspiration - As artists I think we are always searching for and discovering new sources of inspiration.\u00a0 Often these can come from well known venues such as photography magazines, galleries, and the like, but I am not adverse to featuring unusual or new sources either.\u00a0 This week, I will be featuring an unusual source of inspiration, so make sure you stop in for this segment too!\nHead on over to the blog for the remainder of the show notes and links!\nmore.\nEpisode 16: HDR, Web Links, and some news\nSo, this last weekend I went on the photo meetup group outing for the month of February into Eldorado State Park, south of Boulder, and had many an opportunity to capture some landscape and macro work.\u00a0 Some great views were had and I only hope that they all come out as well as this one did.\u00a0 While hiking up a trail of slippery snow and ice (it was cold out Saturday morning), I saw this fissure that was pretty intense looking because it was only partially lit.\u00a0 I thought about it for a second and decided to bracket some exposures to see if it would turn out with some HDR massaging.\u00a0 Not only did it turn out better than I would have thought, I was also very pleased with how Photomatix did with this.\u00a0 I would highly recommend this software to anyone interested in HDR work.\u00a0 Not only is it more intuitive than Photoshop, the results were much more gratifying!\u00a0 You can buy Photomatix for PS, Lightroom and for either Windows or a Mac over at http://www.hdrsoft.com\nSome other web links I learned about recently also include fotoblur.com and usefilim.com\u00a0 Both are much more cognizant and respective of photography copyright than other social and photo networking sites like Flickr and Facebook (we all know about the Facebook Terms of Service fiasco, right?).\u00a0 One thing I like about both Fotoblur and Flickr is that you are limited in how many images you can upload daily.\u00a0 This requires you to be more careful about what you publish, and as a result, you are more thoughtful and objective of what work is worth posting and sharing online.\nLast but not least, the podcast that I had intended to put out last week was delayed for a few days as I put the finishing touches up on a home improvement project.\u00a0 (We finished out one of the basement rooms - expect to see some photos on that makeover forthcoming!)\u00a0 The good news is that not only is the basement room on the verge of completion, but that the podcast is up for this week.\u00a0 Naturally, the title of the podcast will match the blog post title, as the show notes follow closely to todays content.\u00a0 Stop on over to Personal Life Media for the show, or pick it up in iTunes!\u00a0 (Don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts in the review section of iTunes too\u2026the more the merrier!)\nEpisode 15: Multimedia Monday\nWith the \u201cNew and Improved\u201d podcast starting out at PLM this week, there\u2019s a couple exciting things to announce.\u00a0 First off, the drawing for the Think Tank Photo Streetwalker bag was done live on the podcast this week, and the winner was announced in the lead segment.\u00a0 Congrats go out to the winner (you know who you are!), so do get me your address so I can ship you the bag post haste!\nThe meat segment (aka middle segment) I talk about some new sources of inspiration - specifically the grocery store and in a restaurant.\u00a0 The next time you are at a restaurant, take your camera because the table makes for a great tripod, and you can get some really cool shots.\u00a0 Case in point, is the new gallery I have set up here at the blog, titled Tabletop Photography.\u00a0 I\u2019m also sharing a few sources of inspiration from the grocery store too (tune in tomorrow for those).\nThe listener questions were really good ones from Meredith and Jason, where I take a look at the value of carbon fiber and the issue of when and where are we permitted to photograph.\u00a0\u00a0 Last but not least, the photo tip of the week concerns copyright and registering your work, so make sure you stay tuned for that.\nLots of photo goodness to share, so make sure you tune in for the audio, and stop by the blog to pick up the link for the photo gallery.\u00a0 Photos, podcasts, and questions galore.\u00a0 Enjoy the day and we\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow!\u00a0 Happy Shooting!\nmore.\nEpisode 13: The Meat is in the Maintenance\nWith another week come to a close, I got a late start in recording and putting together the podcast for today, so it\u2019s going up a tad late.\u00a0 However, as the old saying goes, good things come to those who wait.\u00a0 Here's the show notes:\nPhoto News\nThink Tank Contest almost Over\nListener Questions & Photo Tip of the Week\nHappy shooting and we'll see you back here tomorrow.\nmore.\nEpisode 12: The Show Must Go On...\nWhile the folks at Personal Life Media continue to work behind the scenes at getting the show re-branded, I\u2019ve been encouraged to keep producing podcasts so, this week, the podcast returns.\u00a0 Here's the show notes:\nThe Boneyard Backstory\nThink Tank Photo Streetwalker Review\nBlog/Podcast Maintenance\nListener Questions and Answers\nPhoto Tip of the Week\nAs you may have noticed if you\u2019re picking up the feed, I am also uploading all the \u201cWhat\u2019s This\u201d images to the Canon Blogger Flickr Pool.\u00a0 As that content arc has ended, I thought it might be fun and of interest to see the entire gallery of photos that have gone up on that subject over a period of roughly 23 weeks.\u00a0 (Almost half a year of images there to rack your brain on!)\nAs we head into the weekend, be sure to take your camera with you - never know when a photo opportunity will present itself, so as the Boy Scouts always said:\u00a0 \u201cBe Prepared!\u201d\u00a0 Happy shooting and we\u2019ll see you back here Monday morning!\nmore.\nEpisode 11: The Final Broadcast of 2008\nThat\u2019s right, this week is the final podcast broadcast for CB this year!\u00a0 It\u2019s a good one though with an announcement of the new product line I\u2019ll be reviewing.\u00a0 For those of you getting this in feed readers, here\u2019s the short version:\nChristmas Wrap-up:\u00a0 A few last minute gift ideas for the photog-type in your circle\nThe New Product Line Review Announcement (you gotta listen to find out!\n)\nThe Value of Starting Over\nListener Questions and Answers\nDave from PA - Hot shoe flashes:\u00a0 tungsten or flourescent?\nLynn from WI - Are 3rd party batteries safe?\nKevin from CO - Best way to learn photography\nTomorrow, the last What\u2019s This of the Year, and then lights out\u2026nothing again until next week. The next edition of Thursday Thoughts will come back the second week of January (I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to ask someone to put something together for New Years Day any more than Christmas Day!) That means you\u2019re actually gonna have to spend time with family, friends, and loved ones for a few days. Oh darn!\u00a0 Hope that shopping is almost done!\u00a0 If not, be sure you tune in for those last minute gift ideas!\u00a0 Thanks for tuning in and we\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow!\nP.S.\u00a0 What made this week\u2019s podcast different from any other podcast I\u2019ve done this year?\u00a0 (Other than the fact that it\u2019s the last one of the year\u2026)\nEpisode 10: Food For Thought\nWell, I was going to save the podcast for Tuesday, but decided since some of the information was from this week that I had better put it out before it gets \u201cold\u201d, so a new podcast is available for your listening pleasure.\u00a0 Consider it your Friday Food For Thought!\u00a0 (I know, I gave it a different title within the audio recording).\u00a0 Here's the short version of the show notes:\nWorking for Free\n"}, {"score": 135.03348, "uuid": "32f7dc4f-1f55-5b7f-8ab4-4dce3e0f8ec7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-10-21254", "target_hostname": "photo.net", "target_uri": "http://photo.net/photos/lintrathen", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Photos by Grayham Allott - photo.net", "snippet": "<em>I</em> <em>prefer</em> to call it photo-based art, in an attempt to remove the stigma of photography as <em>a</em> bastard form. \u201cLook, <em>for</em> me the smaller image is the better version\u2026\u201d You\u2019ve got it completely backwards.

Photography is my hobby.... keeps me sane and gets me out in the fresh air.\nBest regards\n, December 05, 2011; 10:12 A.M.\nGRAYHAM...\nI\u2019m not in the habit of explaining my art, which is about feeling rather than seeing, and one either feels my images or doesn\u2019t, but since the same issues seem to arise again and again, you\u2019ve prompted me to cobble together a brief statement of intent, something I can use as a personalized form letter in the future.\nNo Grayham, I did not use a \u201cpin-hole\u201d lens cap, I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. I have no interest in pin-holes or lenses or f-stops or anything else related to the techno side of photography. Not being a painter, I employ photography as a vehicle to achieve my goal. I use a camera to \u201csketch\u201d my images before scanning them into the computer where I can achieve the effects that \u201cspeak\u201d to me, the same way a painter will sketch from nature before retiring to the studio to finish the work. I prefer to call it photo-based art, in an attempt to remove the stigma of photography as a bastard form.\n\u201cLook, for me the smaller image is the better version\u2026\u201d You\u2019ve got it completely backwards. The image, most of my images, should be printed huge. You worry far too much about my \u201cimperfections.\u201d Has it not occurred to you that every effect is the result of a conscious choice? I am not a dabbler. What you see in my body of work is a consistent and hard won personal style. But then, you don\u2019t feel my images.\nYes, I\u2019m drawn to the vignetting, moodiness, and atmospherics of the Old Masters. I often hear the relatively unsophisticated comment that my works reminds someone of a painting. I think the way they mean it is in assuming that I simply push a button in Photoshop to create a painterly effect. Trust me, I could map out the list of tools and steps taken to create those effects, and they still, in a dozen lifetimes, would not be able to recreate it.\nVision lies between the ears, not in focal length, sharpness, or accurate color. The vast majority of the images shared on photo.net and similar sites are utterly meaningless, they evoke absolutely nothing. Why they\u2019re even posted under Fine Art is beyond me. At best, they\u2019re \u201cpretty,\u201d and those are the images that garner the most responses. They\u2019re easy to like by people who have no interest whatsoever in art. Bluntly put, American really don\u2019t give a shit about art.\nHere\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m standing beside someone, they have a camera. A dog walks past. He snaps a photo of the dog, shows it to me, leaving me entirely befuddled. What was the point? Had I never seen a dog, I\u2019d be quite impressed. But I\u2019ve seen dogs, in fact, I was there when he snapped the photo. Unless he has an entirely new way of presenting the image of that dog, I\u2019m not interested.\nAnd, without any attempt to insult you, I see the same in your own work. Photos of elephants, lions, and zebra. Yes, they\u2019re all very nice, but nice is not nearly good enough, has nothing to do with art. In the most basic sense, they\u2019re about photography, but only in the sense of having used a popular mechanical device to record the image. They don\u2019t transcend the image, the raw material. In some of your images, the composition and groupings are already there, so why not go far, far beyond, show us elephants like they\u2019ve never been seen before. Tragic, mysterious, otherworldly elephants, anything but\u2026just elephants. They\u2019re \u201cpretty,\u201d but they have nothing to do with art.\nSo now you know what I was hoping to achieve. Am I satisfied with each and every image? No, of course not. Art is never finished, only abandoned.\nOnward and upward with the arts!\nHans Bauer\n, December 14, 2011; 04:11 P.M.\nHi Hans............\nI have copied this response to your ROLL CALL image thread.\nRegards\n, December 23, 2011; 08:27 A.M.\nWELL, THEN...\nLIKEWISE, A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND YOURS, SIR.\nHANS B\n, December 24, 2011; 08:11 A.M.\nDear Grayham,\nSeason's Greetings from South Africa.

You are indeed, a world-class photographer, and your work is a great inspiration to many,many aspiring photographers like myself. Work like yours shows developing photographers the \"Pot of Gold at the end on the Rainbow\" We look at your photographs, and we see what is ultimately possible, when the highest levels of skill, technique, and talent are applied to the art of photography. Your portfolio is what we strive for. Your photographs are the standard, against which we measure our own work, and the works of others. I myself am just a beginner (18 months). My portfolio is quite humble, but has been growing steadily. If you have a chance, please visit and let me know what you think. Any comment from someone of your stature would be valued very highly. Thank you, and good luck to you. Andrew Daspin\n, September 04, 2007; 11:24 A.M.\nGorgeous\nHi Rarindra. I am very impressed by your portfolio. Fantastic work.

With the increasing trends nowadays, many local and international brands have made it here to suit the local and foreign interest in shopping. Ever since the 70s, shopping has been popular in KL with some of the pioneer malls like Sungai Wang Plaza in the Bukit Bintang area or Golden Triangle which is still pulling the shoppers till this very day.\nThis list aims to provide you with eight of the top shopping malls along Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur for you to visit with a minor breakdown of what to expect. All the malls here are within walking distance so you can cover them all by foot. The list is in no particular order and random.\n1. Sungai Wang Plaza \u2013 One of the oldest malls which recently went through a massive makeover a few years ago. The mall is connected to the Bukit Bintang Plaza or BB Plaza and giving shoppers a massive 2 million square feet of shopping ecstasy. Located in the heart of the Golden Triangle of Kuala Lumpur, this 6 storey mall never fails to deliver with some of the most interesting choices of shops here. Many speciality shops dominate the mall while there are no top branded outlets here. Younger travellers and guest should check out the 6th floor which is called the T-Zone or Trendy Zone where mini shops cater to current trends worldwide. For IT enthusiast, the 3rd floor has an interesting selection for all things IT including DVD shops, PSP shops and internet cafes. A video arcade which is one of the best in town can be found on the 2nd floor with many choices of games to play. You get a very good mix of choices at this mall. For your added information, Sungai Wang in the Malay language means Money River.\nTip: Great place to shop and hang out for all ages.\nOpening Hours: Daily, 10:00 \u2013 22:00\nLocation: Across the street from Lot 10, next to Imbi Plaza and Low Yat Plaza\nAddress: 99 Jalan Bukit Bintang\nTelephone: (603) 2144 9988\n2.

[2] Contributions were made by Godard, Chris Marker, [3] Alain Resnais and others during this period. Each of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts consists of 100 feet of 16mm black and white silent film shot at 24 FPS, equalling a projection-time of 2 minutes and 50 seconds. [4] The films were made available for purchase at the production cost, which at the time was fifty francs.\nAs part of the prescription for the making of the films, the director was to self-produce, self-edit, be the cinematographer, ensuring that each film was shot in one day. Godard had undergone a series of encounters on the barricades during the 'Langlois Affair' in February of 1968, [5] and during May was seen actively involved in labour marches, photographing the riots in the Latin Quarter. He also took time to shoot some material at the University of Paris campus at Nanterre. [6]\nDue to the anonymous approach of the directors involved in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project and the unification between the directors, no credits are given in any of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts to identify who made them. This use of anonymity extends to the way each film is numbered. The number of each Cin\u00e9-Tract is allocated by where the contribution falls within the total number completed by the group. For example, Godard's contributions available for viewing at the British Film Institute are numbered 001, 004, 7, 9, 16, 018, 019 and 23. [7]\nJulia Lesage notes that many of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts exhibit signs of Godard's direct involvement, such as Godard's distinctive handwriting on the intertitles or directly upon the images themselves. [8] Although these signs of Godard's authorship might be attributable to work he had done for other contributors to the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project, it would appear to be unlikely given the project's prescriptive nature.\nWinston-Dixon states that part of the prescription involved in the making of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts was that each of the films was supposed to be edited entirely in camera. Given that Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts are entirely comprised of still images, and frequently make use of intertitles, it is understandable that this method may have sped up the process of recording the films. If Winston-Dixon's information is correct, the amount of preparation that this method must have involved is readily apparent. The process of editing within the camera would have entailed an enormous amount of storyboarding given that the Cin\u00e9-Tracts use hundreds of still images, frequently repeated between the films. [9]\nThe Cin\u00e9-Tracts were distributed outside of the commercial system of distribution. Owing to the modestly successful private distribution and availability within France, the project succeeded in reaching audiences interested in the shared ideals of workers and students in the May revolt.\nThe eight Godard Cin\u00e9-Tracts available at the British Film Institute were shot in May and June of 1968 with screenings also taking place over those two months. They were made for a predominantly French audience, and were screened in French \"student assemblies, factories on strike and political action committees in May [and June] 1968.\" [10] However, the films were also screened in England at the New Arts Lab, [11] and the National Film Theatre, with limited screenings on the festival circuit, notably in Venice and New York.\nAlthough the textual inscriptions used within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts are in French, and there does not appear to have been a subtitled translation into English made available, Godard's montage reveals a great deal of information that would not be lost on an English-speaking audience.\nIt should be noted that international distribution of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts was most likely an after-thought that can be attributed to overseas interest in the directors involved in the project, as opposed to the content of the films. By 1968, both Chris Marker and Godard were internationally known on the festival circuit [12] ; while Godard and Truffaut's disruption of the Cannes Film Festival that year had also been highly publicised. [13]\nThe purpose of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, as with most of Godard's 1968 film projects, was to offer a critically alternative source of 'news' or information in contrast to the commercially offered mediums available. Although the prescriptive nature of the films, their limitation of budget and the limitations introduced by their use of silence, technically confines what can be achieved by the project, the amount of 'alternative' documentary information contained in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, subverts the state controlled media information. The state censorship of the media throughout the events of May necessitated communication along different lines than had existed before. With the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, Godard was able to provide one avenue of contact and information to various cadres that formed throughout the May revolt. By creating a form of agit-prop for specific audiences, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts provided a means of encouraging the revolutionary momentum begun in Nanterre earlier in the year.\nAs part of the 1998 Viennale Film Festival's recognition of the events of 1968 on cinema, Jonathan Rosenbaum contributed some of his memory of this time.\nIt's also worth adding that during the week's run of La Chinoise that started at New York's Kips Bay Theater on April 3, I and many friends of mine went to see it more than once. Some of these friends were attending Columbia University at the time, and when that college campus was taken over by students a short time later, I couldn't help but think that Godard's film had inspired and influenced their militancy. Maybe part of this was wishful thinking, but maybe not: word of mouth travelled more quickly in those days--faster than the New York Times, faster even than television--because there was less media to compete with. Not that the media didn't exist, but it was believed in much less by people of my generation; all one had to do was read --or, on television, see--the reports of the demonstrations we participated in, against the Vietnam war and on behalf of civil rights, in order to understand that the truth of what happened was available only from fellow demonstrators and other members of the counter culture, not from the \"official\" channels. And the same thing was true when it came to finding out about movies: the David Denbys and the Eugene Archers of 1968 were not the authorities one had to turn to. [14] (Italics mine)\nLe Gai Savoir [1968] had used images from advertising sources illustrating 8mm Cine-equipment, suggesting the means of communicating through the cinematic medium were being opened to a greater number of individuals. There is a form of implicit homage to the industrialisation or production of photographic and Cine-equipment within Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts. The widespread availability of filmmaking equipment to consumers and institutions in the late 1960's allowed a reappropriation of the means to record and distribute visual communication outside the confines of a conventional or commercialised media system.\nThat is not to say the Cin\u00e9-Tracts are some form of celebration of the democratising of technology, but they do hint at the function new technology can serve as a catalyst for a public revolution of images. Although the 16mm format was frequently a choice for professional filmmakers, it is used in its most basic form in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project. Given that the Cin\u00e9-Tracts did not use sound, the most basic of equipment could be utilised to screen the films. In particular, the format was relatively easy to duplicate and disseminate throughout institutions such as the Universities; and due to the portability of the equipment needed to project the films, it is imagined the University 16mm projectors were 'borrowed' to allow the Cin\u00e9-Tracts to be screened within the factories where strike action was taking place.\nThe overwhelming amount of historical data about meetings that took place within the confines of the university and factories undergoing strike action, suggests that these places were not just chosen because they were under siege by the state, but were geographic places that provided the technology to distribute communications and organise plans of action. [15]\nWinston-Dixon points out that this sort of filmmaking would have been done on video tape today, but video technology was in its infancy in 1968 making it difficult and impractical to use for the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project. Godard had tried to experiment with video technology as early as 1967 when filming La Chinoise [16] . However, shooting the Cin\u00e9-Tracts in this format would have destroyed their political purpose. Shooting with video would contradict the objectives of the project, which could only be achieved through the maximisation of distribution to those the films were trying to encourage. Video technology was only accessible to a very few, such as television stations\u2013\u2013one of the media avenues the films were attempting to undermine\u2013\u2013and the means of screening 16mm were at the disposal of both students and workers who were the target audience creating the revolution. In her examination of film culture in May 1968, Sylvia Harvey points out\nA film projected in a factory is a rather different phenomenon from a film projected in a cinema, and the former was seen as part of an attempt at breaking down the 'normal' relationship that exists in capitalist society between the audience-consumer and the spectacle-product. The emphasis on new locations for screenings indicated the beginning of a realisation that it was not enough simply to change the content of films, but that the whole socio-economic structure in which they operated had also to be changed. Film as a consumer product was seen as an intrinsically non-revolutionary phenomenon, and to simply use the film content to show a condition of misery, of contestation or of struggle was regarded as an inadequate, an incomplete solution. [17]\nThe Cin\u00e9-Tracts demonstrate Godard's desire to contribute revolutionary 'tools' in an openly political way. In an interview with Kent E. Carroll in 1970, Godard stated that there had been an enormous change in his attitude towards his role as a filmmaker during this period.\nI was a bourgeois filmmaker and then a progressive filmmaker and then no longer a filmmaker, but just a worker in the movies. [18]\nWithout the necessity to address the cinematic material to a 'larger public,' the target audience is confined to the militants Godard wants to encourage to pursue revolutionary goals. If Godard's aim is the production of smaller films for smaller audiences, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts also demonstrate his ability to enter a non-commercial sphere, albeit in a limited way.\nDue to their relatively limited means of distribution, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, and later projects such as Un Film Comme les Autres [1968], also represent a turning point in Godard's aims in relation to spectatorship. In this respect, the films are the precursor of the problems Godard would face with the films made in the post-1968 Dziga-Vertov period. [19]\nEach of Godard's Cin\u00e9tract films opens with either simple machine produced type, or what is recognisably Godard's hand-written script that is either white on black or black on white with a title reading 'Cin\u00e9tract' and its attendant number. Individually, the films illustrate Godard's political concerns with the May movement, and provide ample illustration of the social divisions that were created. The majority of images are representative of both sides in the revolutionary struggle of May. For example, the pro-Gaullists are frequently pictured opposite their anti-Gaullist counterparts. By manipulating the binary oppositions, Godard is able to reveal the tensions between opposing sides in the revolt, but he is also able to exacerbate them.\nFor example, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts creates a very clear-cut depiction of the pro-Gaullist members of French society. Footage shot in the Latin Quarter is contrasted with the Pro-Gaullist marches in the Champs Elysees. The images Godard selects of these marches include the Arc de Triomphe as a prominent and potent symbol of the older generation. Men in bowler hats with their wives in twin-sets and pearls look on in disgust at the younger generation. City officials in Tri-Colour sashes look on in earnestness as they march with pro-Gaullist banners down the Champs Elysees. The C.R.S. [20] celebrate the violence inflicted on the students and workers by slapping each other on the back. Each of these images contributes to what Godard hopes is the galvanising of the spectator with the ideological aims of the demonstrators.\nUsing montage, Godard creates sequences that contrast young with old and bourgeois with revolutionary. These sequences cut from the youthful protestors to the older onlookers who disapprovingly watch the confrontation between police and protestor. This can also be interpreted as a call to the spectator for direct revolutionary action, by its indictment of those who watch and are not participating in the revolution. Scenes such as this also enforce the idea that the revolution is an active force that is presently happening, thus creating a sense of urgency or immediacy to the images.\nIn general terms, Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts also explore the uses of photography, photojournalism and the relationship the still image has to news reportage and the understanding of events. This is usually achieved by textually inscribing an image to reflect revolutionary ideology or contrasting binary images that give a politically sardonic satirical allusion. For example, in Cin\u00e9-Tract 018\nA series of shots that produce a montage of individual faces in CU shouting.\nFaces of smiling C.R.S. police marching. Camera pans [21] left revealing the enormity of the phalanx, and revealing citizens on the curbside clapping them on.\nIntertitle [Pen on Paper]: \"Vive La Police!\"\nLS of crowd receding into background. Camera pans left over image to reveal people in CU laughing.\nIntertitle: \"Les Brave Gens Avec Nous!\"/The Brave People With Us!\nMCU of bourgeois man in dinner suit with bow tie and military-styled moustache stroking chin.\nCU Elderly man wearing a black beret with determined/concerned face.\nMCU Middle-aged men in uniform black suit jackets, white shirts and black ties.\nMCU Younger man in almost identical dress,\nImage of marching women holding the Tri-Colour flag. Camera pans right over the marching figures to linger on a shot of a woman whose dress and style emulates Jacqueline Kennedy.\nIntertitle: \"Et Assez De Violence!\"/ And Enough Of Violence.\nCU Hands holding sign \"Assez De Violence\"\nMCU of man who is holding sign, panning down to reveal sign.\nIntertitle: \"Compris?\"/ Understood?\nThe butt of a rifle in MCU positioned diagonally across frame. C.R.S. in background with one member who has his face averted.\nIntertitle: \"Nous Protestations\"/ Our Protest/Pleas.\nGodard frequently uses mise-en-scene within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts to depict action and movement. Using the borders of the frame, Godard contrives images of the C.R.S. as robotic figures that have a similar and equally humorous functionality to Sennett's Keystone Cops. They're frequently shot running diagonally from one corner of the frame to the other with no readily apparent purpose. The majority of the time they are depicted as faceless automatons, or inhuman masked oppressors \u2013 helmeted and goggled, they are devoid of human identity.\nHowever, Godard also manages to shamelessly satirise the C.R.S. by capturing them with their batons in obvious Freudian poses. In contrast to the humorous depiction of the C.R.S., Godard frequently illustrates the brutality of the violence that the C.R.S. were capable of inflicting. By contrasting the comic images of the C.R.S. with the acts of violence, the intensity of the effect upon the spectator increases their sympathy or support for the demonstrators.\nOne particular shot of a demonstrator bleeding as he is being beaten also shows his girlfriend looking directly into the camera seeking help. By the juxtaposition of the comic with the dramatic images, Godard is able to effect a greater impact upon the audience, and create a sense of outrage.\nA great deal of the footage used within Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts steps outside the prescription of the filmmaker's own recording of events. Using images from other sources of information lends the films an appearance of a bricolage of material almost bordering the aleatory. For example, Godard includes Edouard Boubat's photograph 'Plutot la vie,' [1968] an internationally published image that became recognised as one of the seminal photographic depictions of the May 1968 events. [22]\nMany iconic pop-cultural images of the 60's circulating today are represented in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the first shot of Cin\u00e9-Tract 23 is of Che Guevara. Guevara, whose image has possibly lasted the longest as the 60's iconic embodiment of revolutionary youth and spirit, is still found battling it out with St. Exupery's 'Little Prince' in Paris tourist shops today. [23] However the image of Guevara also assigns a far more serious implication to the May revolt. As with the images of Vietnam, Godard broadens the meaning of the May events into a global revolution of which France is a part by destroying the conservative perception of the May events as a 'national moment of unrest'.\nThis war of icons is in part the inspiration for Godard's 'cold war' attack on the French establishment. In his 1964 book 'Understanding Media,' Marshall McLuhan reveals the ideological use of images and their purpose within the cold war by the State. Recent evidence from media sources have suggested, for example, one of the pivotal moments in the cold war was the internationally televised national parade of the USSR's nuclear capabilities during the 1960's. In fact, the USSR had nowhere near the nuclear arsenal that was suggested by the television images that were broadcast. All of the 'missiles' shown were empty casings, due to the Russian military not having perfected the technology to create such a weapon. However, the effect of having shown what 'appeared' to be a nuclear arsenal was incontrovertible to the western media.\nUsing the space programme as an example of image over substance, McLuhan expressed the opinion that it was immaterial whether or not a US or USSR based space programme made it to the moon first. The image that corroborated it however was worth a great ideological victory. [24]\nEven ideological warfare in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries proceeded by persuading individuals to adopt new points of view, one at a time. Electric persuasion by photo and movie and TV works, instead, by dunking entire populations in new imagery. [25]\nBy repeating images that have become familiar to the audience from media sources, and reinscribing their meanings, Godard is able to remake the meaning of the image to reflect a different ideological discourse. Through directly annotating the image, or by the use of montage, Godard confronts the spectator and encourages them to take direct revolutionary action. In another way, by critically examining the devices the commercial media use, Godard attempts to reformulate or transform the original image into one that concurs with the ideological aims of the May revolt. For example, Godard often depicts text used as image.\nProtestors hold newspaper headlines aloft to show their solidarity with the message [26] , or to illustrate their objection to what the headlines say. For example, Cin\u00e9-Tract 7 uses familiar images of De Gaulle and Franco, merging the images so that their visages appear indistinguishable.\nBy using 'ready-made' still images, Godard is able to emulate the print medium, but is also able to use the images from outside sources giving them movement. Largely using the camera for panning and zooming, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts includes only one use of what could conventionally be called a 'cinematic sequence'. The sequence of images shows a protestor throwing an object at the C.R.S. and illustrates a staccato-like movement of the protestor picking up the object, running forward and throwing it.\nSignificantly, the images may either have been derived from cine-footage, achieving the effect by dropping alternate frames, or have been taken with a motorised still camera, reinforcing Godard's challenge to the print medium. [27] In Cin\u00e9-Tract 001, Godard deflates the effects of the violence committed by the C.R.S. into a dangerous children's game of catch. After positioning a C.R.S. guard on the left hand side of the frame throwing an object off-screen to the right, Godard cuts to an image of a protestor on the right hand side of the frame throwing an object back into left off-screen space.\nThe textual inscriptions on the images frequently use inclusive language such as \"us,\" \"we,\" or \"our\". There is no doubt that Godard not only wants to include himself as an active participant in this 'dialogue' he wishes to establish with the spectator, but he also wants to provide guidance and ask questions as to what a revolutionary is\u2013drawing a line where passivity is to be excluded, and action with solidarity is the only way forward.\nBy contrasting the image with the text, Godard expects the play between the two to engage the viewer and catalyse the spectator into revolutionary action, as opposed to what Godard obviously perceives as a normal submissive or passive watching of moving images. For example,\n1. An image of naked lovers with the script reading 'sentiments d'amour'/feelings of love.\n2. A poster advertising La Chinoise [1968], Godard inscribes the image with 'Dans Notre Ambition'/ In our ambition.\n3. Two soldiers with a rocket launcher inscribed with 'De Revolution Naire'/ From the revolution born.'\n4. An oil painting depicting a road in front of an abstract house inscribed with 'Nous Tacherons D'Avancer'/We must advance.'\nIn many respects, the importance of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project, as a whole, is their documenting of the May revolt from an alternative perspective. However, Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts undermine any conventional 'serving' of the documentation of events, and instead, try and pull the viewer into a dialogue with the material. The intertitles in particular pose a number of questions that Godard phrases with sardonic sarcasm. It should be noted that Godard uses approximately two question marks throughout all of the textual signifiers in the eight Cin\u00e9-Tracts. This would suggest to the spectator that they should regard the textual material as rhetorical. By using this technique, Godard reinforces the exclusivity of the audience that the Cin\u00e9-Tracts was created for.\nOne of the means to counteract the effect the state media has had upon moving images from the May revolt is Godard's attempt to reappropriate the original power of the images by guiding the spectator to alternate readings through the textual signifiers. By reappropriating the images with renewed textual meanings, Godard is able to subvert images used by the media, reformulating them into revolutionary texts. As has been suggested, the language employed by the Cin\u00e9-Tracts is inclusive, and Godard goes to great lengths to position the revolutionary struggle in a much wider sphere of influence than the national level.\nUsing the Vietnam conflict as a contemporary reference, Godard also refers to an earlier historical struggle by including images of Franco and merging them with the face of De Gaulle within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts. The inclusion of the images of Franco attempts to raise a revolutionary consciousness that has its generational historical precedent rooted in an earlier struggle which aroused revolutionary sympathy.\nWriting on the effectiveness of the Spanish Civil War in politicising his generation, Louis Althusser illustrates the significance of the war in its transformation of class awareness.\nIt surprised us just as we entered the world, and turned us students of bourgeois or petit bourgeois origin into men advised of the existence of classes, of their struggles and aims. From the evidence it forced on us we drew the only possible conclusion, and rallied to the political organisation of the working class, the Communist Party. [28]\nTo the spectator the majority of the footage used throughout the Cin\u00e9-Tracts appears to be executed in a clinical, almost mathematical way. Generally, each of the shots appears on the screen for two or three seconds, giving the spectator sufficient time to comprehend the image and read the textual signifier Godard provides. However, this methodical style also exists where there are no textual signifiers to be read. This consistently measured filmmaking is not the usual style expected from Godard, although he had made intimations of using such a mathematically derived process throughout the year. [29]\nBy using the same timing of each shot where there are no textual signifiers to be read, Godard accentuates the two dimensions of the source material. There are few shots that reveal different contrasting points of view to reveal a 3-dimensional space for the subjects to inhabit; and with only one example of what could be called a cinematic sequence that depicts subject movement, the figures within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts are immobilised in a 2-dimensional space.\nBy using text, Godard is able to contrast political tracts from different sources and contrast the written message with the photographic evidence. For example, Julia Lesage observes that one of the tracts reproduces a speech of De Gaulle's in the intertitles and uses images of students demonstrating to reveal the contradictions between De Gaulle's speech and the events as they happened. [30]\nThe 2-dimensional political art used throughout the May revolt frequently used text as a means of 'Detournement'. [31] Originally devised by Guy Debord and the Situationist International throughout the early 1960's, Detournement is the repossessing of an image for different ideological purposes than that for which it was created. Frequently this technique entailed placing text over the top of an image to subvert the original meaning. [32] One of the more expansive uses of this method was employed by Debord in his 1973 film La societe du spectacle [1973]. Frequently using montage and text as a means to criticise and reappropriate images and their textual meaning, Debord uses a method similar to Godard's own techniques.\nHowever, Debord was highly critical of Godard, accusing him of being bourgeois; but also of plagiarising Situationist techniques without fully understanding them. It should however be noted that the use of the techniques Debord criticises Godard for are found in much earlier movements, such as the Lef group, the Lettrists and other avant-garde traditions that mixed politics and art.\nThe work of Isidore Isou and the collaborations between Breton, Trotsky and Rivera all play a part within this historical tradition of experimentation between politics, text and image.\nAs in Le Gai Savoir, Godard's interest in using formalist techniques for the Cin\u00e9-Tracts is evident. Godard even goes so far as to use some of the same images from the film. Just as the poster from La Chinoise is used, the 'folding in' of these still images and textual signifiers reflexively reinscribes Godard's earlier work and provides a signature of identification. They also furnish evidence of the Saussurean investigation of images that had concerned Godard's work from La Chinoise onwards. Although the majority of Saussurean theory had been confined within the field of linguistics during the early 1960's, it expanded into literary criticism in the latter part of the decade.\nDevelopments within the field of linguistics obviously offered new tools for Godard's criticism of the social order. [33] With the emergence of Cultural Studies, and the work of Louis Althusser on Saussure's work in the late 1960's, it is not difficult to understand Godard's attraction to the new ideas emerging from literary discourse and to see their application in his 1968 work. [34]\nTony Bennett's assertion that \"\u2026language constantly generates the illusion that it reflects reality instead of signifying it\" [35] can be applied to encompass the language of mass media and visual communication. Godard's acute awareness of these ideas is clearly contained within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts and is representative of earlier themes that appeared in Le Gai Savoir. Godard had determined language to be the enemy and cited Noam Chomsky's work in Le Gai Savoir. Godard continues his analysis of language as the enemy in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts.\nAlthough Le Gai Savoir illustrated a number of different textual methods of word play which culminated in Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud's character Emile creating the word 'Misotodiman' (a mixture of the words method and sentiment), this kind of word creation, play, and fracturing of spelling has become a more advanced set of linguistic tools in Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts. Occasionally they are graphical representations which seem to take a cryptographic purpose or sometimes the textual inscriptions evidence serious intentions and sometimes not. These moments are representative of the lighter side of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts and Godard's 1968 work. As Richard Roud points out, who else but Godard would play with the word, 'analyse' transmogrifying it into 'anal'? [36]\nFor example, Cin\u00e9-Tracts 9 and 16 make great use of intertitles as a form of semiological play. Magnification of certain words, the crossing out of others, the accentuation of certain words by underscoring them multiple times, the drawing of frames to accentuate their message \u2013 all of this contributes to multiple meanings from the text or disorientating the information being imparted.\nSometimes a simple rearrangement of the words by breaking them up to give different meanings aids in disorientating the spectator. These techniques also provide the implication that there is a cautionary warning for the spectator to be guarded about the messages being given. By complicating the form of the messages, they cannot be passively read. In this respect, they come to represent Brechtian methods of alienation.\nOn a theoretical level, the Cin\u00e9-Tracts demonstrate a freshness of something new in film that was only seen in literature at that time. Godard was, and still is, regularly pressed by interviewers and critics alike for his controversial, and often quoted view that he is both a critic who directs film, and a director who films criticism. The form of cultural commentary found in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts is no exception to this idea that Godard has formulated about his work.\nRoud maintains the Cin\u00e9-Tracts are influenced by the 'Left Bank' methodology in revealing \"the whole book-layout aspect\" of the work. [37] Although Roud's observations of this aspect of the films can be given some validity, the prescription of the project entails the use of silence, leaving textual modifiers as an essential means to communicate and subvert the material of the films. It could also be said that the textual signifiers hearken back to a much earlier time in the cinema, and reveal Godard's utilisation of techniques employed by earlier revolutionary movements. For example, there are a number of comparisons between Godard's textual signifiers and the Futurists\u2019 'trans-sense' language. Moreover, there are also comparisons to be made with Vertov's filmmaking techniques and his use of textual signifiers. [38]\nOne particular sequence in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts cuts from the image of the 'C.R.S. SS' symbol to the word 'Anarchy' spray painted on a wall. This shot then cuts to an image of a cartoonish characterisation of De Gaulle that has been drawn on a building wall where an elderly couple inspect it. The cartoon image of De Gaulle was originally constructed by art school students for posters, [39] but the use of the image evolved and began to be used directly on buildings and walls in Paris during the May revolt. The image succeeds in belittling the political power of De Gaulle by reducing him to a cartoon figure, a militarist figure of fun, replete with kepe. However there is also a deeper meaning to this image. Firstly, the image's evolution into graffiti makes it public and available for all to see. Secondly, it represents the transition of an image from its original medium.\nIn particular, the use of graffiti in public spaces, and the messages it conveys become increasingly important throughout Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts. These public messages can be anything from the popular image during the May revolution that equated the C.R.S. with the SS, to aphorisms inciting revolutionary action. These images provide a different form of reportage of ideas and questions than the traditional media.\nHowever, they are also representative of an inherent change in attitudes to the mediums available. If the state or private means of communicating revolutionary messages are unavailable or untrustworthy in their reporting of ideas or the 'truth', then graffiti is the only vehicle for taking revolutionary messages 'directly' to the public. The disposability of the print medium and the fleetingness of the televisual medium are therefore contested by the 'direct' image of protesting against media and state by using public spaces where the message of the May revolt is unavoidable.\nGodard's 1968 work is predominantly concerned with both materialist and formalist inquiries in order to transparently or reflexively reveal the mechanics of both the media and his own filmmaking. This technique or process goes a step further with the Cin\u00e9-Tracts. It is not the revelation of art, per se, but the revelation of the art of the media.\nBy creating an individual form of anti-spectacle, Godard compromises the bourgeois message of the majority of media sources. For Godard to create a form of media that is 'straight' documentation or documentary in style would mean complicity with the ideologically dominant media sources. By creating the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, Godard provides a different ideological code that pejoratively reveals the operation of the mass media, and importantly, how it works.\nThis is not to say there are any 'man-behind-the-curtain' theories in evidence, but Godard strips the material of anything that might be passively ingested. Using the textual signifiers within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts reveals two seemingly contradictory ideas. Firstly, there is the question of skeletally revealing the techniques of communication the media use to seamlessly illustrate political perspectives. Secondly, there is a complicity in the use of similar techniques to those employed by the mass media to communicate its alternative political intent, albeit in contradistinction \u2013 by revealing the seams. If the Cin\u00e9-Tracts' methodology is thought of analogously (like the techniques employed in Le Gai Savoir), the Cin\u00e9-Tracts can be interpreted as Godard performing some form of autopsy on the media corpse.\nUsually this is achieved by Godard's use of mise-en-scene. For example, frequently the spectator is shown what appears to be a portrait of an individual filling the frame. The camera then zooms out to reveal the person as part of several thousand people.\nOften these images are used to illustrate the cruelty of the C.R.S. and the bourgeois bystanders. Cin\u00e9-Tract 9 reveals a student being beaten in the doorway of a building, later within the Cin\u00e9-Tract, the image is repeated, but the camera pulls back to reveal the student is being beaten by C.R.S. and bourgeois bystanders. The implications of these types of shot are obvious. The media is frequently not giving the spectator the total picture, and the spectator needs to be re-educated to see correctly.\nIn contrast to Godard's documenting of the events of May, William Klein's [40] documentary Grands soirs et petits matins: Mai 68 au Quartier Latin [1978] presents the May events in a conventional 'Cinema Verit\u00e9' construction. Illustrating the employment of different forms of technology to aid the revolutionary cause, Klein shows the use of radio, telephone and public address technologies that helped enable the spread of ideas and communication that protestors relied upon for action. Protestors gather in the street around radios for information about Government decisions, speeches by De Gaulle and news of action taking place elsewhere in France. Organisers gather around tables in the Nanterre buildings, waiting for and making telephone calls, while printing leaflets on the university copier machines. Each of these instruments illustrates the significance of technology in aiding revolutionary goals.\nSimilarly, Godard repeatedly uses the image of one of these technological instruments\u2013the megaphone\u2013throughout the Cin\u00e9-Tracts as a symbol of communication and a technology of the voice. [41] One sequence uses individual shots of a megaphone being aimed outwards toward each corner of the frame. In one shot, the depth of field in the image allows a figure with a megaphone to appear to be shouting directly into the ear of an individual. As a metaphor, the shot depicts a message of the strength of language, and the belief that the message of the revolution will succeed. However, it also reveals that the technology available is not only helping accomplish the aims of the revolution, but is in part responsible for its success up to the present time.\nGodard's relationship with the still image appears to be contradictory (not to mention ironic, considering the number of commercial postcards where he is the central image) and illustrates his concerns, not only with the images created within cinema, but all images. In this respect, work such as the Cin\u00e9-Tracts provides a precursor to the work he has done in the last few years with the Histoire du Cin\u00e9ma [1989-1997] project. [42]\nMcLuhan suggests the advent of the photographic image provided the means \"to make visual reports without syntax\" [43] in effect displacing literary forms into headlines with the invention of the telegraph. In Susan Sontag's essays on photography, she illustrates their material nature; they are something to possess compared to the fleetingness of the cinematic experience. Godard's history of using still photographs pre-1968 is relatively extensive. One such usage was in a sequence in Les Carabiniers [1963], that satirically examined postcard images the two central characters bring home.\nAlthough the Cin\u00e9-Tracts use a different model of narrative explanation in contrast to Les Carabiniers, the theme developed within the Cin\u00e9-Tracts answers and complements the critique Les Carabiniers established. If the images that 'Ulysee' and 'Michel-Ange' bring back from the war are a ridiculously 'objective' depiction of their adventures, Godard's Cin\u00e9-Tracts attempt to rescue the subjectivity of images, and reappropriate them into a coherence for those who have lived through the struggle they see unfold before them on the screen. However, the exclusivity of using still images in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts reveals a greater economy of usage. Without the use of sound, the limitations of the films' length and the immediacy involved in their creation and distribution, the films eviscerate conventional narrative structures for a semiotic examination of the media using still images.\nDiscussing the use of photographs in Les Carabiniers, Sontag believes the acquisition of post-cards and photographs is a key representation of the modern in Godard's films, they are \"the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood.\" [44] However, Sontag also alludes to the loss of power still photographs have when used within the cinematic medium. In essence, a photograph is created to be looked at for a duration of time that is at the will of the viewer. In contrast, the film medium removes this control or power from the spectator.\nWhat the spectator sees is dictated by what the director has chosen to present and the spectator has no control over how long they will be allowed to view the image. By consciously adopting this precept, Godard strips the photographic image of its material 'static' power and uses the photographic images cinematically to break their 'bourgeois' coding. It is by their appropriation into the cinema, that they take on a revolutionary purpose. Textually inscribing their meanings, or using montage to create new equations, the corollary of this concept suggests an ideological equation. Due to its ability to be possessed materially, the still image has a bourgeois functionality within society, in contrast to, or at war with the cinema, which represents a revolutionary medium.\nRichard Roud stated that one of the contributions to Godard's changing attitudes to film making in 1968 was, he believed, that Godard was discovering the personal was political. The thought could be extended to mean that Godard is searching for something much more profound \u2013 a total personal and political revolution. [45]\nAmeliorating the anonymity that the prescription of the project entailed by the revealing of signs of authorship in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts, and Godard's willingness to directly identify himself with revolutionary struggles outside of his work, lends this some form of credibility. In an interview with Anne Wiazemsky in 1987, she suggests that some of Godard's revolutionary work may have stepped outside the parameters of his films.\nWas he a terrorist? Oui. [..] Very feebly. [46]\nInterestingly, the published criticism of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts project is usually limited to briefly mentioning their existence. Colin MacCabe's exhaustive look at Godard from 1968 to 1980 Godard: Images, Sounds, Politics, mentions the existence of the films once in a brief time capsule of Godard's work [47] , but does not include them in the filmography. Yosefa Loshitzky's book The Radical Faces of Godard and Bertolucci gives an unusual seven line summary of the films, that appears to relegate them to material \"made by Godard at home\" [48] . Royal S. Brown indicates the existence of the project in his chronology of Godard's career, [49] while Tom Milne's Godard On Godard does not even include the existence of the project. [50]\nThe critical work on the Cin\u00e9-Tracts that does exist is unusually negative. A number of criticisms are directed against the Cin\u00e9-Tracts from critics such as Richard Roud, who was normally a great supporter of Godard's films in the United States. Incorrectly ascribing the chronology of the Cin\u00e9-Tracts and Le Gai Savoir, Roud believes the Cin\u00e9-Tracts fall victim to the 'acrostic/aphasiac manner' that was to be evidenced later in Le Gai Savoir, a project that had been completed before the Cin\u00e9-Tracts.\nIt is also significant, and perhaps unfortunate, that some of the more annoying aspects of the tracts one ascribes to Godard can be found in his later films, like Le Gai Savoir, where the acrostic/aphasiac manner reaches new\u2013and perhaps irrelevant\u2013heights. [51]\nOr: The same is certainly true of that curious method of underlining single letters n a handwritten title which he developed in the Cin\u00e9-Tracts. Sometimes the underlined letters spell out a word; at other times they simply form chains of 'u's, 'n's 'i's and 'o's. Even if one does construe the word 'Union,' does it really help? In either case, the technique\u2013or tic\u2013is less than illuminating. [52]\nRoud seems to miss the possibilities of using this technique. By breaking words down into individual letters or phonemes, their spelling can take on otherwise unnoticed meanings. To use Roud's own example, the word 'Union' when broken down into its individual letters can accent possibilities in English, as well as French. U-N-I could merely be a phonetic joke on \u2018you and I\u2019 (that is, It takes you and I to make a union). Roud also misses the historical significance of using this technique to create new meanings or alienate the spectator from the image. One of the features of early Futurism was the use of 'trans-sense' language \u2013 a semi-comprehensible collation of nonsense words and neologisms \u2013 a play on words, their roots and suffixes. [53]\nInterestingly, Jonathan Rosenbaum contends that the pre 1968 work did more for galvanising the counterculture than either the Cin\u00e9-Tracts or Un Film Comme les Autres [1968].\nNo one was quite sure, at least within my purview, but figuring out Godard's position was secondary at the time to learning what was happening. Unlike all the strictly agitational films made by Godard and others after May '68--starting with the Cin\u00e9-Tracts and Un Film Comme les Autres, which failed to galvanise the same energies--La Chinoise and Weekend were exciting first editions of global newspapers that were suddenly running off the presses and being devoured more for their excitement as reports than for their status as statements or as works of art (which they also were). Whether or not they were masterpieces was strictly secondary to their value as provocations.. [54]\nSo why are the provocations of the pre-1968 films supposedly more effective? Most critics seem to be intolerant of the textual inscriptions used within Godard's films from this period. Roud seems to openly resent them as being 'irrelevant' in Le Gai Savoir and the Cin\u00e9-Tracts; and although it is not stated, part of Rosenbaum's criticism of Cin\u00e9-Tracts and Un Film Comme les Autres undoubtedly lies with the fact their content is targeted toward French audiences which reduces the accessibility of the films' content. The 'news' elements of both films affected the daily lives of French national audiences during the May events and confine the immediacy of their intent for that audience.\nHowever, the obvious criticism of Godard's work during and after this period of course is Godard's overt change in direction in the representation of his films. An over-simplification, but changing from subtly politicised fiction to openly political non-fiction, and the rejection of his previously popular narrative style not only achieved its goal of alienating the spectator, it managed to alienate the critic as spectator as well. [55] However, it is these kinds of shifts in spectatorship that Godard is wanting to address with his films throughout 1968, and is representative of what would become of increased concern in Godard's work with the Cin\u00e9-Tracts and subsequent projects.\nLike the earlier work in Le Gai Savoir, Godard draws the spectator's attention to the uses of the media image and provides an ideological critique. This new exploration and understanding can, in part, be attributed to the work of Walter Benjamin. [56] No image is statically fixed within its context or the boundaries of its medium forever. It can easily be manipulated in its meaning and correlated with other images or text for new meanings and messages. In this sense, the images are like a revolving kaleidoscope. The content is the same, but its shifts into other mediums or contexts present new compositions and ever changing data that can be produced in infinite ways.\nThe Cin\u00e9-Tracts are therefore significant not just for their alternative documenting of the events of May, but are testimony to Godard's investigation into the possibilities of ideological cinema, and understanding that without fixity, every image becomes a virtual image.\nBack: Table of Contents\n[1] Godard, 'One Should Put Everything into a Film'.

The company ran prominent ads in the Orange County Yellow Pages, and those ads made the phone ring.\n\u201cEach year I do the biggest, boldest ads,\u201d said Mitch Goldstone, president-CEO of ScanMyPhotos.com . \u201cWe were the biggest and best ad in our category for much of Orange County.\u201d\nLast August, as soon as the directory was published, Goldstone leafed through the pages to see his ad. But it wasn\u2019t there. The Yellow Pages had inadvertently left the ad out.\n\u201cWe saw a significant drop-off in calls,\u201d Goldstone said, adding that without the ad, \u201cit looked like I was out of business\u201d to both customers and competitors.\nNeeding an instant solution, Goldstone turned to local search online. While ScanMyPhotos.com had dabbled in search marketing, testing keyword buys on the major engines last year, it had neither an online or search strategy to speak of.\nAs a stopgap measure, Goldstone turned to Local.com, an online search engine that can target a business\u2019 message to local customers conducting online searches.\n\u201cI was familiar with Local.com because they are based in my city,\u201d Goldstone said.\nIn early November, Goldstone placed his first Local.com ad and said that within a couple of weeks, the phone started ringing and hasn\u2019t stopped.\nScanMyPhotos.com is using Local.com\u2019s Local Promote advertising program, which guarantees its customer\u2019s listing will appear at the top of the search results page in a specified category and region.\nGoldstone said that the best part is he is spending about half of what he had been on Yellow Pages ads. Despite that reduced budget, the effort is producing more qualified leads.\n\u201cWe used to get three or four calls a day on average [that came from the Yellow Pages ad],\u201d Goldstone said. \u201cNow, we get eight calls a day on average and 10 calls a day during the holidays.\u201d\nAs a bonus, Goldstone said that the customers that come through the Internet \u201cseem to be more qualified.\u201d\nSo Goldstone is saying farewell to Yellow Pages advertising.\n\u201cI thought it was a stopgap measure to run until next August and then redo my Yellow Pages ad, but we\u2019re not doing that anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that.\u201d\nHis only regret? That he didn\u2019t discover Local.com sooner.\nFree Photo Scanning for Facebook\u00ae, MySpace\u00ae, Blogger\u00ae and Flickr\u00ae Members From ScanMyPhotos.com\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It\u2019s a wrap.

With equipment, software, and production support all bundled together in one cohesive package, EQ contains everything photofinishing retailers need to produce any product involving their customers' photos.\n\"In fact, while one-hour photo books gave retailers a new hit product this past holiday season, even more bound calendars and folded greeting cards - all done within an hour on the EQ-9800 - were made by photofinishing retailers,\" adds Giordano. \"More than 100,000 one-hour bound calendars and more than one million one-hour folded greeting cards were printed in November and December 2007. The EQ-9800 gave retailers three top sellers for the holidays.\"\n\"Photo books and flip books were some of our hottest sellers this holiday season,\" said Mitch Goldstone, co-owner of 30 Minute Photos Etc. and ScanMyPhotos.com in Irvine, Calif. \"The Lucidiom system is full of exclusive designs that make it easy for consumers to drop in their photos and customize their books to their own personal style.\"\nSome of Lucidiom's retailers took the photo book in regards to gift-giving one step further. For example, Avon Moto Photo purchased special packaging boxes with tissue paper for the books, so customers only had to wrap the box to have a finished gift. \"We built a new kiosk bar area earlier this year, and traffic steadily has increased as consumers use the kiosks to make photo books and other creative photo products,\" said Joel Miller, owner of Avon Moto Photo in Avon, Conn.\nAt PMA '08, Lucidiom will improve upon its photo books even further, by offering full-bleed books to create borderless photo books.The photo and retailing industries can view EQ's capabilities at Lucidiom's booth at two tradeshows this month: the 2008 International CES, January 7-10, and PMA 08, January 31-February 2. Both shows are in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nTips for keeping your house in orderHOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR HOUSE AND PECK AWAY AT THE TO-DO LIST\nBy Judy StarkSt. Petersburg (Fla.) TimesArticle Launched: 01/05/2008 01:39:27 AM PST\nIt's the time of year when we all think about what we should be doing around the house.\nEveryone's time is valuable, so here are some things you can do in 15 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour. We also list the bare-minimum chores for those who are living on their own for the first time or those who are truly time-pressed.\nAdd your own items to this checklist, and work at them as the months go by. You can end 2008 with a home that's cleaner, brighter and better organized than when the year began. That will be worth celebrating!\nIN 15 MINUTES YOU CAN . . .\n\u2022 Flip the mattress.\n\u2022 Dust the fan blades.\n\u2022 Wipe fingerprints off doors and door frames (use a damp cloth and a spray cleaner; if you've got serious grime, try a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser).\n\u2022 Go through the linen closet and pick out the worn but still usable towels and washcloths. If they're still in pretty decent shape, a shelter may welcome them. If they're on the ragged side, animal shelters, pet boutiques and vets may be glad to have them for bathing animals.\n\u2022 Clean out one drawer.\n\u2022 Clean the top of the refrigerator.\n\u2022 Dust that hard-to-reach shelf.\n\u2022 Clean out ceiling light fixtures. Dump the dead insect bodies and wash and dry the fixtures.\nIN 30 MINUTES YOU CAN . . .\n\u2022 Roll out the refrigerator, vacuum theAdvertisementcoils and clean the floor under it.\n\u2022 Roll out the stove and clean beside, behind and under it. (You'll be amazed.)\n\u2022 Get a battery checker and test the batteries in all of your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, flashlights and other battery-powered devices. If they're still good, good. If not, replace them.\n\u2022 Make a dent in that ugly chore you keep avoiding: cleaning the mold and mildew in the shower stall; cleaning and lubricating the rollers on sliding doors; scrubbing and resealing grout in tile floors.\nIN AN HOUR YOU CAN . . .\n\u2022 Sweep the garage.\n\u2022 Wash the car, or take it to the car wash.\n\u2022 Clean out and reorganize your overloaded computer files (wear out that \"delete\" button). At the end of an hour, stop. You can come back another time and do more.\n\u2022 Walk through the house and gather up all the magazines and catalogs. Decide which to throw, which to pass on (to friends, nursing homes, doctor's office, hair salon), which you're going to read. Pick up some magazine organizers at the big-box office-supply stores to keep them sorted. Cancel subscriptions to magazines you no longer read.\nINVENTORY TIME\n\u2022 Review the cleaning supplies you have (which are probably under the kitchen sink, in the garage, in the laundry room and in the bathroom). Set aside those you don't use. Replace what you're about to run out of. If you've got three partial bottles of glass cleaner and four bottles of countertop spray, commit to using them up before you buy more. If you're constantly running out of something (dishwasher detergent, for example), stockpile a year's supply.\n\u2022 Do the same thing for other household staples: coffee filters, napkins, toothpaste, first-aid supplies, stationery items, stamps.\nWORK ON A PHOTO FINISH\n\u2022 Get out those shoe boxes full of photos. Spend an hour identifying them, throwing out duplicates and bad shots.\n\u2022 Put those images on CDs so you can share them, e-mail them, make cards, calendars, etc. One such source: www.scanmyphotos.com . You pay $100 for a prepaid box into which you stuff as many photos as you can. They scan them onto a CD for you and return the photos.\n\u2022 Are there photos you've been promising to share? Take them to a photo store or the photo department at your local drugstore, discount store or grocery, and have the prints made. (This costs as little as 15 cents a print.) Or, if you've got the photos online, spend an hour e-mailing them to the recipients.\nIN THE CAR\n\u2022 Clean it out. Get rid of the trash, juice boxes, fast-food wrappers. Clean out the glove box.\n\u2022 If your maps are more than two years old, replace them.\n\u2022 Put together an emergency kit in a box or canvas bag: flashlight, flares, flat-fixer, change and a few small bills, pen, pad, a couple of envelopes, first-aid items, hand sanitizer or wipes, roll of paper towels.\n\u2022 Replace worn wiper blades.\n\u2022 Look at stores that sell organizing supplies, auto parts and office supplies for organizers that can keep papers, files, samples, sports gear and whatever else you're hauling around in place and out of your way.\n\u2022 When was the last time you checked the oil and topped up the window-washer fluid?\n\u2022 Get new floor mats, a license plate frame and a good cup holder.\nSORT, SHARPEN, SPRUCE UP\n\u2022 Sort through the videos/DVDs (or have those who watch them do this). Get rid of the ones no one watches any longer.\n\u2022 Write on. Throw out pencil stubs and the pens that no longer write. If your pencil jar is jammed full, pull some out and give them away (shelters, senior centers, or your church might be glad to have them).\n\u2022 Where would it be useful to have a hook, a screw or a nail to hang something up? In the garage, the back hall, the front closet, a child's room? Get out a hammer or a drill-driver and solve this problem now.\n\u2022 Where do you need a duplicate: another pair of scissors, a ruler, a screwdriver, a set of measuring spoons? Get them and end those constant trips to the other end of the house.\n\u2022 Do you know where your fire extinguisher is? Do you have a fire extinguisher? Do you know how to use it? Do what you need to do so you can answer \"yes\" to all these questions.\nAROUND THE HOUSE\n\u2022 Hose down the front of the house to get rid of spiderwebs, mud daubers, dead insects and general dust and grime. Clean out the porch light fixture and make sure the light works. Replace the welcome mat. If the flowers are dead, leggy or otherwise spent, replace them. Polish the door knocker and the brass numerals; replace the numbers if necessary.\n\u2022 Is your bathroom sink draining slowly? Remove the pop-up stopper and clean away the hair and gunk that has accumulated on it. If this doesn't solve your problem, you may need a plunger, a snake, a chemical drain cleaner or the baking soda-vinegar-boiling water trick.\n\u2022 Wash the windows. OK, wash one window, or the windows in one room. Work your way through the house over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Do you know how your house works? Learn how to shut off the power, gas and water for the entire house and how to shut off the water at each sink. Label the breakers in your electrical box.\n\u2022 Learn how to unplug your garage door from its electrical source and how to lock it, and know how to open the door manually when the power is out.\n\u2022 What if you locked yourself out of your house? Give a key to a neighbor; keep another at work (unlabeled, please).\nABOUT THE KIDS\n\u2022 Weed out the clothes they've outgrown or won't wear and pass them on to another child.\n\u2022 Ditto with the toys, games and books they've outgrown or lost interest in.\n\u2022 Provide open clothes hampers and open baskets or boxes for toy storage. Kids won't lift lids.\nAT THE BARE MINIMUM\nFor the time-strangled among you, here's the bare minimum to ward off a health department citation and keep your mother happy:\n\u2022 Make your bed every day.\n\u2022 Vacuum and dust once a week.\n\u2022 Do your laundry once a week.\n\u2022 Change the sheets weekly.\n\u2022 Mop the kitchen floor once a week.\n\u2022 Take out the garbage as often as it needs it (if you can smell it, you're overdue). Ditto on emptying the wastebaskets and removing the pile of newspapers.\n\u2022 Clean the bathroom once a week: Swish out the toilet, wipe down the sink and vanity top, clean the mirror. Mop the floor. If you're a tub bather, clean the tub. The shower? Wipe it down with a squeegee every day.\n\u2022 Wash the dishes every day. Wipe the countertops and the cooktop.\n\u2022 Hang up your clothes.\nAnalog Is Dead: Why All Photo Snapshots Must Be Digitized in 2008, Explains ScanMyPhotos.com\nAnalog Is Dead: Why All Photo Snapshots Must Be Digitized in 2008, Explains ScanMyPhotos.com\nIRVINE, Calif., Dec 24, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- If you are plugged-in to the lightning-fast changes in technology, you know your collection of vinyl albums, VHS cassettes and printed pictures must be digitally converted before it fades away.\n\"Analog is dead. Now, the race is on to digitally convert generations of favorite memories super-fast and inexpensively,\" explained Mitch Goldstone, a speaker at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES (R)). As part of the January 8th \"Spotlight on Imaging\" session, Goldstone will discuss what he describes as \"the biggest news since the advent of digital photography\" and forecast how quickly the 3.5 trillion analog pictures can be digitally saved and shared.\n\"If you thought the recording and motion picture industries were smart by re-branding and inventing new distribution channels to market their products, the photo imaging industry is also poised to create similar demand and excitement in 2008.\nGoldstone, president and CEO of ScanMyPhotos.com will again address the 2008 CES--the world's largest consumer technology trade show. His updated message on super-fast photo scanning with the KODAK Document Imaging i660 scanners (Kodak.com customer profile), helps digitally preserve generations of photo memories in minutes.\nOne-thousand photos are digitally scanned in about 10-minutes for just $49.95, or more than 1,600 pictures saved when using the online ScanMyPhotos.com $124.95 prepaid \"fill-the-box\" U.S. Postal Service Priority mail service.\nScanMyPhotos.com has a treasured history of trust.

In many cases, there's simply not enough time to grab them all.\nWhen we put a local family through an evacuation drill this week, they spent almost all of their time and energy saving their albums, pictures and irreplaceable videos with the kids' first smiles and first steps.\nBut wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to worry about any of it? With a little planning, that's entirely possible. All you have to do is back up your data online.\nMozy and Carbonite, featured in a recent USA Today article, are two companies that offer unlimited storage for your photos, your music, and your Outlook e-mail files for $50 a year.\nAs Mozy touts on its website, the great thing about it is that your backup files are encrypted and stored in a secure, remote location that's accessible to you from anywhere. And if there's no time to grab your computer in a fire, your data is safe.\nThe backups are automatic - just schedule the times to back up your data, and Mozy does the rest.\nCarbonite's services are similar, and the company reassures you it is always looking for new data on your PC. The moment you add or modify files, Carbonite swings into action to back up your data.\nBut what about your old photos - the ones that aren't digital?\nYou can always scan your photos, but anyone who's tried to do this before knows it can take a long time. If you prefer, you can try a scanning service.\nAt ScanMyPhotos.com, you pay $124.95 for a pre-paid box. Just fill the box with as many photos as you can fit, and they'll scan them all.\nThe website says the box can hold more than 1,600 4x6 photos, and they'll accept sizes 3x4 up to 8x12. Then, they'll send you a CD with all the images. You can then back those up on your hard drive or online storage service as well.\nWhen I had to evacuate last week, I hastily took video of my house with my Treo phone for insurance purposes so I could document what I owned in case I lost it all.\nA much better way to be prepared is to keep an updated home inventory of your assets. For this, you can get help from a website called KnowYourStuff.org.\nYou can download free software, and can edit, print and store the valuable items you have in your home. You can even store photos of rooms and objects, making your insurance claims quicker if you're a victims of a fire or earthquake.\nSure, all of this will take some time, but if you're organized and prepared, it could end up saving time, and sparing your precious memories.\nScanMyPhotos.com CEO Mitch Goldstone to Speak at the Consumer Electronics Show\nScanMyPhotos.com CEO Mitch Goldstone to Speak at the Consumer Electronics Show:\nGoldstone to speak in Las Vegas at the \"Spotlight on Imaging\" CES panel on Tuesday, January 8 from 3 - 4 p.m. in the Renaissance Hotel, Ballroom 1\nIRVINE, Calif., Dec 17, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- ScanMyPhotos.com, today announced that president and CEO Mitch Goldstone will speak again at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES(R)) as part of a panel discussion entitled: \"Spotlight on Imaging.\" The session is cosponsored by Picture Business Magazine and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA(R)) which produces the 2008 International CES - the world's largest consumer technology trade show.\nThe panel discussion at the 2008 International CES will take place on January 8, at 3:00 p.m. at the Renaissance Hotel, Ballroom 1, in Las Vegas, NV.

No more 4x6\" prints at ScanMyPhotos.com and 30 Minute Photos Etc.\nIrvine, CA (PRWEB) October 17, 2007 -- First, the ocean-sized shift in the photo industry swallowed up film. Now, according to Mitch Goldstone, a well-known leader in the photo imaging industry, \"film is dead, and right behind it are those traditional 4x6\" photo snapshots.\"\nJust as digital replaced film, Photo Flip-Books are poised to replace individual snapshots. As a respected and visionary leader in the photo industry since 1990, Goldstone wants to force consumers to see the future. So, ScanMyPhotos.com, and its parent company, 30 Minute Photos Etc. will no longer be promoting traditional 4x6\" print services.\n\"In advance of the holiday picture-taking season, to help force consumers to see the future, 4x6\" prints are now history at 30 Minute Photos Etc. Instead, the company is using Lucidiom kiosks to let everyone make their own custom photo expressions,\" said Goldstone.\nLast week, Goldstone, president and CEO of ScanMyPhotos.com and 30 Minute Photos Etc. addressed the International Photo Marketing Association's UK conference outside of London. He seemed to shock the international audience of photo specialty retailers, because while overseas, photo labs are still developing and printing film, it is at a reduced rate. His assessment was extra worrisome, because his message also warned that photo snapshots are disappearing at an even faster rate. Today, picture-takers, especially the youth market are snapping more pictures than ever, but just not making prints. Instead, they turn their digital cameras and camera phone around to share their collection of photo memories.\nHowever, Goldstone was very encouraged about the innovations and future of the imaging industry because, just as his company, ScanMyPhotos.com, created an entirely new business model to provide super-fast and very economical ways to preserve the trillions of analog pictures that span generations, the next \"new-new thing\" is 6x6\" Photo Flip-Books. Once the pictures are digitized, rather than ordering prints, the most popular request now are to build do-it-yourself Photo Flip-Books. In minutes, his customers choose all their favorite shots and create custom albums that have dozens of templates and styles. Using the Lucidiom kiosks, you can start with a single cover photo, than add multiple pages and modern layouts with a variety of choices, from two, three and four pictures on each page.\nDiane and George Sanders use to have about five or six rolls of film developed each year, then came digital cameras and they no longer bought film. Today, the same is happening with how they save and show off their favorite snapshots. In the past, they would order double prints of every picture, now they are using the new Lucidiom photo kiosks to create inexpensive Photo Flip-Books that are finished and ready for pickup in minutes.\n\"This is a multibillion dollar market that will offset the decline of film developing and print processing,\" notes Goldstone.\n\"Our customers, like Diane and George Sanders ordered not one, but separate Photo Flip-Books for everyone photographed at their recent company party,\" says Goldstone. \"The cost was just $7.99 each and all twenty four books were completed within minutes.\"\nGoldstone continues: \"Thanks to Lucidiom, the double-sided Photo Flip-Books are the new way to tell stories of events and celebrations and share pictures while having fun. The do-it-yourself kiosks are today's answer to reinvigorating the entire photo business. For more than one-hundred years, the 4x6\" print size was the only pictures that fit in albums, but now we have a new way to create more photo products than ever, from electronic scrapbooking pages, to DVD Cinema presentations, Wall Art and collage prints that are completed in minutes.\"\nScanMyPhotos.com is the leader in super-fast photo scanning with same day return and two innovative services; pay just $124.95 to order a prepaid U.S. Postal Service box that holds more than 1,600+ pictures, or $49.95 to scan up to 1,000 pictures with same day return with several personalized options.

As they glimpse upon the condition of those favorite, overlooked pictures - stored away in shoeboxes - their memories are often diminished. Without digitally protecting all the family snapshots, photographs can be lost forever.\nFamily Tree Magazine's (Jan, 2008) \"Toolkit\" section shares ways to speed up the scanning process. The \"Quick Pics\" article Click here to read , written by Rick Crume, profiles several photo scanning services, including ScanMyPhotos.com and its inexpensive and super-fast same-day, fill-the-box service to preserve photos before they fade away and get lost. Family Tree Magazine is America's leading family history genealogy magazine and along with its website ( FamilyTreeMagazine.com ) helps discover, preserve and celebrate the past.\nSuper-fast photo scanning was created by ScanMyPhotos.com, a division of 30 Minute Photos Etc (founded in 1990). According to company president & CEO, Mitch Goldstone, \"people often do not have the patience to scan their photos and they tend to need their digitized pictures right away. So far, we have scanned more than 3,400,000 pictures.\"\nWhile 1,500 snapshots is an average order size at ScanMyPhotos.com, it takes their super-fast KODAK i660 scanners just minutes to complete each order for its nationwide ecommerce and walk-in retail business.\nThe second most common question at ScanMyPhotos.com concerns turn-around and whether they send customers' pictures abroad? \"Because everything is instant and mailed back the same day, our first answer addresses both concerns,\" said Goldstone.\nBut, the most popular inquiry is whether ScanMyPhotos.com really does have such affordable photo scan to DVD prices?\nWhat Is the Cost to Scan Photos?\nOption #1: Order prepaid fill-the-box scanning from ScanMyPhotos.com and pay just $124.95 to have more than 1,600+ 4x6\" photos scanned. Your prepaid box is mailed to you the same day the order is placed. Everything is included, including the custom DVD data disc and all shipping and handling. This most economical service means that an average cost per scan is about 2.5 cents, and when you buy two boxes, you get the 3rd free -- thus, pay just $199.90 to have more than 5,500 pictures scanned and returned the same day. Many extra services are available, including custom Crystal Diamond Photo Enhancement, photo memory books, volume discounts for multiple extra DVD data discs (low as $2.49 each).\nOption #2: Mail your own box and pay just $49.95 to have up to 1,000 photos scanned, plus shipping and handling. All information and a menu of extra products are detailed on the downloadable order form. Customers should first review the online instructions to learn how easily it is to prepare their photos, but note that no copyrighted pictures are permitted.\nSuper-fast Photo Scanning Interesting Facts:\n- While 35mm mounted slides and 35mm negatives are separately priced and individually scanned at 2000 dpi and include custom color and density correction, and free upright rotation, it does also include KODAK Digital Ice enhancements to adjust for dust and scratches.\n-The most popular ScanMyPhotos.com service is photo scanning, where pictures are scanned at 300 dpi, so a 4x6\" print is digitized at about a large 1.0 -- 1.5 MB compressed file which is ideal for ordering Kodak-quality reprints from their website, sharing, archiving and using as slideshow presentations.\n-The average photo scanning service takes just minutes to complete. However, nothing is average at ScanMyPhotos.com, explains Goldstone, \"every single photo memory is special and unique. We look at each snapshot, even those old Polaroid pictures as being extraordinary, and that is why bulk-scanning is so important.\nHow to Scan Photos?\nIt is as easy as visiting ScanMyPhotos.com. Within minutes, you experience what makes them special. \"We make it super-easy to get your photos scanned,\" said Goldstone, who regularly addresses key photo imaging industry conferences and is a well-known leader in the photo industry.\nEven KODAK has recognized the importance of Goldstone and his partner, Carl Berman's company and has a lengthy customer profile on their Kodak.com website.\nWhat happened during the Family Tree Magazine interview is identical to all the others, explained Goldstone, who described his super-fast scanning and related photo imaging services as something magical. \"Ever since 1990, our company has been all about instant turn-around. Consumers want their orders back while they wait, and that is also our model today; for retail customers they literally drop off their photos and within minutes, their entire order is completed. People get so excited and think of us more like 'The Wizard of Oz.' While we make it seem easy, there is a great deal of care and a 17-year history of professionalism that accompanies each order - whether it is just a few hundred scans or our largest single order of 22,000 pictures scanned to DVD which took under five-hours to complete.\"\nScanMyPhotos.com explained that even though they were featured on page one of \"Marketplace\" in The Wall Street Journal (Jan 31) and scores of other profiles and blogger referrals, Family Tree Magazine is among their greatest recognition yet. The magazine and its online site are targeted directly to its core customers -- readers passionate about preserving their memories.\nThe scanning service is preparing to add several new features, including long-term secured photo archiving and a range of new photo imaging products that are all provided though 30 Minute Photos Etc. - its pro lab retail operation based in Irvine, Calif.

Scanners digitize printed material, so you can store it on your PC. They start at around $75 and easily plug into the USB port on any computer. Many all-in-one printers have built-in scanners, which work with software that operates the unit like a copy machine. Scan at resolution of at least 300 DPI (dots per inch) to ensure that you'll be able to produce a good print later.\nSTORY: Online data backup can save music, photos from disaster If your photo collection is too daunting, try a scanning service. Scanmyphotos.com offers scans of as many photos as you can fit in their prepaid box (about 2,000) for $124.95. Organize your photos by size (8x10s, 5x7s, 4x6s) and put them into the prepaid mailer. The photos are returned to you along with a data DVD of your images.\n\u2022Make a copy on a data DVD. Most home computers come with free burning software; slip in a blank disc, and follow the prompts to burn the disc by adding files. Or use a more robust program like Roxio Easy Media Creator 10 ($99.99), which lets you make cool-looking DVD covers as well.\n\u2022 Use an online backup service. Online photo sites such as Shutterfly and Kodak Gallery store low-resolution files of your pictures; in most cases, you'll need to order prints to get them back. Ad-free services such as Phanfare and Smugmug charge about $50 a year and let you retrieve high-resolution photo files. For photos, videos and all your other digital material \u2014 from Word documents to your music library \u2014 try online backup services such as Mozy or Carbonite, which charge about $50 yearly for unlimited storage.\n\u2022Buy an external hard drive. Hard drives get cheaper and bigger every year. A 500-GB hard drive sells for about $100. Fill it with your digital life. For peace of mind, buy a second drive, and take it to a relative's house or put it in a bank safe-deposit box.\n\u2022Backup the backup. A power outage can cause a hard drive to fail. So if you have an external hard drive connected to your computer, buy a surge protector strip with battery protection. These units are available for $30 to $40 and have built-in batteries that keep your devices running for around 20 minutes in case of a power failure.\nBy Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY\nRemember 9-11-01, fly the flag\nSeptember 11th, 2007 \u00b7 posted by Jan Norman - Orange Ocounty Register\nMitch Goldstone at 30 Minute Photos Etc. in Irvine has a simple suggestion to Orange County small-business owners: Fly the American flag in your office, factory or store today, in tribute to those who lost their lives six years ago on this date in New York City, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania.\nGoldstone has done so for six years.

The program has been around for more than five years, but is just now beginning to pick up steam among many midsize e-commerce companies.\nOne such business is Irvine, CA,-based ScanMyPhotos.com, a service that enables consumers to have more than 1,600 personal photos spanning generations digitally preserved and ported to a single DVD data disc.\nScanMyPhotos president/CEO Mitch Goldstone credits partnership with the USPS and the use of flat-rate boxes with both the Postal Service and ScanMyPhotos brands with helping its business grow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been extraordinary \u2014 we couldn\u2019t have entered into this entirely new business without the flat-rate boxes,\u201d said Goldstone, who began his company 17 years ago as a traditional photo processing service. \u201cLots of times people send us orders that need to be turned around at the last minute for a birthday or anniversary. So we use USPS priority mail flat-rate boxes for all of our business.\u201d\nScanMyPhotos charges a flat $124.95 to scan as many photos as can be packed into a single flat-rate box. Built into that fee is the $8.95 USPS flat rate for priority shipping.\n\u201cWe wanted to keep it really simple,\u201d Goldstone explained. \u201cWe mail them the box and they can fill it up and return it to us without paying anything. After we scanned their photos, we send back all the pictures along with the DVD data disc all for that one flat fee.\u201d\nBecause it primarily deals with family memories, Goldstone stressed it was important that customers were comfortable with the shipping process, adding the co-branded boxes also helped with the company\u2019s image.\n\u201cWhen we first started, we would put stamped labels on the boxes ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to call that hokey, but it wasn\u2019t as professional an image as a company that had been around for as long as we have wanted to convey. So the co-branded boxes have really added a lot of value.\u201d\nUSPS public relations representative Yvonne Yoerger said the co-branded flat rate boxes are emerging as a solid revenue stream for the Postal Service, adding, \u201cThe Postal Service is such a well known brand and offers the credibility and reliability of on-time delivery, so businesses are happy to have their name associated with that.\u201d\nIn addition to flat-rate boxes, the USPS can also offer direct marketers, who reach certain volume or revenue requirements, co-branded customized packaging.\nIn addition to helping a company raise its profile, the co-branded boxes also help businessse keep costs down, Yoerger notes, \u201cAnother big bonus is our packaging supplies are free to the customer.\u201d\nThree Million Pictures Scanned and Fifty-Thousand USPS Co-branded Boxes Ordered by ScanMyPhotos.com - Yahoo!

Once in a PC, software like Adobe Photoshop Elements ($80 for the Mac version; $100 for the PC version) can enhance faded colors, remove scratches and crop the image, just as with pictures shot with a digital camera.\nHewlett-Packard\u2019s all-in-one printers can scan in one pass as many photographs as will fit on the scanning tray, then save them as separate images.\nEpson\u2019s Perfection 4490 ($350) includes a 30-page document feeder and scans up to three black-and-white pages a minute; it also scans 35 millimeter slides, negatives and photographs.\nH.P.\u2019s Scanjet G4050 ($200) scans up to 16 slides or 30 negatives simultaneously, and saves them as separate files. It does not, however, include an automatic sheet feeder for documents.\nA number of services will do the conversions for you, either at storefronts or by mail, like Scanmyphotos.com . For those who are concerned about letting their precious memories out of sight, Kodak offers batch digitizing of photographs and other documents through its ScanVan, a vehicle that is currently on tour in the Eastern United States.\nHOME MOVIES\nThe simplest way to digitize those shoeboxes full of Super 8 movies is to use the technique perfected by movie pirates: project the image on a white wall, set up a digital camcorder on a tripod, and then shoot the film.\nThis is one case where you won\u2019t get the best results if you make it a do-it-yourself project. The different frame rates of movie film and a camcorder could cause annoying flickering of the final image. Send your movies to a commercial transfer service like Audio Video Memories (audiovideomemories.com), Digital Transfer Systems\n(digitaltransfersystems.net), and Just8mm.com that uses a telecine machine, a much more sophisticated version of the same home technique.\nMovies arrive back on DVDs, ready to be imported into the PC for editing with a program like Apple\u2019s iMovie ($79, part of iLife \u201908) for Macs, or for PCs, Adobe Premiere Elements 3.0 ($100).\nVHS TAPES\nTo transfer VHS footage, which is analog, into a computer, the PC needs to receive the data digitally. One way to check if your PC is so equipped to do that is to look at the computer\u2019s ports. If it has the familiar RCA inputs \u2014 the yellow, white, and red connectors \u2014 then it most likely is analog ready.If not, analog images must first be converted to the digital format. To do so, combination VHS/DVD player/recorders are one of the simplest ways to get your home movies off your aging video tapes and onto more permanent DVDs. Available from Panasonic, Sony and others, prices start at under $200.Alternatively, connect a stand-alone VHS player to a DVD recorder to make a digital copy.VHS tapes can also be recorded onto a computer\u2019s hard drive by plugging the VCR\u2019s output cable into a digital camcorder that offers a \u201cpass through\u201d mode (most do). The signal is digitized within the camcorder, and then passed on to the PC\u2019s hard drive.\nSony\u2019s $229 VRD-MC5 is specifically made to record DVD copies of VHS tapes, or recordings from any camcorder or digital video recorder, without using a PC. VCRs and camcorders are plugged into the device, which resembles a portable DVD deck.\nIf you do not own a camcorder or DVD recorder, but you have loads of valuable tapes, consider an intermediary conversion product, such as the DAC-200 ($184; synchrotech.com); Dazzle Hollywood DV Bridge ($300; omegamultimedia.com), and VHS to DVD 3.0 ($80; honestech.com). Each product includes hardware and software that converts analog signals to digital.\nLPS, EIGHT-TRACKS, AND AUDIO CASSETTES\nGetting your old Country Joe and the Fish albums into your PC is one of the easiest conversions to do, according to Tom Merritt, executive editor of CNetTV.com.\nAssuming you still have a phonograph turntable (or eight-track or cassette deck) and it is not the console type from the 1950s or earlier, plug the audio output from the turntable\u2019s amplifier/receiver into the minimike port found on virtually all home computers.\nWhile commercial audio editing software is available, Mr. Merritt recommends installing Audacity (audacity.sourceforge.net), a free program available for Macs, PCs and Linux/Unix machines that will manage the files, convert them into a specific format (for example, WAV or MP3), and remove clicks and crackles.\nFor those who value their time more than the fun of connecting cables and reading manuals, there are plenty of commercial companies happy to do the converting for you. Cassettes2CDs.com will convert audio and video tapes, LPs and 45s to digital format, storing the data on a CD, DVD or MP3 format for iPod use. The company does not handle 78 r.p.m. records, reel-to-reel or eight-track tapes.\nIf the thought of gathering up boxes full of photographs or phonograph records to digitize is daunting, here is one other compelling thought: your treasured memories will be in a digital format that can still be easily converted to the next video and audio formats that will invariably show up in the coming years.\nMade in Irvine: Photo Discs - OC Register\nScanMyPhotos.com DVDs help preserve the enjoyment of old photographs. The memories are quickly transformed by a Kodak i660 scanner, which can digitize 750 photos in just five minutes.\nPrice: $49.95 to scan up to 1,000 pictures; or for $124.95 you can fill up their prepaid box with as many photos as you can.\nGenerations of Family Photos are G oing Digital Super-fast at ScanMyPhotos.com -\nYahoo! News\nThousands of neglected motion pictures need to be preserved, but billions of photo snapshots must be saved too, according to ScanMyPhotos.com.\nIrvine, CA (PRWEB) May 24, 2007 -- Because there is an urgent need to save motion pictures at risk of being lost forever, famous entertainment industry leaders are calling to preserve neglected movies, but, there is an equal demand to save another type of picture -- generations of family photos.\n\" While there are thousands of movies that must be saved, there are billions of snapshots spanning decades that must immediately be restored and preserved,\" according to ScanMyPhotos.com . The Irvine, Calif.-based photo imaging company claims to have already preserved millions of pictures -- representing shoeboxes of family photos that span generations from across the nation.Unlike the formidable challenge, cost and time to restore a single motion picture, hundreds of individual snapshots are easily scanned in minutes and digitally preserved. While it can take years to restore a single movie, ScanMyPhotos.com uses the award-winning KODAK i660 Series Scanner and KODAK Capture Software to easily protect photo memories as vibrant digital files. The company also turns the preserved pictures into photo memory albums and can magically enhance each picture to help fix faded and discolored snapshots -- especially those old analog Polaroid pictures.\nHow it works: Shoeboxes from across the nation are mailed each day to ScanMyPhotos.com which provides same-day service for transforming up to one-thousand 3 1\u20442 x 5\" - 11x14\" pictures in minutes onto digital files for just $49.95. This innovative scanning service also features a \"fill-the-box\" prepaid program for scanning more than 1,600 4x6\" photos for just $124.95. (Special, buy two prepaid boxes and the third is free).\nScanMyPhotos.com, a division of 30 Minute Photos Etc., which was founded in 1990 as a traditional retail photo lab, built this new business model to accommodate the growing need to preserve pictures. Reader's Digest (page-197) and Women's Health (page-56) magazines both are profiling ScanMyPhotos.com in their June issues and other feature profiles have appeared in The Wall Street Journal (Jan 31, page-one, Personal Finance) and USA Today (Mar 8, page-three, Money).\nMitch Goldstone, president and CEO of ScanMyPhotos.com, explained that the company \"regularly augments its traditional photo, slide and negative scanning with new products, like, custom Crystal Diamond Photo Enhancements for every picture [Perfectly Clear Software. We also recently added new robotic accuracy for manufacturing the custom DVD discs [Microtech.\" Goldstone explained that ScanMyPhotos.com uses KODAK imaging technologies to help easily scan hundreds of pictures in minutes (750 photos are scanned in five minutes).\nScanMyPhotos.com digitally preserves photo memories and is a division of 30 Minute Photos Etc. which was founded in 1990 by Mitch Goldstone and Carl Berman who operate a retail and ecommerce business for servicing consumer, amateur and professional photographers nationwide with Kodak-quality photographic imaging, custom photo restorations and Lucidiom in-store electronic scrapbooking photo kiosks.\n"}, {"score": 115.16058, "uuid": "93fd2cbb-cf92-5dbe-8b26-6c19ad409f59", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1316wb-47-04011", "target_hostname": "blog.aba.org", "target_uri": "http://blog.aba.org/building-birding-skills/", "page_rank": 1.3315999e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "ABA Blog: Building Birding Skills", "snippet": "Particularly given the abundance of information and the very large number of <em>photographs</em> here, the book is very well produced. <em>I</em> might <em>prefer</em> to have seen <em>a</em> single type face throughout, rather than <em>a</em> different, larger and unattractive font <em>for</em> the introductory material.", "explanation": null, "document": "A multi-authored blog from the American Birding Association with a focus on all things birding.\nBuilding Birding Skills\nby Rick Wright\nAnd that's really what it's all about, isn't it? The goal of birding, of any hobby, is expertise gratia sua, and the only reason we do it is to do it better. This slender new volume by Derek Lovitch will help almost any birder do just that.\nRelatively new birders who take this book in hand may be surprised to find out just what \"better\" means. This is not a difficult species guide. Instead, in nine short, casually written chapters, the author introduces us to some of the tools and resources 21st-century birders have available, and shows us how to bring them to bear as we look for that next \"good\" bird.\nAfter an introductory chapter advocating \"whole bird and more birding,\" Lovitch devotes the next two to how birders can use--and acquire--a knowledge of habitat and geography. Here and throughout, he offers very helpful recommendations for books and online resources in the ancillary sciences; no excuse now not to be able to tell a syacmore from a maple. There is a whiff of an eastern bias in the habitat discussions; the extended example of wintering Empidonax flycatchers in southeastern Arizona doesn't really \"work\" for me. But the reminder to seek out islands of habitat, especially treed islands in seas of open country, is a salutary one wherever you are. Literal islands, peninsulas, and other geographic edges are the subject of the next chapter.\nLovitch is at his very best in the book's central chapters, where he offers detailed instruction in reading weather forecasts for finding birds. I've \"bookmarked\" several meteorological websites I hadn't used before, and am eager to see whether they help me this spring. Just to show that theory begets practice, the author narrates a \"case study\" of a few autumn days in New Jersey, when Lovitch and his friends used the techniques described here to great advantage, birding from Garrett Mountain to Cape May.\nThe book ends with a postscript about \"patch birding,\" frequent visits to the same birding site over a long period. This is how birding used to be done, by most of us at least, and Lovitch's call to return to the practice is a welcome one. And the skills we're taught in this book will make it even more fun--and make us all better birders.\nby Rick Wright\nSteve N.G. Howell's new photographic guide covers all the procellariids, diomedeids, hydrobatids, and oceanitids recorded in (or off) the North American continent.\nYes, you read it right: oceanitids. The taxonomy Howell uses in Petrels, Albatrosses, and Storm-Petrels is progressive indeed, leaving the AOU's would-be canonical classification schemes in the dust. Not only do we find the southern storm-petrels assigned to their own family, Oceanitidae, but numerous novel genera and species are at least tentatively recognized. Howell treats in full 70 taxa, with comparative discussion of many more; in contrast, the AOU lists only 61 species for its area, which, unlike Howell's region of coverage, includes Hawaii. Following Howell (and Robb et al.'s marvelous Petrels Night and Day), we now have in North America, for example, three \"Cory's\" and six \"Manx\" shearwaters, two \"Fea's\" and two \"great-winged\" petrels, three \"wandering\" albatrosses, and three \"band-rumped\" and four \"Leach's\" storm-petrels. And before each of those numbers is to be understood a quiet \"at least\": many of the species, and even some of the genera, split here may well conceal other cryptic taxa deserving of species-level recognition. There may even be two \"Northern\" fulmars. Howell is scrupulous and admirably clear in explaining the nomenclatural \"clusters\" that have long made even talking about so many seabirds so difficult.\nNot to mention identifying them. But even storm-petrel identification, rightly described here as \"one of the most challenging frontiers in modern birding,\" will be made less frustrating in most cases by the wealth of carefully chosen and beautifully well presented information in this book. The (sub)species accounts are clear and thorough, with full treatment of taxonomy, status and distribution, and similar taxa; behavior, especially flight habit, is given considerable space, and Howell's descriptions here are as clear as they are evocative. Each taxon treated is illustrated with an impressive number of often dazzlingly good photos--and, perhaps even more importantly, often with some poorer images of birds at a distance, in fog, or nearly lost in a swarm of similar congeners. The captions are marvels of concise eloquence, pointing out important characters and comparing similar species, sometimes even in the same photo.\nParticularly given the abundance of information and the very large number of photographs here, the book is very well produced. I might prefer to have seen a single type face throughout, rather than a different, larger and unattractive font for the introductory material. Typos are very few and mostly insignificant. The name of the island Trinidade is inconsistently spelled, and the caption to photo 7.11 reverses the identity of the background birds. The Christmas Shearwater is Puffinus nativitatis (not -us), and the black margin to the underwing of the Hawaiian Petrel is thin (not, as claimed in Fig. 120, \"thick\"). The specific epithet of the Black-capped Petrel, hasitata, is probably a misspelling not of haesitata but of hastata, meaning blade-shaped, in reference to the wings. Howell's writing is as pleasingly vivid as it is informative; still, it's unusual to see the phrase \"brain fart\" in print, and I'm skeptical as to whether \"emotional castration\" is truly behind the occasional abbreviation of the name of the Light-mantled Sooty Albatross.\nAs one might expect from the author of the molt volume in the\u00a0Peterson Reference Guide series , the plumages of seabirds are discussed with special thoroughness here. Howell gives us eight well-illustrated pages on the topic in his introduction, then provides dates--at least tentative dates--and details in each species account. It turns out that it is precisely that molt information that permits the distinction in the field between many pairs and trios of similar species; many of Howell's photos show this very well, making this\u00a0an essential tool to help\u00a0readers get their eye in for their next pelagic trip. But even if you're not going down to the sea in boats, Petrels, in its sophistication of approach and exemplary detail, may well be the most useful book you read this year.\nFew are the bird books that go through six editions in their authors' lifetimes, and fewer still those every edition of which takes another considerable step up in accuracy, completeness, and usefulness. Precious few indeed.\nBut here's one.\nI remember well my first sight of the then-new National Geographic Field Guide, twenty-eight years ago (!), and I couldn't wait to get my own copy. I've leapt on each new edition ever since, and nearly three decades of living with the book has only affirmed my conviction that this is by far the best book of any for learning the birds of the United States and Canada. And this new, sixth edition is by far the best of this splendid guide's incarnations so far.\nThere's no need here to rehearse in detail the NatGeo's many advantages over even its most worthy competitors. Some of those advantages--the rich text, the emphasis on variation, the comprehensiveness even at the outermost edges of the area covered--have been present ab ovo, but they have been strengthened, and new strengths added, by the increasingly unified authorial leadership provided by Jon Dunn and Jonathan Alderfer (with Paul Lehman supplying his usual excellent maps).\nThe editorial history of the book is as fascinating as it has been complicated: starting in the late 1970s as a true team effort forged in sad circumstances, this guide has with each passing edition become more and more the child of one of North America's very finest field ornithologists, and each new edition should be read as approaching ever more closely to Jon Dunn's ideal conception of the field guide.\nMirroring Dunn's interests and expertise, this sixth edition adds considerably to the status and distribution information available in earlier versions of the guide. We are given population numbers for many rare taxa, and the accounts for many casual and accidental species include precise dates and locations, a great boon for the watchful seeker of repeat occurrences; quite detailed historical information is often provided for species whose ranges or abundance have changed notably. Several species still relegated to an appendix in the fifth edition have been moved into the main text, and some rarities once crowded inconspicuously among the \"normal\" birds of the area have now been given their own plates and more extensive texts.\nEven a few species not yet recorded in North America north of Mexico are treated: the Sulphur-bellied Flycatcher account urges careful separation of apparent vagrants from the Streaked Flycatcher, and ambitious East Coast birders are furnished with an illustration and brief identification material for the Common Scoter that is certainly lurking out there in the flocks of the (newly re-split) Black Scoter.\nA trademark of this guide since its first edition, geographic variation is accorded especially full and sophisticated treatment here. Some such information appears on the plates; the seventeen figures of the Horned Lark, for example, are larger than in the immediately preceding edition and more amply annotated (one of the very few layout errors in the book finds the label alpestris for one of the flying birds attached to a perched strigata). For other taxa, such as the Common/Holarctic/Californian/Chihuahan Ravens, significant portions of the text are devoted to introducing the complications of their geographic relationships. And for nearly 100 species that are especially complex, the maps--either those accompanying the species accounts or additional, larger maps in an appendix--indicate the breeding range and often the migration routes and wintering grounds of field-identifiable subspecies and subspecies groups. Study a few of these maps carefully, and I think you'll agree with me that no self-respecting field guide of the future will fail to imitate them. Just think what an e-guide could do with this idea, adding layer upon layer to a species' base map....\nUnmatchable in so many ways, the NatGeo guide, even in this newest edition, still reveals weaknesses in its paintings. Thanks to the involvement of Jonathan Alderfer in the last couple of editions, though, the less satisfying illustrations--the troublesome legacy of the book's origins as a committee project--are slowly but surely being replaced with far better images. Something like 300 new figures were painted for this edition, by Alderfer , Killian Mullarney, David Quinn, John Schmitt, and Thomas Schultz; a quick leaf through the art credits finds many of my favorite plates and images attributed to these artists.\nMore noticeable, and perhaps more important, than the new figures is the new design of very many of the plates, permitting the enlargement of many birds that in previous editions were tucked into corners and margins. At the same time, the redesign has left space for sometimes extensive annotation directly on the plates themselves, an innovation with an obvious and estimable forebear .\nThe sixth edition of the National Geographic Field Guide is, simply put, the one book every North American birder needs to have on the shelf. Beginners will find it attractive, easy to use, and portable; intermediate and advanced birders will refer to it again and again with profit--and with surprise at how much it can teach even the most experienced among us.\nby Blake Mathys\nAs birders, our goal is to find and identify birds. That is what we do when we are out in the field, driving, doing yard work, or just glancing out the window. Our overriding urge is to see and then identify birds. Fortunately for us, birds are everywhere. No matter where you go in the ABA area (and, I dare say, the entire world), there are birds to be seen. And as I mentioned in my previous post , we should always be prepared for the unexpected, as you never know what you will find, even in unlikely places. All of this put together means that seeing birds is relatively easy.\nThe second part, identifying, can be more difficult. We try to identify every bird we see. Sure, if a bird is too far away or if the conditions are poor (low light, back light, fog, etc.), we may admit that we aren't sure what the bird was, aside from \"It was a duck\" or \"Definitely a small passerine\". This is of course the thing to do, because we just don't have enough information to completely identify what we've seen. What I want to discuss is when we have an abundance of information: when the bird is a few feet away in good light, providing excellent views. This is when the urge to identify, to name every individual possible, can get us into trouble.\nImagine the scenario that you are birding with friends. A small bird sits up on a close perch, and you are the closest to it. You get a good long look through your binoculars, and then it disappears back into the brush. You are very confused by the bird, and aren't sure of any specific ID (and in fact you aren't quite sure what family it was in). Your friends weren't as close and didn't have the view that you did; they ask you, \"What was that?\" This is when it is tempting to try to make the call; we want to identify birds, and we want to be good at it. We want to know what things are, and we don't want to seem like incompetent birders. We want to say without a doubt \"Female Indigo Bunting\". This can be an especially powerful urge if we've spent time around birders that are better than we are, and we want to show that same ability. The last thing we want to admit is that \"I don't know\".\n\"I don't know\" is one of the few identifications we can ever be completely confident about. If you say you aren't sure, you are being completely honest and are completely right. When we identify birds to species, there is always that lingering possibility that we are wrong (hybridization, mutation, environmental contamination, etc., can all cause an obvious identity to be subtly or completely incorrect). Another benefit is that saying we aren't sure shows other birders that it is okay to be uncertain, that it is okay to question what we saw. These sorts of uncertainties can lead to good outcomes. In the scenario above, imagine you call out \"Indigo Bunting\". Your friends may keep walking, accepting your ID. You've just lost an opportunity to perhaps learn from your birding group's collective knowledge. If you say you aren't quite sure, perhaps someone more familiar with that age/plumage/subspecies will have some helpful insights into how to identify that individual, things you can use for the future.\nAlternately, perhaps you say I don't know, and your birding group takes a closer look and finds a Lazuli Bunting, a rare bird in your area. Now you've learned something and helped find a rarity. The final, and least desirable, scenario is that you make the Indigo Bunting ID, despite your uncertainties; one of your birding friends happens to come across the same bird and makes the correct ID. Now you're embarrassed about the misidentification, and perhaps miss out on a good learning opportunity because of it.\nIt is IMPOSSIBLE to identify every single bird every time. Admitting that you aren't sure is always okay. It doesn't mean you are a bad birder, just that you are honest. Birders at every level make mistakes. Saying \"I don't know\" is never a mistake.\nby Ted Lee Eubanks\nThe title means exactly what the words say: naked lunch, a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork\u2026 William S. Burroughs on Naked Lunch\nI am more curious about what is at the end of every birder\u2019s arm. What do we hoist, perch, lift, finagle, finger, and thumb to identify birds? We invest mightily in accoutrements such as binoculars, scopes, recorders, cameras, and field guides. How often do we use them? For every hour of birding how many minutes are we actually spying through those $2000 glasses? Leica promises that their binoculars offer \u201cbreathtaking images all day, any day.\u201d Do we really screw these tubes to our eyes \u201call day, any day?\u201d\nMy \u201cNaked Hunch\u201d is no. The survey that I recently posted investigated this suspicion. The results are in.\nThe Naked Hunch received 143 responses from 28 states and the District of Columbia. New York and Texas sent in the most. I also received surveys from four foreign countries: Canada, Dominican Republic, Denmark, and Costa Rica.\nParticipants reported an average of 19 hours weekly watching birds. I filtered out the zeros (if you are not watching birds, why are you responding?). Responses ranged from 1 to 136 hours.\nOf that 19-hour average, respondents are without optics or field guide around 45% of the time. They have access to optics yet no field guide a similar percentage (45%). They bird with both (field guide and optics) only 10% of the time.\nCombined our respondents spend around 55% of their birding time with optics. Of this optically-enhanced period, however, they spend only a third (32%) actually looking through these optics. In other words, our birders actually use their binoculars around 17% of the time they bird.\nLet me make an assumption. These respondents are relatively active, committed birders. Given this forum, I doubt that Ma and Pa with their backyard feeders responded to the survey. This is a survey of birders. Proof? Our sample reported the ability to identify an average of 243 species without optics or field guide (the range is 0 to 2000, the median is 150). This is the hard core.\nThumb through your most recent Birding magazine. Most of the articles and ads are focused on this 17% of our birding time. We assume that people can find, detect, locate, and uncover birds, and devote our attention to the final act of identification. Yes, there are services advertised that address the 83%. Tours and tour leaders handle preparation (lodging, meals, transportation), finding, and identification. Most reduce the act of birding to look, see, and tick.\nThe process of birding, the act itself, has distinct phases. Preparation, detection, and identification demand different skill sets and resources. Birding addresses the first and last well enough. I scanned the 10,000 Birds blog this morning. Articles included \"Essentials for Packing When Birding Anywhere in the World\" and the \"Pied-billed Grebe from Every Angle.\" Yes, we cover preparation and identification well.\nFor the most part we ignore finding, the actual act of detecting a bird. Birders purchase books, tapes, CDs, web resources, and optics to prepare for birding and to identify birds. We publish tomes dedicated to tail feather patterns in the Dendroica (or whatever the hell it\u2019s called now). At every turn there is a new field guide. What\u2019s available for finding or detecting, that critical act of uncovering a bird? How much time do we invest in developing these skills?\nBirds are ubiquitous, spread throughout the earth\u2019s habitats and ecological zones. This distribution is not random. We know that shorebirds like shores, and land birds like land. But within these gross delineations there is a fine partitioning of space and resources. To find birds, we must work at their scale.\nSubtle, almost undetectable clues mark their presence. What is obscure to us is obvious to them. A quick flick of the tail, a whispered call note; that which is inconspicuous to us may be blatant to a bird.\nFor 83% of the time we are reduced to their level. We use our blessed panoramic vision to watch for motion: a quick flick here, a restrained bob there. We listen for the thinnest of chips and cheeps, the sound of birds advertising their presence.\nFor 83% of the time no optic or field guide aids us. Of course we depend on these tools for the final act of identification, the coup de grace, in instances when bare-naked birding isn\u2019t sufficient. But what is the return on the investment in a new field guide or a new pair of binoculars? Fractional? Marginal? Negligible?\nIs a new field guide that much better than the old ones? How many species will the new guide aid us with over the course of a year? To what degree do the $2000 binoculars actually help us find and identify new birds? As Ken Rosenberg wrote , \u201ctoday\u2019s mid-priced binoculars in many cases seem better than the top-of-the-line models of a decade ago.\u201d This is not to say that the newest models do not deliver a remarkable image. But to what degree do they make us better birders as opposed to better gearheads?\nTo become a better birder, to become more effective at finding birds to identify with these close-focused, waterproofed, multi-coated, space age wonders, where better to invest than in the 83% of the time we spend watching birds without them? No field guide will find birds for us. No pair of binoculars will help us notice the winter wren rustling the leaves in the thicket along the stream, or alert us to the Nelson\u2019s sharp-tailed sparrow poking through the smooth cordgrass. Knowing sounds, motions, behaviors, seasons, habitats, shapes, and relative sizes are all finding skills that can be learned and honed. Bare-naked birding is more feel and intuition than gear. When is the last time that you felt the presence of a bird?\nI began this particular thread with an article in Birding in 2007. Bare-naked birding has evolved in this brief interlude, and its value has only been enhanced with this evolution. If we spend most of our birding time naked and unadorned, and if the general public is perpetually in a state of undress, why not invest our limited time and resources in developing skills that do not depend on the accoutrements? Why not learn to find, detect, and notice as well as to identify? Why not learn to sense their presence?\nby Bill Schmoker\nMost photographers buying big telephoto lenses are thinking about reaching out to relatively distant subjects.\u00a0 Conversely, folks wanting close-ups will often acquire a good macro lens.\u00a0 But don't forget that modern telephotos often focus pretty close, increasing their utility as \"telephoto-macros\".\u00a0 With its high magnification, a telephoto lens that can focus as close as about 2 or 3 meters can bring out intense detail in small nearby subjects.\u00a0 As an added bonus, skittish critters like dragonflies or butterflies will often tolerate slow approaches to 6 or 8 feet but flush if a lens is thrust any closer.\u00a0 So a telephoto can be perfect to photographically nab these gems.\u00a0 On those wonderful occasions when a wild bird is really close, this technique can also yield stunning portraits!\nA few considerations for telephoto-macro photography:\nIf you've never tried this technique, find a little target like a pebble or leaf and see how close you can get with your camera still able to focus.\u00a0 (If you have a focus-limiting switch don't forget to select the full range or near range, depending on the lens.)\nTelephoto lenses inherently yield very narrow Depth of Field (DOF).\u00a0 Even a smallish butterfly can have the body in focus but upturned wings out of focus.\u00a0 Solution: crank down your aperture (increase the f-stop.)\u00a0 To explore how DOF for your lens is dependent on variable distance and aperture, try a utility like Simple DoF .\nFor longish subjects like dragonflies, it may be difficult to get the whole critter in focus if the body is angled away from the camera.\u00a0 Here you can make the artistic decision to just let the back go soft (focus on the eyes if in doubt.)\u00a0 If you want everything sharp you may need to reposition so the head and body are nearly perpendicular (and thus nearly equidistant) to the lens.\nCranking up your f-stop will slow your shutter speed.\u00a0 If you've lost too much speed to get sharp images (especially if you are hand-holding the lens), bump up your ISO until you get satisfactory shutter speed back.\nReview your shots in the field by blowing up the image on your camera's display.\u00a0 Can you see bristles or tiny antenna on a dragonfly?\u00a0 Can you see scales on a butterfly wing?\u00a0 If not, keep trying.\u00a0 This is a pretty experimental, non-standard technique so figure out what works for you!!\nYours truly photographing odes stream side in Weld County, Colorado, July 2011.\u00a0 (Photo by John Barr.)\u00a0 While I'm using a big telephoto (Nikon 200-400mm f4 VR + 1.4X teleconverter), my subjects are within 10 feet of the lens.\u00a0 All photos below taken with this rig.\nAmerican Rubyspot, Weld County, Colorado, July 2011.\nPale Clubtail,\u00a0 Weld County, Colorado, July 2011.\nCrab (genus Graspus?

If you've ever been to this well-known migration spot, it will be easy to envision the hike through the trees and the anticipation of what avian wonders might pass by over the course of a day's vigil. This site is known for its importance in the history of hawk conservation, its beautiful scenery, and the often spectacular raptor migrations. Now, continuing in your imagination, you may be hiking up the ridge with a birding acquaintance, perhaps someone more familiar with Hawk Mountain's migration patterns.\nAs you both pause to catch your breath, you ask your birding friend, \"What are our chances for a goshawk today?\" This is a species you've always wanted to see, the big Accipiter of the forests. Always a favorite during fall migration in the eastern United States. Your friend replies, \"We're a little early, but still a decent chance. Keep an eye out for a stocky Accipiter, moving fast. Let me know if you see something that seems like a good candidate.\" You continue up the trail a little farther, until you gain your first view of the valley below. \"I'd love to see a goshawk,\" you say, \"but I was also wondering about something else. Any chance for a Pterodroma petrel?\" Your friend looks at you in disbelief: \"Do you see an ocean? What are you thinking?\"\nHawk Mountain: Perfect Petrel Habitat?\nIf the day in your imagination was October 3rd, 1959, your ridiculous question would have seemed prophetic. On that day, a dark Pterodroma with white in the primaries was seen for about 5 minutes at Hawk Mountain. Unprecedented and nearly unbelievable. There is still debate as to its identity, but the fact remains: a petrel, master of the ocean winds, was more than 100 miles from the closest ocean, flying where hawks would be expected, not seabirds. No one would have predicted or expected that to happen.\nWhat does this mean for your everyday birding? It means you must expect the unlikely, never discount something because it seems unreasonable or improbable. Even when you've had a slow day of birding with few birds and poor conditions, don't give up. That Pterodroma is far from the only outlandishly unexpected bird to be seen in the ABA area. Lesser Frigatebird in Michigan (2005) and a dark-morph Parasitic Jaeger at Fort Huachuca in Arizona (2006) immediately spring to mind. And it isn't just seabirds, of course. A relative newcomer to birding photographed an unusual shorebird in West Virginia in August 2007. It looked different than the others he was seeing and he couldn't figure out what it was. The pictures he took clearly showed a Great Knot! I could go on about this, and I'm sure many of us could come up with similar stories and examples of very unexpected birds where they shouldn't belong. However, how do we prepare for the unlikely?\nThe first rule is to trust yourself. If you see a bird that seems impossible for your location or time, don't tell yourself you must be mistaken or confused. Remember, these things happen! When I see a rare bird, the first thing I think of is documentation. Pictures or field sketches are invaluable when reporting your sighting to others. Take notes about why you think it is unusual. In fact, you may find a bird that you've never heard of before and don't recognize at all. Don't say: \"Oh, I don't know what this is, I need to be a better birder\" and give up. Take notes and pictures and make careful observations; even if you can't identify it in the field, someone may be able to recognize it based on your documentation.\nThe second rule is that previous knowledge can go a long way in the field. The more time you spend studying birds (in the field and in the field guides) the better you'll be able to recognize something unusual. I've noticed over the years that many rarities are found by people having previous experience with the species. This means that the more your study, the better prepared you'll be when an impossibility flies by you. The final rule is that you should never give up. You never know what exciting bird might be right around the corner; always take that extra scan of the ocean or sweep of the horizon, because the possibilities are there, you just have to look for them!\nby Bill Schmoker\nOn a tour I led in North Dakota this summer we ran into a curious Marbled Godwit that joined us on a back country gravel road.\u00a0 Like many roadbeds in the area, this one was elevated to keep it above the soggy meadows and marshes it crossed.\u00a0 I suspect the bird had chicks out in the nearby field and it felt better keeping tabs on us from the open visibility of the road as we scanned for other birds.\u00a0 The godwit didn't act agitated and pretty much just shared some space with us for a while.\u00a0 I like to experiment with different compositions when an interesting, cooperative bird like this comes along, and would like to share three images of the same bird in the same place for your consideration.\n1) Shots like this are pretty typical- the bird is standing there and I'm standing nearby to take the picture.\u00a0 The problem is that disconnect between the level of the bird and the level of the lens.\u00a0 It also accentuates the gravel road here- while not the worst background (say, like an oily parking lot) it certainly isn't the most natural-looking setting as the bird seems lost in a sea of sterile gravel.\u00a0 If this was a rarity to document or something I wanted to study later or confirm an ID on I'd certainly be happy with the pic- it is sharp and shows ample details.\u00a0 But it isn't really an image that would sell many northern plains trips, would it?\n2) By sitting in the road (think safety, of course, if you are going to be doing crazy bird photographer things like sitting in roads), the lens is at about eye level with the godwit, making for a more pleasing photo in my opinion.\u00a0 The shallow depth of field lessens the impact of the road in the image, too, but the road still dominates since it is in line with the lens.\n3) By getting in the ditch along the road and shooting the bird from slightly below, I think the road becomes a more minor element and the background foliage and sky present a much nicer tableau for this iconic northern plains shorebird.\nI know we don't always have the luxury of a cooperative bird in a setting that allows multiple photo angles but if you find yourself with a subject that sticks around, play with your perspective a bit to see what kind of results you can produce.\u00a0 For birds on or near the ground or on the water, it can make a world of difference to get low and shoot at eye level or as close to that as you can get.\nby Jeff Gordon\nBelow is a picture of my ATM card. Of course, I've sloppily cloned out a bunch of numbers from the photo of it, and it's bleached and nicked from (over)use, but I still wanted you to see it. I should say right up front that this is not the card referred to in the title that I think can help the ABA and birding. That isn't a credit card or debit card at all. I'll get to that card soon.\nWhen I moved to Colorado Springs last winter, one of the small but very real pleasures I found in the mountain of hassles that accompany moving was my discovery that my new bank wouldn't force me to carry the same old boring ATM card. Their website would let me upload my own photo to personalize it (or choose one of their many stock photos).\n.\nSo, perhaps feeling a twinge of homesickness and certainly lacking any photos from Colorado yet, I chose this shot I took of a flock of Ruddy Turnstones feeding on horseshoe crab eggs along the shore of Delaware Bay. It's a picture that just makes me happy.\nI can't tell you number of opportunities this card has provided me to talk to people about birds and birding. And the fact that I can say it's my photo really adds to the lift I get when I do so. With one simple change, my ATM card has gone from being something with which I have little personal connection to a co-branding collaboration between me and Wells Fargo. Pretty cool, if you ask me.\nHow does this relate to the ABA?\nWell, one of the perennial ideas that the ABA (and many other organizations) have employed over the years is the idea of an ambassador group. In the ABA's case, what this has generally meant is that very small numbers of super-wonderful and super-dedicated volunteers have been recruited. And please please please understand that nothing I say here should be construed as criticism of those terrific folks or their tireless efforts. I am nothing but grateful to them. But I am interested in providing them (and lots of other members, I hope) with a more streamlined, elegant, effective, and fun way to promote the ABA and birding in general. To use a buzz word, something more viral.\nWhat has often been done is that expensive, heavy boxes of expensive, heavy publications have been shipped to our ambassadors (did I say how much I appreciate the efforts of those folks? 'Cause I do!) who would then display them at a table at a local bird event or nature festival.\nNow, I love birding festivals. I go to a lot of them and I've spent a lot of time in booths at them. I only want festivals to get better and better. But I have to say that from a return on investment standpoint, that old ambassador strategy seemed less than optimal when it came to getting new members. It was however, good for visibility and was often a great way to contact existing members. And we'll still do that sort of outreach, whenever we can.\nAnother recruitment tool is the standard membership brochure. You know, with the little, \"fill it out and mail it in,\" membership application. We have 'em. Everybody has 'em. They're useful, too. But they also seem to me, in the age of social media, very impersonal and a bit cumbersome.\nSo here's what I see as an innovative and I hope, effective approach to ABA outreach. It's something I've had in mind for quite awhile and have discussed with various people, including current ABA ambassadors. But I think it's time to open it up to you. I'd ask that you look over our ideas. Tell me which ones are good and which are not. What ways would you suggest to make it better?\nThe Program\nThe key is interacting with people in the field, at the eyepiece. Go where you can help people see more birds and get more out of the birds they're seeing right where they are. That could be a traditional \"birding spot\" or not (a city park with a duck pond would be fine, for example). Set up your scope. Hand over your binoculars. Tell the people you meet what birds are around and a quick story or a few cool things about those birds. Here's a very quick example .\nABA First Lady Liz shares her bins, and a family of Prairie Falcons, with a (former) stranger\nThis program should have very little barrier to entry. If you want to do it, at most you should have to spend a few dollars, possibly splitting the cost with ABA, and that's it. You're in.\nThere needs to be an easy way to track and reward your success. If you get us 1 new member, I want us to be able to know and to thank you. If you get us 10 new members, I want to really thank you.\nI want to know what types of rewards would be meaningful to you. Free membership for yourself, a special hat or shirt, your name at the top of a new listing category? What about for the super achievers? Optics, or travel, or at least discounts thereon? A donation to a club or cause?\nWe might want to come up with a name other than \"ambassador.\" Field crew, something. I need help here.\nThe ABA would produce two basic items to help you seem more \"official,\" and maybe give you a teeny confidence boost, if you're feeling a little shy. At the most basic level, one is a card and the other is a shirt (you'll see there are some possible variations, but let's start with card and shirt).\nThe Card\nThe card should be larger than a business card but still pretty small. I'm thinking it should be at least 3x5\" but not more than 5x7\". It ought to tuck neatly into a \"little Sibley,\" a Kaufman guide or similar sized book. Folded over once, it should fit easily into a pocket.\nThe card should clearly communicate the message, \"I enjoyed meeting you and birding with you. Here's how to take some next steps and/or stay in touch.\"\nThe card should be beautiful and eye-catching, with at least one photo or other art work. Ideally, users could upload their own photos, or choose from some great shots and art that the ABA would provide free of charge.\nThe card should be thoroughly ABA-branded, with logos, contact info, etc. It might offer some sort of less expensive trial membership, or a special premium or gift for joining.\nThe card should be personally branded, too, with your contact info, to the extent that you want it to be. Want more readers for your blog, more Twitter followers, Facebook friends, and so on? That should be easy. Want none of those things? That's fine, too. Use the space to put a quotation about birds or birding that you like or anything that makes the card yours.\nThe card should be environmentally friendly in its materials and production.\nThe card should look professional. We shouldn't be asking you to print if off on your home printer.\nThe card should have your ABA member #, or a bar code, a QR code , or something that lets us know if the person you gave it to actually joined and thus lets us thank and reward you.\nI am open to the idea of the card giving contact info for other organizations in addition to the ABA, especially local bird clubs. Even bird-related businesses aren't out of the question, but we'd very likely want the biz to contribute money or other resources to the program. It's got to be first and foremost you, the ABA member and the ABA itself, but I want the ABA to support and work well with groups that support us and our mission.\nThe card, ideally, should have something useful on it. Something that would make it valuable even if they never got in touch with you or joined the ABA. The ABA Code of Birding Ethics (almost certainly in an abridged form due to space limitations) is one possibility. What else would be useful? Some very basic identification info? Birding tips? What?\nThe card should also be available in an electronic version, easily e-mailed, texted, or passed using Bump or some similar app.\nHard copies of the card should be printable in fairly small quantities, without tying up too much ABA staff time. There are many digital presses; e.g., MOO , that do this sort of thing, though I don't know of one yet that does exactly this. Do you?\nThe Shirt\nThe shirts (and hat and binocular strap) already exist in a simple, elegant form. You can get an ABA logo shirt at Shop@ABA right this minute. But I'm thinking of a special shirt (or vest, or banner, or flag). One that you wear or display only when you really want to do outreach (and one you can take off or cover up if you want some privacy for a while).\nThe shirt prominently displays the ABA logo, perhaps in a slightly modified form. But there's a tropicbird in blue and green and blue, for sure. Almost certainly the words, \"American Birding Association,\" and almost certainly our URL: aba.org\nEven more prominently, the shirt says, \"ASK ME ABOUT BIRDING!!!\" I think it does that with those exact words, in big big letters. Think about those old Frankie Goes To Hollywood T-shirts from the 80's:\nFrankie Says Relax T-shirt photo by Fighting with Spoons, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license\nOK, maybe not that exactly, but you get the idea, right?\nThe major function of the shirt is to identify yourself, at some distance, as a person that wants to help others enjoy birds and birding more.\nIt would be great if the shirt looked good and/or cool. But not to the extent that it obscures the basic message. \"I am a birder and I am here to recruit you!\" Any suggestions for how to balance wearability with impact are most welcome.\nYour Ideas\nOK, that's what I've got for right now. I'm sorry for running on so long, but as you can see, I'm trying to put a bunch of thoughts out there and see where you all take them. Now I need you to say what's right and what's wrong with these concepts. Help us come up with something really cool.\nI appreciate your interest in and support of the ABA and I can't wait to have this program fully launched. With your help, it'll be a lot of fun and do a lot of good.\nNext \u00bb\nWelcome to the ABA Blog!\nBirders know well that the healthiest, most dynamic choruses contain many different voices.

The photos are by Philip Greenspun and were taken with a Canon EOS 5D , ( compare prices ) ( review ) for the Africa articles in our Travel section .\nOptical Quality\nI've tested this lens alongside all the Canon 75-300 and 100-300 zooms, as well as the EF300/2.8L, and it's clear that it is a very good lens indeed. It is significantly sharper than the zooms (including the 100-300/5.6L) and holds its own against it's \"big brother\" the 300/2.8. It's sharp wide open and even sharper when stopped down to f5.6. I have no hesitation at all using this lens wide open.\nImage quality is very close to that of the 300/2.8L. I'd say that the 300/4 at f4 and the 300/2.8 at f2.8 are about equal, but at any given aperture the 300/2.8 has a slight edge. This is based on looking at images of resolution test targets. For real world images, it's pretty hard to tell which lens shot what.\nThe 300/4L works very well with the Canon 1.4x TC. Again I have no hesitation about shooting wide open (420mm f5.6) with this combinations and I'm very happy with the results. Autofocus is still fast and accurate. In a side by side test of the 300/4L + 1.4x TC and a Sigma 400/5.6 APO (not the new Macro APO), the Canon lens combination was clearly better (shrper, higher contrast, more neutral color).\nWith the Canon 2x TC you lose autofocus and some image quality. It's a usable 600/8, but I don't think this is a combination you would want to depend on if you were trying to make a living at photography and needed a 600mm lens to do it.\nI have also tried the Tamron 1.4x TC with this lens. Results were pretty good, but not as good as with the Canon TC. Autofocus was less reliable, image quality was lower at the edges of the frame and there was slight vignetting wide open.\nFeatures\nThe lens has a removable tripod collar, a built in sliding lens hood and a USM focus motor with full time manual overide. The front element (77mm filters) does not rotate during focusing. It's well balanced and solidly built (no plastic).\nIs it better than the Canon EF400/5.6L?\nA lot of people ask this, and my answer is that I don't know, since I've never actually used an EF400/5.6L! I can say though that, in principle, I like the 300/4 + TC combination better than the 400/5.6 + TC combination. With the 300/4 you get excellent 300/4 and 420/5.6 AF lenses. plus a usable manual focus 600/8. With a 400/5.6 you get an excellent 400/5.6 AF lens, a good, but manual focus, 560/8 and a very slow 800/11, which in my opinion isn't a very usable lens.\nSummary\nThe EF 300/4L is a killer lens, espcially when combined with the Canon 1.4x TC. It's much better than any zoom I've ever tested at 300mm, and it's 1/2 the weight and 1/4 the price of the EF300/2.8L. It's the lens I take when I'm hiking around in areas where I expect to see wildlife but I don't want to carry too much weight. Not only is the lens pretty light (3lbs), but you don't need a monster tripod to support it either. I've had good results using it on a Bogen 3001 (3.5 lbs) with a medium Bogen ball head. You can't do that with the bigger telephotos. The 300/4 is an ideal compromise of size, weight, focal length, speed and cost\nStreet price for the EF300/4L is close to $1100 (1/97). A fair price for a used lens in good condition is around $800, but I can't see any reason for anyone ever to sell one. I'm certainly not getting rid of mine!\n1997 Update: Canon EF 300mm f/4L Image-Stabilized (IS)\nIn early 1997, Canon introduced an IS (image-stabilized) version of the 300/4L. The IS lens also has a shorter minimum focus distance. Old questions about the usefulness of IS are raised again by this lens. For example in a May 1997\nOutdoor Photographer\nit was stated that \"for many photographers the 300/4L IS lens will replace the need for the f2.8 lens altogether\". I'm not so sure.\nJust think why photographers use the faster f2.8 lens:\nFaster shutter speeds to freeze action. IS doesn't help.\nTo blur backgrounds. IS doesn't help.\nHigher quality optics. IS doesn't help.\nDue to the above, better performance with TCs. IS doesn't help.\nAF with a 2x TC. IS doesn't help.\nAnd, of course, once you have the lens on a tripod, IS doesn't help.\nIS does help when hand holding the lens, but that's not why most photographers buy a 300/2.8. They aren't going to be hand holding it much. I think few photographers will use a 300mm lens hand held very often. Think about it. Are you really going to take a 300mm lens out in the field and leave your tripod home?\nI think the IS lens is a great idea, however don't get sucked in by the hype you may see in the magazines. Given an unlimited budget, I'd get one tomorrow. I might only use the IS function a fraction of the time, but it's nice to have when you need it. Just think about the claims before you rush out and buy one. I own the 75-300 IS lens so I don't have an \"anti-IS\" bias!. I still much prefer to use it on a tripod when ever I can.\nNote that the IS lens has 15 elements in 11 groups, while the original 300/4L has 8 elements in 7 groups. Adding elements can result in greater susceptibility to flare and loss of sharpness. Reports are that the 300/4L USM IS is a sharp lens. However the Popular Photography test (July 1997) seemed to show it was very similar in sharpness to the Sigma 300/4 APO Macro, while George Lepp's test of the original 300/4L showed it significantly sharper than the Sigma 300/$ APO Macro. There really isn't enough critical test data available right now (05/97) to say for sure whether the extra elements in the IS lens cause a slight optical degradation. If the IS function is important to you, that's probably a secondary issue anyway. The IS lens would clearly outperform the original lens in any circumstances in which the IS function was needed (hand holding at less than 1/350). For those using the lens on a tripod all or most of the time, optical performance may be a concern, but we will need to wait for further testing to see if there is a significant difference between the two lenses.\n[Editor's Note: Canon settled the question that Bob raised by discontinuing the non-IS version of this lens.]\nCanon EF 300/4L USM Technical Data\nConstruction:\n8 elements/7 groups [15/11 for IS]\nAngle of view:\n2.5 m (8.2 ft) [1.5m for IS]\nFilter size:\n214.5 x 90 mm (8-3/8 x 3-9/16 in)\nWeight:\n1.3 kg (2.9 lb) [1.2kg for IS]\nExample Images\nExample Images with 1.4X Teleconverter\nRed-billed Hornbill.

According to the report, the lens should be available sometime this year for just a little more than the current 300/4L.\nSounds like a dream tele lens: light, sharp, usable without a tripod, and less than $2000.\nRobert SIlvers , June 03, 1997; 02:14 P.M.\nI was photographing a speaker indoors and saw a photographer for the Boston Globe. He also had EOS, and I noticed he was using the 28-70 2.8L from too far away. I offered him my 300 F4.0L to get a tigher shot. He said no thanks, it was not a fast enough lens. I mean, not only was it an F4, but also 300mm which made it 3 stops slower than his lens once you considered the higher shutter speed needed. This comes to my mind on why even though I have the 300mmF4.0L, I also wanted the 300mmF4.0L- Image Stabilized. You can handhold this at 1/30, which gives you three extra stops. Yes, I know that if the subject is moving it is no good -- which is why it will not replace the 300mm 2.8 for sports, but I think there are many cases where this idea wins. Yes, it has 15 elements instead of 8, and for this reason I may not sell my regular 300.\nBill Meyer , August 26, 1997; 02:02 P.M.\nI am in love with this lens. The USM is almost dead silent, the fastest I've ever used and the most accurate. I was tracking a redtail hawk from about 200 feet away and it stayed sharply focused at all times using the continuous focus (AI Servo) on my Canon A2.\nThe slides have been extemely sharp when I do my job. I was at an air show this past Memorial Day and was shooting pictures of the Thunderbirds when I ran out of film (always bring enough film). I had two choices, sit back and watch the Thunderbirds or find a film vendor. I opted for the latter, and after being screwed on the price of grocery store brand Kodak Gold 100 I ran back and shot the rest of the show. I got some awesome full framed shots of the F-16 and had them blown up to 8x12's. To my amazement, the blow ups are extremely sharp and considering the film, I contribute this to my 300 f/4. I would venture to say that I could blow up these images to 11x14 or even 16x20 and still maintain sharpness.\nThis is the best lens I've ever used and I can attest that it's well worth every penny. No, it's not as bright as a 300 f/2.8 (which is my next desire) but it's f/4 is pretty good and at a substantial cost and weight savings, I'd say it's the best telephoto you can buy.\nPaul Tsong , February 17, 1998; 07:09 P.M.\nIn my neck of the woods (essentially Seattle) at least, it has been my impression (and confirmed in conversation with various salespeople) that this lens is becoming more widely available on the used market as people trade up for the IS version. So if IS is not essential for you, I think good deals can be had.\nHarvey Chao , March 07, 1998; 05:09 P.M.\nJust a note for anyone trying to track down a copy of the referenced Popular Photography review, it is in JUNE '97, not July as indicated.\nPaul Morrison , September 03, 1998; 02:14 A.M.\nI have owned both the original 300 f4L and the IS version. I shoot ski action full time and love both of these lenses. I have not purchased the 300 f2.8 due to the performance of the slower, lighter and more versatile f4L's. I replaced the non IS lens as soon as the new version became available. Contrary to the review, the IS lens will make you question the need for a f2.8 optic. No, the IS function will not freeze action directly, but with it's panning mode, it certainly can help. The light weight of these lenses allows vastly easier panning over a 300 f2.8. The small size and light weight also mean that you are much more likely to be carrying this lens than you would the f2.8. The sharpness of the IS version versus the original is a non-issue in my opinion. No noticeable difference. Both excellent. The 77mm filter size is very nice to work with on the smaller 300's and allows smooth filter changes between lenses like the 17-35, 28-70, 70-200 and the 300 f4L's. Perhaps the only negative I can think of regarding the IS version over the original, is that the lens hood on the new version, rubs against the focusing ring when it is pulled back (especially bothersome when using filters, particularly polarizers). Other than that minor quibble, this is a fantastic addition to most any serious photographer arsenal.\nGary Voth , October 07, 1998; 04:44 A.M.\nOne big additional reason to opt for the 'IS' lens over the standard 300mm f4.0L is the closer focusing distance of 4.9 feet, useful for fashion or portrature where you want a stylized perspective. I now own the 'IS' lens and love it for its light weight and hand-holdability. Optical quality seems very fine. Back in my F1 days I did lots of sports shooting with the FD 300mm f2.8L, so I am familiar with the benefits of having the extra stop. But given how good the 300mm f4.0L 'IS', today I might allocate my \"6 pounds\" on the 200mm f1.8L or even the 500mm f4.5L...\nkurt heintzelman , May 30, 1999; 09:51 P.M.\nI recently bought the 300 IS along with the EOS 1.4 TE. Using a 1n and a 540EZ for fill flash when needed,and shooting Velvia w/ a 1 stop push, I have made several trips to the Columbus Zoo, focusing on their outdoor aviary. Simply put, this lens is superbly sharp and the IS technology is astounding. I hand-held every shot through 6 rolls of film (and I shake), and the resulting slides contained a high percentage of keepers. After the first roll or two of film, I added the 1.4 TE, and quickly became addicted to the resulting 420/5.6 IS lens thus created. In fact, the 1.4TE has remained attached ever since! I've previously owned the 400/5.6L, and I honestly feel the 300IS + 1.4TE (in IS mode) delivers far more sharper images. The drawback is, of course, slower autofocusing with the TE attached. This combination will not work well with bird flight or other fast moving subjects. But for slower moving or stationary subjects, the IS lens with or without the TE, hand-held, vastly eclipses the 400/5.6L. As a bird flight lens, the 400 is clearly the winner, but this may become less true with the EOS 3 or the next incarnation of the 1n. After using the 300 IS, I no longer lust for a 300/2.8L or a 400/2.8L. Now I can drool over the 600/4.0L in my wildest dreams...In summary, if you're contemplating a 300/4 L lens, I strongly suggest biting the bullet and shelling out the extra cash for the IS version--you'll be amazed and richly rewarded by what it will do for your telephoto photography. I am not uncommonly getting sharp images at shutter speeds as low as 1/15th sec. in IS mode 1.\nkurt heintzelman , June 30, 1999; 11:58 P.M.\nThe retractable lens hood of my 300/4 IS most certainly locks when properly extended and rotated to the locked position. As for the 2 images graciously provided by Chieh Cheng, I find these images to be rather unsharp and not a good example of what the 300/4 IS is routinely capable of (whether in IS or non-IS mode), in my experience.\nkurt heintzelman , July 04, 1999; 06:12 P.M.\nAt 2.6 lbs., I would certainly not classify the 300/4 IS as an \"extremely heavy\" lens, as Chieh Cheng asserts. The 400/2.8 or the 600/4--now those are heavy ( approx. 13-14 lbs.) lenses...\nI S , October 09, 1999; 06:54 P.M.\nI Have just bought the 300 F4 L IS and on present showing I absolutely adore the lens. Since it has taken me some considerable time to afford the lens (#1000=$1600) and considering that I am 17, I am glad to have had good reason for forking out. When I have more results from the lens I shall report again, and perhaps even upload some.\nTimothy Breihan , November 08, 1999; 02:42 P.M.\nI recently had the opportunity to use a 300/4 L lens on an EOS A2 to photograph a football game (borrowing it while my Nikon equipment was temporarily unavailable) and can say that the lens performed excellently. I had it on a monopod and manually focused the entire time, but the prints were sharp and contrasty, as was the viewfinder image.\nTo say a bit about the IS version; I am looking at the specifications for the two lenses in Canon's own L lens brochure. The IS lens is slightly larger and heavier (by a mere 25 grams) and adds an additional seven elements in the IS module. It would also appear, by the photo in the brochure at least, the the IS lens lacks a tripod collar, which is absolutely stupid. I suppose Canon thinks that no one is ever going to want to bolt this lens down, but I certainly would not like to hold it for an entire football game!\nSpeaking of image quality, though, is where the differences in these two lenses make themselves apparent. Canon publishes the Modular Transfer Function graphs of all their L lenses in the brochure, and the results of the new IS lens are interesting. Canon's MTF tests record the resolving power and contrast of each lens at both its maximum aperture as well as stopped down to f/8. There are a pair of results for each aperture, one showing the len's performance with a sagittal target and the other with a meridional target. The more that these lines diverge the greater the len's astigmatism.\nThe IS lens, while slightly outscoring the original lens in resolving power, had greater astigmatism. In fact, the astigmatism apparent in the IS version at f/8 was equal to the astigmatism of the original lens at f/4. Furthermore, the original lens exhibited virtually no astigmatism whatsoever at f/8.\nSo, I suppose it is a trade-off. A ten-percent increase in resolving power and Image Stabilization for a fifteen to twenty-percent increase in astigmatism and the perplexing deletion of a tripod collar.\nBenjamin Yap , November 08, 1999; 08:33 P.M.\nI have the 300/4 IS and mine has a tripod collar as standard.\nTimothy Breihan , November 09, 1999; 10:15 P.M.\nVery good. I don't know if you have seen the Canon L lens brochure or not, but a closer look reveals that it has simply been removed for the photo, which makes much more sense. Sorry about the mistake!\nRob Schima , February 23, 2000; 05:17 P.M.\nI don't own this lens but had a chance to shoot with a friend's recently and was really impressed with it's balance. I use a 70-200L, and the 300 was noticably easier to hold and use.\nI still like the flexibilty of the zoom, but this is one aspect of equipment that is often overlooked. I'll be hitting him up for the 300 again in the future!\nI S , March 02, 2000; 01:39 P.M.\nI'm back again. I'm still very pleased with the quality of results that I have got from this lens. Absolutely excellent. I do have a question though. I received an email from an Abbey at photo.net, asking me about the lens. I tried to reply, but the mail kept getting bounced back. If anyone knows about this, and where I should have replyed to, please email me.\nAnyway, about the lens. It is indeed beautifully balanced, and noticeably more weidly than my father's 100-400 L IS, despite being almost as heavy and almost as big. I am finding, however, that I am using up a stupidly large amount of battery power. I seem only to be getting 4 or 5 rolls of 36exp. from my EOS5, 300f4lIS with VG10. Maybe it's due to the fact that I often shoot in the cold, but the camera was never that bad before.\nTripod collars, and a clarification thereof: Canon have two standard removable tripod collars, and some lenses with fixed tripod mounts. The 300 f4LIS, 35-350, 100-400, 70-200f2.8L, 180f3.5L and MPE-65f2.8 all use the bigger, newer collar, whilst the 300f4L, 400f5.6L, 70-200f4L, 200 f2.8L, and perhaps a couple of others use the older, two-piece collar. If the lens does not have the collar on, you can tell which collar it takes by the fact that the new collar uses four small roller bearings on the lens barrel, whereas the old used a large \"groove\" in the lens barrel. Everybody happy now?\nI S , March 25, 2000; 02:04 P.M.\nDoes anyone else have the same problem I do with cases for this lens? I think very little of the case that Canon supply with the lens, but on a belt system I have no alternative. I use the CCS belt system, but they don't do a lens pouch big enough for this lens. The Canon case fits on the belt system, but I don't like the case (not padded enough, zips could scratch the lens barrel, made of cardboard (check the label if you don't believe me), NOT WATERPROOF.) For a lens which cost #1300 when I bought it, and is #1500 now, it's not enough.\nHowever, there is a possible solution. CCS will custom make a pouch if about 20 are ordered. The pouch could be ordered big enough for 100-400, sigma 170-500, sigma 135-400, 35-350, sigma 400 f5.6, etc. All I need is to find 19 other people who want a belt system case of huge quality (35 year warranty, waterproof, well padded, usual CCS quality.), for a lens of this sort of quality. Please Email me if you're interested. I may be able to get a price by next tuesday, but email me over the next few months if you're interested. I should expect that it will not cost more than about #80 (It's not a lot for a lens which cost so much, remember that.) Let me know, because I can't possibly be the only person out there with this problem\nHarvey Chao , August 24, 2000; 01:06 A.M.\nA big reason for getting this lens was shooting ice skating exhibitions from the stands, available light and hand held. This lens, in the IS version, has been an absolute JOY! It combines the optical reach, fast autofocus, and sharp crisp images I had been seeking. Using Fuji superia 800, 11 x 14 enlargements are crisp, sharp, and just beautiful! Yes it was expensive, but the results ! Shot some frames at the San Diego Zoo and from a moving tram at the San Diego Wild Animal park - the IS made hand held shots in shadow areas not only possible but practical without having to go to high speed film.\nMichael King , December 31, 2000; 08:50 P.M.\nI recently bought the non IS version from eBay. The front element has a lot of marks in the coating, from the previous owner's apparent attempts to clean it with a brillo pad! They don't seem to be causing any image problems, though.\nI think this lens is just superb in terms of sharpness, brightness and contrast. AF and AI servo on the EOS 3 make this lens a joy to use! The AF is very quick. The build quality is very solid. My only gripe (apart from the coating marks), is its weight. A monopod solves that problem, though.\nHsu Chen-Kuang , April 18, 2001; 07:51 A.M.\nI bought a second 300/4L and decide to change it to a 300/4L IS.Why ?\n1.I often use 300mm with handhold. 2.Even I use it with tripod,I can shot down the IS function and it works great for me.\nSo,I think that the 300/4L IS is more suitable for me.\nCraig Watson , November 28, 2002; 12:23 P.M.\nIn Reference to the review of the Canon 300 f/4 versus the newer \"IS\" version of the lens, I would like to submit one additional consideration. The Original version of the lens was and is Tack Sharp. However, I have heard the Image Stabilization does seem to subjectively improve the quality of the image by off-setting camera vibration (On a tripod) during exposure. As of late I have also heard some really good reports of using the lens with a 2X Canon TC to photograph butterflies.\nDaniel Sandlin , December 22, 2002; 01:18 A.M.\nI wouldlike to answer the author's question \"would yuo really carry a 300mm nto the feild and leave your tripod at home?\" Yes I would, and I also intend to shoot wildlife. A lifetime of hunting wit hheavy rifles and shooting at the range of 500 or more yards at the range has taught me to find a good steady rest even leaning on a tree can enable you to pull of a 300yd shot at a running deer. I figure the less gear you pack the better off you are physically. Take it from someone who has spent his life in hard labor, and packing the weight because \"I'm the strongest S.O.B you'll ever see!\" was brought down by his very arrogance and pride. I switched to EOS from FD to save weight so I could still enjoy my hobby turned livelihood. Just pickup some real cheap print film, or bulkload some black and white and go out to the feild, and practice handholding, and resting off of any available surface. It will take a little practice but you will soon master the techniques. One thing about humans is that we adapt very well to change.Yes you do need a tripod for some things especially lowlight shooting, but it is a cumbersome peice of equipent that can be left in the truch except for when the situation calls. I can't count how many times I lugged it for no reason just to come home wit hmy back wrenched because the extra weight slung across my shoulders and the physical compensation to keep it from falling or getting hung up whe ncrawling over logs or through viney maple. For that reason, I think the 300 F4IS sounds like a treat, if need be you can always turn the IS off and have the benifits of anon IS lens. Very good review and has convinced me to look into this lens as a potential dream lens if I cant swing the 400mm. P.S. I do however always carry a nice sturdy SIMA Monopod.\nWee Keng_Hor\n, March 31, 2003; 09:34 A.M.\nI have both the non-IS and IS verions concurrently for a brief period. Was indifferent to both but later sold the non-IS and keep the IS. Now I was glad that I keep the IS. There are many occasions that setting up the tripod is impractical. With some luck and extra care, I'm able to obtain razor sharp images shooting at 1/20s.\nf5.6, 1/20s\nJim Mueller , April 21, 2004; 08:32 P.M.\n300D, 300/4 IS + 1.4X TC II at f/5.6, 1/1000 sec, ISO 200 +2/3 Stop\nThe real strength of this lens is its sharpness with teleconverters. I use this lens regularly with the EF 1.4C TC II and the 2X TC II. Believe it or not I can hand hold the 300/4 IS with a 2X TC II which is the equivelent of a 600/8 because of the Image Stabilization Technology. It makes an awesome Butterfly Lens as well.\nAbove is an image captured with the Canon 300D, 300/4 IS + 1.4X TC II at f/5.6, 1/1000 sec, ISO 200 +2/3 Stop.\nAndrew Robertson , June 24, 2004; 07:31 A.M.\nOystercatcher, 300 f/4L IS + 1.4x II TC, 10D at ISO 800\nBird photography is fun with this lens! It's relatively small, and the built-in hood is great for saving bulk. I don't hesitate to shoot it wide open.\nOren Barel , June 26, 2004; 01:42 P.M.\nThe Canon EF 300/4L is my best telephoto lens, it is 480mm equivalent on my 10d, it is sharp and fast.\nYou can see the attached picture taken from 150 meters !!!\nhttp://www.jugend.co.il/gallery/showgallery.php?ppuser=3882&cat=500&thumb=1\nOren Barel, Israel\nBest Action Shots , December 14, 2004; 04:38 P.M.\n20D has changed my view for need of fast lenses like f/2.8 since its performance in high ISO like 1600 and 3200 is excellent. I do shoot action sports and 300/4L fits my budget very well. This is one heck of a lens! It's very sharp! I'm very happy with this lens so far.\nshiva manjunatha , October 21, 2006; 12:55 A.M.\nHere is an image taken with tc1.4x , just noticed recently http://www.flickr.com/photos/shivanayak/274369005/ a slight purple fringe..\nNeil Cowley , March 20, 2007; 10:43 P.M.\nI've been able to handhold this lens with great success when I've otherwise been out of reach.

That entire time, I've used the original hacky kludge created by Blogger's founders back in 1999, where I write my posts at the blogger.com website, but it then sends the resulting text files over the Internet to a web server I rent, using the venerable FTP (File Transfer Protocol) standard\u2014which was itself last formally updated in 1985. This is known as\nBlogger FTP publishing\n.\nWhile often unreliable for various technical reasons, Blogger FTP works effectively for me, with my 13 years of accumulated stuff on this website. But I am in a small, small minority of Blogger users (under 0.5%, says Google). Almost everyone now:\nUses Blogger's own servers for their sites.\nOr another hosted service that takes care of everything for them.\nOr if they want to publish on their own servers, another tool like Movable Type , WordPress , or ExpressionEngine , which you install on your server and publish from there.\nSo, as I've been expecting for years, Blogger is now permanently turning off FTP publishing , as of late March 2010. And, in my particular case, that means I need to find a new blog publishing tool within the next month or so.\nThis has been coming for a long time\nBlogger has all sorts of clever solutions and resources for people using FTP publishing who want to migrate to Google's more modern server infrastructure, but they don't fit for me. I have specific and very personal needs and weird proclivities about how I want to run this website, and putting my blog on Google's servers simply doesn't meet them.\nThat's sad, and a little frustrating, but I'm not angry about it\u2014and I think it's misguided that many people commenting on this topic seem to be. I realize that I have been getting an amazing, easy publishing service for free for almost a quarter of my life from Blogger. It has enriched my interactions with thousands of people. Again, for free. (Actually, I did pay for Blogger Pro back in the day before the 2003 Google acquisition, but that was brief. And as thanks, Google sent me a free Blogger hoodie afterwards\u2014I still wear that.)\nThe vast, vast, vast majority of users find the newer ways of publishing with Blogger meet their needs. And any of us who has used FTP publishing for years knows it's flaky and convoluted and something of a pain in the butt, and always has been since Ev and his team cobbled it together. I've been happily surprised that Blogger has supported it for so long\u2014again, free.\nYes, it was a distinguishing feature of Blogger that you could use a fully hosted editing and publishing system to post to a web server where you don't have to install anything yourself. Very nice, but I think there are good technical reasons that no other service, free or paid\u2014whether WordPress.com , TypePad , SquareSpace , or anything else\u2014ever offered something similar.\nI applaud the Blogger team for trying to do the best they can for us oddballs. And it serves as a reminder: Blogger FTP can go away. Gmail could go away. Facebook could go away. Flickr could go away. Twitter could go away. WordPress.com could go away. If you're building your life or business around free online tools, you need some sort of Plan B.\nI've had this possibility on my mind at least since the Google takeover, seven years ago. Now I have to act on it. But I'm thankful for a decade of generally great and reliable free service from Blogger. I haven't had ten free years of anything like it from any other company (online or in the real world), as far as I know.\nGetting nothing but static\nOne other thing I've always liked about Blogger's FTP publishing is that it creates\nstatic files\n: plain-text files (with file extensions like .html or .php or .css, or even no extensions at all). It generates those files from a database on Google's servers, but once they're published to my website, they're just text, which web browsers interpret as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create the formatting and colours as such.\nMost other blogging tools, including Blogger's hosted services, generate their web pages on the fly from a database. That's often more convenient for a whole bunch of reasons, and I'm happy to run other sites, such as Inside Home Recording and Lip Gloss and Laptops , with a database-dependent tool such as WordPress.\nBut this site is my personal one\u2014the archive of most of my writing over the past 25% of my life. And I'm a writer and editor by trade. This website is my thing, and I've worked fairly hard to keep it alive and functional, without breaking incoming links from other sites, for well over a decade now. I've always wanted to keep it running with static files, which is one reason I didn't migrate from Blogger to WordPress four or five years ago. Over on Facebook, Gillian asked me why I'm so hardheaded about it. (She's a database administrator by trade.)\nI'll be blunt about the most extreme case: I have cancer . I may not live that long. But I'd like my website to stay, even if only so my kids can look at it later. If necessary, if I'm dead, I want someone to be able to zip up the directory structure of my blog, move it to a new server, unzip it, and there it is, live on the Web. I don't want to have to plan for future database administration in my will.\nIn that worst case I won't need to update my site anymore, but I think static files on a generic web server are more reliable in the long run. To make a bulk change, a simple search-and-replace can update the text files, for example, to note that it's not worth emailing me, since, being dead, I'll be unable to answer.\nOn other blogging and content management systems I've worked with, I've had MySQL databases die or get corrupted. Restoring from MySQL backups is a pain for non-techies, or even for me. I've blown up a WordPress site by mis-editing one part of one file, and I've been able to fix it\u2014but I don't want someone else to have to do that.\nRight now, if Blogger died entirely, my site would still work exactly as-is. If my web host went belly-up, anyone with a teeny bit of web savvy and access to my passwords and one of my computers could redirect penmachine.com to a new server, upload the contents of one of my backup directories to it by FTP, and (other than visitors being able to post new comments) it would be up and live just like it was within a day or two.\nIn addition, tools like WordPress are brittle. I like using them, but there are security updates all the time, so the software goes out of date. That's fine if you're maintaining your site all the time, but if not, it becomes vulnerable to hacks. So if a database-driven site choogles on without updates, it's liable to get compromised, and be defaced or destroyed. That's less likely with a bunch of HTML files in directories\u2014or at least I think so.\nBetting on text\nPlain text has been the language of computer interchange for decades. If the Web ever stops supporting plain text files containing HTML, we'll all have big problems. But I don't think that will happen. The first web page ever made still works, and I hope and expect it will continue to. My oldest pages here are mild derivatives from pages that are only five years younger than that one. They still work, and I hope and expect that they will continue to.\nAt worst, even a relatively non-technical person can take a directory dump backup of my current website and open the pages in a text editor. I can do that with files I've had since before the Web existed\u2014I still have copies on my hard drive of nonsensical stories from BBSes I posted to in the '80s (here's an HTML conversion I made of one of them).

LA, day five / SYNTHe green roof project / Los Angeles\nFinal day of Postopolis! LA . On the one hand, it\u2019s difficult to believe that the end is in sight (and sad, too); on the other, my tiredness is an indication that, yes, we have been doing this for almost a week now. But the exhilaration associated with the event carries us through the finale and beyond.\nBefore the evening\u2019s events unfold in predictably unpredictable fashion though, most of the Postopolis! LA organisers, curators and several speakers and guests converge on the SYNTHe urban green roof project in Downtown LA. This is a pretty fantastic project in many ways, and allegedly the \u2018first green roof in LA\u2019 (although that\u2019s slightly hard to believe. Or indeed define. Also, conflict of interest alert: Arup Los Angeles were consultants to the project, which I had no idea about until afterward.)\nDesigned by SCI-Arc teacher Alexis Rochas it\u2019s a laser-cut (increasingly everything in LA is laser-cut) galvanised metal roof, creating a curving landscape on the top of The Flat, a converted Holiday Inn. The roof curves not just for formal experiment but also as sits on top of the varied bulky services that typically adorn such buildings, neatly covering up these air-conditioning units as well as creating a new fa\u00e7ade (This aspect of exploring the \u201cfifth fa\u00e7ade\u201d of the roof is interesting in itself - given the rise in popularity of both tall buildings and satellite-based mapping like Google Earth, these surfaces are looked down upon as never before. There is no longer any justification not to care about the design of these spaces.)\nNo two panels up here are alike; each panel is bent to shape (along score marks created by the CNC machines, presumably?) and then snapped into place on-site.\nHowever, the roof is essentially significant due to its productive capacity. The roofing structure is designed with grooves of varying depth, filled with a custom soil mix and then planted with various edible plants which are used by the restaurant at the base of the building (called Blue Velvet . Dennis Hopper not included perhaps fortunately). Food waste from the restaurant (the non-meat stuff, to avoid rodents) is returned to the garden as compost. The residents of the low-income apartments that comprise the rest of The Flat get to tend and use the garden apparently, though its primary function is in this nice closed loop with the restaurant.\nInitial concern over heat build-up due the use of the metal was dissipated a little by realising that the reflected heat will reduce the thermal build-up in the building (if more roofs were like this, would it have the same impact as the humanity-saving white paint idea ?). And of course green roofs have fantastic qualities in terms of better dealing with stormwater run-off as well as this natural thermal insulation. Still, it was hot up there that day, and it wasn\u2019t summer yet. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the plants will do when it's hotter than July, but their planting is rotated to match the menu and seasonality, so presumably the plants are selected with climate in mind too.\n95% of the planting is edible, with the remaining 5% to brighten the place up (though lavender is there both for ice-cream etc. but also to attract bees to help with pollination.) There was a patch of grass down one \u2018terrace\u2019, which was deliberately planted for people to sit on towards the end of the day, as the sun is going down. The view is fairly spectacular from up there, being on the edge of Downtown largely facing away from the high-rises, and being up there with a glass of wine, a book and a sunset would be wonderful. Grass is thirsty, so there plan is to water it until it\u2019s fully bedded in and then let it dry out to form a kind of thickish layer of dry grass matting, which seems smart.\nThe roof was strong enough to hold a fair few people, as tested by our visitors gathering around Rochas, eager to hear more details about the garden (in fact, one thinks some informatics display illustrating the garden's real-time performance from street level would be interesting (web cam, soil temperature, acidity, moisture etc.). You'd never know it was there from the street.) Still, this garden structure absorbs people very well, creating dramatic, almost heroic, romantic views.\nIt's an odd but enjoyable feeling being up there. The structure gives a little under foot, contributing slightly to the sense that you shouldn't be up there. But that's derived from our traditional and absurd waste of these spaces. (When I think of Saul Griffiths' concept of 'peak waste', I often interpret it as much spatially as anything else, through wasted roofs, under-used office space , inefficient systems like car parks and the like.)\nThere are always loading issues when retrofitting existing buildings with green roofs, as wet soil can get very heavy. Rochas explained a special soil mix reduced the load. Irrigation is by hand at the moment, via volunteers who look after the garden, but they\u2019re keen to get \u201crobots\u201d to do the watering in future.\nI\u2019m not sure how much food it generates, or indeed what is used by the restaurant. At lunch after, it\u2019s clear that a very small percentage of the restaurant\u2019s needs could be catered for by the garden, just as the restaurant would produce far more compost than the garden could possibly handle. So the loop is a little out of kilter. However, the project remains inspirational. Standing up there, looking down onto thousands of square metres of non-productive, non-useful roof space, just sitting there in the sun soaking up heat, wasting energy and giving nothing back to the city, you realise you\u2019re standing on a structure and a system that could be 'cut-and-paste' across all those roofs, utterly changing the city. [ More SYNTHe photos here and lots more detail on the project here ]\nIf it had only demonstrated this, it would have been a great project, but it's fascinating and engaging on numerous levels. It\u2019s perhaps the primary project I\u2019ve talked to people about since I got back to Australia, just as Benjamin Bratton\u2019s talk tonight was and remains the most thought-provoking presentation.\nAnd as such, SYNTHe echoed one of the primary themes emerging from the week\u2019s work. Oddly enough - or perhaps not oddly at all - car-bound, concrete-covered LA is home to numerous thriving projects, at all scales, that engage with food production, gardens and other productive landscapes. Not least in the work of Fritz Haeg , Ari Kletzky, Fallen Fruit, Greenmeme and others speaking at Postopolis! but also visible elsewhere around the city.\nPerhaps the other themes emerging from the week, for me at least, would gravitate around the complex form of LA itself (I always learn so much from the cities that conferences are held in that it should be listed as a formal component of the conference) and the palpable sense of innovation around the place.\nDirectly related to my work, the talks by Ben Cerveny, Eric Rodenbeck, Patrick Keller , Christian Moeller, Robert Miles Kemp and Bryan Boyer were particularly useful and enlightening.\nAnother theme would be the increasingly ubiquitous presence of fabrication tools, techniques and practice: through laser-cutting, CNC machines and sometimes rapid prototyping. Evidence of this is everywhere. You walk into any restaurant, bar or shop and you\u2019re likely to be looking past a complex undulating roof structure or a panelised screen etched, scored and punctured to within an inch of its life. On a recent trip to London, I was struck by the preponderance of large LED screens around the city; here it\u2019s laser-cut structures of varying scales. (Is that due to lack of sunshine in London and excess of same in California?!)\nMore significantly of course, its influence is visible at larger scale in the work of Eric Owen Moss and others emerging in and around the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) , with many documented in the edition of A+U I mentioned earlier . This work exemplifies the looming, benevolent influence of SCI-Arc on \u2018the scene\u2019 here. Just as certain universities provided a silent backdrop to Postopolis! New York, here SCI-Arc is behind a lot of the work and thinking here, often to great effect (a note to follow on that).\nThis emphasis on fabrication has a long history in Los Angeles architecture, design and engineering, not least due to the ability to borrow tools and techniques from the car design industry so strong around here. And before that, an earlier wave of LA designers like Neutra, Eames, Lustig et al relied on the skills and craft of the boat-building industry. So this concern with fabrication and industrial design has a long and honourable history here, yet it feels like this is allied with an increasingly broad intellectual framework. Again, this is perhaps a sign of SCI-Arc at work.\nIn an occasionally oblique interview at Archinect , current director of SCI-Arc Eric Owen Moss talked a little about this. About \u201cthose people understanding, utilizing and applying new technical skills; milling skills, CNC skills, vacuum forming skills, laser cutting skills, all of the 3D forming skills, parametric drawing and BIM skills, and so on. But what you want, are the students who can combine those tools with conceptual skills ... you want students who are not interested in (only tools) but also interested in conception, idea, fabrication.\u201d\nHe had earlier stated:\n\u201cSci Arc is not a trade school. We still have the capacity to satisfy the requirements of accreditation boards. However, our objective has always been to create independent, critical and intellectual students. I think the point is, to teach a group of students to deal with complicated subjects, in a clear coherent way. To speak to the world they are going into, and not to speak to the architects only. The architects as professionals have the problem of only talking the language of their profession. In the process of doing buildings nowadays, especially the bigger projects, architects have to have the capacity to talk and work with many people who are not necessarily architects. This is very important. So, we have many people coming from different areas lecturing on philosophy, science, engineering, fabrication, history. We are bringing in the usual and the unusual voices into the profession to develop that capacity to think, understand and analyze. And after that, the students have to go out into the world and find a way to make their critical and intellectual capacities useful and productive.\u201d [ Interview with Eric Owen Moss at Archinect ]\nThis points to another theme of Postopolis! LA: that of architects and other designers increasingly engaging in fields outside their traditional discipline boundaries, working in multi-disciplinary collaborations often focused on deploying \u2018design thinking\u2019 to the broader themes of the day. Not simply solving problems but framing questions. Not simply building stuff but helping shape a lens through which to understand and shape our world. This I am all in favour of, with the caveat that it is best done with grace, humility and broad skills and experience. The theme emerged several times, and is perhaps the most interesting area of design at this point. But one also wonders whether it is simply a reaction to the global financial crisis and the vertiginous drop in jobs in architecture and urban development i.e. a need to find a new job, a new role. (Later that evening, Paul Petrunia mentioned that Archinect job listings had plummeted by something like 90% almost overnight.) Fortunately, most of the time at Postopolis! LA, the discussion was a lot deeper than the need to find a new job, not least in Bryan Boyer\u2019s great contribution and some of the local practices\u2019 Q&As with the ArchDaily Duo.\nMost of all though, the backdrop to this Postopolis! was not Los Angeles, food production and fabrication, or the changing nature of architecture and urbanism but the Banquo at the feast that is the GFC itself (an ugly acronym which does not possess the elegance, power or appropriate levels of heartbreak as the term \u2018Great Depression\u2019 it seems to me.)\nAs noted I was struck by the intensity of focus on this subject, sometimes in maudlin hand-wringing fashion, sometimes with due concern and trepidation, and sometimes as an inspiration for actively and creatively trying to shape better things. It\u2019s not quite the same in Sydney, a city half the size of LA but with much in common. The wheels of creative destruction turn slower here in Australia, which is both good and bad. Most people would not yet be arguing that there\u2019s little or no future in daily newspapers, most mining, broadcast advertising models and much broadcast media, most domestic commercial aviation, speculator-driven property development, private education, shopping malls, supermarkets, big cars, big houses and Nicole Kidman. Or more importantly, that we should \u201cresist the recovery\u201d, as Bratton put it , and that perhaps much of the world needs this change. Much of Australia hasn\u2019t felt the sharp end yet and may be meandering along a little too comfortably, perhaps buffered by China. Perhaps . Though China, of course, already has a very different economic and political model. It would be ironic if Australia were left last man standing with an un-reconstructed 'western-style' neo-liberal economic model due to its trade relationship with China. Although Rudd's government is possibly beginning to move things on - witness the brave and ambitious decision to build a government-led FTTP national broadband network , announced while I was in LA - the scale and complexity of change required is daunting.\nWhen he was Treasurer, Paul Keating, who would later become Prime Minister of Australia, famously said of the early \u201890s recession that it was \u201cthe recession Australia had to have\u201d. Well, I suspect this might actually be the one. However. It would be insensitive to stress this point given that tens of thousands of Australians have already lost their jobs.\nI realised during this week in Los Angeles that the USA was already being hammered by recession to a far greater degree. perhaps as it had gone bigger and deeper than anywhere else in the first place. Yet this meant that some were thinking about alternative futures to a far greater degree than elsewhere too. To some degree that is coinciding with the Obama effect - how wonderful to hear his speeches sampled in hip-hop all around - though whether he can, or wants to, go far enough isn't clear. In a decent attempt to reimagine the American character - though even I might say written in overly-optimistic fashion - Kurt Anderson notes that aspects of the 'Obama effect' (which would be as temporary as the Bilbao effect anyway) have been put on the back-burner given the need to get on with business. Or get on with reconfiguring what business is. But he's doing the right thing fairly often e.g. General Motors e.g. high-speed rail etc. Government is there to lead, not merely reactively heal over market failure, and this combination of Obama + GFC is leading in potentially interesting directions. Outside of government or other macro-scale movements, perhaps more so.\nI understood this intellectually before I arrived, but to see it and hear it in situ was often compelling. I had not thought that witnessing or even partaking in some of these conversations and thought-processes would be a thrilling, unforeseen and personally valuable side-effect of the event. For this I am grateful.\nThis sensation was most clearly articulated in Benjamin Bratton\u2019s talk , which was the curtain-raiser on our final day on the rooftop of The Standard. I\u2019ve written that one up and Bratton\u2019s kindly agreed that we could re-post his talk in full, so do go and have a read . I think it will continue to resonate for some time. Geoff noted that Bratton\u2019s profile had been framed in the late-afternoon sun by a giant Citibank logo on a \u2018scraper behind him. While we're doing landscape irony, over Bratton\u2019s left shoulder was the gleaming cylon -esque form of the Bonaventure hotel , which Fredric Jameson had pronounced the icon of late-capitalism in his landmark 1988 essay \u2018 Postmodernism and Consumer Society \u2019. A building as theoretical signifier of a theory about signifiers. Bratton noted that:\n\u201cAs Zizek was fond of saying, quoting Jameson talking about blockbuster sci-fi movies featuring exploding aliens and cities, it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. Perhaps that is less so today.\u201d\nQuite so. But if late capitalism might now be late as in parrot , we have work to do. The Bonaventure, which was the structure that instantly cut me off from the street on my first day in Los Angeles , sat there across the urban airspace, stubbornly glaring at us throughout the week. Whether it exemplifies or resists late-capitalism I'll leave to the professional theorists , but I recall it also features as a silent signifier in William H. Whyte's quietly powerful book The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces , not directly referenced in the text but sitting there glowering on the page nonetheless, amidst his impassioned chapter on megastructures:\n\"One feels somewhat disembodied in these spaces. Is it night? Or day? Spring? Or winter? And where are you? You cannot see out of the place. You do not know what city you are in, or if you are in a city at all. The complex could be at an airport or a new town. It could be in the East or the West. The piped music gives no clue. It is the same as everywhere. You could be in a foreign country or on a space satellite. You are in a universal controlled environment. And it is going to date very badlly. Forms of transportation and their attendant cultures have historically produced their most elaborate manifestations just after they have entered the period of their obsolescence. So it may be with the megastructures and the freeway era that bred them. They are the last convulsive embodiment of a time passing, and they are a wretched model for the future of the city.\" [From The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces by William H. Whyte]\nQuite so again. Whyte was writing that almost 30 years ago and Bonaventure and the freeways are still there - this is a problem with hard infrastructure - but I take great solace in the fact that Postopolis! LA was going on right under its nose, and that many of the protagonists were carving out far more interesting, useful and exciting futures for the city.\nBratton was followed by an artist whose work I\u2019ve long admired: Christian Moeller (see a couple of entries in this earlier post on facades ) and it was a pleasure to meet him. Write-up to follow.\nYet after Bratton and Moeller the format for the rest of the evening comprised of panels. With Postopolis! New York, this was the one aspect that arguably didn\u2019t work. There the last day felt a bit shambolic, which was probably more of a reflection on us organisers than the panellists. Here, the panels largely worked. The first, on new media art, didn\u2019t fire on all cylinders perhaps, but the subsequent panels were largely fascinating. I won\u2019t attempt to annotate these however. Reviewing a single speaker is tricky enough; a quick-fire panel of between 3 and 5 contributors, 1 or 2 moderators and audience Q&A is beyond me. Suffice to say I gleaned a lot from the media and photography panels in particular, and the last session with the editors of Dwell and Good magazines also worked well.\nThe turnout for the last day was great, as it had been all week, so thanks again. However, our plans for a grand closing party were foiled somewhat by the venue. But they\u2019ve been gracious hosts for most of the week so we can\u2019t complain too much. Apologies to those who wanted to hear Jace Clayton DJing again (but to those who were hoping to hear Dwell editor Sam Grawe's promised balearic stylings, you might have been better off without.) The event dissipates with a gracious 'thank you to all' from Storefront director Joseph Grima, and people drift off into the night. Most of us organisers actually hang around on the rooftop for a while, slightly dazed but happily chattering away, slowly beginning to relax and unwind, cold fingers gripping glasses of rapidly chilling red wine. It's almost as if we can\u2019t leave the place, or don\u2019t want to. We\u2019re all so happy with the week that we feel we could just carry on. Do another week just like it. After a day off perhaps.\nIf I'd criticise elements of the week, I'm a little disappointed we didn't manage to get more representation of a Latino view on the city and its landscape (save Rochas perhaps, and Michael Dear , though I'm not either 'qualify' as such). Still we don't want to be tokenistic about such things. We had a few technical hitches but then it's all done for not-much-money, as if you couldn't tell, so that's going to happen. The temperature was of course ridiculous at times. In terms of the online distribution of the event, I though the Twitter feed was particularly good (thanks Geoff), and although our blog entries could've got up quicker, I like the fact they're delayed. Someone commented on one of my posts that 'it's almost like there was more information in there than the actual talk'. Well, that's the idea. You can't approach the sensation of being there, but you can at least add context, analysis, links and your own take on such things. This will slow the process down (as you'll see, when my reviews of this thing are still emerging a few weeks from now) but I hope it's better for it. Anyway, these quibbles aside, I'm personally really happy with how Postopolis! LA turned out..\nThanks so much to all the speakers who contributed their time and thoughts; to the audience who braved the cold (who knew LA could even get that chilly?), as well as those watching the live streams, Twitter feeds and blogs; huge thanks to my fellow curators and co-hosts at BLDGBLOG , Subtopia , We Make Money Not Art , Mudd Up! and ArchDaily - we had a blast; to ForYourArt for all their help in supporting the event and The Standard for hosting; and to the Storefront for Art & Architecture extended crew for performing above and beyond the call of duty again, playing away from home this time; and to director Joseph Grima in particular, for making it all happen.\nI\u2019ll now concentrate on getting all these other notes online, and you might also read various summings-up, across numerous blogs, websites and news outlets elsewhere, and from the Postopolis! LA team themselves e.g. Bryan\u2019s rather poetic post-PostOps post , Regine\u2019s various great summary posts (days 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 ), Geoff's thanks and narrative planetarium , ArchDaily\u2019s reflections and so on. There\u2019s more to come here, but for now, until the next time \u2026\n"}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]}
