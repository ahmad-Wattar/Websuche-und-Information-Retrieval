But the patent isn\u2019t necessarily limited to the iPhone application itself, and the describes how such a system could be used in a number of ways, including with mobile phones, PDAs, tablets, game consoles, embedded computer systems in cars, and possibly others. This assistant might provide information and services on a single client device or multiple devices, and possibly in combination with applications and information on servers as well.\nIt could also act as an active participant in messaging platforms such as email, instant messaging, discussion forums, group chat sessions, and customer support sessions.\nThe intelligent assistant could go on the internet to discover, find, choose among, purchase, reserve, or order products and services, using multiple sources of data if needed to check reviews, find prices from different places and their locations and operating hours, locate information about events, performances and attractions, places to go, places to stay, places to eat and drink, and times to meet others.\nIt could also combine natural language dialog with a graphical user interface that can:\nSearch, including location-based search\nNavigate, providing maps and directions\nLookup information on databases (such as finding businesses or people by name or other properties)\nProvide weather conditions and forecasts\nCheck prices of market items or status of financial transactions\nMonitor traffic or the status of flights\nAccess and update calendars and schedules\nManage reminders, alerts, tasks and projects\nCommunicate over email or other messaging platforms\nOperate devices locally or remotely (e.g., dialing telephones, controlling light and temperature and home security devices, playing music or video)\nInitiate, operate, and control many functions and apps available on the device\nOffer personal recommendations for activities, products, services, source of entertainment, time management, etc.\nWhat does this intelligent assistant mean to search? The patent filing tells us:\nUnlike search engines which only return links and content, some embodiments of automated assistants described herein may automate research and problem-solving activities.\nWe\u2019re also told that the personal information that the assistant learns about while interacting with its user enables it to provide better personalized search results than we might get from search engines, and also improve how someone interacts with the Web by automating things such as filling out forms or signing up for services.\nIn addition to speech recognition and input, this intelligent assistant also will offer graphical options to do things like calling a business, saving information about the business to remember for later, share the location with someone else by email, show the location on a map, save personal notes about the business.\nThe patent also describes how \u201cActive Ontologies\u201d serve as the underlying infrastructure behind how the intelligent assistant builds models about data and knowledge. For example, a \u201cdining out domain model\u201d might be linked to a \u201crestaurant concept\u201d as well as a \u201cmeal event concept.\u201d\nThe patent application is very long, and provides a wide range of examples and information about how the assistant works, interacts with others, understands paraphrases, interprets language and vocabulary, and recognizes language patterns, and other features as well.\nInvented by Thomas Robert Gruber, Adam John Cheyer, Dag Kittlaus, Didier Rene Guzzoni, Christopher Dean Brigham, Richard Donald Giuli, Marcello Bastea-Forte, Harry Joseph Saddler\nAssigned to Apple Inc.\n"}, {"score": 992.0624, "uuid": "ba21f145-6fcd-57bc-a486-88db0a948210", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-64-20893", "target_hostname": "www.popsci.com", "target_uri": "http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2012-03/apples-new-ipad-screen-better-and-its-faster?cmpid=tw", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> New iPad: The Screen Is <em>Better</em>, and It&#x27;s Faster | Popular Science", "snippet": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> New iPad: The Screen Is <em>Better</em>, and It&#x27;s Faster Apple just announced the newest iPad, <em>which</em> will be called the iPad, and not the iPad 3 <em>or</em> iPad HD <em>or</em> iPad: Eddie Bauer Edition <em>or</em> with any other modifier.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Dan Nosowitz Posted 03.07.2012 at 2:05 pm 9 Comments\nThe New iPad Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\nApple just announced the newest iPad, which will be called the iPad, and not the iPad 3 or iPad HD or iPad: Eddie Bauer Edition or with any other modifier.

But while MSN fine-tunes its algorithms, Google has struck at the heart of Windows with a beta release tool to search PC desktops.\nGoogle Desktop Search , which for now works with Windows XP, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 and above, represents a new front in Microsoft's war for the Web; it was never really about the browser, according to Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox.\nWhile Microsoft\ncame to dominate the desktop OS market, the rise of the Web threatened it, because people didn't need a specific operating system to access Web content. \"Netscape was not really the competitive threat Microsoft was trying to address [with Internet Explorer],\" Wilcox said. \"By making the browser part of the operating system, if you have the dominant platform, you can extend it to the Web. You're also extending the utility of the operating system and the way it takes in information.\"\nGoogle's move has again raised the question of whether Windows is required to access the Web. \"By extending its search platform, Google\ncreates a presence in other browsers and other operating systems, and potentially in new devices that will be increasingly be used to access the Web, such as Wi-Fi-enabled PDAs, cell phones and smart phones,\" Wilcox said.\nAt the same time, Google has invaded Microsoft's prime turf: the desktop. Said John Battelle, author of an upcoming book on search, \"Search has become a de facto interface for the Internet, and I think Google has quite elegantly leveraged that presumption back onto the desktop.\"\nHe said Google's clean and simple interface is a better solution to finding all the various files that Microsoft creates. While it's neither an alternative to Windows nor an interface on top of it, he added, \"there's no question that this approach will eat into the amount of quality time a consumer spends with Windows.\"\nBut desktop search itself is not such a threat to Redmond, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff. Microsoft certainly knew Google was working on this, and MSN is working on a similar tool, with Lookout as the basis.\nIn July, Microsoft bought Lookout, a third-party developer's \"personal search tool\" that lets users search their desktops from within their Outlook e-mail client. The software was placed under the purview of the MSN Search team, which is working on new Web search technology.\nAt the same time, another team at Microsoft is building WinFS, a new file system that supposedly will let users search through multiple file types stored on a desktop computer.\nBut Lookout -- and Google Desktop Search -- are very different from WinFS. \"WinFS is a whole different search beast,\" said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. \"You're talking about more than just searching for documents, you're also searching for complex information. One of its fundamental aspects is being able to use metadata as a means of not just finding information but also making it more meaningful.\"\n\"MSN is making significant investments in search, and we will ship the product when we are confident it will meet the needs of our customers,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. The company plans to release betas of the new algorithmic search engine and desktop search in the U.S. by the end of 2004.\nRosoff said that WinFS is a non-starter in this battle. Microsoft admitted in August that WinFS would not ship as part of Longhorn, the next Windows version expected in 2006. \"It's not going to be in Longhorn, and I'm not sure when we'll see it,\" he said. \"MSN search will be their answer to Google for the time being.\" In fact, he said, Microsoft has always used MSN as a blocking tool, first against AOL and most recently, with the launch of MSN Music, against Apple's iTunes music download service.\n\"MSN has the time and resources, and they will hammer at this idea until they perceive the threat is gone,\" he said.\n\"The bigger threat from Google is that end users will turn more and more to hosted online services to perform regular functions, rather than using the Windows shell or Microsoft desktop applications,\" Rosoff said. \"The threat [is] from hosted applications versus Microsoft's thick client and desktop operating system. When Google is looking more and more like a thin-client company, that poses threat to Microsoft's core business model.\"\nAnd it's not like there aren't other alternatives for desktop search, according to Gary Price, author of \"The Invisible Web.\" He pointed out that companies like Copernic have offered desktop search for years. \"Alta Vista in its raw form is still more powerful than Google,\" he said, adding that Google doesn't index a lot of file formats.\nJosh Jacobs, president of search technology provider X1, which powers part of the new Snap personal search tool, said his company's desktop search technology indexes 255 different file types, including MP3 and PDF. X1, which retails for $79.95, is aimed at professionals who understand file types and how to refine searches, while Google Desktop Search, according to Marissa Mayer, Google director of consumer Web products, is aimed at people who aren't sure of where the information they're looking for is located.\n\"A lot of time users don't even remember where things are,\" she said. \"All they remember is that they saw it.\"\nX1 users, on the other hand, \"focuses on people who use desktop search as a part of the way they do their jobs,\" Jacobs said. \"They're people for whom the information on their computer is the key to business success.\"\nJacobs said he welcomed the arrival of Google's product, because it would raise awareness of the desktop search category.\nAfter all, awareness is one of Google's key strengths. Said Price, news editor of Search Engine Watch, which, like Jupiter Research, has the same corporate owner as internetnews.com. \"What's equally impressive about Google is how they've turned something you can't hold in your hands into a verb -- without doing any consumer-facing marketing.\"\n\"A lot of companies besides Google do desktop search,\" Battelle said. \"But none of them are Google. Integrating it into Google's strength, the Web interface, that's what makes it special.\"\nBut if the desktop is the new front in the war for the domination of search, the battle has just begun. As Microsoft homes in on the problem via the OS and MSN, rivals Yahoo\n, AOL\n"}, {"score": 966.3073, "uuid": "6d48bf8b-b805-5c31-bf9e-553d18065071", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0506wb-35-12105", "target_hostname": "www.internetnews.com", "target_uri": "http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3422131", "page_rank": 1.2136353e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Google&#x27;s</em> New Threat to Microsoft - InternetNews.", "snippet": "He said <em>Google&#x27;s</em> clean and simple interface is a <em>better</em> solution to finding all the various files that Microsoft creates.", "explanation": null, "document": "Google's New Threat to Microsoft\nGoogle's New Threat to Microsoft\nBy Susan Kuchinskas\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 October 15, 2004\nPage 1 of 1\nEmail this Article\nMicrosoft has warned that it's preparing a Google killer in the form of a better search tool.

Said John Battelle, author of an upcoming book on search, \"Search has become a de facto interface for the Internet, and I think Google has quite elegantly leveraged that presumption back onto the desktop.\"\nHe said Google's clean and simple interface is a better solution to finding all the various files that Microsoft creates. While it's neither an alternative to Windows nor an interface on top of it, he added, \"there's no question that this approach will eat into the amount of quality time a consumer spends with Windows.\"\nBut desktop search itself is not such a threat to Redmond, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff. Microsoft certainly knew Google was working on this, and MSN is working on a similar tool, with Lookout as the basis.\nIn July, Microsoft bought Lookout, a third-party developer's \"personal search tool\" that lets users search their desktops from within their Outlook e-mail client. The software was placed under the purview of the MSN Search team, which is working on new Web search technology.\nAt the same time, another team at Microsoft is building WinFS, a new file system that supposedly will let users search through multiple file types stored on a desktop computer.\nBut Lookout -- and Google Desktop Search -- are very different from WinFS. \"WinFS is a whole different search beast,\" said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. \"You're talking about more than just searching for documents, you're also searching for complex information. One of its fundamental aspects is being able to use metadata as a means of not just finding information but also making it more meaningful.\"\n\"MSN is making significant investments in search, and we will ship the product when we are confident it will meet the needs of our customers,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. The company plans to release betas of the new algorithmic search engine and desktop search in the U.S. by the end of 2004.\nRosoff said that WinFS is a non-starter in this battle. Microsoft admitted in August that WinFS would not ship as part of Longhorn, the next Windows version expected in 2006. \"It's not going to be in Longhorn, and I'm not sure when we'll see it,\" he said. \"MSN search will be their answer to Google for the time being.\" In fact, he said, Microsoft has always used MSN as a blocking tool, first against AOL and most recently, with the launch of MSN Music, against Apple's iTunes music download service.\n\"MSN has the time and resources, and they will hammer at this idea until they perceive the threat is gone,\" he said.\n\"The bigger threat from Google is that end users will turn more and more to hosted online services to perform regular functions, rather than using the Windows shell or Microsoft desktop applications,\" Rosoff said. \"The threat [is] from hosted applications versus Microsoft's thick client and desktop operating system. When Google is looking more and more like a thin-client company, that poses threat to Microsoft's core business model.\"\nAnd it's not like there aren't other alternatives for desktop search, according to Gary Price, author of \"The Invisible Web.\" He pointed out that companies like Copernic have offered desktop search for years. \"Alta Vista in its raw form is still more powerful than Google,\" he said, adding that Google doesn't index a lot of file formats.\nJosh Jacobs, president of search technology provider X1, which powers part of the new Snap personal search tool, said his company's desktop search technology indexes 255 different file types, including MP3 and PDF. X1, which retails for $79.95, is aimed at professionals who understand file types and how to refine searches, while Google Desktop Search, according to Marissa Mayer, Google director of consumer Web products, is aimed at people who aren't sure of where the information they're looking for is located.\n\"A lot of time users don't even remember where things are,\" she said. \"All they remember is that they saw it.\"\nX1 users, on the other hand, \"focuses on people who use desktop search as a part of the way they do their jobs,\" Jacobs said. \"They're people for whom the information on their computer is the key to business success.\"\nJacobs said he welcomed the arrival of Google's product, because it would raise awareness of the desktop search category.\nAfter all, awareness is one of Google's key strengths. Said Price, news editor of Search Engine Watch, which, like Jupiter Research, has the same corporate owner as internetnews.com. \"What's equally impressive about Google is how they've turned something you can't hold in your hands into a verb -- without doing any consumer-facing marketing.\"\n\"A lot of companies besides Google do desktop search,\" Battelle said. \"But none of them are Google. Integrating it into Google's strength, the Web interface, that's what makes it special.\"\nBut if the desktop is the new front in the war for the domination of search, the battle has just begun. As Microsoft homes in on the problem via the OS and MSN, rivals Yahoo\n, AOL\n"}, {"score": 952.8723, "uuid": "f67a320b-f702-5230-a7a0-4ec9d4893370", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0602wb-31-22913", "target_hostname": "www.pcworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/241562/apples_siri_has_rival_in_sensory.html", "page_rank": 1.2358837e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> Siri has Rival in Sensory | PCWorld", "snippet": "<em>Better</em> yet, the software is &quot;always on.&quot; You don&#x27;t have to punch any buttons to activate it, as you do with Siri.

Mello Jr. , PCWorld Oct 9, 2011 2:21 PM\nAmong the features of the new iPhone 4S, which should start reaching consumers' hands this week, is a baked-in personal assistant app called Siri . The software uses speech recognition, artificial intelligence, and tight integration to the phone's built-in apps to create a \"personal assistant\" to perform a multitude of tasks for you. As powerful as Siri is, however, a speech recognition product made by a company called Sensory, Inc. may outshine Apple's offering in the long run.\nWhile the name of Sensory's product -- Trulyhandsfree Voice Control 2.0 -- doesn't slip off the tongue as smoothly as Siri, it does something that all speech recognition programs have had a devil of a time doing: recognizing speech in hostile ambient noise environments.\n\"It's amazing,\" Michael Morgan, a mobile devices analyst with ABI Research in New York City, tells PC World. \"They've used some kind of black magic so you can have your phone in your pocket in a noisy environment and issue voice commands.\"\nBetter yet, the software is \"always on.\" You don't have to punch any buttons to activate it, as you do with Siri.\nOrdinarily, an \"always on\" speech recognition application is asking for trouble. That's because the software can't determine when you're speaking to it or talking to someone else. Sensory's speaker-independent software appears to address that problem with highly accurate recognition and the capability to recognize commands, even when they're embedded in sentences, surrounded by ambient sound, and spoken as far as 20 feet from a phone.\n\"You can leave it on and talk for two hours, and it will not misfire, and it will pick up the second you say a command,\" Morgan says. \"It does an excellent job.\"\nOf course, you can do many more things with Siri than you can do with Sensory's software, which is currently made for Android phones. For example, before you walk out the door for work in the morning, you can ask Siri if you'll need a raincoat. It will do all the work of checking the weather forecast for your geographical location and returning with an answer based on that forecast.\nBut if you have to repeat a question five times before you can get a response from an app or instead of answering your raincoat question, it displays a calendar item with the word \"rain check\" in it, then that app is likely to lose its luster pretty fast.\nThat could be the case with Siri, according to Morgan. \"Apple's gateway into the iPhone's voice commands doesn't work that well,\" he asserts.\n\"Apple did a great job of making sure that the speech recognition is contextually aware,\" he adds. \"At this point though, as usual, it's going to be speech recognition making promises that it can't deliver on at the moment.\"\nSensory , located in Santa Clara, California, has been around since 1994, and its speech recognition technology has been used in products produced by Plantronics, Motorola, Hasbro, Mattel, Kensington, and Samsung, as well as others.\nFollow freelance technology writer John P.

Later, Page and Brin would rely on university largesse in the early days of the Google Book Search project, when major research libraries allowed the company to scan huge portions of their collections for free.\nIn return, Google has given higher education Google Scholar, which provides a popular bridge to otherwise obscure academic research; Google Apps for Education, which enables universities to use the company\u2019s e-mail and communications tools, and its huge server capacity, for free; and, of course, Google Book Search \u2014 which, despite its discomfiting monopoly, gives scholars a more comprehensive body of digitized literature than has ever existed. \u201cGoogle,\u201d Vaidhyanathan observes, \u201cis an example of a stunningly successful firm behaving as much like a university as it can afford to.\u201d\nBut as is often the case with cousins, the genetic differences between higher education and Google are more striking than their similarities. Beneath the interdependence and shared hereditary traits, tensions creep. And like an awkward Thanksgiving dinner, Vaidhyanathan\u2019s new book, The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry) (University of California Press), provokes these tensions to the surface.\nThe Virginia professor, who is not afraid to confess his affection for the ease and usefulness of Google, nevertheless distrusts the company\u2019s basic motivations as it vies for our intellectual inheritance. \u201cGoogle has fostered a more seamless, democratized, global, cosmopolitan information ecosystem,\u201d he writes. \u201cYet it has simultaneously contributed to the steady commercialization of higher education and the erosion of standards of information quality.\u201d\nGoogle does not reward our impulse to know, Vaidhyanathan argues; it exploits it by making it appear as though knowing is easy. \u201cThe ways that Google structures, judges, and delivers knowledge to us exacerbate our worst tendencies to jump to erroneous conclusions and act on them in ways that cause harm,\u201d the professor writes. Meanwhile the company keeps collecting, on behalf of its advertisers, the wealth of personal information that we feed it in exchange for this flattery, then pats its own back all the way to the bank.\nVaidhyanathan\u2019s point is not that Google has scammed us. He attributes the ascension of Google to a \u201cpublic failure\u201d \u2014 negligence by public stewards to preempt the privatization of knowledge and learning in the switch from analog to digital. In other words, we should have seen this coming. Did Google\u2019s academic bloodlines lull higher education into passively supporting Page and Brin as they quietly absconded with the family jewels? Perhaps, but Vaidhyanathan is less concerned with how we got here than where we are and where we\u2019re going. Accordingly, he proposes a sprawling effort by libraries and like-minded institutions that would essentially give Googlers a public option. \u201cThe future of knowledge \u2014 and thus the future of the species \u2014 depends on our getting this right,\u201d he writes.\nInside Higher Ed caught up with Vaidhyanathan, whose Wikipedia page credits him with coining the term \u201cCritical Information Studies,\u201d though it does not cite its source.\nQ: You admit early on that your book has an \u201covertly political\u201d agenda: greater government regulation of Google. When a company exerts such control over public goods \u2014 like, say, a digital archive of 130 million books comprising the entire living history of human thought \u2014 oversight by public authorities becomes necessary, you argue. One might counter that public institutions are potentially just as compromising. To the extent that regulation would transfer power over the basic infrastructure of knowledge and learning from Google to the government, might we simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization?\nA: While I argue that we should consider \u2014 not fear \u2014 the prospect of regulating Google, I stop short of prescribing much in the way of specific regulation. My goal is to convince readers that Google is already highly regulated, so it's dumb to say that Google should remain unregulated. More importantly, I want to raise the prospect of whether Google and the Internet in general are properly regulated. That, to me, is the grown-up way to approach the question. Right now Google is haphazardly and clumsily regulated. Copyright stops Google and others from doing clever, useful things. Antitrust is too toothless to provide serious competition in online, search-based advertisements. Most important from the perspective of the values important to a democratic republic, Google's search standards are opaque and potentially corrupt. That's why the European Union is examining them . I don't believe Google's search results are corrupted. I do believe they very well could be in the near future. And there is no guarantee that the next company that governs search would be named Google. As to the direct questions about whether the transfer of authority from firm to state would \"simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization,\" I say exactly! Politicization means that citizens battle over competing visions of the good. That's what we are supposed to do in a democratic republic. Fundamentally, we must recognize that some things are too important to be entrusted to unaccountable private actors. There may be hazards. But they are our hazards.\nQ: As you write, it is not just our institutions that are being \u201cGooglized\u201d; so are our minds and habits. Some surveys have suggested that nearly half of college students use Google as their primary research tool. \u201cGooglized\u201d students have poor memories and inflated expectations about how much effort it takes to dig up definitive answers. A Greek chorus of tsk-ing academics has all but declared this a preamble to the Twitter-apocalypse. Are they right?\nA: I don't subscribe to the \"Google is making us dumber\" position. I think Google is allowing us to be differently smart. I also refuse to bracket off my students as some exotic tribe that behaves and reacts differently than I do or my mother does. We are all in this crazy environment together. The challenges we share are much more important and interesting than the differences we might demonstrate across age groups. So yeah, Google is my primary research tool. It's also my mother's. Collectively, our dependence on Google is not a problem because it allegedly weakens our faculties. It's a problem because Google bakes biases into its algorithms. And we fail to recognize that fact. Most of the time, we can't even discern what they are. Most of the recent changes in Google's search algorithms make Google much better for shopping and much worse for learning. That could make us collectively dumber, but not individually. That's why we need a fresh approach to how we manage our information ecosystem. The same service cannot serve wisdom and wealth equally well. I'm sorry. What was the question? I got distracted by YouTube for a moment...\nQ: At a digital scholarship conference last fall , I watched Daniel M. Russell, a senior research scientist at Google in charge of \u201cuser happiness,\u201d give an academic audience a demonstration of what treasures lie in the depths of Google\u2019s trove \u2014 a facsimile of Stravinsky\u2019s score from \u201cSacre du Printemps,\u201d a 3-D model of the Notre Dame Cathedral, unemployment data for Santa Clara County over the last 20 years \u2014 before lamenting that most students have no idea how to find them. The implication was that Google has created this rich, open vault that students love to use but which colleges are failing to teach them to use effectively. To what extent can better training and education realistically solve this problem?\nA: Well, I am not sure training is the gap here. Google keeps rolling out cool features and services faster than we can fold them into our habits and curricula. A couple of weeks ago Google unveiled a really cool high-definition tool to explore major art works in museums. Every day I plan to use it to show my daughter some of her favorite works. But every evening I forget to do that because I just can't get out of the tangle of links connecting YouTube videos.\nGoogle has not figured out how to connect with the right faculty in the right numbers for many of its services. But it's not really Google's fault. Perhaps each university should assign a librarian to be the Chief Google Officer so she or he could hip faculty to the newest, coolest things.\nQ: Lest our readers assume that your book is a frothing, techno-phobic screed penned by a dyed-in-the-tweed academic who lives to prove that any large, profitable company is necessarily sinister and exploitative, I should mention that you actually have some quite nice things to say about Google in these pages. What is the greatest contribution Google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life?\nA: Google made the Web usable. Before this clean and useful search tool, using the Web well meant starting at a trusted point and following trusted links. That's why it is called a \"web.\" With decent search one can just drop down into a new part of the Web, skipping over the useless and icky parts. Google actually cleaned up the Web \u2014 or at least our experience of it. Not long ago simple searches for double entendres like \"facial\" would yield anything but links to the cosmetic spa treatment. Google's biases \u2014 what it calls standards \u2014 effectively hide the most troublesome links deep in the search results. You can find the yucky stuff by searching for exactly what you might want. But you are unlikely to stumble upon bad stuff accidentally. This is a great service, but one with real costs at the margins.\nBeyond that, Google Docs is a major service to higher education. It's the easiest and most dependable way to allow multiple authors and editors to work on a document together. It lacks the useless gizmos that infect Microsoft Office. I use the Google Docs presentation software to run slides for class because it's simple, dependable, and can host embedded YouTube videos. Did I mention that I spend too much time on YouTube? That said, I believe it's incumbent on universities to ensure maximum user confidentiality and data security for any Google product. I don't believe universities have been strong or effective negotiators for their students' and faculties' interests when it comes to using Google services. There should be a collective set of best practices for when universities deploy third-party services that collect user data.\nQ: Your book culminates with a proposal for an alternative to Google\u2019s \u201chyper-commercialized, data-mined, advertising-directed\u201d model \u2014 working title: the Human Knowledge Project. Contrary to Google, this project would set the agenda for the creation of a information system that is public, comprehensive, civic-minded, and strong enough to outlast its colorful, colossal counterpart. How plausible is it that a confederation of relatively cash-poor and fractious public institutions might actually shoulder the resolve and unity of vision to field a more stable alternative to Google? Does any part of you fear that what \u201cthe Googlization of everything\u201d has taken from humanity, humanity lacks the will to reclaim?\nA: The Human Knowledge Project would be a 50-year public, global plan to design, legislate for, enable, and fund a global digital library service to deliver the best information to the most people. It's as feasible as it is desirable. In other words, if we don't do it it's because we don't really want it. States are only as cash-poor as they choose to be. States are only as incompetent as they are designed to be. The fractured nature of public discourse could be the source of strength for such a project as long as we all agree on the terms of debate and the over-arching goal: that no child growing up in Sweden should have better access to better information than a child growing up in Rwanda would have. If we don't agree to that, then we should not pursue the Human Knowledge Project. If we do agree, then let's start a political campaign for it. Let's figure out the steps we need to take. Let's change the laws we need to change. Let's raise the money we need to raise. The goal would not be to oust or push Google. The goal would be to build what we want and need without resorting to cheap, short-term fixes. If anyone should \"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible,\" it should be the world itself.\nFor the latest technology news and opinion from Inside Higher Ed, follow @IHEtech on Twitter .\n"}, {"score": 902.63257, "uuid": "a0dad006-0852-5d07-abdd-8f0381ec9601", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500wb-27-16627", "target_hostname": "www.macworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.macworld.com/article/146788/2010/03/nexus_one_iphone.html", "page_rank": 1.2382054e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "iPhone lessons from <em>Google&#x27;s</em> Nexus One | Macworld", "snippet": "Because as much as I\u2019m capable of toying with <em>technology</em>, I\u2019d rather the <em>technology</em> just work.

In 2007, it was the announcement of the iPhone at Macworld Expo . This year, Google tried to replicate the experience by calling a media-only event of its own to announce the Nexus One , the first device running the search-engine giant\u2019s Android operating system to be sold directly by Google.\nSimilar Articles\nJobs speaks! The complete transcript\nUnlike the iPhone announcement, which was revolutionary, the Nexus One announcement marked the evolution of Android. A few months before, Motorola\u2019s Droid was announced as the first Android phone that could really compete with the iPhone. I tried a Droid and, quite frankly, came away disappointed. But the Nexus One, with its fast processor and streamlined design, looked like it was worth a test drive.\nWith a new Nexus One in hand, provided on loan from Google, I spent several days using the Nexus One as my only smartphone, and another week with it in one pocket and my iPhone 3GS in another.\nBut my purpose here is not to review the Nexus One\u2014you can read Ginny Mies\u2019s full review () for those details. I'm here to look at the Nexus One and consider where it\u2019s better than the iPhone, where there are notable differences, and how Apple\u2019s platform might progress when we see the next generation of iPhone hardware and software.\nHow does the Nexus One rate as a smart phone? It\u2019s a really good device. It outdoes the iPhone in a few areas, and its weaknesses show that Apple\u2019s device still has some serious advantages.\nA Mac user with Android\nWhen I first mentioned I was trying out a Nexus One, I heard from a collection of Mac users who seemed stunned by the idea that any Mac user would use a non-Apple smartphone. Yes, it\u2019s true that many smartphone operating systems\u2014I\u2019m thinking Windows Mobile and BlackBerry\u2014have been indifferent or even hostile to Mac users in the past.\nAndroid seems different. In fact, Android doesn\u2019t seem to have been designed with the existence of personal computers in mind. You can use an Android phone even if you never, ever connect it to a computer.\nThat said, I found using the Nexus One with my Mac to be easy. It helped that I already sync my iCal calendars with Google Calendar using BusyMac\u2019s $25 BusySync () utility. Because of that, all I had to do was point the Nexus One at those calendars, and the phone was in sync with the data my Mac. The Nexus one ships with a built-in Gmail client, but it\u2019s also got a separate app that\u2019s a full-fledged IMAP client, which I connected with my work and personal e-mail accounts. That was easy.\nIt\u2019s easy to access the Nexus One\u2019s onboard microSD memory card, either by connecting the phone to your Mac and mounting it directly or (slightly less conveniently) by removing it entirely and using a card reader to do the job. Once the card is mounted, you can just drag music, videos, and photos onto it and they\u2019ll be recognized by the built-in Music and Gallery (photo/video player) apps. But that\u2019s not a very friendly solution. Better is to use Salling Software\u2019s Salling Media Sync utility ($22, free-but-slow-to-sync version also available), which automatically syncs your iTunes playlists and iPhoto albums when you mount the memory card.\nIs the Nexus One as integrated into the Mac experience as the iPhone? Absolutely not. But if you integrate your Mac with Google\u2019s data services\u2014most specifically Google Calendar\u2014the Nexus One will fit in nicely. It\u2019s not as seamless as the Apple experience, to be sure, but it\u2019s not hostile, either.\nThings I wish the iPhone had\nWhen the iPhone first hit the scene, it was far ahead of any other device in almost every way. (There were exceptions, of course, like support for MMS messaging and voice dialing.) The entire smartphone market has transformed over the past two years in reaction to the iPhone \u2014 and in some areas that game of catch-up has turned into leapfrog. There\u2019s no doubt that the Nexus One has some features that I find superior to what\u2019s available on the iPhone.\nThe screen resolution. The Nexus One\u2019s screen is slightly larger than the iPhone\u2019s (3.7 inches diagonal versus 3.5). But while the iPhone\u2019s screen is 320 pixels wide by 480 pixels high, the Nexus One\u2019s is 480 wide by 800 high. That\u2019s 2.5 times more pixels than the iPhone offers, and it shows, most especially in the playback of videos and photos and in the Nexus One\u2019s crisp text. (Nexus One\u2019s screen is based on OLED technology, which generates vibrant colors and looks great in most environments, but really suffers in bright sunlight.)\nThe Android home screen is more flexible than the iPhone's, and you can install small Widgets on it.\nA more flexible home screen. The iPhone\u2019s home screen was originally designed for a device with a fixed number of apps, all of which Apple could display on a single screen. With the advent of the App Store, Apple expanded the metaphor\u2014by adding more pages with more app icons. Page after page of icons. Every app you download will, in fact, show up on one of those pages until you fill them all up.\nThe Nexus One will let you fill your home screen with icons, if you like. But you can choose which apps show up on the home screens; to bring up a scrollable list of every app on your phone, you tap the app button at the bottom center of the screen. It\u2019s a nice way to give you quick access to your favorites, while also keeping every app within reach.\nThe iPhone\u2019s home screen will only make space for iPhone apps and saved Safari shortcuts. In contrast, the Nexus One lets you save shortcuts to important contacts, phone numbers, map directions, and even items from third-party apps (such as individual e-books or FourSquare check-in locations). Oh, and you can also add widgets\u2026\nWidgets. Widgets are small mini-programs that run right on your home screen. For example, one built-in widget displays your current weather and scrolls through news headlines. Another is a Google search box. Yet another lets you quickly turn off some basic phone settings, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. I quickly added a calendar widget to my home screen, which shows me my next appointment\u2014and doubles as a shortcut I can tap to take me to the full Calendar app.\nNone of the Widgets are mandatory. You can add or remove them at will. But I like them. That same information is there behind every app on my iPhone; I just have to tap individual apps to bring it forward. Now when I look at my iPhone, I see a wall of apps waiting for me to tap them. On the Nexus One, I see what I need to do next and what music I\u2019m currently listening to (with a control to quickly pause or move to the next track). It\u2019s a good idea.\nA look at the pull-down notifications list.\nNotifications. The iPhone doesn\u2019t do notifications very well. If it wants to get your attention, it throws up a window with a message that interrupts what you\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s it. It also doesn\u2019t deal with multiple notifications well \u2014 they\u2019re just a series of those same single notifications. If you dismiss one accidentally, you can\u2019t find it again. It\u2019s a system designed for a simpler time, and with thousands of apps and a spiffy push-notification service any developer can use, that time is gone.\nAndroid on the Nexus One, on the other hand, has a new notification trick. It can pulse the light on its trackball to let you know something\u2019s going on. And to see your notifications, you can pull down the menubar at the top of the screen. It\u2019s easy to see all the notifications at a glance, and you can tap on one to go to the relevant app.\nI can\u2019t say I think Android handles notifications perfectly. This is an instance where Android may do something that the iPhone can't do, but doesn't pull it off in a way that really satisfies me. Or to put it another way, Android does more to address the problem, but doesn\u2019t completely solve it. There\u2019s a better answer here, and neither Android nor iPhone has found it.\nMultitasking. Every time I talk to someone who is a fan of the Android platform, the first advantage over the iPhone they say to me is that Android can run more than one app at a time, while the iPhone can\u2019t. It would be more accurate to say that the iPhone won\u2019t run any third-party apps in the background: since day one, the iPhone\u2019s iPod app has been able to run in the background (otherwise you couldn\u2019t play music while doing anything else), and of course telephone and notification services are always running, as is e-mail if you\u2019ve got it set to auto-check. In iPhone OS 3.0, Apple added the ability for Safari to run in the background, meaning you can now stream audio from Internet radio stations in the background while running other apps. (It\u2019s ugly, but it really does work.)\nThe P in the title bar indicates that Pandora is running in the background.\nIn any event, these tiny bits of multitasking in the iPhone don\u2019t address the larger issue, which is that some apps really need to be able to run in the background in order to reach their fullest potential. The poster-boy app for this cause is Pandora , the streaming-music service. Pandora\u2019s not a faceless MP3 stream that you can play in Safari; it\u2019s interactive, allowing you to customize your stations and control playback. Still, you should be able to start playing it, then switch to another app, then switch back to Pandora when you want to interact with the service. On the iPhone, that\u2019s currently impossible: if you want to listen to Pandora, you can\u2019t do anything else with your phone.\nAnother good candidate would be GPS-based apps, such as photo loggers , or running/ biking loggers, or location-based social-networking services such as Loopt and Google Latitude . There are a few other uses, too.\nIn any event, Android lets apps run in the background. If you aren\u2019t paying attention, you wouldn\u2019t notice most of the time. Using the Nexus One, I never ran into a situation where I needed to find and quit apps in order to speed things up.\nRunning apps in the background can cause your battery to drain faster; that\u2019s the top reason that Apple says it has avoided adding background capability for third-party apps. I get that, but if I want to drain my battery listening to Pandora, or receiving notifications every time anyone mentions me on Twitter, I\u2019d like to be able to make that decision.\nI don\u2019t think that Apple needs to implement the same philosophy of multitasking as Android. There should probably just be a special class of apps that are allowed to run background tasks, and users would be able to choose whether they want them to run them that way. Perhaps Apple could require those apps to undergo an extended approval process. But there needs to be something. It\u2019s an absolute joy to run Pandora in the background on the Nexus One, and it\u2019s a clear Android advantage over the iPhone.\nA feature not available on the iPhone: A combined view of all your e-mail account Inboxes.\nCombined e-mail inbox. It\u2019s a feature that\u2019s been on Macworld\u2019s wish list since the original iPhone came out , and yet Apple has never addressed it. A lot of us\u2014most notably anyone who has work mail come to one e-mail account and personal mail come to another\u2014have more than one e-mail account! And yet, to check your mail on your iPhone, you need to perform a ritual dance on your iPhone. Tap into an account, tap on Inbox, check your mail, then tap the back button twice, then tap on your other account, tap on Inbox again, and check that mail. Apple\u2019s Mac Mail app provides a unified Inbox; why not the iPhone?\nThanks to Android, the Nexus One does provide such a feature. The main screen of the built-in Mail program lists all your e-mail accounts and, above it, a combined inbox (along with options to view starred mail and any drafts you might have). It\u2019s not perfect\u2014some indication of which mail came from which account might be a nice feature\u2014but it\u2019s much more convenient than doing the iPhone tap dance.\n(With that praise out of the way, let me take a moment to criticize something about the Nexus One\u2019s e-mail system. Google ships not one, but two separate e-mail programs on the phone. One, Gmail, only works with Google\u2019s own mail system, and it supports all the features of that service, including the ability to view conversations in a chain just as you can on the Web version of Gmail. Then there\u2019s Mail, which supports your standard array of POP, IMAP, and Exchange e-mail accounts. It\u2019s kind of a mess. Why not just have one app that displays snazzy Gmail features when they\u2019re available, and not when they\u2019re not?)\nFree access to the music library. The music on the iPhone is largely locked in, loaded via iTunes sync. With the release of the iTunes app for the iPhone, you can now buy and download media on the phone and then sync it back to iTunes. But third-party apps don\u2019t get to modify the library in any way. In contrast, Android gives access to its media library to all comers. (Though to be fair, calling it a \u201clibrary\u201d gives a bit more credit than it deserves\u2014The library is just a collection of files on an SD card that the Music app re-scans every time the card is updated.)\nStill, my mind boggled when I launched an Android app for controlling my Logitech Squeezebox music player at home, only to discover that it offered me the option of downloading anything on my music server directly to my phone. I could sit on my couch, see an album I wanted to have on my phone, and with two taps and a couple of minutes it was loaded up. Of course, in such a scenario, Amazon could offer an Amazon MP3 Store app for the iPhone, too, giving iTunes a bit more competition.\nI also discovered that pressing and holding on any song in the collection of music on the Nexus One brought up an option to set that song as my ringtone. If you\u2019d like to know how to make a custom music ringtone for your iPhone from a track you already own, you\u2019ve got a bit of a Google search ahead of you.\nIs it better, or just different?\nThere\u2019s a whole other category of Nexus One features that are generally portrayed as advantages over the iPhone, but I\u2019m much more ambivalent about. Some of them are advantages that I view more as solutions in search of a problem; others are actually disadvantages.\nRemovable battery. Unlike the iPhone, the Nexus One comes with a battery that you can remove. If you\u2019re someone who uses your phone away from an electrical plug for hours at a time, this can be a big deal, because you can just pack a second battery and swap it in when it\u2019s needed. But I\u2019ve been using cell phones for more than a decade, and I\u2019ve never, ever owned a second battery for any of them. For a short period of time I had a second battery for my laptop, but I never used it, so I decided to give up on the practice as wasteful.\nDoes my iPhone run out of battery sometimes? Sure, on those rare occasions that I\u2019m using it heavily without being able to stop and recharge. That\u2019s why I bought a Kensington battery that will charge pretty much any device that uses a USB connection to get juice, and I will occasionally use it with my iPhone, my daughter\u2019s iPod, or any other device that needs a boost. And iPhone users can get more or less the same effect by buying an external pack like the svelte $80 Mophie Juice Pack Air\u2014but it\u2019ll make the iPhone slightly bigger, and it costs more than a simple spare battery.\nWhen it comes to batteries, here\u2019s what I really took away from the Nexus One: You can make a slim, sleek smartphone with a removable battery and a battery door that doesn\u2019t slip and slide off too easily. Perhaps Apple will always prefer to seal in its batteries due to the company\u2019s obsession with getting its devices as thin as possible. But if Apple felt it was important to make the iPhone\u2019s battery removable, the Nexus One shows that it can be done. Me, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth all the trouble.\nA camera with a flash. The iPhone 3GS's camera is actually pretty good. Though the Nexus One's offers more megapixels, the iPhone generally does a better job , and offers better camera controls, to boot. Even in low-light conditions, the iPhone will often take a more appealing picture than the Nexus One. But still, the Nexus One's camera has a flash. A flash would be good. I expected the Nexus One's camera, with a megapixel advantage and a flash, to blow the 3GS's camera out of the water. It didn't happen.\nThe Android Market is not a friendly place for regular people.\nFree and open app store. Most of the comments I read on Twitter from people who are promoting Android as a platform mention Apple\u2019s heavy-handed and inconsistent behavior in approving, rejecting, and removing third-party apps on the App store. As I have criticized Apple\u2019s approach to the App Store on many occasions, I see their point. Apple controls the app store, meaning that if a developer runs afoul of Apple\u2019s approval process for any reason, the work they\u2019ve put into build their app can be utterly wasted. The rules keep shifting, confusion seems to reign, dogs and cats are living together\u2014it\u2019s mass hysteria!\nBut if the App Store is a bit like a rigorously managed chain retailer\u2014Target or Wal-Mart, let\u2019s say, though I\u2019m sure Apple would prefer I liken it to Nordstrom\u2014then the Android Market is a bit like an open-air bazaar. There are featured apps, yes, but once you start searching things get really weird, really fast. I kept running into apps that demanded that my phone be \u201crooted,\u201d the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. Other apps required specific phone models (Droid, for example) or specific versions of the Android software. Real geeks won\u2019t care about any of that, maybe, but it\u2019s a terrible experience for regular consumers.\nSometimes I wonder if Android Market is actually a victim of the App Store backlash. Quite honestly, I think Android would better serve its users if it began to follow Apple\u2019s approach, rigorously testing apps and approving only a tiny fraction for the Market, as well as providing some very specific filters so that users of a non-rooted Nexus One don\u2019t run into search results full of apps requiring a rooted Droid.\nThere would still be freedom in this world of tightened Android Market scrutiny. You can still \u201csideload\u201d apps onto an Android phone from any source out there on the web, without going through the Android Market\u2014though you need to click through some preferences and receive a warning about unscrupulous programmers before the feature is enabled. But the purpose of Android Market shouldn\u2019t be to give Apple the finger; it should be to provide a clean, well-lit place for consumers to find apps. It\u2019s got a long way to go to catch up to Apple, and I\u2019m not entirely convinced Google is willing to put in the effort.\nI totally understand people who say they want to use Android in order to support an open platform over Apple\u2019s closed platform. That\u2019s not a bad political stand, as stands go. But make no mistake, there\u2019s a sacrifice in usability when you take that position. (This could all be resolved, by the way, if Apple would just relent and allow sideloading in the same fashion that Android does. Then there would be a free bazaar lurking outside the walls of the App Store, and users could enter it at their own peril.)\nUnlock screen. Right now on the iPhone, you have two options when it comes to unlocking your phone. You can slide to unlock, or you can tap in a four-digit code to unlock the phone. I don\u2019t have a PIN code on my phone; the thought of having to look down and tap numbers precisely onto a keypad just doesn\u2019t appeal to me. The thoughtful option added on the Nexus One is the creation of a lock pattern, in which you trace your finger over a grid of dots. It\u2019s not necessarily a feature I would use, but using a pattern you can build into your muscle memory seems to be more usable, faster, and more secure than using a four-digit code.\nSilkscreened buttons. Just below the bottom of the Nexus One\u2019s screen are four silkscreened-on, touch-sensitive buttons: Back, Home, Menu, and Search. And they\u2019re kind of a disaster. They\u2019re hard to press\u2014I found myself touching them over and over again before the presses would take (at which point the phone helpfully vibrates).\nThe root of a good idea that led to these buttons is that they\u2019re always there, they never move or change, and they don\u2019t take up any space on your screen. That\u2019s fine. But there are lots of contexts where they get in the way. The search button is rarely necessary, the menu button often not needed, and the home button is right below the spacebar of the phone\u2019s virtual keyboard, making it a user-interaction disaster. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I accidentally hit the home button (irony of ironies, it\u2019s easy to trigger when you\u2019re not trying to touch it) when I was typing something, causing the application I was using to quit and summarily banishing the entire message I had been typing to the land of wind and ghosts.\nThe iPhone has a physical home button, but any app that wants to perform these other features needs to use up screen space to do so. Of course, the concept of \u201cgo back\u201d on the iPhone is pretty ingrained: it\u2019s almost always a button in the top left corner of the screen, with a very particular look. But different app developers can put it in different places, and that can cause some confusion. On the Nexus One, there\u2019s always one place to tap in order to go back: the back button in the bottom left corner, below the screen. And as I used the Nexus One more and more, I found that back button to be a lifeline. Not sure where I am? Hit the back button. Switched to the wrong place? Back button.\nThis is why I\u2019m ambivalent about the buttons on the Nexus One. I can see the appeal of having that back button available, though the iPhone\u2019s approach isn\u2019t that far off. The search button seems extraneous. The menu button allows app developers to hide user-interaction elements away where nobody will see them unless they get the bright idea to tap the menu button. (Seems like a really bad idea to me.) And the home button is in a terrible location, leading to mistaken exits when you\u2019re just trying to type a space.\nWhat does it all mean?\nOverall, I find the Nexus One to be a credible smartphone, perhaps the best non-Apple smartphone I have ever used. In just about a year, Google has made some big strides from the first Android phone, the G1. And there are definitely several areas where Google has exposed the weaknesses of the iPhone. It was the first non-Apple smartphone I have used for an extended period of time without feeling like I wanted to chuck it into the nearest body of water. If the iPhone didn\u2019t exist, I would have the Nexus One in my pocket right now\u2014but then again, if the iPhone didn\u2019t exist, the Nexus One wouldn\u2019t either.\nJust because the Nexus One surpasses the iPhone in some areas doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a better product, however. It\u2019s not. As impressed as I am with the pace of advancement on the Android side, and as excited as I am that there\u2019s a legitimate competitor who is trying to out-innovate Apple in the smartphone market, there\u2019s no way I could recommend the Nexus One to a mainstream audience.\nIf you\u2019re a tech-savvy person who enjoys tweaking your system, installing add-on utilities, swapping in new hard drives, and that sort of thing, Android will fit the bill better than the iPhone. But the reason Apple sands off all those edges and reduces user options is not out of some insane degree of control-freakishness: Apple sands off the edges and reduces user options because most people don\u2019t want edges and options on their tech products.\nEven many tech-savvy people\u2014and I\u2019m including myself in this category\u2014would prefer to have a phone that just works, rather than a phone they can hack within an inch of its life. That\u2019s the path Apple has chosen to walk with the iPhone, and so far the company has seen massive benefit from that philosophy.\nI would not hesitate to recommend a Nexus One to a computer-geek friend of mine, especially one who has grown tired of Apple\u2019s App Store policies. But I\u2019d warn them first that they\u2019ll be trading a lot of well thought-out user experience, of usability.\nAndroid's music player is functional but ugly (left), and features a hierarchical navigation system that makes it easy to select albums without displaying their tracks (right).\nTake Android\u2019s copy-and-paste feature\u2014it\u2019s a total disaster. It\u2019s inconsistent across apps, hard to figure out, and doesn\u2019t work well. Apple took its sweet time adding that feature to the iPhone, but the company did it right, and did it consistently across the platform. It\u2019s an object lesson in how the iPhone continues to be superior to Android when it comes to usability.\nOr consider Android\u2019s approach to media playback, which is deeply inferior to the iPhone\u2019s. Of course, Apple has been focused on media playback for a long time, thanks to the success of the iPod, but I had assumed good media playback would be a standard feature for a phone today. Not so. The Android music player is functional but weak, with a crude Now Playing screen and a frustrating hierarchical list view that sometimes makes it hard to realize that you\u2019ve succeeded in opening an album\u2019s track listing. Video playback is completely separate in the Gallery app, the same place you view your photos. I consider media playback, particularly music, to be one of a smartphone\u2019s most important features\u2014and Android\u2019s got some serious catching up to do in this area.\nAs for regular people who just want a phone that works, runs apps, and is easy to use, there\u2019s no question. I would not inflict Android Market, with its rows of alpha-quality apps requiring rooted systems and specific hardware configurations, on any average consumer. Not my mom, not my wife, not my friend the PR guy, and not even me. Because as much as I\u2019m capable of toying with technology, I\u2019d rather the technology just work. The iPhone works.\nWhere Apple goes from here\nStill, there are several area where the iPhone does need to improve in order to match or surpass the Nexus One. The Nexus One\u2019s high-resolution screen is awfully nice. The Nexus One's home screen and widgets shows that it's time for a rethink of the iPhone\u2019s home screen. Adding more support for backgrounding and multitasking is vital\u2026 but not in a way that requires you to install a third-party app to shut down processes. And I still want that combined e-mail inbox.\nWhat Apple needs to learn from the Nexus One is that someone else out there is playing the same game Apple is\u2014and while Android\u2019s still behind, it\u2019s closing fast. Even if I never buy a Nexus One, I\u2019m happy that it exists\u2026 especially if it ensures that Apple doesn\u2019t get complacent when it comes to iPhone hardware and software development.\n[Jason Snell is Macworld's Editorial Director.]\nSee more like this:\n"}], [{"score": 883.3001, "uuid": "6068ae16-8be2-5e48-bb33-d8d8bec04119", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0406wb-69-18618", "target_hostname": "www.ciozone.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ciozone.com/index.php/Cloud-Computing/Apple-s-Cloud-is-Different-from-Googles.html", "page_rank": 1.1938378e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> Cloud is Different from Googles", "snippet": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> iCloud is more asset based than processing based. iCloud is focused less on full-scale \u201ccloud computing\u201d (moving the performance of the apps themselves to the web) than on synching a number of devices with one\u2019s personal data files \u2014 <em>which</em> resides in <em>Apple\u2019s</em> data center.", "explanation": null, "document": "So can we say that Cloud Computing will replace the ERPs in near future?\nApple's Cloud is Different from Googles\nShare This -\nBy Vincent Capasso\nWhy? Different device product lines lead to differentiation of the online architectures available to both companies. While Google\u00a0has traditionally been a services based company they more recently have made the transition to devices with the Android based phones\u00a0and the newly released Chrome OS based netbooks.\nDifferent architectures do not necessarily mean one vendor solution is better than the other either, but consumers always\u00a0welcome the available options and the ability to make the choice ( even if it based on herd conformity mentality ) between\u00a0two popular products.\nLets take a look at the major annoucements coming from Apple recently. \"We're going to talk about three things today,\" \u00a0Steve Jobs said at the beginning his keynote. Then he and his colleagues proceeded to talk about many new features and services made possible by their new cloud initiatives as well as their OS upgrades.\nWhite Papers\nLos Angeles Trade Technical College\nThere were a few major themes announced by Apple:\n1) A cord-cutting of sorts that freed iPad, iPhone and iPod touch users from the requirement to own a Mac or PC. This is a fundamental shift\u00a0in their strategy to date. Specifically, the iOS 5 announcement, the system upgrade for iPad, iPhone and the iPod Touch. The features Apple unveiled gives these devices\u00a0capabilities previously available only on PCs. With iOS 5, you can edit photos, create mores \u00a0complex mail documents, etc.\nThis accelerates the trend of releasing powerful apps on the iPad.\u00a0So while the Mac is morphing into the iPad, the iPad is stepping up to perform tasks that were at one time reserved for\u00a0your Mac or PC.\n2) The demotion of the Mac from the center of the user's computing universe to just another Apple product. \u00a0The release of Lion, with this latest version of OS X, the Macintosh is adopting more traits of its iOS cousins.\u00a0Lion supports more multitouch gestures. Lion has the App Store built in, etc. This move brings the look and feel of\u00a0all Apple interfaces closer together and closer to their historical norm. This was an important early feature of Apple Applications, all of the Apps had the same look and feel, there was no real need to \"learn\" a new interface with every application as you often had to do on a MS Windows application ( eg. Wordperfect and MS Word ).\n3) Lastly, a new system of file storage that eliminates the need to know where files are stored - either locally or in the cloud.\nThe Apple approach to cloud computing very different from, and less radical than Google's.\u00a0Apple has taken up the position that the \u00a0cloud is really just the center of activity and a data store for all end user Apple assets.\nGoogle's Chrome OS treats the cloud as the computer itself, more like the thin client network computer envisioned by Larry Ellision from\u00a0Oracle back in the early 1990s. In the Google cloud there is seemless activity between front end Apps like Google Docs, and the Chrome based browser\u00a0interface to the data.\nApple's iCloud is more asset based than processing based. iCloud is focused less on full-scale \u201ccloud computing\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(moving the performance of the apps themselves to the web) than on synching a number of devices with one\u2019s\u00a0personal data files \u2014 which resides in Apple\u2019s data center. The Apple strategy is also less risky then Google because it is not as dependent on ubiquitious bandwidth demands brought on by server side processing of Chrome OS.\nApple, Jobs claimed, would achieve success in this model where others have failed.\u00a0Why will Apple triumph? Because, said Mr. Jobs, \u201cit just works.\u201d\nLets hope so, there is a lot riding on it.\n"}, {"score": 878.96674, "uuid": "e0e78251-c9a3-560b-8a19-253d90f5f063", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-72-12021", "target_hostname": "www.pcworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/253200/googles_project_glass_teases_augmented_reality_glasses.html", "page_rank": 8.389522e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Google&#x27;s</em> &#x27;Project Glass&#x27; Teases Augmented Reality Glasses | PCWorld", "snippet": ", and collaboration. * Musically Inclined Jelly Probably Sings <em>Better</em> Than You Do * <em>Google&#x27;s</em> Project Glass Eyewear: Next Big Google Flop <em>or</em> Hit?", "explanation": null, "document": "By Jared Newman , PCWorld Apr 4, 2012 9:55 AM\nGoogle has taken the wraps off its long-rumored augmented reality glasses project, officially dubbed \"Project Glass.\"\nA concept video, titled \" One day... ,\" shows how Google's glasses might work. In the video, the user performs tasks commonly handled by smartphones, such as scheduling meetings, taking pictures, checking the weather, getting directions, and placing a video call. The information simply hovers in the user's field of view, and the interface is controlled by voice or other inputs.\nGoogle says it is gathering feedback from users on Project Glass, according to a post on Google+ by Babak Parviz, Steve Lee and Sebastian Thrun. The post contains a few \"design photos\" of people wearing augmented reality glasses. These glasses have a small second screen--presumably for the video output--above one of the lenses, with an extra thick arm that extends back to the ear.\n\"We\u2019re sharing this information now because we want to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input,\" they wrote. \"So we took a few design photos to show what this technology could look like and created a video to demonstrate what it might enable you to do.\"\nThis is the first time Google has publicly acknowledged its augmented reality glasses project.

By the time Mountain Lion ships sometime next summer, Apple says it will have lots of new features , some transported from its iOS environment of the iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch world. This column will examine just one of the new features, one that, while good, has not yet included all the functions of its iOS prototype.\nBACKGROUND: Apple counts down to 25 billion apps\nApple iOS performs a validity check on each application before the app runs. The check verifies that the application came from a trusted source and has not been modified. In the case of iOS, the trusted source must be the Apple iOS App Store. This check makes it much harder for the iOS device to be corrupted by a rogue application introduced by a computer virus. But it also locks the iOS device to only get new or updated applications from the Apple-run store. In this way, Apple controls what you, the titular owner of an iOS device, are permitted to run. With a collection of a half million applications in the App Store, this control over the user has been more of a theoretical than a practical problem.\nApple is now adding a poor man's version of this validity check to OS X in the form of Gatekeeper . Gatekeeper does the same validity check as the iOS system but only does it when an app is first installed, and then only if the application is downloaded over the Internet. As described, Gatekeeper will be able to be run in three modes. The default mode will permit applications to be installed from the OS X App Store (not to be confused with the iOS App Store) and from developers who have registered with Apple as long as the applications have not been modified since they were created. Gatekeeper will also be able to be run in a stricter mode where it will only permit applications from the OS X App Store to be installed or an open mode in which applications are not checked before installation. The last mode is equivalent to the way OS X currently operates -- you can install applications from anyone, including applications from developers that Apple has never heard of.\n[RELATED: Mountain Lion: Hands on With Gatekeeper ]\nThe reaction to Apple's announcement has been decidedly mixed. On the security side, some pundits seem to be from the branch of computer security that feels security is worthless unless it is perfect. These pundits dismiss Gatekeeper as almost worse than worthless because it only does the validity check when the software is installed. Checking only at the time of installation will not discover software that gets modified after installation and does not deal with the case where an application's bad behavior is only discovered later. Performing the validity check every time the application is run will catch modified applications and, because Apple can distribute a list of bad software developers in real time, it can block applications newly discovered to be bad.\nI think the security provided by Gatekeeper is worthwhile but do hope that Apple changes to a check-before-running from the current check-when-installing operation before Mountain Lion is distributed.\nThe other area that some pundits have focused on is the one of lock-in. They are worried that this is the next step in a progression that would wind up with OS X being as closed as iOS. While there is no current reason to think that is in Apple's plans, it does bear watching.\nBy the way, it turns out that Apple included Gatekeeper in Lion -- just use the terminal command \"sudo spctl --enable\" to turn it on, and \"sudo spctl --disable\" to turn it off.\nGatekeeper is only a step along the path to better OS X security, but a useful one, as long as it is not also a step along a path to an Apple-knows-best future.\nDisclaimer: I know of no one at Harvard who would complain about improved security, but I know of no university opinion on the topic. So the above is my own review.\nRead more about wide area network in Network World's Wide Area Network section.\nFor more information about enterprise networking, go to NetworkWorld .

But what\u2019s delighted users is that once you get to understand its limitations this thing works really well. The range of ways that you can ask questions and still be understood is impressive and the types of information it provides are genuinely useful.\nFor some things it makes much more sense to use voice commands\nThe more you use Siri the more you realise that this is the best way to do certain tasks. Much like the touch-screen interface that Apple introduced to smartphones and tablets, this feels like the user interface you\u2019ve been waiting for all along. Mundane but essential tasks like setting an alarm, scheduling an appointment or texting a friend already seems an unnecessary hassle using anything but voice activation.\nYou learn together\nAs you discover the boundaries of what Siri can and can\u2019t do, it starts to learn more about you. For example, I asked it yesterday to phone my mother. Siri asked me who my mother was. Now it knows, I can refer to my mother for relevant commands and it knows what I mean.\nLikewise it learns to understand your voice patterns and will respond to contextual commands. This mutual learning process creates a bond between the user and the interface that makes it more personal.\nIt\u2019s fun\nApple likes to delight its users and Siri is packed with personality. The UK version comes across as an English butler with a warm and often witty character.\nOkay it\u2019s the 21st century version of the pathetic fallacy , but the programmers of Siri have clearly put lots of effort into ensuring that you feel something for this technology \u2013 from its constant use of your first name to the witty replies to more personal questions (the Tumblr blog Shit That Siri Says lists some of the most amusing answers). It\u2019s deft touches like this that help you to fall in love with it .\nIt\u2019s disruptive\nFor some search-orientated tasks, Siri performs better than Google. Not because you can search with voice commands \u2013 you can already do that via the Google app on iPhone and a lot more besides on Android phones. Rather it\u2019s because of the results themselves.\nA Google search offers you a results page that often requires further action (which link do I click on?), of variable quality (web spam is increasing) and surrounded by ads. Compare this to Siri where some results are delivered straight into your operating system from Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia.\nWith Siri we can see the potential for a better search system than Google\u2019s. Naturally Google could emulate this functionality themselves, but the point is not that it\u2019s beyond their capabilities (they have much of the technology already) but that it disrupts their business model.\nOm Malik makes this point really well in the latest episode of This Week in Tech . As long as Google\u2019s business is based on delivering text-based advertising around web and mobile searches, it\u2019s not in the company\u2019s interests to build Siri-like functionality. It\u2019s these kind of disruptions that change the landscape in technology.\nLeave a Comment\n"}, {"score": 848.67975, "uuid": "6bc1833d-9406-5368-8f5d-bf26bac60226", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-76-06566", "target_hostname": "gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com", "target_uri": "http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/googles-new-privacy-policy-what-to-do/?scp=2&sq=google%2527s+new+data-sharing&st=cse", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Google&#x27;s</em> New Privacy Policy: What to Do - NYTimes.com", "snippet": "Some people do not like this, because <em>Google\u2019s</em> search engine is used for lots of activities, some of them personal, financial <em>or</em> medical.

If you have a Google Account, your activity on one Google property is available to other Google properties.\nSome people do not like this, because Google\u2019s search engine is used for lots of activities, some of them personal, financial or medical.\nIt is one thing to search for information about, say, a particular ointment. It may be jarring, however, to go to YouTube later and see that it has suggested toe fungus videos.\nIf you would rather not have all of your Google-related activity sloshing around the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d empire, remedies are available. Some are simple, others laborious:\n\u00b6 You can delete your search history and prevent Google from using it for advertising purposes in the future.\nTo do this, sign in to your Google Account and go to google.com/history.\nYou will see two buttons: \u201cPause\u201d and \u201cRemove All Web History.\u201d If you click on \u201cRemove all Web History,\u201d you have not only deleted what you have looked up in the past, you have also turned off any tracking of your search history by Google in the future.\n\u00b6 If you really want to keep your activity on various Google sites segregated from one another, you could set up a separate user account for each service \u2014 one for Gmail, one for YouTube and so on.\nThe problem is that you will need a different e-mail address for each account, and managing all of them could be annoying, particularly if you log into one Google service and then click on a link to another without first having logged out and re-entered under a different account. (Even describing that procedure was time-consuming; imagine having to do it all the time.)\n\u00b6 If you do not want Google to use your search history to help determine what ads the company shows you, you can opt out by going to google.com/ads/preferences .\nDoing so, however, affects only the computer you are using. You must perform the opt-out procedure on every other computer you use.\nThis will not affect how Google sites share your activity with one another, nor will it reduce the number of advertisements you see.\nBut it will make those ads less relevant \u2014 or less creepy \u2014 depending on your feelings about the issue.\n"}], [{"score": 785.66565, "uuid": "51ab7630-5fa9-5418-b0dc-76a1fa603290", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-75-13993", "target_hostname": "www.pcworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/250405/apples_gatekeeper_a_low_cost_for_partial_security.html", "page_rank": 1.3110977e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> Gatekeeper: A Low Cost for Partial Security | PCWorld", "snippet": "Gatekeeper will also be able to be run in a stricter mode where it will only permit applications from the OS X App Store to be installed <em>or</em> an open mode in <em>which</em> applications are not checked before installation.", "explanation": null, "document": "By Scott Bradner , NetworkWorld\nOut of the blue, Apple just announced Mountain Lion , the next generation of its OS X operating system. By the time Mountain Lion ships sometime next summer, Apple says it will have lots of new features , some transported from its iOS environment of the iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch world. This column will examine just one of the new features, one that, while good, has not yet included all the functions of its iOS prototype.\nBACKGROUND: Apple counts down to 25 billion apps\nApple iOS performs a validity check on each application before the app runs. The check verifies that the application came from a trusted source and has not been modified. In the case of iOS, the trusted source must be the Apple iOS App Store. This check makes it much harder for the iOS device to be corrupted by a rogue application introduced by a computer virus. But it also locks the iOS device to only get new or updated applications from the Apple-run store. In this way, Apple controls what you, the titular owner of an iOS device, are permitted to run. With a collection of a half million applications in the App Store, this control over the user has been more of a theoretical than a practical problem.\nApple is now adding a poor man's version of this validity check to OS X in the form of Gatekeeper . Gatekeeper does the same validity check as the iOS system but only does it when an app is first installed, and then only if the application is downloaded over the Internet. As described, Gatekeeper will be able to be run in three modes. The default mode will permit applications to be installed from the OS X App Store (not to be confused with the iOS App Store) and from developers who have registered with Apple as long as the applications have not been modified since they were created. Gatekeeper will also be able to be run in a stricter mode where it will only permit applications from the OS X App Store to be installed or an open mode in which applications are not checked before installation. The last mode is equivalent to the way OS X currently operates -- you can install applications from anyone, including applications from developers that Apple has never heard of.\n[RELATED: Mountain Lion: Hands on With Gatekeeper ]\nThe reaction to Apple's announcement has been decidedly mixed. On the security side, some pundits seem to be from the branch of computer security that feels security is worthless unless it is perfect. These pundits dismiss Gatekeeper as almost worse than worthless because it only does the validity check when the software is installed. Checking only at the time of installation will not discover software that gets modified after installation and does not deal with the case where an application's bad behavior is only discovered later. Performing the validity check every time the application is run will catch modified applications and, because Apple can distribute a list of bad software developers in real time, it can block applications newly discovered to be bad.\nI think the security provided by Gatekeeper is worthwhile but do hope that Apple changes to a check-before-running from the current check-when-installing operation before Mountain Lion is distributed.\nThe other area that some pundits have focused on is the one of lock-in. They are worried that this is the next step in a progression that would wind up with OS X being as closed as iOS. While there is no current reason to think that is in Apple's plans, it does bear watching.\nBy the way, it turns out that Apple included Gatekeeper in Lion -- just use the terminal command \"sudo spctl --enable\" to turn it on, and \"sudo spctl --disable\" to turn it off.\nGatekeeper is only a step along the path to better OS X security, but a useful one, as long as it is not also a step along a path to an Apple-knows-best future.\nDisclaimer: I know of no one at Harvard who would complain about improved security, but I know of no university opinion on the topic.

A company that built an empire through open partnerships has decided to go medieval on its closest allies,\u00a0asserting strict control over the hardware and software on mobile devices that use its operating systems. Note to Ballmer: That turtleneck doesn\u2019t fit you.\nThis week, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft is actively trying to limit the number of vendors a chipmaker can partner with to create Windows 8 devices, which will result in fewer Windows 8 tablets overall. Imagine Dell being the only company allowed to make Windows 8 tablets with Intel processors in them.\nThis draconian strategy started with the launch of Windows Phone 7 last year. Vendors who want to manufacture Windows Phone 7 handsets must agree to a harsh set of restrictions; they can only use a certain screen, processor, and other key hardware components. \u00a0They can\u2019t modify the look and feel of Windows Phone 7 to make it look distinctive for their users; the best they can do is throw on a few applications and use a few of the tiles on the home screen.\nJust as Apple only lets iOS developers sell their apps through the App Store, WP7 developers can only sell their applications through Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7 Marketplace. There\u2019s no way for users to side-load apps or for anyone to start an alternative market. Apps are even severely restricted in what they can do. Eight months after the WP7 launch, there\u2019s still no way to build a screen shot app, because one app cannot run in tandem with another.\nThis week at Computex, Acer CEO J.T. Wang said that Microsoft \u201cis really controlling the whole thing\u201d and that both he and his competitors feel the restrictions are \u201cvery troublesome.\u201d Based on what we\u2019re hearing, I can\u2019t blame him. With Android, Acer was able to produce the truly unique Acer Iconia Smart , which has compelling software and a higher res screen than the competition. With Microsoft\u2019s mobile OS, Wang\u2019s products look and act just like his competitors\u2019.\nWhile a partner- and developer-unfriendly lockdown may work well for Apple, it\u2019s not a model that Microsoft should follow. When trying to forge a new mobile strategy, Microsoft should learn from its own successful history of flexibility and collaboration with partners rather than trying to pick up a big stick and keep everyone in line. And that\u2019s exactly what seems to be happening with Windows 8.\nWindows became the world\u2019s leading operating system precisely because it is so flexible. For decades, vendors have been free to use any hardware they want to build Windows PCs, and they\u2019ve been allowed to customize the Windows software pre-load to their hearts\u2019 content. Developers have been able to program for Windows in dozens of different programming languages and distribute applications through literally millions of outlets, from download engines to retail stores.\nWith Android, Google is actually following the Windows model for success: build a strong OS and then let your partners innovate and make it their own. When HTC wants to develop the first LTE phone or the first Android tablet with pen input, CEO Peter Chou doesn\u2019t need to call Google\u2019s Andy Rubin and beg for a papal exemption. But if Chou wants to adopt these features on a Windows Phone 7 handset, he\u2019ll have to wait until Microsoft issues an edict from on high, telling his competitors that LTE is now part of the standard hardware build they all must use.\nSome pundits have dinged Google for allowing its partners the freedom to try new things. They foolishly focus on subtle differences in the user experience from one phone to another, such as the UI enhancements that HTC has put into its Sense software that are different than those you\u2019ll find in Motorola\u2019s Motoblur overlay. But what they call \u201cfragmentation\u201d is really innovation.\u00a0Without the freedom to push the envelope and make their products standout, there\u2019s little incentive for vendors to put a lot of eggs in Microsoft\u2019s basket.\nMicrosoft says that it is locking things down to provide a consistent experience for users , but in the end, the company is trying to play by Apple\u2019s rules rather than its own. Ballmer and company have taken the wrong message from Apple\u2019s success. Locking down its products is not the key to Apple\u2019s success. The iPad and iPhone continue to win because they are well made and marketed.\nMicrosoft won\u2019t succeed by picking up the big stick and trying to go it alone. To be a leading player in the mobile space, Ballmer and his charges needs to focus on the company\u2019s core strength in bringing developers and vendors together to build the best ecosystem, not pushing them away with high-handed edicts.\n"}, {"score": 766.696, "uuid": "307c3125-5403-5039-87b8-55067f63f87e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-95-03456", "target_hostname": "www.techmeme.com", "target_uri": "http://www.techmeme.com/120222/p25", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Techmeme: <em>Google&#x27;s</em> new \u201cbats**t crazy\u201d UX (Dcurtis&#x2F;Dustin Curtis)", "snippet": "The company expects the new ads to <em>perform</em> 40 to 8o percent <em>better</em> than its previous product. \u2014 As the owner of a social creative agency \u2026 More: Betabeat, AdAge, Fast Company, MarketingVox News &amp; Trends, Friending Facebook Blog, Telegraph, Techie Buzz, Marketing Pilgrim, The New Persuaders, bizjournals", "explanation": null, "document": "Alexia Tsotsis / TechCrunch :\nNow You Need Quora Credits To Ask Questions, But Can Also Use Them To Promote Content \u2014\u00a0 Quora has fiddled around with its Credits system and unveiled some new features today, making two very notable changes.\u00a0 The first one is the elimination of the original \u201cPay to show to Topics\u201d \u2026\nChristian Zibreg / 9to5Mac :\nQualcomm just announced the chip that would be a one-stop shop for Apple's mobile needs \u2014\u00a0 Chipmaker Qualcomm today took the wraps off a new piece of silicon\u2014a fifth iteration of its Gobi reference platform.\u00a0 It packs comprehensive support for TD-SCDMA, TD-LTE, LTE on FDD and TDD networks worldwide and embedded GPS capability.\n"}, {"score": 760.45544, "uuid": "f2295243-fa7f-5b3e-9537-ff583cf71931", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-42-02961", "target_hostname": "www.brighthand.com", "target_uri": "http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=18736&news=apple+iphone+5+display+release+date", "page_rank": 1.1792113e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> iPhone 5 Could Sport a 4.6-inch Display", "snippet": "The iPhone 4 is <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> thinnest smartphone yet, but offers a much <em>better</em> screen, faster processor, video calling, and many other enhancements.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u00bb News \u00bb Apple's iPhone 5 Could Sport a 4.6-inch Display\nApple's iPhone 5 Could Sport a 4.6-inch Display\nTweet\nAccording to an unnamed industry source, Apple is looking to use a 4.6-inch display on the next generation iPhone.

Rather than attack Adobe, they should be trying to work together to create a Flash release that will offer the MILLIONS of Flash users the same rich content on their Apple mobile devices that they would get on their PC or MAC. Instead of moving technology forward, you have taken us backward into an internet without the rich content of Adobe Flash. Very, very Microsoft-ish.\nYou\nApril 30th, 2010 1:48 pm ET\nBut how long will it take the internet to switch to HTML5? In tech history, it's been the one thing that people want which makes the difference. In gaming, it's happened twice. The Sega Dreamcast was revolutionary, and was the first console to go online, but it didn't have the capability to play DVDs, which Sony capitalized on when they created the PlayStation 2, and made Sega bust out of the market. In a similar vein, Nintendo's GameCube was the only console of its generation not to have online capabilities, leading users to buy more PlayStation 2s and XBoxes. Flash is what people want now. Knowing Apple's tendency to come out with newer models that have better features and making older models obsolete, they might as well incorporate Flash now, and then come out with a \"new\" model that's HTML5 capable, so Apple fans can gobble it up. Steve's making a colossal mistake in not using Flash.\nAnd I've been a Mac user all my life.

I also own a iMac and an iPhone. Flash does some pretty decent work but it does it only on larger machines (PC types). When it comes to smart phones, I know first hand that Flash is a resource hog and it is very clear that product was not meant for those devices. Steve Job wrote that we can make use of HTML5, CSS, Javascript and H.264 to achieve great results: This is not fiction! This is fact. I see it everyday in my line of work. I use my phone extensively and I don't miss Flash for a minute!

I'm really sick of getting the blank box where a flash animation was suppose to be inserted. Those who do not think flash needs to be supported do not surf the web.\nNot having Flash is the single biggest drawback with the iPhone. The browsing experience is lacking. For example, I tried booking a few hotel rooms through my iPhone for vacation and could not do it because the website's reservation system was using flash.

Apple is the least \"open\" player in the tech world...right along side Microsoft. This is the only reason why Jobs is fighting Flash on the iPhone. Apple controls all Apps and gets a cut of the profit via iTunes. If Flash was possible on the iPhone (There is someone working on this independently via a JS library by the way)...Apple would have a hard time controlling Ad revenue delivered via Flash...or even Games and other apps.

I lived without it on my Windows Mobile phone. What would solve the problem is if web sites gave users the option of the player they choose to embed in their sites that are serving up H.264 video streams. I would venture to guess that most users are disappointed they can\u2019t get [video] from sites such as youtube.com or their favorite social networking and/or adult sites, and not really too concerned about a Flash application.\nNote: I\u2019m aware the iPhone does youtube videos. It is not done using Flash. It is not doing it through the user interface desktop users are accustomed to. Youtube.com encodes video using H.264 and uses the Flash player in its web pages.

Pages which are associated with those queries may be boosted in search rankings over pages that aren\u2019t.\nRelated Hot Topics \u2013 When \u201csimilar\u201d queries become hot and increase in the amount of search results for those queries happens, pages associated with a query that might be similar to that query might be boosted in search results.\nConstant Queries with Consistently Changing Results \u2013 Some queries remain constant in the amount of searches for them, but the results for those queries tend to change over time, such as a query for \u201cworld series champion.\u201d How the results for these queries change may be monitored and used to rank pages accordingly.\nFreshness of Documents \u2013 How stale or fresh a document is might be can be based upon factors such as a document\u2019s creation date, growth of anchor text, levels of traffic, changes to content, growth or decrease in links to and from the pages, and other factors. For some queries, recent documents may be considered very important. For example, if a search is for a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, the most recent version might be much more desirable than an older one.\nGoogle might learn which queries recent changes are most important by analyzing which documents in search results tend to be selected by users, and by considering how often users favor a more recent document that is ranked lower than an older document in the search results. If a page tends to be included in results for mostly topical queries such as \u201cWorld Series Champions rather than more specific queries, such as the name of a team that recently won the world series, then this by itself might be used to lower the ranking for a page that appears to be stale.\nStaleness of Documents \u2013 For some queries, older pages might be considered better choices than newer ones, and the decisions in those cases might be based upon how often those older pages are selected in search results over newer documents. If searchers tend to select a lower ranked relatively stale document for a given query over a higher ranked, relatively recent document, the stale page might be adjusted to rank higher.\nOverly Broad Pages If a page tends to rank fairly well for a range of \u201cdiscordant\u201d queries, that might be a signal that the page is a \u201cweb spam page.\u201d\nNewly Filed Continuation Patent Applications\nThe claims sections of the patent applications from last week go into a little more detail on a number of those factors and add to them. These contination patent applications were all filed on September 26, 2011 and published on January 19, 2012.\nTrends Related to Topics and Search Terms\nDocument Scoring Based on Query Analysis (US Patent Application 20120016889)\nThis contination patent application focuses upon analyzing trends related to search queries to determine groups of topics and search terms that increasingly appear in queries over time, and the frequency with which they appear. Pages that appear within those topics that do include the terms or similar terms that are increasingly being searched for might be boosted in results while pages within those topics that don\u2019t include those terms might not.\nWhat this patent application doesn\u2019t tell us is how some search terms might be considered related or similar to others that are trending upward in popularity.\nAccess Times to Determine Freshness and Staleness\nDocument Scoring Based on Query Analysis (US Patent Application 20120016888)\nHow much time to visitors access specific pages in search results for particular documents? That can be another factor that might be considered when reranking results, in combination with looking at how frequently those pages are selected in search results for a particular query.\nIf the amount of time that people spend looking at a particular page decreases from one specific time period to another, that might be an indication that the page is stale, and the ranking of that page might be lowered.\nIf the amount of time people look at specific page increases from a specific time period to another, that might indicate that the document is fresh, and its ranking score might be adjusted upwards.\nRelevance of those documents would still play a strong role in how they are ranked.\nFrequency of Selection\nDocument Scoring Based on Query Analysis (US Patent Application 20120016874)\nThis patent application looks at the frequency of selection of specific pages for specific queries. How frequently a certain page is selected in search results over one period of time might be compared to how frequently that page might be selected in search results over a later period. If the page is selected less, it might be lowered in search results. If it is selected more frequently, it might be increased in rankings.\nWhen Staleness Might be Preferred\nDocument Scoring Based on Query Analysis (US Patent Application 20120016871)\nFor some queries, searchers seem to prefer older results that might be perceived as \u201cstale\u201d pursuant to an analysis of user trends regarding that query. Regardless of that perception, if searchers tend to bypass higher ranking fresh looking results and prefer clicking on older documents, then the search engine might rank older documents higher than fresher ones, even if the older documents don\u2019t rank as well from a relevance perspective.\nSpam Determination Based Upon Breadth of Rankings, and Authority\nDocument Scoring Based on Query Analysis (US Patent Application 20120016870)\nWhen a page ranks highly for a wide range of different search queries, then that might be a sign that it is spam, and its rankings may be negatively adjusted.\nThis patent application provides an exception, which is whether or not that page might be considered an \u201cauthoritative document.\u201d An authoritative document might be (1) a government document, (2) a document associated with a web directory, or (3) a document that has maintained at least a threshold rank over time. The historical data patent and the original query analysis patent did mention how Google might make some exceptions for authoritative documents in some parts of the description for those patents related to link based criteria and aspects of ranking history that might be analyzed, it wasn\u2019t mentioned in the query-based factors or in the actual claims of those patents.\nTakeaways\nIf you read through the descriptions of these new patent applications, those descriptions cover a much wider range of topics than the claims associated with them, and are very similar to the descriptions in the Historical Data patent.\nThere are a lot of interesting things in the descriptions, like the idea that if a page rises too quickly in search rankings over time that it might be demoted somewhat in those rankings. But the important part of these patent applications are the claims sections, which focus much more narrowly on specific aspects of query-based analysis of search results and pages.\nThe claims in this group of newly published patent applications discuss how how some topics might quickly become popular, and how pages in search results for popular search terms (or similar search terms) within those topics might be boosted in search results for those topics.\nThey tell us that pages that are being accessed longer and selected more frequently for specific queries from one time period to another might be boosted in results as well. A couple of the other patent applications include the terms freshness and staleness related to increasing frequencies of access time and selections of specific pages, and tell us that in some cases newer and fresher pages might seem to be preferred by searchers, and in other cases older and staler pages might be better results, and either type of result may also be boosted as appropriate.\nWe\u2019re also told that pages that rank too well for too many queries might be considered web spam unless they are determined to be \u201cauthoritative\u201d pages, or government pages, web directories, or pages that have maintained high rankings over a period of time. That \u201cauthoritative\u201d designation is one of the things that stands out for me with these patents.\nOf course, these are only patents and patent applications, and it\u2019s possible that Google might be doing something somewhat different than what is described within the claims of these documents. But it\u2019s worth spending some time thinking about how Google might be analyzing search results for queries performed at their search engine, and how it might influence what searchers see when they perform a search.\n"}, {"score": 722.68915, "uuid": "f494dd3c-3e6b-5f78-a915-f6f3c6c13ad2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900tw-37-17907", "target_hostname": "www.macworld.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/news/?newsid=3353360&pagtype=allchandate", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "New version of Flashback eludes <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> XProtect - Mac software - Macworld", "snippet": "XProtect No password required for new variant <em>which</em> bypasses <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> detection tools Karen Haslam &lt;a A new variant of the Flashback Trojan has been discovered by Intego that is able install itself without a password and elude <em>Apple\u2019s</em> XProtect anti-malware tool.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tue, 24 Apr 2012 New version of Flashback eludes Apple's XProtect\nNo password required for new variant which bypasses Apple's detection tools\nKaren Haslam\nA new variant of the Flashback Trojan has been discovered by Intego that is able install itself without a password and elude Apple\u2019s XProtect anti-malware tool.\nIntego researcher Lysa Myers told Security Watch: \"It's an entirely silent install now. We've seen silent installs on OS X before, but this is the first time we've seen something to this extent.\"\n\"It's just making better use of the Java vulnerability ,\" she told Security Watch.\nThis new version, labelled Flashback.S, is still exploiting the same Java vulnerability but has been tweeked to get around Apple\u2019s XProtect, according to Sophos\u2019s Chester Wisniewski.\nXProtect relies on exact fingerprints of the malware. Security Watch highlights that last year when Apple updated its signature in XProtect, malware writers simply tweaked Mac Defender to bypass it.\nThe report also criticises Apple for only protecting Lion and Snow Leopard users. Other Mac users are just told to disable Java.\nFlashback.S drops two files in the user's home folder at the following locations:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.java.update.plist\n~/.jupdate\nOnce it has installed it deletes cached Java files to avoid detection or sample recovery, according to Intego.\nSophos claims that the difference between Flashback.S and the previous variant is so minor that Sophos and other Mac anti-virus products will still detect it.\nThe Flashback.G variant was discovered by Intego in February. It can inject code into web browsers and other applications that connect to the Internet, often causing them to crash. It attempts to sniff out usernames and passwords that you enter into many popular sites (like banking sites, Google, PayPal, and others), presumably so that the malfeasants behind the software can exploit that information in other nefarious ways.\nThat Flashback variant discovered two months ago asked for administrative privileges, but did not require them.\nContrary to reports by several security companies, the Flashback botnet is not shrinking , the Russian antivirus firm that first reported the massive infection three weeks ago claimed today.\u00a0Dr. Web, which earlier this month was the first to report the largest-ever successful malware attack against Apple's OS X, said on Friday that the pool of Flashback-infected Macs still hovers around the 650,000 mark, and that infections are continuing.\n"}, {"score": 714.2431, "uuid": "593eafa7-1899-57d5-be56-ccc6bee012bd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1809wb-76-28796", "target_hostname": "www.strategicsourceror.com", "target_uri": "http://www.strategicsourceror.com/2010/09/apple-pricing-strategy-keeps-consumers.html", "page_rank": 1.2350748e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "The Strategic Sourceror: <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> pricing strategy keeps consumers spending", "snippet": "So why does everybody still spring for <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> products, even though they&#x27;re much more expensive than competitors&#x27; offerings?", "explanation": null, "document": "Apple's pricing strategy keeps consumers spending more\nStrategic Sourceror on\nThursday, September 2, 2010\nApple offers a variety of products - iPhones, iPads, iPods, not to mention Macintosh computers - that have been copied by other technology companies, often for hundreds of dollars less.

It is based upon a pool of video compression and related technology patents contributed by various companies in exchange for \"Fair, Reasonable and Nondiscriminatory\" licensing fees. Mozilla, Opera and other free and open source advocates opposed the use of any technology that might require licensing fees to produce or distribute web content.\nCommercial hardware developers, led by Apple and Nokia, opposed any shift toward Ogg Theora in H.264, noting that H.264 was far ahead of the older Ogg Theora video technology in technical sophistication, and that hardware decoding was already well established in place to accelerate H.264, particularly in mobile devices.\nReplacing H.264 with Ogg Theora to placate Mozilla and Opera's insistence upon cost-free video encoding for the web would have broken the ability of millions of smartphones, iPods, netbooks and other mobile devices to efficiently play back video. Additionally, Google noted at the time that Ogg Theora was not powerful enough to serve the billions of video streams it was delivering via its YouTube service.\nThe Ogg Theora war on H.264 ended when HTML5 working group members agreed that rather than defining Ogg Theora or H.264 or anything else as the \"baseline\" codec for video served via the HTML5 video tag, the decision should be left to the market and to the votes of web users and Internet broadcasters to decide.\nThis decision paralleled how HTML has always worked with every other type of media file; there is no baseline graphic or audio format, for example; instead, web publishers decide for themselves whether to use GIF, JPEG, or PNG graphics formats and whether to use MP3, AAC, or raw WAV audio files. Modern browsers support them all.\nThe WebM war on H.264\nAt the end of 2010, the war on H.264 was reignited, this time by Google. After having converted its massive library of YouTube videos to H.264 in a partnership with Apple to shift web videos from the constraints of Adobe Flash and make open video viewable on devices that lacked the ability to run Flash, Google decided to buy On2's VP8 (a newer generation of the VP3 codec Ogg Theora was based upon) and release it as a \"free\" codec named WebM.\nBecause WebM was technically capable of serving YouTube videos, Google now hoped to join Mozilla and Opera in turning back support for H.264 video on the web and replacing the H.264 codec with a free alternative it claimed to be unencumbered by patent claims.\nThis strategy shared some similarity to Apple's war on Adobe Flash using the free and open HTML5, which Apple successfully pursued over the five years following the release of the original iPhone.\nHowever, WebM was \"unencumbered\" by patents only in the sense that Google didn't plan to charge royalties for its use itself. It was still based on technologies that the MPEG Licensing Authority claimed to own, making it no less \"encumbered\" than H.264. Microsoft had earlier learned the same lesson when its own Windows Media Video (aka VC-1) codec was found to be infringing a variety of technologies already patented by MPEG members who had pooled their expertise to create H.264.\nCreating an illegitimate, infringing copy of H.264 is no more legally legitimate than simply implementing H.264 and failing to pay licensing fees. However, Google was emboldened by having done essentially the same thing to JavaME in order to create Android, and having suffered no consequences for it. So it began a campaign to derail the adoption of H.264 in HTML5 and aggressively push WebM as its substitute at the beginning of 2011.\nA year later, Google's WebM hasn't gained any more traction than Google Wave, Google Buzz, Google TV or Android 3.0 Honeycomb tablets. In part, this is because H.264 is the only way to serve videos to Apple's iOS devices, a factor that also helped to rob Flash of critical mass among mobile devices.\nHowever, Google also never removed H.264 support from its own Chrome browser as it had promised to do. And even among other browsers that had effectively made WebM the only default way to present HTML5 video (including Mozilla's Firefox and the Opera browser), there was still a fallback in place to use Adobe Flash.\nThat meant video content creators could reach all audiences using H.264, and simply route around the idealogical position of Mozilla, Opera and now Google by wrapping their videos with Flash. There was no exclusive audience that could only be reached by WebM, and therefore no real advantage to using it.\nHowever, there is a big advantage to using H.264: support for efficient hardware acceleration exists for it on all modern mobile devices. Mozilla's new softening stance on the issue seeks to allow this underlying hardware support (or the operating system, such as Windows Phone 7 or Android) to perform the H.264 decoding on behalf of the browser.\nThe war on H.264 is over: \"We lost,\" says Mozilla\nGal announced plans to add a feature that \"adds hardware-accelerated audio/video decoding support to [Mozilla's] Gecko [browser engine] using system decoders already present on the system,\" including \"hardware-accelerated decoders for good battery life (and performance).\"\nHe noted, \"We will support decoding any video/audio format that is supported by existing decoders present on the system, including H.264 and MP3. There is really no justification to stop our users from using system decoders already on the device, so we will not filter any formats.\"\nThe mechanism will apply both to Mozilla's own \"Boot2Gecko (B2G)\" mobile operating system as well as Android, although Gal stated that \"on Android we might have to add a second video path using overlays which would only work with a small subset of CSS since extracting video frames isn't supported on all versions of Android (and all devices).\n\"I don't think this bug significantly changes our position on open video,\" he wrote. \"We will continue to promote and support open codecs, but when and where existing codecs are already installed and licensed on devices we will make use of them in order to provide people with the best possible experience.\" Gal also noted plans to add similar technology to the desktop version of Firefox, allowing the host operating system or available hardware to render video or audio as needed.\nAdding such an option to Firefox for Windows would mean Windows 7 users could render H.264 but the installed base of Windows XP could not, unless Mozilla actually bundled H.264 codecs with its browser. This additional complexity is pushing Mozilla to focus first on adding the ability to render H.264 to mobile devices, something that would help Firefox on Android, which lacks the ability to render H.264, the format most web videos now use.\nNoting the necessity of supporting H.264, Mozilla's Open Source Evangelist Christopher Blizzard noted, \"We've only seen [WebM] format adoption on YouTube. Basically everyone else uses H.264 & Flash. There are occasional exceptions, but it's not getting better with time.\"\nAsa Dotzler, Mozilla's product director for the Firefox added, \"We're talking with major video sites and they're saying 'no' to WebM. The costs of transcoding huge libraries just doesn't make sense to them.\n\"Firefox on Desktop is experiencing these same 'significant deficiencies' and the tide is not turning in any appreciable way. All that's happening while we wait is that Web developers are embracing other browsers and their primary targets.\n\"What I fear people aren't getting here is that Gecko is the _only_ mainstream browser that doesn't support h.264. We lost. It's not like we're at some tipping point and it's 3 of 4 browsers on the side of royalty free codecs with the forth about to agree. Things have tipped the other way and to not realize that and continue to hold out for a change that will not happen does little but cost us users and developer mindshare.\n\"It's time to bite that particular bullet and deliver h.264+AAC (and probably mp3) in Firefox -- across all platforms and devices.\"\nAndroid powerless to push WebM over H.264 in the way iOS pushed HTML5 over Flash\nThis is a turnaround of the situation Google intended to create in starving iOS devices of H.264 content by leveraging Adobe Flash, which in 2010 became exclusively available for Android (shortly before Adobe gave up on Flash for mobile devices in recognition that its War on Apple wasn't going to work out).\nIf Android could play both Flash videos and WebM, Google expected to be able to either force Apple to adopt Flash or WebM. Instead, Google is rethinking its position on H.264, bundling the legally grey ffmpeg H.264 decoder with Chrome, and bundling an Apache License 2.0 implementation of H.264 with Android.\nEven Mozilla, representing the ideological left flank of its partners, is throwing its support behind H.264 out of necessity. And so, another war is over: H.264 first defeated Microsoft's VC-1 in HD-DVD , defeated proprietary codecs used by Flash , and has now defeated Google's attempts to replace it with its own WebM.\n"}], [{"score": 686.3269, "uuid": "ba1010ee-0058-57aa-819d-338fd35ae9d0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200tw-78-08760", "target_hostname": "news.investors.com", "target_uri": "http://news.investors.com/article/601532/201202171245/google-doubleclick-tracking-apple-safari-browser.htm?ven=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20InternetTechnologyRss%20(Technology%20RSS)", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Google Accused Of Tricking <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> Safari Browser To Circumvent Privacy", "snippet": "They <em>perform</em> useful tasks, such as remembering passwords, <em>or</em> settings on sites users browse often.

And when it comes to on-time arrivals, not all airlines are created equal. Sure, sometimes it depends what airports they fly into, regulars at LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark have to deal with a lot more congestion than airlines flying into say Charleston, South Carolina. But sometimes the arrival record is also a function of the airline itself.\nListed below are the top 10 airlines for arriving on-time with the highest customer satisfaction rating.\n#10 Delta\nOn-time performance: 76.9%\nThough most airlines increased their on-time performance, Delta\u2019s dropped ever so slightly, from 77.3%. Unfortunately, that means slipping from the #7 spot, though the airline still remains in the top 10.\n#9 Alaska\nOn-time performance: 77.6%\nThere wasn\u2019t much movement for Alaska, which gained 1 percentage point in on-time arrivals from 2010 but slipped from #8.\n#8 AirTran\nOn-time performance: 78.4%\nAirTran\u2019s jump of 2 percentage points from 2010 was enough to help it snag the #8 spot from Alaska.\n#7 Northwest\nOn-time performance: 79.6%\nNorthwest made a big move this year; its improvement of 6 percentage points from 2010 meant a jump of 5 spots in the rankings and a solid spot in the top 10.\n#6 Frontier\nOn-time performance: 80%\nFrontier was booted out of the top 5 this year, despite an increase in on-time performance from 78%\n#5 US Airways\nOn-time performance: 80.4%\nThough US Airways slipped less than 2 percentage points from 2010, the surge from a couple regional carriers cost the airline its #3 spot.\n#4 SkyWest\nOn-time performance: 81.4%\nThis regional carrier\u2014which is the primary United Express carrier along the West Coast, as well as a Delta Connection and Midwest Connect carrier\u2014increased its 2010 performance (78%) and its ranking (#5).\n#3 Southwest\nOn-time performance: 83%\nWhile Southwest\u2019s performance increased this year (it was 80% in 2010), that wasn\u2019t quite enough to hold onto its #2 ranking.\n#2 Pinnacle\nOn-time performance: 83.4%\nPinnacle\u2014which operates flights for Northwest Airline and Delta Connection\u2014didn\u2019t crack the top 5 in 2010 (it was #6 with 77.4%), but this year flew to the #2 spot.\n#1 Hawaiian\nOn-time performance: 89.5%\nOnce again, Hawaiian outperformed all other carriers. Should airline executives be worried that the on-time percentage dropped from 92% last year? Probably not\u2014it\u2019s still ahead by a healthy margin.\nPosted by Jeffery Brown in Just for Fun Quick Tips The Internet Tuesday, June 14, 2011\nAmazon Cloud Player\nLet\u2019s look at the first cloud music solution brought to us by Amazon. Cloud Player works hand in hand with Cloud Drive, the web-based storage platform created to deal with its cloud offering.\u00a0 With the service offering a browser based user interface, any internet connected PC or Mac will be compatible. At present Android seems to be the only mobile device platform supported by Amazon, although other platforms could be added shortly.\u00a0 The service provides customers with 5GB of storage space to get started, but users who make a purchase at the Amazon US MP3 store during 2011 will automatically be given a 20GB upgrade for a single year. Not bad.\u00a0 Perhaps this \u2018deal\u2019 is some kind of incentive to sway consumers away from Apple\u2019s iTunes and over to Amazon\u2019s MP3 store. I\u2019m not sure that it will work like Amazon hopes, but it\u2019s certainly a nice offer.\nAlso, Amazon has claimed that it will keep all your stored music online for a \u2018lifetime,\u2019 which where we come from means until you\u2019re dead. Again, this is a nice feature \u2013 unless you plan on leaving your cloud storage to a relative, that is.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s determination to sign the big four record labels, Amazon released the service without obtaining any sort of legal deal with them. One stunned music executive was quoted saying that many in the industry questioned the service\u2019s legality.\u00a0 The anonymous executive said: \u201c\"I've never seen a company of their size make an announcement, launch a service and simultaneously say they're trying to get licenses,\" said the executive.\u201d\nUnlike iCloud\u2019s offering, there are no additional costs to upload your music sourced from elsewhere. Amazon simply charges if you need to expand on your cloud drive\u2019s free capacity.\u00a0 The service will also allow you to re-download your MP3/ACC files to 8 devices.\nMusic Beta by Google\nJust like Amazon, the current beta seems to have no legal backup from copyright holders. Launched at the Google I/O conference, the service hasn\u2019t really set the world talking.\u00a0 With Adobe Flash powering the Android-centric platform at present, iOS devices go unsupported. It also seems, however, that Android devices are also the only method of re-downloading your content.\u00a0 In terms of storage, Google approaches capacity by the number of songs instead of storage space. With the ability to upload 20,000 songs there\u2019s plenty of room to hide your embarrassing guilty pleasures.\u00a0 Just like Amazon, both MP3 and ACC files can be uploaded, with the lesser used WMA and FLAC formats also supported too.\u00a0 Unlike its rivals, users can\u2019t purchase music via the system as Google has no music store to compete with iTunes or the Amazon MP3 Store, which could be a bad thing for the search giant depending on how you look at it.\niCloud and iTunes Match\nThe major difference between the iCloud service and its opponents is the lack of browser support. Apple once again has kept the walled garden gate shut by requiring users to be running iTunes (yes\u2026even the Windows version) or an iOS device.\nThe idea behind iCloud and iTunes Match clearly leaves out streaming from the agenda, your music must be fully downloaded to play. This process is made much easier by the automatic syncing between the iCloud and your devices.\nA big advantage Apple has over its rivals is that iTunes Match will literally match your non-iTunes music and download a high quality 256 kbps AAC version of the songs.\u00a0 Once again the iCloud service is free (replacing the paid-for MobileMe) with iTunes Match setting you back a yearly fee of $25.\nBy matching your files up with the limited 5GB, iCloud will then use an already in the cloud file (from the iTunes server) to push this to up to 10 of your iOS devices. This saves the hassle and time of large amounts of data being uploaded to the iCloud servers via end-users limited internet connection.\nConclusion\nWithout knowing Google\u2019s future pricing plan it is hard to tell which one of these services I will use in the future but for right now I will stick with Music Beta by Google.\u00a0 I am doing this mostly because of the massive storage space allowed.\u00a0 I have around 4,000+ songs.\u00a0 Google\u2019s offering allows me to upload 16,000 more songs.\u00a0 I uploaded all of my music to Amazon\u2019s Cloud Player and have only 3 GB of space left.\u00a0 I cannot test out Apple\u2019s offering because I do not have an iOS device.\u00a0 But Apple\u2019s lack of streaming or being able to play my music in a web browser is a major buzz kill on the product for me.\nBut as the saying goes, to each his (or her) own.\u00a0 Let us know if you try any of these out and which one you like the most.\nPosted by Daniel Lightner in IT Solutions Quick Tips Tuesday, June 14, 2011\nSo we all enjoy a clean, safe, and healthy home or work environment.

This dust will stop internal fans from running; it can cause fans to run at a slower speed, or can create layers of grim on important components preventing the heat from escaping.\nSo if a car air filter will give you 10% better fuel economy, an air filter for your home or office will prevent sickness and allergies, think about what a server room or desktop cleaning could do you.\nPosted by Salvatore Rigoroso in Hardware IT Solutions Quick Tips Security The Internet Tuesday, June 14, 2011\nWell we hope not to see $5.00 a gallon, but it looks inevitable.

On a flight) and want to listen to some funky grooves.\nThe pricing for additional storage is as follows:\nStorage Plans\nGet all the online storage space you need.\nPlan\u00a0Price\u00a0\u00a0Details\n5 GB\u00a0FREE\u00a0\u00a0Free of charge to you\n20 GB\u00a0$20.00 / Year\n50 GB\u00a0$50.00 / year\u00a0\u00a0Less than $4.25 / month\n100 GB\u00a0$100.00 / year\u00a0\u00a0Less than $8.50 / month\n200 GB\u00a0$200.00 / year\u00a0\u00a0Less than $16.75 / month\n500 GB\u00a0$500.00 / year\u00a0\u00a0Less than $41.75 / month\n1000 GB\u00a0$1,000.00 / year\u00a0\u00a0Less than $83.50 / month\nAll storage plans are billed on an annual basis.\nI am excited to see this idea mature and to see what the competitors (Google and Apple) come up with to fend off Amazon from becoming the king of the mp3 download realm.\n6 of 10 of 61 First | Prev | Next | Last |\ncategories\n"}, {"score": 661.6926, "uuid": "12c86f22-5710-5fcc-9541-d88338224378", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-02-04790", "target_hostname": "www.nationaltechcenter.org", "target_uri": "http://www.nationaltechcenter.org/index.php/tag/portable-technology/", "page_rank": 1.4581097e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Portable <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "Student response systems, <em>or</em> clickers\u2014not unlike gadgets used on television game shows\u2014first appeared in college classrooms over a decade ago and have since spread to just about every college and university in the country, thanks to cheaper and <em>better</em> <em>technology</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "November 20th, 2009\nTHE Journal\nHumanWare\u00a0 has debuted a notetaker designed for students who are blind.

So, MIPS engineers picked up the release from the Google source tree and ported it to MIPS within 24 hours. In fact, they decided to push through the weekend and bring 4.0.3 up on the Ingenic/Ainol tablet. Thus we were able to give Ainol a head start towards an over the air (OTA) upgrade for tablets sold to-date plus schedule a switch over to 4.0.3 for new tablets.\nBut there is more here than just our dedication to supporting MIPS\u2019 licensees and the Android community \u2026\nAndroid 4.0 expands on Google\u2019s use of LLVM, and MIPS completely supports this initiative \u2013 in fact, when Google adopted LLVM 3.0 as the basis of Renderscript in Android 4.0.3, MIPS support was already available. So, what is LLVM, and why is it important for the Android community?\nLLVM \u2013 Low Level Virtual Machine \u2013 is an umbrella for modular compiler technologies. It includes a C/C++ compiler front-end, a portable code generator supporting a wide variety of architectures, an aggressive optimizer, and an efficient just-in-time (JIT) compiler on the back-end. Renderscript, the first technology in Android to use LLVM, first became popular in HoneyComb (Android 3.0)\u2013as a set of low-level APIs targeting 3D rendering and compute operations. In fact Renderscript is an example of using the \u00a0high-performance APIs provided by LLVM to achieve the same level of system performance that developers could expect were they instead to \u00a0use native code on the underlying device. But unlike the existing Android native development kit (NDK), this solution is cross-platform \u2013 meaning that applications built using this technology can run on several architectures supported by LLVM.\nThe inclusion of MIPS optimizations for LLVM in Google\u2019s Android 4.0.3 release takes a great step in making LLVM available for more general use by app developers seeking to exploit native processor performance and capabilities while retaining complete portability in the Android universe.\nSo what\u2019s behind this LLVM push for Android?\nMIPS actually became involved in the industry\u2019s LLVM initiative over a year ago \u2013 before it became generally available in Android. This was when MIPS\u2019 compiler group realized that LLVM was going to be a major basis for applications in the future. LLVM had already been the basis of Apple\u2019s application environment for the iPhone and iPad. Our engineers felt that it was only a matter of time before it became the basis of application development environments in the wider market.\nWe were clearly not alone in our thinking, and so LLVM first appeared in Android.\nBy supplying our LLVM technology for the MIPS architecture to Google, we have enabled all MIPS licensees, their OEMs and application developers targeting their platforms to have access to the best possible execution environment on MIPS-based platforms, starting with Android 4.0.3. Of course, as Android moves forward, MIPS will make further refinements to LLVM on the MIPS architecture available to Google. We will also make available other optimizations and software related to improving Android\u2019s \u201cout of the box\u201d support for the MIPS architecture.\nAndroid has become an enormous force in the consumer electronics market \u2013 a market in which MIPS\u2019 legendary performance, power efficiency and cost effectiveness have been well recognized. The MIPS architecture has already been adopted widely on just about every type of consumer device \u2026 cell phones, tablets, set-top boxes, and digital TVs to name a few.\nThe inclusion of support for the MIPS architecture directly in this latest key facility of Android provides an even more attractive future for all of our licensees and their customers \u2013 and ultimately for the end users who continually seek out the best price/performance products available in the market and rely on those products in their day to day lives.\nMIPS is moving forward with Android \u2013 as always, we are focused on going beyond simply what the market is demanding. We know that providing an enriched apps development environment benefits all end users. More apps, anywhere and any time, running on Android, running on MIPS!\nConvergence with a Caveat: Will the TV, tablet, smartphone and computer converge into one master device?\nDecember 14th, 2011 by Kevin Kitagawa\nThe evolution of the iPhone and Android smartphones have allowed consumers to be entertained, to easily access information on-the-go and to communicate with anyone from anywhere. Need directions to the nearest gas station? Look it up on Google Maps. Need restaurant recommendations? Launch your Yelp app. Need to waste 10 minutes while waiting for someone? How about a few levels of Angry Birds? Want to listen to music or watch a movie away from home? You can do that. Talk, text or facetime your friends? No problem.\nAs we all enjoy the features and functions enabled by today\u2019s \u201csmarter\u201d mobile and portable devices, TVs have become smarter too. Today\u2019s TVs are adding internet connectivity, streaming video and TV programming such as Netflix and Hulu, voice/video conferencing capabilities such as Skype, and much more. In addition, Smart TVs can access movies, pictures, and music on any DLNA capable device such as a Windows 7 machine or tablets.\nAs these devices become more powerful and feature-rich, some people think that we will ultimately see all of the capabilities of TV, mobile phone, tablet and PC converge into one master device. But is that really a possibility?\nThe short answer is, I don\u2019t think so.\nBattery Life\nConsider first the matter of battery life. Gone are the days of going a week without needing to charge our phones. Most of us constantly charge our phones at home, work and even in the car just to power a single day. Even with this constant battery charging, many of us swap in other devices to further conserve power. For example, I will use my iPod Touch to watch a movie during an hour at the gym, to be sure I have enough smartphone power for a conference call later in the day. Just imagine the incredible amount of battery life a device would need to provide in order to meet our daily usage appetite for all online/media consumption/phone activities. Today\u2019s devices just can\u2019t supply that.\nSize Matters\nSecondly, what size would a master device be? Watching video content on my smartphone/tablet is a bit of a compromise. While this is something I would do on a plane or while stuck waiting for hours on end somewhere, while I am at home, I much prefer to watch movies/TV shows in front of my TV.\nSome people have proposed that the smartphone can become a set-top box by \u201cdocking\u201d it with the TV. This capability will definitely be possible in the near future, but I don\u2019t see this ever replacing a dedicated set-top box that stays in the living room. There are too many questions to sort out: Whose smartphone should be used as the main set-top box? What happens if that person receives a private phone call in the middle of a live football game? What happens if that person is not at home \u2014 how would the family watch a program that was recorded on that person\u2019s phone?\nAt least in my family, this simply wouldn\u2019t work. Even in the future when all data will be stored remotely in the \u201ccloud space,\u201d and each device becomes more or less a screen with all content available on-demand, there will be a need for each device to retain its primary purpose.\nPrimary Functions\nWhile a smartphone could operate as a master device, it\u2019s very clear that smartphones, tablets, personal computers, set-top boxes, and TVs each have primary functions at which they excel. The smartphone is primarily a phone and mobile internet device. A tablet brings casual email and a better mobile internet experience with its larger screen. The TV is still a one-to-many entertainment device. And the PC is still the best machine for writing reports, developing Powerpoint presentations, and other work-related tasks. In the case of set-top boxes, that primary purpose is delivering premium content in a way that is secure, acceptable to content owners (e.g. HBO and Showtime) and seamless to viewers.\nThe idea of any one of these devices becoming a \u201cmaster device\u201d spells compromise for the primary functions of those other devices.\nSmart devices will complement each other\nWhat these devices WILL do is complement each other by allowing intelligent interaction between devices. Today, we already see smartphones and tablets being used as remote controls for TVs. Very soon, we will be able to engage in even more advanced integrated tasks.\nFor example, there have been many times while watching a TV show or movie that I wanted to find out more information about something in real time \u2013 perhaps the name of an actor/actress or the location of the scene I\u2019m watching. With a tablet next to me on the couch, I can instantly research the relevant information. Even so, I need to type in my search terms on the tablet to get my information. And while today\u2019s smart TVs allow us to access the internet in order to search directly from the TV, this interaction disrupts the show for everyone else. In the future, smart TVs and set-top boxes will have the ability to deliver relevant keywords to a connected tablet / smartphone by hitting a button on the TV remote allowing a user to search.\nIn addition, game shows could allow multiple users at home to play along with contestants, vote for participants, or comment in real time.\u00a0Using a tablet together with a TV during live sports events could enable a user to control different camera views, have user controlled instant replay, or bring up live individual or team statistics, all without disrupting what is being displayed on the TV.\nConvergence with a caveat\nI believe that convergence will indeed occur among devices, but it will be a kind of functional, not device convergence. We will continue to have separate devices, but they will speak and interact with each other much more seamlessly. Each device will have a lot of similar functionality, but will retain the primary functions at which they excel. Until we have the technology to deliver weeks of battery life on a device that will fit in my pocket and deliver a 60\u201d HDTV experience when I\u2019m home, I see each of these devices being part of our lives. It\u2019s a convergence of functionality, but with a caveat.\n"}, {"score": 639.5908, "uuid": "eeaf9aca-f558-5b53-b473-c3c1ecf87052", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0817wb-92-27800", "target_hostname": "www.mattbernius.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mattbernius.com/tag/technology/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.1775746e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Technology</em> &#x2F;&#x2F; mattBernius.com", "snippet": "More importantly, he didn\u2019t need to get his apps only from <em>Google\u2019s</em> (<em>or</em> anybody\u2019s) \u201cstore\u201d.

Chu-Carroll\nI've been being peppered with questions about Go , the new programming language just released as open-source by Google. Yes, I know about it. And yes, I've used it. And yes, I've got some strong opinions about it.\nGo is an interesting language. I think that there are many fantastic things about it. I also think that there are some really dreadful things about it.\nA warning before I go on: this post is definitely a bit of a rush job. I wanted to get something out before my mailbox explodes :-). I'll probably try to do a couple of more polished posts about Go later. But this should give you a first taste.\nThe natural question is, what does it look like? It's vaguely C-like, but with a lot of cleanups and simplifications. Every declaration is preceded by a keyword that identifies what it's declaring: type, func, var, or const. Lots of parens that are required in C have been removed. The type declarations have been cleaned up quite a lot - they've gotten rid of the type-declaration garbage of C.\nIn every declaration, the name comes first, followed by the type. So, for example, types are declared after variable names, and all type modifiers precede the types. So *X is a pointer to an X; [3]X is an array of three X's. The types are therefore really easy to read just read out the names of the type modifiers: [] declares something called an array slice; \"*\" declares a pointer; [size] declares an array. So []*[3]*int is an array slice of pointers to arrays of three pointers to ints.\nFunctions in Go are amazing. They start off really simply, but by providing a few simple extensions, they let you do all sorts of things. To start off, here's a factorial function in Go.\nfunc Factorial(x int) int {\n   if x == 0 {\n      return 1;\t\n   } else {\n      return x * Factorial(x - 1);\n   }\n}\nGo extends that by adding support for named return values. You can declare the return value as a variable in the function header; then you can assign values to that variable. When the function returns, the last value assigned to the return variable is the return value. So you could also write factorial as:\nfunc Factorial(x int) (result int) {\n  if x == 0 {\n    result = 1;\t\n  } else {\n    result = x * Factorial(x - 1);\n  }\n  return;\n}\nYou can also write a function with multiple return values:\nfunc fib(n) (val int, pos int) {\n   if n == 0 {\n      val = 1;\n      pos = 0;\n   } else if n == 1 {\n      val = 1;\n      pos = 1;\n   } else {\n      v1, _ := fib(n-1);\n      v2,_ := fib(n-2);\n      val = v1 + v2;\n      pos = n;\n   }\n   return;\n}\n(The above contained boneheaded mistake 1: I just wrote that out, and didn't bother to compile it. Naturally, I screwed it up in a silly way. It's since been fixed.)\nIt's not object-oriented in a traditional way; it provides something like a limited form of object-orientation using another extension to functions. You can define new types - either type aliases, or structure types. You can declare methods for any type at all in the module where it's defined. A method is just a function which has a parameter preceeding the function name.\nSo, for example, a basic linked list could be implemented as;\ntype IntList struct {\n  next *IntList;\n  val int;\n}\n\nfunc (s *IntList) SetNext(n *IntList) {\n   s.next = n;\n}\n\nfunc (s *IntList) GetNext() *IntList {\n   return s.next;\n}\n\nfunc (s *IntList) SetValue(v int) {\n   s.val = v;\n}\n\nfunc (s *IntList) GetValue() int {\n   return s.val;\n}\n(Boneheaded mistake 3: I originally put the declarations in the wrong order above - even within a struct, it's name-first - so \"next *IntList\" not \"IntList* next\".)\nOne of the dominant themes that you'll see as I continue to describe it is minimalism. The guys who designed Go were very focused on keeping things as small and simple as possible. When you look at it in contrast to a language like C++, it's absolutely striking. Go is very small, and very simple. There's no cruft. No redundancy. Everything has been pared down. But for the most part, they give you what you need. If you want a C-like language with some basic object-oriented features and garbage collection, Go is about as simple as you could realistically hope to get.\nTo give you one example of that minimalist approach, Go allows you to define types with methods. But there's no such thing as a class, and there's absolutely no inheritance. Instead, there's a kind of composition. I won't go into detail about it here.\nAs I said above, you can define methods on any type. The methods are really just functions with a special parameter. There's no such thing as a type constructor! There's an allocation operator, \"new\" - but it doesn't initialize values. You can't provide Go with any automatic initializer. Instead, things like constructors are handled by convention. You'll generally create a new data type inside of a module. That module will have a public function named \"New\", which returns an initialized value. So, for example, there's a module named \"vector\" containing an implementation of a vector; to create a vector, you import the vector module, and call vector.New(size).\nAnother example of that minimalism is the way that they handle abstraction and name hiding. There are exactly two kinds of name visibility: public, and private. Private things can only be seen in the module that declared them; public things can be seen in any module that imports them. The way that you make things public is by lexical cues: public things are things that were declared with an identifier starting with an upper case letter. \"fact\" is private, \"Fact\" is public.\nThe most innovative thing about it is its type system. There are two kinds of types in Go: concrete types, and interface types. Concrete types are exactly what you're used to from most programming languages. Interface types are similar to interface types in languages like Java, with one huge exception: you don't need to declare what interface types you implement! An interface is a specification of what methods a type must provide to be used in some context. Anything which implements those methods implements the interface. Even if the interface was defined later than a type, in a different module, compiled separately, if the object implements the methods named in the interface, then it implements the interface.\nTo make that even better, methods aren't limited to objects. In fact, Go doesn't really have objects. Any value, any type at all, can have methods. So you can make an integer type with its own methods. For example:\ntype Foo int;\n\nfunc (self Foo) Emit() {\n  fmt.Printf(\"%v\", self);\n\t\n}\n\ntype Emitter interface {\n  Emit();\n}\nFoo implements Emitter. I've created the type \"Foo\". Values of type \"Foo\" are integers. Then I've implemented a method on an instance of \"Foo\".\nThat's brilliant. I absolutely love it. And even in the relatively small amount of time I've spent hacking Go code, I've seen it pay off, when I've created new interfaces, and realized that old types already implement the interface. It's a very elegant idea, and it works really well. It ends up giving you something with the flavor of Python-ish duck typing, but with full type-checking from the compiler.\nFor example, the first thing I wrote in Go was a parser combinator library. I defined an interface for the input to a parser:\n// ParserInput represents an input source readable by a\n// parser. \ntype ParserInput interface {\n  // Get the character at an arbitrary position in the\n  // input source.\n  CharAt(i int) uint8;\n\n  // Get the number of characters in the input source.\n  Size() int;\n}\nNow, anything that implements CharAt(int) and Size() can be used as an input to a parser. Then, I defined an interface for parsers:\n// ParseValue represents the type of values returned by\n// successful parses.\ntype ParseValue interface { }\n\t\n// A Parser is an object which parses input sources. The\n// framework of parser combinators provides a very general,\n// backtracking parser.\ntype Parser interface {\n\n\t// Run the parser on an input source, starting with\n\t// the character at a specified position. If the parse\n\t// succeeds, it returns \"true\" as the status, the\n\t// number of characters matched by the parser as the match_len,\n\t// and an arbitrary parser-specified, return value as the result. \n\t// If the parse fails, then it returns false as the status, -1 as \n\t// match_len, and nil as the result.\n   Parse(in ParserInput, pos int) \n       (status bool, match_len int, result ParseValue);\n}\nSo a parser is anything which has a Parse method. A parse method takes an input, and a position in the input; and it returns three values: a success code (indicating whether the parse succeeded or failed); a match length (indicating how many characters in the input were accepted by the parser), and a return value. The return value can be anything: it's defined as an empty interface, and everything implements the empty interface.\nTo build parsers, you start with a kind of parser that can process a single input character, which is any character from some set of characters.\n// CharSetParser parses a single character from among a \n// specified set.\ntype CharSetParser struct {\n  chars string;\n}\n\nfunc (self *CharSetParser) Parse(in ParserInput, pos int) \n \t(status bool, match_len int, result ParseValue) {\n\tstatus = false;\n\tmatch_len = -1;\n\tfor c := range self.chars {\n\t\tif self.chars[c] == in.CharAt(pos) {\n\t\t   result = self.chars[c];\n\t\t   match_len = 1;\n\t\t\t   status = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn;\n}\nThis demonstrates one sort of odd feature of Go. A structure and a pointer to a structure are different types, and they can have different methods. A pointer to a\nCharSetParser\nis a parser; but a\nCharSetParser\nThe implementation above doesn't provide a way of creating a\nCharSetParser\n. To do that, we need a function. And to try to make the parsers look as clean as possible, we'll name it so that it doesn't look like a creator function, but just a parser itself:\n// Create a CharSetParser which accepts any one character\n// from a specified string.\nfunc CharSet(s string) *CharSetParser {\n   return &CharSetParser{ s };\n}\nThen you add more kinds of parsers which allow you to combine simple parsers. For example, one combinator is repetition, which runs a parser over and over until it succeeds:\n// ManyParser is a parser that parses a repeated syntax\n// element. It succeeds if the sub-parser succeeds at least\n// a specified minimum number of times. Returns a list\n// of the results of the sub-parses.\ntype ManyParser struct {\n  min int;\n  parser Parser;\n}\n\n// Create a ManyParser which matches min or more\n// repetitions of the sequence parsed by p.\nfunc Many(p Parser, min int) *ManyParser {\n  result := &ManyParser{ min, p };\n  return result;\n}\n\t\nfunc (self *ManyParser) Parse(in ParserInput, pos int) \n\t (status bool, match_len int, results ParseValue) {\n  status = false;\n  curPos := pos;\n  numMatches := 0;\n  stepResults := vector.New(0);\n  stepSuccess, stepLen, stepResult := self.parser.Parse(in, curPos);\n  for stepSuccess {\n\tnumMatches++;\n    curPos = curPos + stepLen;\n    stepResults.Push(stepResult);\n    stepSuccess, stepLen, stepResult = self.parser.Parse(in, curPos);\n  }\n  if numMatches < self.min {\n     stepSuccess = false;\n     match_len = -1;\n\t     results = nil;\n     return;\n  }\n  status = true;\n  results = stepResults;\n  match_len = curPos - pos;\n  return;\n}\nWith that, you just say Many(P, 0) to represent a parser that parses 0 or more repetitions of P.\nAnyway, the end result is a library where you can write lots of very simple functions which combine parsers in very flexible ways. The end result is something where I can write a parser that parses lisp SExpressions into a cons-list structure with:\nSexprParserRef := MakeRef();\nManySexprs := Action(Many(SexprParserRef, 1), new(VectAction));\nListParser := Second(Seq([]Parser { Lp, ManySexprs, Rp }));\nSexpr := Alt([]Parser{ ListParser, SymParser });\nSexprParserRef.SetTarget(Sexpr);\nAlas, not everything about it is so wonderful. Sometimes that minimalism comes back to bite you on your ass. And worse, there's a bit of a \"for me but not for thee\" attitude that pervades some aspects of the language design.\nFor one example of an odd minimalist tradeoff: they decided that they didn't want to specifically add something like an enumeration type. After all, what's an enumeration? It's really a type-safe alias for an integer, with a set of constants defining the members of the enumeration. Go already has the ability to define a type-safe alias for an integer! So why bother allowing the definition of a new kind of type? Instead, just make it easy to define the constants. So they created a pseudo-variable named iota which can be used inside of a constant declaration block. Each time you see a semicolon in a constant block, iota is automatically incremented. So to define a set of colors, you could do something like:\ntype Color int; const ( RED Color = iota; ORANGE = iota; YELLOW = iota;\nGREEN = iota; BLUE = iota; INDIGO = iota; VIOLET = iota; )\nThat will create a color type, with \"RED\" as 0, \"ORANGE\" as 1, etc. Of course, it's kind of annoying to have to re-type the iota every time. So if you omit the values after an iota in a const block, it automatically just copies them. So you could rewrite the colors as:\ntype Color int;\t\nconst (\n  RED = iota;\n  ORANGE;\n  YELLOW;\n  GREEN;\n  BLUE;\n  INDIGO;\n  VIOLET;\n)\nIt seems a bit strange and obtuse, but not awful. But it can get downright strange. Here's an example from the Go tutorial:\ntype ByteSize float64\nconst (\n\t_ = iota;\t// ignore first value by assigning to blank identifier\n\tKB ByteSize = 1<<(10*iota);\n\tMB;\n\tGB;\n\tTB;\n\tPB;\n\tYB;\n)\nIota starts at 0. By assigning it to \"_\", you effectively discard the zero value. Then, \"KB\" is defined as 210*iota. That full expression is then copied to the successive values. So MB gets a copy of Bytesize = 1<<(10*iota), which evaluates to 1<<(10*2). And so on. Since ByteSize is an alias for a float64, the values are automatically converted to floats.\nIt's powerful, but if you ask me, it's ad-hoc and ugly.\nThen there's the \"We're the language designers, we need stuff you don't\".\nThe Go type system does not support generic types. They're considering adding them at some point in the future, but for now, they don't consider them necessary. Lowly programmers just don't need parametrics, and it would clutter up the beautiful compiler to implement them.\nOh, but wait... Go really needs type-safe arrays. Well, that's OK. Everyone provides arrays as a sort of special case - what language doesn't have typed arrays, even if it doesn't have any other parametric types? And we really want these cool things called slices - but they really need to be strongly typed. So we'll let them be parametric. And maps - we really need a map type, which maps keys to values, and it really needs to be type-safe. So we'll add a parametric map type to the language, by making it a special case built-in.\nSo: you can't write parametric types - but they can. And that creates a very weird asymmetry to the language. Everything in Go is passed by value - except for the built-in slice and map types, which are passed by reference. Everything is allocated by \"new\" - except for the built-in slice and map types, which are allocated by \"make\". It's by far the biggest blemish in Go, and it's absolutely infuriating.\nThere's a similar issue around error handling. The language doesn't have exceptions. I can accept that - exception handling in most languages is absolutely hideous, and you can make a strong argument that it's so damned broken that you should find a way to do without. Particularly in a language like Go, where you can return multiple values from functions, you can do things like return both a result and a status code, and handle errors via status codes.\nSo the Go guys left out exceptions. They say that you don't need them. But for their own code, they added workarounds that become something like exception handling for their own code. For example, if you want to do a cast from an interface type X to an interface type Y, you'd write something interface type to another, you'd write \"y = x.(Y)\". But if the value x didn't implement interface Y, it would be an error, and the program would crash. So if you're not sure that x implements Y, you can write \"y, ok := x.(Y)\". That never fails; if x implements Y, then y gets the casted value, and ok is true. If x doesn't implement Y, then y get assigned nil, and ok is set to false. Once again, having a way of catching an error is OK for the language designers, but not for anyone else.\nAnyway, with the complaints out of the way: one other major piece of goodness is compilation speed. One of the fundamental goals of Go was to be able to compile things really quickly. Lots of things about the language were designed to make it possible to build a really fast compiler, and to be able to do full separate compilation without every needing to re-process anything. (The motivation for this is that at Google, we have a very large code-base with tons and tons of code re-use. This is a very good thing. But because most of that code is C++, builds can be incredibly slow. The way that C++ header files work with a standard compiler, you can wind up re-parsing the same file hundreds or thousands of times. So even with a really fast compiler, you can easily wind up with some extremely slow compile times. Tricks like pre-compiling headers can help, but they've got their own problems.)\nGo programs compile really astonishingly quickly. When I first tried it, I thought that I had made a mistake building the compiler. It was just too damned fast. I'd never seen anything quite like it. I'd taken a parser combinator library that I'd written in Java, and re-implemented it in Go - the full version of the code that I excerpted above. The code was slightly more than 30% shorter in Go, and also cleaner and prettier than the Java. A full, clean build of the combinator library in Java took just over 3 seconds in Eclipse. It took 0.6 seconds on the command-line compiled with Jikes. With the 6g go compiler, it took 0.06 seconds!\nBefore using Go, Jikes was the fastest compiler I'd ever used. But Go managed to do better by a factor of 10! And Jikes was generating Java bytecode; 6g is generating reasonably well-optimized native code! Part of that is the genius of Ken Thompson, the guy who implemented 6g; but part of it is also the very careful design of the language.\n(Boneheaded mistake 2: for some reason, I always confuse Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. It's Ken who wrote 6g, not Dennis, as I originally wrote.)\nSo... At the end of the day, what do I think? I like Go, but I don't love it. If it had generics, it would definitely be my favorite of the C/C++/C#/Java family. It's got a very elegant simplicity to it which I really like. The interface type system is wonderful. The overall structure of programs and modules is excellent. But it's got some ugliness. Some of the ugliness is fixable, and some of it isn't. On balance, I think it's a really good language, but it could have been a lot better. It's not going to wipe C++ off the face of the earth. But I think it will establish itself as a solid alternative. And hopefully, over time, they'll fix some of the worst parts of the ugliness, without sacrificing the beauty or simplicity of the language.\nTo preemptively answer a question I'm sure people will ask: am I using Go for my daily work? Not yet. My project has a lot of existing code, and at the moment, I'm constrained by that. I'll be starting work on a prototype of a major new component very soon, and once I've had time to look at the foreign function interface for Go, I'll make a decision about whether or not to use it. Basically, if the FFI is good enough to allow me to link to the Google infrastructure that I need to be able to use, then I will use Go for my prototype, and hopefully for the full component.\nFind more posts in:\n"}, {"score": 633.33246, "uuid": "96a5c975-c24f-5c73-bc87-8c2308cb2feb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-09-11107", "target_hostname": "blog.bftcpa.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.bftcpa.com/", "page_rank": 1.52501e-08, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "CPA <em>Technology</em> Blog", "snippet": "was designed, created, and deployed to mobile devices running <em>Apple\u2019s</em> iOS and <em>Google\u2019s</em> Android OS reportedly in just six weeks.", "explanation": null, "document": "Motorola Xoom Review\nI bought a Motorola Xoom dual core tablet about six weeks ago in Philadelphia.\u00a0 The Xoom runs Android 3.1 \"Honeycomb\", and is a little different from what I've seen in the iPad.\u00a0 I had to speak on tablets at a number of conferences this year (including AICPA TECH+, Office Tools Pro, and others), and since the iPad2 didn't blow me away, I decided to do something different.\u00a0 I'm glad I did - the Xoom is a great tool, and I like the form factor (16x9 10.1\" LCD) better than the iPad (which is a 4x3 10.1\" layout).\nKey observations:\n1. I actually think the Honeycomb UI is better than the iPad UI, as you can create a \"dashboard\" with your appointments, mail, social media, etc. with widgets on the grid.\u00a0 The Xoom can be upgraded to Android 3.1, and I have done so.\u00a0 Some applications, like the Prey Project anti-theft tool don't work on it yet, and it\u2019s still missing some apps \u2013 but a nice device.\n2. Video is a problem.\u00a0 There's nothing like the iTunes video, but I've not spent much time fretting about it.\u00a0 Solution for media sync appears to be DoubleTwist, which will actually copy your iTunes files (although the DRM is not supported).\u00a0 You CAN sync with DoubleTwist over WIFi, but it's an extra $10.\u00a0 The tablet supports Flash, so the issue of video is probably one of me not spending enough time working with the tool to make the Flash video work OK.\u00a0 I hope Amazon makes their video work on it soon.\u00a0 You can buy some content in the Android Market, and it\u2019s relatively painless to use.\n3. The Economist is available on the Android Kindle application, and I use the new Zinio app for Android to look at my magazines (PC World, The Economist, Bloomberg Business Week, etc.)\u00a0 As such, if you have subscriptions to periodicals on your iPad and thinking about doing something different, you may want to see how you will be able to consume the content on the new tool.\u00a0 I miss my Wall Street Journal application, but the browser supports their website remarkably well, so I'm not completely locked out of the Journal.\u00a0 The new WSJ Android app isn\u2019t working yet on Android 3.1, so I\u2019ll have to review it later.\n4. Battery life is so-so.\u00a0 Will spend some time working on this and report back on it later.\u00a0 I've not been turning it completely off, and the Wi-Fi in sleep mode seems to use up some battery life.\u00a0 I\u2019d estimate the battery life (with the screen at \u201csomewhat like the sun\u201d brightness) at about 8 hours of active use.\n5. The Google integration is awesome, and it performs notably faster than my phone (as you would expect).\n6. There aren't many apps for the tablet, but you can do pretty much anything you would need an app for on a phone in the browser on a tablet.\u00a0 Firefox for Android rocks, and is really nice on a dual core processor.\u00a0 The accounting software publishers have largely adopted iOS and BlackBerry OS for their vertical applications, but I think the rumored entrance of Amazon into the tablet market will shift some significant momentum to Android.\u00a0 You can get the BNA Tax Rates app, and all of the publishers I've talked to this year want to do something with Android.\n7. Accessories are limited and hard to find (as you would expect).\u00a0 I'm currently using a pleather Motorola folder, and would like to get a nicer leather case, but can't find one that doesn't look cheap.\u00a0 Like any good engineering company, Motorola has developed a range of sturdy, useful, and hideously ugly accessories (think: digital pocket protectors) to go with the Xoom.\u00a0 Hopefully the third parties will jump in - but who knows?\u00a0 My Zagg bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad works fine, but it doesn't fit well in the slot to hold it up.\n8. My family (who hasn't drank the Apple Kool-Aid) likes the Xoom better than the iPad 1 we have.\u00a0 No Skype video yet, but I've not spent much time looking for an effective video chat solution.\n9. There is an Adobe PDF creator for $9.99 which will convert Office files and images to PDF - very cool.\u00a0 I have not located a suitable PDF markup tool yet, but I'm sure there's one out there.\u00a0 If any of you know of one, please let me know.\nThe device charges with this needle-like proprietary plug, so you can't charge it effectively with MicroUSB.\u00a0 It does have a built-in Micro-HDMI port, and I've been racking my brain to figure out how to get that over to an analog VGA cable for presentations, to no avail.\u00a0 It probably can be done, but would likely require a Rube Goldberg-type combination of adapters to accomplish.\u00a0 (I will play with it on the TV set later.)\nThe thing which I think would make a killer application for this would be something which would let you pair your Android phone to your tablet for places where you would like to have some synergy between the two devices.\u00a0 For example, if you were on the phone with someone, I'd like the tablet to be able to securely poll the name/info of the party you're talking to and bring up their contact information in a CRM system.\u00a0 I understand that this was the idea with the Playbook, but I can't wait for it to get Android compatibility or even something as simple as a calendar application.\nIn summary, it's a great device, but you have to work harder to get it to do the same things as an iPad.\u00a0 There are some things, like the widgets, which are better than anything I've seen on the iPad, but the device isn't saddled with the \"it's so uncool\" mantra that plagues Windows slates.\u00a0 If Amazon comes out with an Android tablet, I think it will make Android a more robust competitor with iOS.\n"}, {"score": 616.2516, "uuid": "1615fcab-08ec-5dcc-8282-e0cdc995af02", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-87-23132", "target_hostname": "www.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/feb/22/apple-foxconn-nightline?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "up: social apps lost networks $13.9bn last year, what we learnt from <em>Apple&#x27;s</em>", "snippet": "more Boot up: Google+ -disks, <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> patent poker, the tablet &#x27;slowdown&#x27; and more Boot up: Google kills products, photographing Steve Jobs, down with word clouds and more Boot up: the privacy problem, <em>Google&#x27;s</em> tough path, the 9x email problem, RIM&#x27;s latest woe and more * Report errors <em>or</em> inaccuracies", "explanation": null, "document": "What we learned from the 'Nightline' report on Foxconn factories >> The Verge\nThis and more from Josh Topolsky:\nFoxconn executive Louis Woo said that he would actually like it if Apple demanded that the company double the pay of factory employees.

Motorola was losing market share, Samsung was growing fast, and some company called HTC had recently launched a new phone running some software called \"Android\".\nThe opportunity cost of Windows Phone >> asymco\nHorace Dediu (who has taken our graph about changing market shares by country and improved it hugely):\nthe speed with which Android handsets can be developed seems to be a key value of that operating system and one for which Microsoft does not have a good answer. Nokia is now one year into its commitment to the Microsoft platform and it has a very limited portfolio to show for it (and limited sales as well.) As a result, Nokia's Symbian business evaporated very rapidly. More rapidly than the company anticipated. The dilemma for other vendors may well be how long will it take for them to develop a replacement for their Android portfolio in Windows Phone. The opportunity cost of this switch is subtle and insidious but may be the root of why we don't see a stampede toward Microsoft. Conversely, Android's contract-free, implement-at-will availability may be its greatest selling point.\n\"Opportunity cost\" is the economic term for \"potential value lost in other areas because of what you choose to do\".\nSocial messaging apps 'lost networks $13.9bn in 2011' >> BBC News\nSocial messaging applications cost mobile network operators $13.9bn (\u00a38.8bn) in lost SMS revenue last year, a report has claimed.

It concluded that mobile operators must \"work together to face the challenge from major internet players\".\nGet popcorn.

Other unibody manufacturers can now dictate prices to Apple's rivals who have to pay. But the production capacities are low so they can only use such chassis in flagship products while Apple is using them in mass products. Apple rivals go to great lengths trying to change this situation: Intel created a fashion for ultrabooks and aluminum bodies seem only natural for them but manufacturers are not able to get enough production capacity to satisfy the demand for aluminum bodies. Instead they use the old trick: they make 'aluminum sandwiches' - aluminum sheets cover a plastic chassis. Naturally, this solution is not very elegant though it costs slightly cheaper (applicable to laptops $1000+). This solution is too expensive to be used in laptops in the below $1000 bracket so manufacturers are forced to use all sorts of plastic there. This is a result of insufficient supply of needed components.\nWhich explains a lot about ultrabooks and their pricing and Intel's venture fund for them. There's some interesting suggestions too that Apple is looking to tie up lots of plastic for its phones.\nHeavy Hangs The Bandwidth That Torrents The Crown >> Andy Ihnatko's Celestial Waste of Bandwidth (BETA)\nIhnatko rebuts the arguments used by The Oatmeal over how if you can't get it legally now, well damn, you'll get it illegally now:\nI'm reminded of a Louis CK joke.

Tape and then CD players, VHS recorders and DVD players have all been widely used, to great effect, in languages classrooms across the world.\nToday, we would be hard-pressed to find teachers would disparage the positive impact the application of such technologies has had in the field of languages teaching. Yet the introduction of these technologies was initially met with great scepticism, as they were deemed to be a distraction from real learning.\nMore recently, advances in computing and almost ubiquitous internet access have heralded the arrival of the next logical stage in the evolution of teaching and learning. New technologies are by conjuring up new and innovative pedagogical practices and questioning traditional teaching and learning paradigms. For example, the application of these technologies allows us to depart from the convention that pupils must be at school in order for them to learn or be taught or for teachers to be able to assess their progress.\nYet, despite the huge pedagogical potential unquestionably present in the effective use of these technologies, many teachers still harbour considerable doubt as to technology\u2019s utility in the teaching and learning context, remaining unconvinced of the benefits the web may be able to bring to their classrooms. It appears that sceptics \u2013 as they always have done and always will \u2013 attack the adoption of new technologies on the same, familiar grounds: they\u2019re a distraction from real learning.\nSo, it begs the question: What exactly is real learning? In languages teaching, taking it again as a case in point, the definition of real learning has alternated over the last few decades: first there was a focus on grammatical rigour, then came an emphasis on communicative skills; first there were lists of words to be learnt, then came a focus on the skills needed to put those words together. What is certain, however, is that the essence of what real learning means to many teachers, of any specialism, hasn\u2019t altered considerably: real learning occurs when the teacher is firmly in control 1 and when tried and tested practices are used with which teachers are familiar.\nThis may go some way toward explaining why many teachers see the implementation of new technologies as a capitulation to what they\u00a0perceive as a lack of discipline, absence of self-control and preference for immediacy among the current generation of students 2 , establishing, in my view, a false dichotomy between technology implementation and academic rigour.\nTeachers clearly remain split in their acceptance of the different educational paradigm new technologies provide us all. In the meantime, our students \u2013 for whom being online and participation in the social media environment are a by-product of living in the developed world 3 - look on at us in bemusement. We\u2019re not \u2013 I think you would agree \u2013 providing them with a very edifying spectacle.\nSo, when does a healthy dose of scepticism become an over-dose?\nWhat do you think? Conversations are always welcome.\nMany thanks to Grumpy-Puddin for the fantastic picture\n"}, {"score": 598.4124, "uuid": "330896f8-dcb8-5069-87c1-2837b5e5d40c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-67-22504", "target_hostname": "www.law.duke.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/index", "page_rank": 1.4397951e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Duke Law &amp; <em>Technology</em> Review", "snippet": "<em>Apple&#x27;s</em> success with the Apple iPhone has brought with it certain problems.

Microsoft, held that \u201cthe 25 percent rule of thumb is a fundamentally flawed tool for determining a baseline royalty rate in a hypothetical negotiation.\u201d2 This decision is problematic for a variety of reasons: (1) it assumes that the 25% Rule, as it is classically understood, is a rule of thumb; (2) district courts could interpret it as prohibiting damages experts from applying the Classic 25% Rule as a tool for determining a baseline royalty rate, because of the court\u2019s confusion between a baseline royalty rate and a \u201creasonable royalty\u201d under \u00a7 284 of the Patent Act; and (3) it could denigrate the skills of true experts who have utilized, and continue to utilize, the Classic 25% Rule in a way that otherwise meets the admissibility standards of the Federal Rules of Evidence. This article attempts to correct these misunderstandings in the hope of restoring some certainty in an area of jurisprudence that, unfortunately, has become an unpredictable area of the law. .\n"}, {"score": 595.80316, "uuid": "fe04ff15-7a21-5651-94be-54074e5c2e64", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-24-04632", "target_hostname": "blog.bftcpa.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.bftcpa.com/computer_applications/", "page_rank": 5.9540883e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "CPA <em>Technology</em> Blog: Computer Applications", "snippet": "was designed, created, and deployed to mobile devices running <em>Apple\u2019s</em> iOS and <em>Google\u2019s</em> Android OS reportedly in just six weeks.", "explanation": null, "document": "Motorola Xoom Review\nI bought a Motorola Xoom dual core tablet about six weeks ago in Philadelphia.\u00a0 The Xoom runs Android 3.1 \"Honeycomb\", and is a little different from what I've seen in the iPad.\u00a0 I had to speak on tablets at a number of conferences this year (including AICPA TECH+, Office Tools Pro, and others), and since the iPad2 didn't blow me away, I decided to do something different.\u00a0 I'm glad I did - the Xoom is a great tool, and I like the form factor (16x9 10.1\" LCD) better than the iPad (which is a 4x3 10.1\" layout).\nKey observations:\n1. I actually think the Honeycomb UI is better than the iPad UI, as you can create a \"dashboard\" with your appointments, mail, social media, etc. with widgets on the grid.\u00a0 The Xoom can be upgraded to Android 3.1, and I have done so.\u00a0 Some applications, like the Prey Project anti-theft tool don't work on it yet, and it\u2019s still missing some apps \u2013 but a nice device.\n2. Video is a problem.\u00a0 There's nothing like the iTunes video, but I've not spent much time fretting about it.\u00a0 Solution for media sync appears to be DoubleTwist, which will actually copy your iTunes files (although the DRM is not supported).\u00a0 You CAN sync with DoubleTwist over WIFi, but it's an extra $10.\u00a0 The tablet supports Flash, so the issue of video is probably one of me not spending enough time working with the tool to make the Flash video work OK.\u00a0 I hope Amazon makes their video work on it soon.\u00a0 You can buy some content in the Android Market, and it\u2019s relatively painless to use.\n3. The Economist is available on the Android Kindle application, and I use the new Zinio app for Android to look at my magazines (PC World, The Economist, Bloomberg Business Week, etc.)\u00a0 As such, if you have subscriptions to periodicals on your iPad and thinking about doing something different, you may want to see how you will be able to consume the content on the new tool.\u00a0 I miss my Wall Street Journal application, but the browser supports their website remarkably well, so I'm not completely locked out of the Journal.\u00a0 The new WSJ Android app isn\u2019t working yet on Android 3.1, so I\u2019ll have to review it later.\n4. Battery life is so-so.\u00a0 Will spend some time working on this and report back on it later.\u00a0 I've not been turning it completely off, and the Wi-Fi in sleep mode seems to use up some battery life.\u00a0 I\u2019d estimate the battery life (with the screen at \u201csomewhat like the sun\u201d brightness) at about 8 hours of active use.\n5. The Google integration is awesome, and it performs notably faster than my phone (as you would expect).\n6. There aren't many apps for the tablet, but you can do pretty much anything you would need an app for on a phone in the browser on a tablet.\u00a0 Firefox for Android rocks, and is really nice on a dual core processor.\u00a0 The accounting software publishers have largely adopted iOS and BlackBerry OS for their vertical applications, but I think the rumored entrance of Amazon into the tablet market will shift some significant momentum to Android.\u00a0 You can get the BNA Tax Rates app, and all of the publishers I've talked to this year want to do something with Android.\n7. Accessories are limited and hard to find (as you would expect).\u00a0 I'm currently using a pleather Motorola folder, and would like to get a nicer leather case, but can't find one that doesn't look cheap.\u00a0 Like any good engineering company, Motorola has developed a range of sturdy, useful, and hideously ugly accessories (think: digital pocket protectors) to go with the Xoom.\u00a0 Hopefully the third parties will jump in - but who knows?\u00a0 My Zagg bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad works fine, but it doesn't fit well in the slot to hold it up.\n8. My family (who hasn't drank the Apple Kool-Aid) likes the Xoom better than the iPad 1 we have.\u00a0 No Skype video yet, but I've not spent much time looking for an effective video chat solution.\n9. There is an Adobe PDF creator for $9.99 which will convert Office files and images to PDF - very cool.\u00a0 I have not located a suitable PDF markup tool yet, but I'm sure there's one out there.\u00a0 If any of you know of one, please let me know.\nThe device charges with this needle-like proprietary plug, so you can't charge it effectively with MicroUSB.\u00a0 It does have a built-in Micro-HDMI port, and I've been racking my brain to figure out how to get that over to an analog VGA cable for presentations, to no avail.\u00a0 It probably can be done, but would likely require a Rube Goldberg-type combination of adapters to accomplish.\u00a0 (I will play with it on the TV set later.)\nThe thing which I think would make a killer application for this would be something which would let you pair your Android phone to your tablet for places where you would like to have some synergy between the two devices.\u00a0 For example, if you were on the phone with someone, I'd like the tablet to be able to securely poll the name/info of the party you're talking to and bring up their contact information in a CRM system.\u00a0 I understand that this was the idea with the Playbook, but I can't wait for it to get Android compatibility or even something as simple as a calendar application.\nIn summary, it's a great device, but you have to work harder to get it to do the same things as an iPad.\u00a0 There are some things, like the widgets, which are better than anything I've seen on the iPad, but the device isn't saddled with the \"it's so uncool\" mantra that plagues Windows slates.\u00a0 If Amazon comes out with an Android tablet, I think it will make Android a more robust competitor with iOS.\n"}, {"score": 584.1795, "uuid": "e0d1a29e-8675-545d-89de-0e26c90ab464", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-09-11130", "target_hostname": "blog.bftcpa.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.bftcpa.com/auditing/", "page_rank": 5.078025e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "CPA <em>Technology</em> Blog: Auditing", "snippet": "was designed, created, and deployed to mobile devices running <em>Apple\u2019s</em> iOS and <em>Google\u2019s</em> Android OS reportedly in just six weeks.", "explanation": null, "document": "Mobile Monitors 2011\nAs a recovering auditor, I try to review the options for mobile hardware to be able to advise conference participants on the devices they should be considering for their summer retooling process.\u00a0 This year, I\u2019m fortunate to have a Field Monitor Pro from Mobile Monitor Technologies (15.4\" LCD, clamshell case with keypad on the other side, image gallery of this unit at http://mmt2.com/fmp/gallery.html ).\u00a0 It has 32/64 bit drivers, works and plays well with the DisplayLink drivers for my docking station (it actually is a DisplayLink compatible device) , and is designed to take the level of abuse that road warriors dish out.\u00a0 Although I just got it a few days ago, it appears to be a BIG WIN, and I love it so far.\u00a0 I'll be taking it on the road this year, and I'll post an updated report on it to my blog once I have adequately tested it.\nThe Field Monitor Pro from Mobile Monitor Technologies (mmt2.com) is a USB-connected 15.4\u201d second monitor for use in the field.\u00a0 Designed for auditors, this should be on your short list for evaluation and purchase this year if you work at client sites 2+ days at a time.\nFor more information, visit www.mmt2.com\nI also have one of the older Samsung LD displays which are designed for laptop users (mine is a 19\").\u00a0 The 22\" is as small as you can buy the Samsung monitors - I asked the Samsung people at CES about this directly this year.\u00a0 I broke the LCD on one of these a couple of years ago by putting too much pressure on it, and had abandoned using it for fear of breaking it.\u00a0 As such, the FMP is going to be a big win this year.\nI love the Samsung LD220 (Staples is closing them out at $160 each at http://bit.ly/LD220) , and it has full 1080p (1920x1080) resolution.\u00a0 The major technical concern I have with this device is that it's using a traditional VGA cable, and 1080p is an awful lot of data flowing over a VGA cable - I would prefer an HDMI input so I could use it with other home theater gear.\u00a0 The thing really stopping me from carrying one of these is the size of the unit.\u00a0 If you are traveling by car, it's fine, but if you are doing air travel or train travel, unless you put the monitor in your clothing suitcase, it's just too darn big.\u00a0 It also takes up a lot of desk real estate, and unless you have lots of desk room, it's simply too much.\u00a0 But boy, it\u2019s pretty.\nI am notoriously hard on equipment since I travel over 100,000 air miles a year, and spend 150 nights a year in hotels, so I think the rugged design of the FMP should be a major consideration for buyers, and I think it will serve users well.\u00a0 It IS a little more expensive, but it's a very high quality LCD unit, and the dot pitch and resolution matches my laptop display nicely.\u00a0 At $289, it's about $50 more than the Toshiba unit after you add the $40 external power supply to the Toshiba, but it is a LOT more substantial, and is 1.4\" more display area as well.\nToshiba\u2019s Mobile Monitor was unveiled at CES this year, and it hit the market about six weeks ago ( http://bit.ly/tosmmt) .\u00a0 I was excited about it before I discovered the Field Monitor Pro, as there aren\u2019t many choices for mobile monitors in this area.\u00a0 Some things to consider about it:\n+ The case is a soft case, and I am not comfortable that it gives the LCD the protection it needs to survive planes, trains, and automobiles.\u00a0 Although it is an inexpensive device, it feels a little cheap\n+ Although it says that it will run off of USB power, and it technically will run off of USB power, it's in a very reduced brightness mode.\u00a0 As such, you will want to get the $40 optional external power brick so you can see the thing.\nThe other option is to use the approach of using desktop LCD displays with a CaseAce carrying case/harness.\u00a0 Although the form factors of these monitors are a little clunky, with the built-in stands of these LCD's protruding from the bottom of the devices, this is a workable solution for some. CaseAce is the brand I've been recommending for this - see http://bit.ly/caseace .\u00a0 While I don't advocate this use, it might be a way to recycle some of those 17\" and 19\" displays that you're phasing out for users in the office.\u00a0 I don't advocate this use unless these older monitors are in pristine condition and the users don\u2019t travel much , but it is an option if you have to improvise.\nAs a side note, I now carry a 12' HDMI cable with me on the road so I can use the LCD TV in most hotel rooms as a second monitor (since my laptop has an HDMI port).\u00a0 This is particularly useful for watching Hulu and iTunes shows on the tube if you are not on a schedule where you can watch normal prime time TV.\u00a0 The big displays are also excellent for reviewing images of scanned documents - they'll keep you from going blind trying to stare at monitors.\nSummary:\nFirst choice - Field Monitor Pro $289 @ www.mmt2.com .\u00a0 The right tool, and ruggedized for your protection.\nSecond choice - Samsung LD220 ($160 @ staples ( http://bit.ly/LD220 ), add a $70 case to get to $230) (assuming you don't do much air travel)\nThird choice \u2013 CaseAce monitor harness ( http://bit.ly/caseace ), plus a desktop LCD.

However, users are usually required to install a so-called plugin.\nWeb 3D also can refer to technology that allows to browser the Web in 3D. See visualization .\nSee also:\n3D interactive environment , Desk-top virtual reality and 3D file formats .\nOverview of web 3D technologies\nOne may distinguish several kinds of technologies and that are not really comparable since the fulfill different needs.\nWikipedia (retrieved 11:00, 2 September 2010 (CEST)) suggests to use four different criteria:\nSimplicity (Automatic Installation, rates facilities already high)\nCompatibility (Windows, Mac, Unix ..)\nQuality (Performances, see Frames per second , and indirectly display quality)\nInteractivity (Depending on the solutions, their programming opportunities, the creators of content have more or less freedom in the creation of interactivity.)\nWe add to this list:\nStandardization (which is very important in education, since contents should last for decades). Standardization includes interaction with other standards, such as HTML , HTTP (URLs), ECMAScript , MPEG , etc.\nExpressiveness, i.e. what types of contents can be defined and rendered. See also interactivity above, i.e. what can be changed dynamically (anything as in X3D or only some things as in gaming engines)\nFormat, i.e. weather the technology is a format or a programming API (or some of both)\nVRML and X3D\n3D on the Web began in it's very beginning. The major impulse for VRML , the Virtual Reality Modeling Language, can be traced back to a birds of the feature sessions on Virtual Reality Markup Languages at the First International Conference on the World-Wide-Web, May 25-27, 1994 at CERN in Geneva.\nIt's conceptual origins are older, e.g. (a) Science Fiction literature (e.g. [Gibson, 1994], [Stephenson, 1992]), (b) Mark Pesce's, P. Kennard's and Toni Parisi's Labyrinth system ([Pesce et al., 1994]) and proposal for a 3-D navigation and representation scheme and (c) more generally 3-D computer graphics (including VR). Based upon SGI's Open Inventor format, a almost final draft for VRML 1.0 was presented at the second WWW conference in fall 94 in Chicago. On April 3, 1995 SGI presented WebSpace, the first publicly available VRML browser. So all in all it took about a year to set standards and make the first browser available. In 2007, VRML became an ISO standard.\nVRML never caught on very much, because it's flexibility made it difficult to write rendering engines that were fast. In opposition, early gaming engines just could render tunnels (with textures) and weapons and were fast because of this specialization. Of course, in the 1990's most PC's didn't have 3D graphics boards and those who did, were both very slow and very expensive compared to modern boards. In addition, interfaces with web browsers, i.e. the HTML page in which the 3D scene is embedded were unreliable and not standardized. This was also a major flaw, since it is important to be able to combine interactive 2D and 3D contents. Finally, 3D companies ought to be able to plan for the long term since writing flexible rendering engines cans take years. Without the backing of large company, this is not possible.\nIn 2001, the Web3D Consortium started work on X3D and a first release was published in 2003. X3D is a revision of VRML in modular form. It supports both XML and traditional VRML syntax. Most modules are now ISO standard s or almost.\nWebGL\nThe purpose of WebGL is to bring hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to the Web without plug-ins. In other words, web browsers will directly support 3D graphics and lessen the need to install plugins.\nCurrently, (Sept. 2010), Firefox 4Beta and WebKit\u00a0?Beta (Safara/Chrome) provide partial support. It is possible to install one of these versions in addition to the stable versions, but you'll have to carefully manage your profiles.\nWeb GL is based on the well know OpenGL graphics API.\nHTML5 / JavaScript APIs\nThe HTML canevas element allows for some 3D:\n\u201cThe The Canvas API is a client-side scripting technology to allow for the rich creation or alteration of raster images (bitmaps) . It uses vector-based programmatic methods to create shapes, gradients, and other graphical effects, and because it has no DOM, it can perform very quickly. Dedicated scripters can develop games or even full-featured applications using the Canvas API, alone or integrated into HTML or SVG. It is supported natively in most modern browsers (with script libraries extending support to all major browsers), and even on some mobile devices.\u201d ( Graphics (W3C, retrieved Sept. 2 2010).\nOther proposals (additions to the HTML5 DOM tree, or JavaScript extensions)\nGoogle promotes O3D . \u201cO3D is an open source (BSD license) JavaScript API[2] created by Google for creating interactive 3D graphics applications that run in a web browser window or in a XUL desktop application. O3D may be crafted for use in any application area, however it is geared towards games, advertisements, 3D model viewers, product demos, simulations, engineering applications, control and monitoring systems, or massive online virtual worlds. O3D is currently in Google's incubation lab, and is deployed as an experimental web browser plugin.\u201d (retrieved Sept. 2, 2010). Currently, a converter allows to load Collada files, an X3D-like interchange format sponsored by the entertainment industry. O3D sort of follows the same logic as Flash 3D , i.e. one has to write EcmaScript code.\nThe Web|3D consortium launched X3DOM in 2010. X3DOM \u201can experimental open source framework and runtime to support the ongoing discussion in the Web3D and W3C communities how an integration of HTML5 and declarative 3D content could look like. It tries to fulfill the current HTML5 specification for declarative 3D content and allows including X3D elements as part of any HTML5 DOM tree.\u201d ( X3DOM Blog , retrieved Sept. 2 2010).\nFlash\nFlash 10 (released in 2008) does have 3D capabilities, i.e. ActionScript classes and methodes. Prior to official 3D support, many 3rd party developers did release Flash 3D products most of which are programming libraries. These libraries remain more popular than Adobe's classes but they usually rely on Adobe's framework.\nThere is no official 3D authoring tool from Adobe. CS4 and CS5 only provide support for 3D animation of 2D objects.\nFlash is a popular technology for developing light-weight web games.\nAdobe also provides older Shockwave format.\nJava 3D\nAccording to Wikipedia (retrieved Sept. 2, 2010), \u201cJava 3D is a scene graph-based 3D application programming interface (API) for the Java platform. It runs atop either OpenGL or Direct3D. Compared to other solutions, Java 3D is not only a wrapper around these graphics APIs, but an interface that encapsulates the graphics programming using a real, object-oriented concept. Here a scene is constructed using a scene graph that is a representation of the objects that have to be shown. This scene graph is structured as a tree containing several elements that are necessary to display the objects. Additionally, Java 3D offers extensive spatialized sound support.\u201d\nQuickTime VR\nAccording to Wikipedia (retrieved 11:38, 2 September 2010 (CEST)), \u201cQuickTime VR (virtual reality) (also known as QTVR) is a type of image file format supported by Apple's QuickTime. It allows the creation and viewing of photographically captured panoramas and the exploration of objects through images taken at multiple viewing angles. It functions as a plugin for the standalone QuickTime Player, as well as working as a plugin for the QuickTime Web browser plugin.\u201d\n3DMLW\n3DMLW is format somewhat similar to X3D. They can be distinguised by two major features:\n3DMLW supports both 2D and 3D Contents, whereas X3D is meant to be embedded in HTML\n3DMLW allows .3ds, .obj, .an8, and .blend file formats for 3D models .\nIn 3DMLW scripting is with Lua , whereas in X3D it is JavaScript (in addition to interactive built-in elements of the X3D format).\nGaming engines\nSince most gaming engines support multi-users over the Internet, it shouldn't be difficult to integrate a client with a web browser.\nUnity has a Webplayer . According to Wikipedia (sept. 2010), \u201cUnity is an integrated authoring tool for creating 3D video games or other interactive content such as architectural visualizations or real-time 3D animations. Unity is similar to Director, Blender game engine, Virtools or Torque Game Builder in the sense that an integrated graphical environment is the primary method of development.\u201d\nX3D/VRML vs. proprietary formats\nBoth VRML and X3D never caught on a lot. Nevertheless, both formats are quite popular in education since they are flexible and powerful, declarative and standardized. Most proprietary Web 3D formats did not survive. A typical pattern is that a new 3D company makes a lot of noise for their proprietary format and then encounters some success then falls down to a smaller niche than VRML/X3D or bankruptcy. Examples were Active Worlds and now maybe Second Life .\nAnother typical pattern are the really big company planning to \"own the 3D world\". Typical examples are Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere. Both were hailed as solutions supported by all the might of these companies, but they are all dead.\nLet's see what will happen to Google's O3D, a particular difficult format to use, i.e. it's a JavaScript API and not a format. Such a strategy may be successful if end-user tools become available, like for Flash 3D or gaming engines, but probably it won't\u00a0:)\nFor the reason that both VRML/X3D did survive and are quite expressive, both formats also are used as reliable exchange format (in the same way that SVG is used for 2D]]). Examples coded in 1997 still run and examples from 1995 only need minor adjustments. X3D has much better HTML/JavaScript integration. Yet another reason to opt for these standardized formats.\nLinks\n"}, {"score": 590.47925, "uuid": "06619520-de5d-583f-8a28-97bd37a060dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-76-17711", "target_hostname": "www.insidehighered.com", "target_uri": "http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/09/18/barron", "page_rank": 1.2201246e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "&#x27;A <em>Better</em> Pencil&#x27; | Inside Higher Ed", "snippet": "Have you noticed any change -- for <em>better</em> <em>or</em> worse -- in your students&#x27; communicative styles and abilities as a result of such <em>technologies</em>?

No.", "explanation": null, "document": "Serena Golden\nIn this electronic age, new writing technologies seem to proliferate and evolve with alarming speed -- but of course, people have been coming up with new ways to communicate their thoughts for as long as language has existed at all. Writing itself -- writes Dennis Baron -- was once the object of much suspicion; Plato wrote that it could attenuate human memory, since writing things down would obviate the need to memorize them. In his new book, A Better Pencil: Readers, Writers, and the Digital Revolution (Oxford University Press), Baron looks at the history of writing implements and communication technologies, and explores the digital revolution's impact on how we write, how we learn, and how we connect with one another.\nBaron, professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, responded via email to questions about his book and how its themes relate to higher education today.\nQ: It seems that you\u2019ve embraced -- or at least been relatively quick to accept -- new writing practices for decades: in A Better Pencil you describe your own initial encounters with automatic typewriters (in the early \u201870s) and personal computers (in the early \u201880s). Did you find that your research for the book changed your attitude toward the progression of writing technology?\nA: I\u2019ve always loved writing and its technologies. My earliest memories of writing include typing on an old Remington portable on the floor of the living room when I was 5 or 6. I can still see the ink-clogged e\u2019s and o\u2019s. I also remember my first fountain pen, a marbled-maroon Esterbrook that I got for my 8th birthday. I remember the smell of the ink when I filled the pen (no cartridge refills back then), tangy, metallic, kind of like blood. And my first ball point, a Paper Mate in two-tone green, the same colors as my parents\u2019 1955 Chevy (I later inherited that car, and while I always hated the colors on the car, on the pen they were magical).\nBut enough nostalgia. I think the book really came about when I realized the connection between technologies of writing and literacy, the subject that I had originally set out to write on. I was reading all sorts of treatments of literacy in psychology, anthropology, sociology, education, law, engineering and history. I found the last two areas most influential: Michael Clanchy\u2019s story of the Norman introduction of writing into England as a way of doing business in the 11th and 12th centuries; William Harris\u2019s book on ancient literacy; Adrian Johns on the history of the book in England; and Henry Petroski\u2019s study of the pencil as a paradigm for engineering. Putting my own experiences with writing and its technologies together with these brilliant takes on literacy was the catalyst, and A Better Pencil is the result.\nQ: You are deeply skeptical of claims that new communication technologies such as e-mail and text-messaging will do any lasting damage to the English language. Have you noticed any change -- for better or worse -- in your students' communicative styles and abilities as a result of such technologies?\nA: Are students using the acronyms and emoticons we associate with txting in their academic work? No. In fact, they\u2019re not even using them in their texts and IMs. By the time they get to college, most students -- certainly the English majors -- have put away such childish things, and many of them had already abandoned such signs of middle-school immaturity in high school. It\u2019s kid stuff, plain and simple, and they\u2019re mightily embarrassed when their parents send them texts beginning \u201cwassup?\u201d and signed \u201cluv u.\u201d\nMore to the point, though, writers learn to adapt their style to the demands of their audience and the conventions of the genre in which they\u2019re writing. Some do it more successfully, or more quickly, but just as we speak differently to different audiences, we write differently too.\nWhich is not to say that technology has no impact on language. Writers love computers because the machine lets us shape our writing more easily than earlier tools did. Revision is less of a mental or physical strain; copy is always clean; and we can design the text by choosing fonts, colors, and styles, if we\u2019ve a mind to do that. Of course there\u2019s a down side to this: clean copy, text that looks like published prose, can lull us into thinking that what we\u2019ve written is actually ready for publication.\nAs for how computers change writing behavior, I\u2019ve started asking students to e-mail me their papers as attachments. I make marginal comments as I read them on the screen, then e-mail the paper back to the student. I find that I make a lot more comments this way, but I wonder, though, if students pay any more attention to those comments than they did to the comments I used to make in my illegible handwriting on their hard copies.\nBut I suppose the greatest impact of computers and the Net is that more people than ever are writing, creating text rather than just copying it. Some critics worry about giving the masses such unprecedented access to publication. Doomsayers accuse these hordes of semi-pro writers of threatening high culture, fomenting revolution, destroying the language, contributing to the information glut, stealing credit cards, selling us products we don\u2019t need, purveying hate and filth, or simply taking up unnecessary bandwidth.\nOf course the other innovations that promised to put an end to life as we know it -- movies, radio, television, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, Webster\u2019s Third, even writing itself, all turned out to be pretty indispensable. Plato warned us in the Phaedrus that writing was dangerous because it weakened memory, and the written word was just a bare shadow of reality it stood for. We remember this, of course, because Plato wrote it down.\nQ: And how have they changed the format and content of your own teaching?\nA: I\u2019ve begun teaching in classrooms with overhead computer projectors, a good sound system, and wi-fi connections. I bring my laptop, plug it in, and we\u2019re ready to go. But my classes are mostly talk, supplemented by what\u2019s on the screen. I\u2019ve always showed lots of visuals when I teach, so it\u2019s a snap to put up slides on a PowerPoint (pictures, charts, videos, news articles -- not my talking points -- students still have to listen to me and take notes, and they have to talk about the topics as well). Students do lots of presentations in my class, so they too take advantage of the hook-ups, either using my laptop or their own for their talks. And lots of students sit in class taking notes on their laptops, or checking their Facebook pages.\nQ: You describe in detail a class exercise in which you assign students to write on a tablet of modeling clay. What inspired you to create this assignment, and what do you hope your students will take away from it?\nA: I took that assignment from an exercise that a graduate student did in a class I taught many years ago. I can\u2019t remember which student did this -- maybe she\u2019ll read the book, or this interview, and come forward so I can give her the credit she deserves.\nA few years later, when I began teaching courses in technology and literacy, I adapted that exercise, because writing with an unfamiliar technology -- one that used be mainstream -- forces us to pay attention to many aspects of the physical act of writing that have become automatic for us. We\u2019re not used to having to prepare our own writing surface before we write. We\u2019re not used to carving our text -- that\u2019s something which makes us retool our already shaky handwriting skills in the interests of readability. Clay\u2019s got no real cut-and-paste, so we have to figure out how to correct or revise the clay text when we find a mistake or think of a better way to say something. We\u2019re not used to estimating how many of our words might fit on a small writing surface. Or figuring out how to preserve or transport our \u201cclay tablets\u201d when we\u2019re done with them (you can\u2019t easily put your clay \u201ccomposition\u201d on your refrigerator at home, one student discovered).\nI find that writing on clay also brings out the artist in many of the students. They take pains to shape the writing surface into something resembling a rectangle of paper, or into something more three-dimensional, a stele, a cylinder (one student even \u201cwrote\u201d a clay version of \u201cThe Scream\u201d). Many students decorate the text with little clay flourishes when they\u2019re done writing. Some students do their task individually, while others form a team, assigning parts of the task to each participant, fusing their texts together to form a larger tablet or a scroll when they\u2019re done.\nIn the end, in addition to this great intellectual exercise, what the students take home with them is a hunk of clay to play with, and the conviction that, back in the day, clay writers had it really, really tough.\nQ: While A Better Pencil doesn\u2019t really tackle online education, you do express your belief that \u201ccomputers won\u2019t take the place of conventional, face-to-face lessons in American schools any more than earlier technologies did.\u201d Do you include postsecondary schools in this assessment?\nA: The telephone was supposed to revolutionize education, bringing lectures, concerts, and current events into our homes so we didn\u2019t have to go to an auditorium, or a classroom, or even read the papers. Then there was radio, beaming knowledge to our set tops. And TV: remember \u201cSunrise Semester\u201d? As a child I occasionally watched bleary-eyed at 6 a.m. while someone from the state university gave a series of canned lectures on algebra or the water cycle or French on network TV (it was the 1950s, there were still programming slots to fill). Adults could get college credit for this. Most didn\u2019t. Phones, radio, and TV all remain essential elements in our culture; they\u2019re just not particularly good at schooling us.\nNow it\u2019s the computer\u2019s turn. Yes, I interact with students via e-mail and the Web. And computers can be great for teaching when it\u2019s difficult or impossible for students to get to a brick-and-mortar classroom. But for me, teaching involves f2f (there, you see, I\u2019ve gone and used a computer term in a sentence). I want to listen to students talking to me, to one another, having a spontaneous conversation about the subject. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s energizing. Online, I just don\u2019t feel that kind of electricity. It\u2019s probably just a personal preference.\nBut I do see some significant downsides to distance education. It\u2019s touted for all the wrong reasons. It\u2019s cheap: yes, perhaps, if you discount the price of the technology (it turns out that computers cost more than people, that computer techs cost more than entry-level instructors, and that software costs more, not less, than textbooks, and it must be constantly upgraded).\nComputers are interactive, or at least they can be, but is the student at home interacting with and getting feedback from an expert instructor or assembly-line workers being paid by the piece and being evaluated by how many dollars they bring in?\nDistance education lets students \u201cwork at their own pace.\u201d But face it, how many students are motivated enough to sit down at the computer to do their lessons when there are so many other distractions at home; or when they come home after a hard day (or night) working and have to take care of family needs before sitting down at the laptop? I fear that completion rates for many online courses are still disappointingly low, that the quality of much of the education is also lower than what happens in the classroom -- of course I\u2019m thinking about the kinds of courses that I am my colleagues teach, ones which don\u2019t require memorization of a body of knowledge but instead call for analysis, speculation, exploration. Courses where reading is intensive, where group discussion produces many insights, and where evaluation can\u2019t be done by machine.\nAs for computers in secondary schools, there\u2019s a lot of variation in how they get used: everything from a couple of machines at the back of the classroom that students are allowed to play on when they\u2019re do with their work, to intensive group projects involving computer research, collaborative writing, graphics, sound and video. A lot depends on how creative and flexible the instructor can be, and whether the school system puts too many obstacles in the way of students getting on line. I\u2019ve found in working with the secondary schools that they set up firewalls because they\u2019re afraid students will look at bad stuff, or to keep them safe from predators. But such obstacles really shut down much of what computers can do for students, and of course, once the kids get home and use computers there, the firewalls tend to disappear, which reinforces the message that what happens in school has very little to do with what happens in life.\nQ: You sound relatively lukewarm about Google\u2019s controversial books project; are there other recent developments in educational technology that you find particularly intriguing?\nA: Here\u2019s my objection to the Google book project. First, I think it\u2019s great to digitize as much nondigital text as possible. I take advantage of many of the online databases with digitized newspapers, early printed books, and manuscripts. What I don\u2019t like is that Google is poised to monopolize text. No one entity should have that kind of power over the word. Not only does Google intend to profit from this kind of control (it answers to its stockholders, not to the public), it would have the power to manipulate the text under its control, deciding who can and cannot see it, what can be displayed, what can be erased.\nWhen Amazon reached into readers\u2019 Kindles recently and wiped bootleg copies of 1984 many readers screamed. But I read a lot of the online comments about the Amazon fiasco, and while Amazon eventually apologized for its behavior, many commenters were convinced that the company was well within its rights to take back text that it had merely \u201cleased\u201d to users under a digital rights management agreement.\nLibraries \u201clease\u201d books to us when we borrow them, but libraries are different from Google and Amazon. Plus, they\u2019re all not-for-profit. The goal of the library is to spread the word, not control it. And libraries are not in the repo business: when you have an overdue book, the librarian doesn\u2019t break down your door and swipe it from the kitchen table or from your nightstand.\nMany if not most libraries are government-run, and the financial books of public libraries are as open to the public as their novels, their reference collection, and their how-to books. But even in the current political climate, I don\u2019t hear conservatives yelling that public libraries represent \u201csocialized literacy.\u201d Google, on the other hand, is both private and secretive. You won\u2019t need top-level security clearance to get into the library, but good luck getting past the metal detector at the Googleplex, and even if you do, its corporate secrets will always remain a closed book to most of us.\nThe sorts of operations that Google and Amazon represent are important to how we use computers, and they make a vital contribution to our economy. But while they have been important in shaping our literacy practices, they should not get to dictate them.\nSo far as the next great app goes, I can\u2019t predict what it will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re never going to come to the end of communications technology road. Maybe we\u2019ll get to the point in the next decade or two where speech to text will eliminate the keyboard \u2013 now that\u2019s something that will revolutionize the composition process, bringing us full circle to the days when authors dictated their texts to scribes.\nBut I suspect that even so, writers won\u2019t go back to the days of Homer\u2019s oral composition, or the dictations of Milton or Wordsworth. Instead they\u2019ll find a way to spin the new technology in some unforeseen direction, one that will bring howls of anger from their critics, and shouts of wonder from their fans, while most everybody else will do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to sit on the sidelines and wait to see whether this next-big-thing pans out or not.\n"}, {"score": 590.0969, "uuid": "3337febc-081b-57c7-b44b-cd1e41184e03", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0716wb-31-32049", "target_hostname": "uwelectioneye.seattletimes.com", "target_uri": "http://uwelectioneye.seattletimes.com/category/technology/", "page_rank": 1.2574294e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Technology</em> | Seattle Times Newspaper", "snippet": "But now <em>technology</em> has caught up to the horse race.

Sometimes that is because someone has intentionally disrupted a campaign\u2019s public message. Sometimes it is a campaign\u2019s own fault.\nConsider an example of Instance #1: In 2003 during an interview , Rick Santorum spoke about homosexuality and bestiality in the same breath. In response, Dan Savage of The Stranger created and promoted a site that redefined Santorum\u2019s name into a substance I would rather not describe.\nFor a long time, Savage\u2019s site, spreadingsantorum.com , came in as the first result on the results pages for various search engines. It\u2019s taken awhile but Santorum\u2019s main campaign site has now replaced Savage\u2019s for the first spot on the results page.\nSimilar \u201ccampaign disruption\u201d sites have been created to target other Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , and Ron Paul . However, these sites do not rank very highly on the results page, and in the case of Paul, the site is actually positive: it claims Ron Paul=Champion of the Constitution.\nPaul has a different search engine problem, which is an example of Instance #2: his own campaign is ineffectively promoting Paul.\nSites from top to bottom: RonPaul2012.com, RonPaul.com, RonRaul.org, DailyPaul.com\nA web search for \u201cRon Paul\u201d will produce a barrage of sites, and at first glance it is near impossible to discern which site is the official Paul campaign site. All of the results sound legitimate enough: ronpaul.com , ronpaul2012.com , ronpaul.org , ronpaulforpresident2012.com , and ronpaul2012.net , just to name a few.\nThe internet presence of candidates is crucial in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Having a centralized web identity is paramount for two reasons.\nFirst, it\u2019s about consistency of message. Voters go to websites to learn about a candidate\u2019s personal story and to learn about their stance on issues. For a candidate like Paul, who has literally stayed on message since the 1960s, having any inconsistency across the sites is problematic.\nFor example, curious individuals who go to RonPaul2012.com and want to know more about health care are met with two clear, concise messages: \u201cDo no harm,\u201d and \u201cFreedom not force.\u201d The first talks briefly about Paul\u2019s professional history as a doctor and his commitment to this principle of medicine. The latter zones in on Paul\u2019s desire to repeal the Obama administration\u2019s health care law and lays out an exacting plan of how he will work with Congress in a short list of bullet points.\nHowever, someone who goes to RonPaul.com in search of health care information encounters a somewhat rambling message interspersed with videos, transcripts, and excerpts before concluding with a 16-point plan.\nRonPaul2012.com is the campaign\u2019s official site and RonPaul.com is a fan site, but the two contend for the first position on the search-engine results page, followed by a litany of other sites. (Try googling \u201cRon Paul,\u201d which site do you get first?) For the casual searcher, it can be confusing which to pick. And for a candidate, looking to get an exact message to potential voters, it can be damaging if the searcher selects the fan site first.\nThe other crucial aspect of a centralized campaign site is distributing and disseminating consistent information about events.\nWhen voters, supporters, or interested citizens want to know more about a candidate\u2019s event schedule, they often go to their website. This approach makes perfect sense. But when there are multiple websites with different event information, things are no longer simple.\nTop image: RonPaul2012.com events page. Bottom image: RonPaul.com events page.\nThe official Paul site has timely event postings, documenting his rallies and appearances for the next few days. The site also integrates various Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Google Maps, and iCal options so users can get event information to social networks, map locations of events, or add it to their personal calendar.\nAs for the other sites, forget about fancy integration: they don\u2019t even have events. The fan site doesn\u2019t have any events listed until Election Day. For the casual searcher, it is confusing.\nWe have all heard that Paul has a devoted, young following who, because of their generational familiarity with technology, are able to surf the interwebs and find his official site with the desired event information. Such folks arrived en masse at Paul\u2019s SeaTac rally this past Thursday. But for the casual supporter or person who wants to experience Paul-mania in person, Paul\u2019s multiplying web presence can be tricky to navigate.\nPaul may want \u2014 and need \u2014 to take a page from Santorum\u2019s playbook on getting the real Ron Paul to come in first.\nPosted from Seattle, Washington, United States\n"}, {"score": 587.17554, "uuid": "4bf5f264-2478-5348-b4af-09abed38d7d8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-57-08654", "target_hostname": "www.matjjin-nehen.com", "target_uri": "http://www.matjjin-nehen.com/category/technology/", "page_rank": 1.6762215e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Technology</em> \u00bb matjjin-nehen", "snippet": "In addition to mobile phone applications for dictionaries of endangered languages, we think we can probably make downloadable programs for other devices, like iPods, and mobile phones that run Android (<em>Google\u2019s</em> open-source and free answer to <em>Apple\u2019s</em> iPhone).", "explanation": null, "document": "1 Comment\nThis week, an argument has been being waged in the Opinion section of the Sydney Morning Herald about the effect of the internet on language. It started with an article on Tuesday about Australian author Cate Kennedy, who fears literature is being threatened by the internet . She\u2019s referring specifically to writers who become addicted to being online and therefore cannot put as much effort into their art.\nFair conclusion.\nOn the Wednesday, the following letter appeared.\nEnglish mangled\nI agree with Cate Kennedy\u2019s criticism of the effect of the internet on literature, but it spreads further than that, with technology affecting the entire English language (\u201cA click too far: the internet\u2019s toxic effect on literature\u201d, April 13). The internet and its ease of communication has shaped English into a pseudo-speech characterised by grammatical errors and inaccuracies in syntax, punctuation and commonsense. Where is the line drawn between beneficial advancement and irreversible side effects? Will our desire for progress come at the sake of our language?\nAnna Pavlakis Greenwich\nI read this and thought \u2018enough is enough\u2019, and replied with this letter which appeared the following day:\nLoose language is not the end of civilisation\n1\nEvery so often a letter appears decrying the demise of English due either to some generation younger than that of the letter writer, or to technology such as mobile phones and the internet.\nWhen these letters appear, I read them aloud to my colleagues, always to their amusement. But on reading Anna Pavlakis\u2019s letter (April 14), I decided it was about time we put an end to this nonsense.\nEnglish is not becoming a \u201cpseudo-speech\u201d. Technology is not causing its demise. Young people who cannot accurately place an apostrophe, or who think \u201cshould\u2019ve\u201d is a contraction of \u201cshould of\u201d, will not bring about the inevitable destruction of Anglophone civilisation.\nThe easy way to respond to these ludicrous claims is to cite the continual evolution of living languages. Such change is neither good nor bad; it just is.\nSecond, most people have always had difficulty with English \u2013 ask any high school English teacher. Such difficulties were not created by technology, they are merely more visible.\nFor most English speakers this doesn\u2019t matter. Advanced skills in such a horrible language as English are necessary only for a small percentage of people, and only then because we arbitrarily attach prestige to a standard form of the English language that retains a plethora of irregularities and archaic forms and is therefore very difficult to master.\nWith this in mind, the internet is actually the great democratiser, allowing many more people than ever before to gain access to privilege by removing the arbitrary barrier of English linguistic mastery.\nAidan Wilson Department of Linguistics, University of Sydney\nAnd this morning, I opened up to the letters page to find no less than three responses to my letter.\nNothing can come of nothing\n2\nI can just see my year 9 English class when I tell them Aidan Wilson thinks most of us don\u2019t need advanced English skills (Letters, April 15). Even better when I mention hopefully that the internet makes for a more democratic society. \u201cFantastic,\u201d they will say and toss away their quaintly \u201carchaic\u201d novels that I make them read, to feast instead on the dross online.\nYes, language is not static and can accommodate the influence of technology, but \u201clol\u201d and (: will not cut it when my students need solutions to problems requiring complex and precise language skills. By having no standards we are reduced to the lowest common denominator. How depressing. What\u2019s wrong with trying to master complex things? Are we becoming dumber? Maybe it is the end of civilisation as we know it.\nCathy Hooke Ashfield\nAs a former English teacher I take umbrage at Aidan Wilson\u2019s diatribe. Has Mr Wilson ever read Chaucer or Shakespeare? The wealth of vocabulary, beauty and \u201cinfinite variety\u201d of the English language are evident in the magnificence of our literary tradition, which is sadly being lost because of the widespread use and abuse of modern technologies.\nFor shame! Mr Wilson is promulgating superficial and base ideas about the English language.\nMichele Linkiewicz Caringbah\n3\nof Sydney University that they can \u201cput an end to this nonsense\u201d (moral panic about civilisation being destroyed by slovenly English expression) by anything so simple as a letter to the Herald.

I don\u2019t suppose they would accept my observations as scientific evidence, but, over 40 years as a seconary [sic] school teacher, I have noticed that pupils\u2019 written work was always superior to their parents\u2019 writing, as evidenced by the standard of absence notes. Indeed, excellent English in an absence note was a pretty good indication of a forgery.\nRaymond McDonald Stanmore\nPerhaps Raymond McDonald is right; I am probably jousting with windmills by writing a letter, but you can\u2019t blame me for having a go!\nThe titles of the letters, by the way, are the creation of the letters page editors, and not the letter writers.\nI\u2019m not even sure what this is meant to mean!\nLinguisticians.

The hosted collaboration and communication suite includes applications for e-mail, calendar, office productivity, intranet, video sharing and discussion forums.\nThe Pitch\nGoogle Apps Premier offers enterprises cloud-based messaging and collaboration software intended to cost less and to be simpler to deploy and manage than on-premise systems. Unlike the free Standard edition, Premier offers IT management tools to support enterprise software integration, user provisioning and migration among its capabilities.\nAt first, CIOs didn\u2019t bite, but during the past three years, Google has steadily strengthened Premier\u2019s features and security. Today, customers include companies as diverse as Genentech and Fairchild Semiconductor ( FCS ), with thousands of users.\nRajen Sheth, a Google Apps senior product manager, says Gmail has been Premier\u2019s main attraction, but now Google is beefing up its Docs office productivity suite to better compete with Microsoft ( MSFT ) Office. \u201cIt\u2019s an area we\u2019re ready to delve into a lot more deeply now,\u201d Sheth says. \u201cGoing forward, we\u2019ll be able to offer them a choice for office productivity.\u201d\nThe catch\nIBM ( IBM ) and Microsoft are moving fast to tweak their Lotus Notes and Exchange products\u2014as well as release new ones\u2014to provide the cost savings and management benefits of hosted suites like Google Apps.\nMeanwhile, end users may resist the switch from familiar applications. The Schumacher Group, a healthcare company, bought 2,000 Premier seats to provide e-mail for doctors who are independent contractors. But full-time employees are sticking with Exchange, in part to avoid the change-management process, says CIO Douglas Menefee.\nThe city of Orlando, Fla., trained 3,000 users on Premier Gmail, calendar and contacts. But Google Docs will wait until PCs deployed two years ago with Microsoft Office 2007 are no longer usable, CIO Conrad Cross says.\nThe usual concerns about cloud computing \u2014whether storing data off-premise is secure, and worries about bugs, outages and performance issues over which IT departments have no control\u2014also apply.\nWhat\u2019s more, say CIOs, Google has much to learn about cultivating relationships with enterprise customers. Omnetic, the Schumacher Group\u2019s Premier reseller and integrator, enjoys good communication with enterprise engineers at Google, and Menefee has sales contacts there. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel I have solid communications with Google from the support and engineering perspectives,\u201d he says.\nThe score\nNucleus Research analyst Rebecca Wettemann says Google has moved quickly in the past year to make Apps Premier a viable choice for CIOs. \u201cGoogle has taken important steps in terms of usability, performance, reliability and, most important, providing guidance to enterprises on how to deploy these tools effectively,\u201d she says.\nHowever, there\u2019s no simple answer for CIOswho wonder if the suite is a good fit for their companies. \u201cYou have to know what the cost of providing the service internally is,\u201d Cross says. \u201cOtherwise, you won\u2019t know what your savings will be and why it would be to your advantage to adopt Apps.\u201d\nCross also warns that while ditching an on-premise system for Apps reduces the IT staff\u2019s internal server-maintenance work, it doesn\u2019t mean IT executives can abdicate their management roles.

Instead, randomly select the variation to present to a user in proportion to the probability that this variation is the best based on the data (if any) you have so-far.\nHow? The key is the beta distribution . Let\u2019s say you have a variation with 30 impressions, and 5 conversions. A beta distribution with (alpha=5, beta=30-5) describes the probability distribution for the actual conversion rate. It looks like this:\nThis shows that while the most likely conversion rate is about 1 in 6 (approx 0.16), the curve is relatively broad indicating that there is still a lot of uncertainty about what the conversion rate will be.\nLet\u2019s try the same for 50 conversions and 300 impressions (alpha=50, beta=300-50)\u201d):\nYou\u2019ll see that while the curve\u2019s peak remains the same, the curve gets a lot narrower, meaning that we\u2019ve got a lot more certainty about what the actual conversion rate is \u2013 as you would expect given 10X the data.\nLet\u2019s say we have 5 variations, each with various numbers of impressions and conversions. A new user arrives at our website, and we want to decide which variation we show them.\nTo do this we employ a random number generator, which will pick random numbers according to a beta distribution we provide to it. You can find open source implementations of such a random number generator in most programming languages, here is one for Java .\nSo we go through each of our variations, and pick a random number within the beta distribution we\u2019ve calculated for that variation. Whichever variation gets the highest random number is the one we show.\nThe beauty of this approach is that it achieves a really nice, perhaps optimal compromise between sending traffic to new variations to test them, and sending traffic to variations that we know to be good. If a variation doesn\u2019t perform well this algorithm will gradually give it less and less traffic, until eventually it\u2019s getting none. Then we can remove it secure in the knowledge that we aren\u2019t removing it prematurely, no need to set arbitrary significance thresholds.\nThis approach is easily extended to situations where rather than a simple impression-conversion funnel, we have funnels with multiple steps.\nOne question is, before you\u2019ve collected any data about a particular variation, what should you \u201cinitialize\u201d the beta distribution with. The default answer is (1, 1), since you can\u2019t start with (0, 0). This effectively starts with a \u201cprior expectation\u201d of a 50% conversion rate, but as you collect data this will rapidly converge on reality.\nNonetheless, we can do better. Let\u2019s say that we know that variations tend to have a 1% conversion rate, so you could start with (1,99).\nIf you really want to take this to an extreme (which is what we do in our software!), let\u2019s say you have an idea of the normal distribution of the conversion rates, let\u2019s say its 1% with a standard deviation of 0.5%.\nNote that starting points of (1,99), or (2,198), or (3,297) will all give you a starting mean of 1%, but the higher the numbers, the longer they\u2019ll take to converge away from the mean. If you plug these into Wolfram Alpha (\u201cbeta distribution (3,297)\u201d) it will show you the standard deviation for each of them. (1,99) is 0.0099, (2,198) is 0.007, (3, 297) is 0.00574, (4, 396) is 0.005 and so on.\nSo, since we expect the standard deviation of the actual conversion rates to be 0.5% or 0.005, we know that starting with (4, 396) is about right.\nYou could find a smart way to find the starting beta parameters with the desired standard deviation, but it\u2019s easier and effective to just do it experimentally as I did.\n"}], [{"score": 582.5413, "uuid": "8e56a374-b478-5fd5-853d-a45d93aadbd5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-15-18227", "target_hostname": "www.banktech.com", "target_uri": "http://www.banktech.com/blogs/archives/2010/01", "page_rank": 1.2567986e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Blogs - Bank Systems &amp; <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "at CES Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers explored some of the ways <em>technology</em> makes our lives <em>better</em>, just before Steve Ballmer&#x27;s keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show this week.", "explanation": null, "document": "Three Approaches to Combatting Enterprise Fraud\nJanuary 22, 2010 @ 09:07 AM | By Christine Hintze\nBy David Nussenbaum, vice president, ACI Worldwide Fraud is on the rise and it's expected to accelerate in the wake of the global financial crisis, with not just cards but other bank products and channels being targets for criminals.

But unlike Siri, which is only loaded on the latest iPhone, Evi is available as an app for the iPhone and phones running Google's Android software.\nSiri and other personal assistants are still fairly limited. As they become more popular, established companies and startups will need to expand the range of tasks they can perform. True Knowledge is hoping the semantic database it has built up over the past few years could provide this edge.\nEvi's availability and promise as an artificial intelligence app, coupled with its low price (99 cents on the iPhone and free on Android phones), caused its popularity to skyrocket following its Monday release, and made it difficult for those downloading it to try it out. Evi isn't the only Siri competitor\u2014and in fact its capabilities are somewhat different from Siri's offerings\u2014but plenty of smart-phone users, it seems, are eager for Evi's help in particular.\nEvi uses a platform with hundreds of millions of data points that True Knowledge developed over several years (initially for Web search). Information in this database has been tagged to add meaning and context. For example, Apple is classified as a \"company\" and Tim Cook is classified as a \"person\" and a \"CEO.\" True Knowledge founder and CEO William Tunstall-Pedoe says this allows the app to understand all sorts of things\u2014people, places, buildings, colors, and more\u2014and how they interact, which helps the app find the right answer for a wide range of questions. In addition to all this information, Evi, like Siri, can access data on some outside websites.\nEssentially, the app takes your spoken or typed question and uses its vast store of knowledge along with outside data from websites like Yelp to give pertinent answers. This is similar to how Siri works, but Apple's assistant focuses more on accomplishing tasks, such as making calls, setting alerts, or dictating text messages, by working with the iPhone's other apps. Evi does not do these things, but Tunstall-Pedoe says it will eventually be able to take on more tasks.\n"}, {"score": 577.89355, "uuid": "f5ea3afd-c964-589e-91a3-4f5e9a0d0417", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0405wb-62-01266", "target_hostname": "wulibraries.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://wulibraries.typepad.com/digitalgateway/technology/", "page_rank": 1.4255505e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "Digital Gateway: <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "NPR&#x27;s as a matter of fact posted these drawings of <em>Google&#x27;s</em> book scanner.

Give it to me.\nSteven Colbert, The Colbert Report,\nJanuary 26, 2010\nApple's iTablet (or probably called, it seems to me, iPad ) is expected to be announced later today. So this is my last opportunity to write something about it without knowing what it is, exactly. But the truth is, we won't know what it is for a while, as was the case with the original announcement with the iPod. I recall being underwhelmed with the unveiling of the iPod. Maybe because bringing music with me wasn't going to change my life. But I wasn't the only one who damned it with faint praise. No one could see at the time that that it was going to take off as a product, and re-define the MP3 player market, in part by creating the iTunes (now the world's largest music retailer) culture to support it.\nThis time around, we know not just to look at the gadget itself, but the role it will play in a networked media environment. And there has been much speculation about the tablet's capabilities, but especially the media libraries that will be available to it, including video and formerly traditional print vehicles like Time magazine. In addition to the speculation, there has been one outright confirmation, from Terry McGraw of McGraw-Hill Publishers on CNBC:\n\u201cYeah, Very exciting. Yes, they\u2019ll make their announcement tomorrow on this one. We have worked with Apple for quite a while. And the Tablet is going to be based on the iPhone operating system and so it will be transferable. So what you are going to be able to do now is we have a consortium of e-books. And we have 95% of all our materials that are in e-book format on that one. So now with the tablet you\u2019re going to open up the higher education market, the professional market. The tablet is going to be just really terrific.\u201d\n(quote courtesy of crunchgear )\nE-books have never not been horrible. They're difficult to read on the screen, and until recently they were mostly only as portable as a laptop (not very) and unless ebooks or etexts leverage some other computer-powered capability like search across libraries, they have seemed fairly pointless (at least to me). I will always remember David Seaman describing the experience of reading etexts on the Windows handheld as \"surprisingly non-horrible.\" That was as good as it got. In any case, the rise of the e-book was threatening to erradicate the phrase \"pleasure reading\" from modern parlance.\nE-book readers have improved over the years. The Kindle certainly gave page-like lighting, and came with a iTunes-like library for easy acquisition of content. But the cost of the Kindle still seems too high for a dedicated device; and unlike music in an iPod (for most people, what they want to do with music is play it) text almost requires interaction. You want to do things with it. The first thing you want to be able to do is pick it up to read it. So far so good with the Kindle. And I believe you can also annotate. But another fundamental difference with the iPod is to music as the Kindle is to books analogy is that the iPod didn't force you to listen to your music only on that device. Apple in fact made it easy to use that same music in, for instance, creating a multimedia slideshow of photographs in other applications. And the \"more\" you really want to do with text is not just to write in the margins, but copy and share (at least fair-use size snippets!) to use in some other format.\nNo college student will make the Kindle part of a student workflow (if such a thing exists) if they can't use it directly in connection with their work, and if Kindle content can't interact with other media. All the other things this tablet will be able to do in terms of multimedia and access to content libraries will certainly help expand its market and appeal. It matters less whether you'll be able to write an actual term paper on this device (though likely you will; I'd think physical keyboards will be able to connect to it) than that you'll be able to send the notes you create from the content you read and hear to a place where you can; and that alone will make this device (and those that copy it) a commonplace first for college and later for secondary education as well. But we'll see after today.\nAs for the Kindle?

Now there\u2019s a new and very important enhancement: the ability to invite customers into Private Chatter Groups for cross-company collaboration around customers\u2019 issues. Salesforce Chatter is a B2B equivalent of Facebook (that also integrates well with Twitter, Facebook, et al). You can see a good, current demo given to Rackspace\u2019s Robert Scoble in late August, 2011 here . (Thanks, Robert!)\nSalesforce\u2019s enterprise social media strategy is simple and seductive:\n1) Give employees social media tools that are integrated with the enterprise applications they already use as well as with external social media tools like Facebook and Twitter.\n2) Ensure that your employees have visibility into their clients\u2019 companies\u2019 and individuals\u2019 social media activity so they\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on with their clients\u2019 companies and with their individual customers.\n3) NEW: Enable employees to invite customers into private social groups for customer interactions. These can be customer-account-specific groups to work collaboratively and in an ad hoc manner on customers\u2019 issues or proposals. They can also be private groups of customers who are working on a common project with your subject matter experts. This is the kind of collaborative support that\u2019s perfect for supporting the ongoing work of Customer Advisory Boards and Customer Innovation Teams.\nWhat I like about the new version of Chatter is that you can create private groups of employees + customers from MULTIPLE customer accounts. Think about a customer advisory board or a group of customer co-designers who are providing input and feedback to your strategy and your product directions. All you need is your customers\u2019 email addresses in order to invite them. They can accept the invitation whether or not Salesforce.com Chatter is used within their own organizations. You\u2019ll be able to share files and do real-time screen sharing and collaboration with the members of the group. Everyone from your company who joins in the conversations will KNOW that this is a group that includes customers. So they\u2019ll engage in appropriate behavior. But the interactions will be more casual, more ad hoc, more free-flowing, and they can be tagged with keywords that will make it easy for members to follow (or subscribe to) the conversation threads they\u2019re interested in.\nSalesforce.com has also made Chatter part of its Force.com platform with an open API (REST), using its Heroku (Ruby on Rails) integration. So third-party developers will be able to write applications that build on the Chatter foundation.\nWill Inviting Customers into Chatter Turn the Salesforce.com Ecosystem into a Customer Ecosystem?\nWe\u2019ve been longtime fans of Salesforce.com\u2019s fantastic ecosystem of applications, developers, partners, and consultants\u2014known as Force.com\u2014and its AppExchange (which pre-dated Apple\u2019s App Store). What\u2019s been missing for us is the fact that the Salesforce ecosystem has been designed to be ABOUT end-customers, not FOR end-customers. Most of the applications in the Salesforce.com ecosystem help companies manage their relationships with customers. There are few offerings that help END-CUSTOMERS manage their relationships with their suppliers.\nNow, customers get to participate, too! We like the friction-free support for cross-company collaboration that Salesforce now offers with the new version of Chatter. This may be the way that customers gain more visibility into the conversations, interactions, and workflows that impact them! Chatter will benefit customers in many ways. It can be used to streamline approval workflows and to add visibility into that process for customers (e.g., approve a discount for a pending deal; approve a credit to a customer that impacts the customer, the reseller, and his distributor).

Pretty much ALL Android tablets do what the iPad does\u2026 and then more. Wireless synch;ing of apps, music, & movies\u2026 available first on Android tablets. HDMI output\u2026 again, first on Android. HD resolution\u2026 again, first on Android. USB/SD storage options- ONLY on Android tablets. Desktop-like internet browsing experience- Android. Voice dictation- again, first on Android. Multi-tasking- Android. And up until now, most tablet optimized apps have looked better on Honeycomb/ICS Android tablets. Although I suspect this last point to shift to Apple\u2019s favor now with the higher resolution available\u2026.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of iOS, than this new ipad is certainly on point. However, when it comes to being first with innovation in the OS, Android users likely still have the most to look forward to.\nErik Bernhardsson's reply:\nWhile Apple certainly has something that seemingly all other tech companies have; taste, vision and understanding of the consumer, which is why their products are \u2018better\u2019 than others\u2019\u2026 it also has plenty of things that make their products unusable to me.\nThis to the extent that I have just purchased a\u2026 Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet. A terrible tablet in many ways, but also an outstanding one in others. It has great connectivity with its usb port and sd slot. The file system is open and I can easily add content onto the tablet and then modify it, using the active stylus.\nAll of these are things that Apple devices lack and will continue to lack until they\u2019ve taken a nasty hit from it. I don\u2019t see how its going to be used professionally if it means buying into a huge system provides little flexibility and demands continuous reinvestments in it. And you might not be able to get your work out of the system if you don\u2019t pay!\nMuch of the technologies and software Apple introduces is increasingly proprietary and only work on Apple devices.\nTheir closed nature is especially hurtful when they decide to not allow many input options and just as few output options. It is not a friendly device, system, company. Case in point would be pens with active digitizers. Thanks to the more open nature of Android and even Windows 8, there\u2019s going to be plenty of offerings for designers/creators, but Apple is going to be behind in this area for at least another year it seems.\nSurely there are aspects of Android that are pathetic.

I actually think the Honeycomb UI is better than the iPad UI, as you can create a \"dashboard\" with your appointments, mail, social media, etc. with widgets on the grid.\u00a0 The Xoom can be upgraded to Android 3.1, and I have done so.\u00a0 Some applications, like the Prey Project anti-theft tool don't work on it yet, and it\u2019s still missing some apps \u2013 but a nice device.\n2. Video is a problem.\u00a0 There's nothing like the iTunes video, but I've not spent much time fretting about it.\u00a0 Solution for media sync appears to be DoubleTwist, which will actually copy your iTunes files (although the DRM is not supported).\u00a0 You CAN sync with DoubleTwist over WIFi, but it's an extra $10.\u00a0 The tablet supports Flash, so the issue of video is probably one of me not spending enough time working with the tool to make the Flash video work OK.\u00a0 I hope Amazon makes their video work on it soon.\u00a0 You can buy some content in the Android Market, and it\u2019s relatively painless to use.\n3. The Economist is available on the Android Kindle application, and I use the new Zinio app for Android to look at my magazines (PC World, The Economist, Bloomberg Business Week, etc.)\u00a0 As such, if you have subscriptions to periodicals on your iPad and thinking about doing something different, you may want to see how you will be able to consume the content on the new tool.\u00a0 I miss my Wall Street Journal application, but the browser supports their website remarkably well, so I'm not completely locked out of the Journal.\u00a0 The new WSJ Android app isn\u2019t working yet on Android 3.1, so I\u2019ll have to review it later.\n4. Battery life is so-so.\u00a0 Will spend some time working on this and report back on it later.\u00a0 I've not been turning it completely off, and the Wi-Fi in sleep mode seems to use up some battery life.\u00a0 I\u2019d estimate the battery life (with the screen at \u201csomewhat like the sun\u201d brightness) at about 8 hours of active use.\n5. The Google integration is awesome, and it performs notably faster than my phone (as you would expect).\n6. There aren't many apps for the tablet, but you can do pretty much anything you would need an app for on a phone in the browser on a tablet.\u00a0 Firefox for Android rocks, and is really nice on a dual core processor.\u00a0 The accounting software publishers have largely adopted iOS and BlackBerry OS for their vertical applications, but I think the rumored entrance of Amazon into the tablet market will shift some significant momentum to Android.\u00a0 You can get the BNA Tax Rates app, and all of the publishers I've talked to this year want to do something with Android.\n7. Accessories are limited and hard to find (as you would expect).\u00a0 I'm currently using a pleather Motorola folder, and would like to get a nicer leather case, but can't find one that doesn't look cheap.\u00a0 Like any good engineering company, Motorola has developed a range of sturdy, useful, and hideously ugly accessories (think: digital pocket protectors) to go with the Xoom.\u00a0 Hopefully the third parties will jump in - but who knows?\u00a0 My Zagg bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad works fine, but it doesn't fit well in the slot to hold it up.\n8. My family (who hasn't drank the Apple Kool-Aid) likes the Xoom better than the iPad 1 we have.\u00a0 No Skype video yet, but I've not spent much time looking for an effective video chat solution.\n9. There is an Adobe PDF creator for $9.99 which will convert Office files and images to PDF - very cool.\u00a0 I have not located a suitable PDF markup tool yet, but I'm sure there's one out there.\u00a0 If any of you know of one, please let me know.\nThe device charges with this needle-like proprietary plug, so you can't charge it effectively with MicroUSB.\u00a0 It does have a built-in Micro-HDMI port, and I've been racking my brain to figure out how to get that over to an analog VGA cable for presentations, to no avail.\u00a0 It probably can be done, but would likely require a Rube Goldberg-type combination of adapters to accomplish.\u00a0 (I will play with it on the TV set later.)\nThe thing which I think would make a killer application for this would be something which would let you pair your Android phone to your tablet for places where you would like to have some synergy between the two devices.\u00a0 For example, if you were on the phone with someone, I'd like the tablet to be able to securely poll the name/info of the party you're talking to and bring up their contact information in a CRM system.\u00a0 I understand that this was the idea with the Playbook, but I can't wait for it to get Android compatibility or even something as simple as a calendar application.\nIn summary, it's a great device, but you have to work harder to get it to do the same things as an iPad.\u00a0 There are some things, like the widgets, which are better than anything I've seen on the iPad, but the device isn't saddled with the \"it's so uncool\" mantra that plagues Windows slates.\u00a0 If Amazon comes out with an Android tablet, I think it will make Android a more robust competitor with iOS.\n"}, {"score": 564.34375, "uuid": "ecdf9b71-2376-5151-bcc6-c1c8e466b744", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-71-08860", "target_hostname": "blog.kerika.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.kerika.com/?cat=6&paged=2", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Kerika&#x27;s Blog \u00bb <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "We are encouraging our users to create public projects: projects that are open to the public to visit, and <em>which</em> can serve as templates for other users who need to <em>perform</em> similar functions.

It took a really long time for us to build, since we were working on this while doing all the other usability improvements, bug fixes and new features we have delivered over the past few months, and we think it will improve the overall usability of Kerika in a very big way.\nThere are all sorts of side-benefits to this feature:\nNow, you can upload a snapshot of the project to LinkedIn and Facebook along with your comments; the picture will contain a live link to your project.\nWe have made it possible for you to embed a snapshot of a Kerika page in your own website or blog, using the Share! button that\u2019s now more powerful than ever.\nThese snapshots of pages are automatically updated whenever a member of your project team makes a change to the project: we wait a couple of minutes after the last change has been made before producing a new snapshot to avoids sending you a flurry of new images.\nThere are also two new ways for you to embed either a Kerika page, which you can use as a regular website page, or the entire Kerika application, in your own website or blog.\u00a0 (This is a big enough topic to deserve it\u2019s own blog post.)\nAnd there\u2019s more to our latest version!\nYou can see the page URL of any project at any time (unless you are using Internet Explorer which continues to lag in its support for the HTML5 standard.)\nWhen you upload documents to a project page, they are now stored in your own Google Docs account, not the Google Docs account of the Project Leader.\u00a0 This is a big change, but one that was necessary to allow the use of the same document in multiple projects.\u00a0 Previously, we passed ownership of the document to the Project Leader, but this meant that ownership could pass through several people\u2019s hands if the same document was used in multiple projects.\nThe browser\u2019s Back button (and the keyboard backspace key) work now! Yeah, it took us a while to get this working, but there were some serious hurdles that we had to overcome first, relating to the way different browsers support HTML5.\u00a0 More on this in a subsequent blog post.\nWe have added a new diamond shape to help you draw flowcharts.\u00a0 We are not keen to add a lot of shapes; we want to keep the Kerika user interface clean and uncluttered, but we felt that a diamond shape could really help with flowcharts so we have added our first new shape in six months!\nPages now automatically refresh if the application detects that there was a problem connecting to the server.\u00a0 The old dialog box that used to pop-up asking you to refresh your browser \u2013 which we found as annoying as you did \u2013 has gone away.\nYou can now add a Twitter feed to a page by just providing \u201c@name\u201d as the URL.\u00a0 Adding Twitter feeds to Kerika pages is becoming more popular with our users, so we made the process of using the Magic Plus button simpler: just enter \u201c@kerika\u201d, for example, when you use the Magic Plus button to add content from the Internet and you will get our Twitter feed added to your Kerika page.\nSpeaking of which, the Magic Plus button got even more magicky: now you can add content from dozens of third-party sources to a Kerika page.\u00a0 (You can see a handful of them listed on our website , but don\u2019t be shy: just add any kind of URL and see if Kerika can\u2019t automagically figure out how best to show it on your project pages.)\nWe also spent some time improving our text blocks , after seeing just how popular this feature was becoming with our users:\nWe have better icons for the buttons; the old ones weren\u2019t as intuitive as they could have been.\nWe have added a new background fill color so that you can have even fancier text blocks.\nThe text block feature has better buttons and a new background fill color capability\nWe have done a ton of usability improvements and bug fixes, as usual, and we will continue to do so in the future\u2026\nOne usability improvement was to \u201cundo\u201d a previous improvement: we had made a change in our last version that we thought was a good idea, but it turned out that everyone liked it, even us, so we have taken that out.\u00a0 Now, when you resize an item on your page using the grab handles, the item resizes in just one direction rather than in all directions.\nWe made it easier to add large (high-resolution) pictures to your Kerika pages.\u00a0 Previously, high-res pictures would appear initially with full resolution and crowd out everything on the canvas.\u00a0 Now, pictures appear with a maximum initial size of 640\u00d7480 pixels, and you can, of course, resize it to be larger if you like.\nFinally, we have revamped our website completely and would love to get your feedback.\u00a0 We are featuring sample projects on our home page , and the Example pages.\nWe want to feature your work on our site!

It has propagated to at least Github , the Dzone social network, The Register and Information Week since Sunday.\nBy Z-Bo at 2011-09-15 14:25 | Critiques | Javascript | other blogs | 27007 reads\nComment viewing options\nInteresting, too soon/closed to say, and slightly frightening\nThe sender of the mail is Mark S. Miller, which is well-known outside Google and his recent work on Javascript standardization for his continued work in the capability-security circles and the language E. This is only the first sign that this memo is LtU-relevant.\nI found it interesting (interesting that Google is still looking for a language-based solution) and exciting. I've been disappointed, however, that this project is apparently so closed. I found it a bit disturbing to see this level of secrecy among people that come directly from the research community, and surely value openness and diffusion of ideas.\nIt's hard to say much more before the technical details are available. I'm interested in knowing what they are thinking of (frankly, with the goals they have, I don't expect a revolution, but you never know).\nBrendan Eich has reacted very strongly against this effort. In a nutshell, he's afraid this effort may \"fragment\" the web and apparently see it as a single-vendor product trying to bypass openness and standardization.\nI would myself welcome something like a \"web assembly\" suitable as a target for programming languages, so that I may choose whatever language I like -- as we do for desktop application. I'm a bit surprised Google doesn't try to push in that direction; if you restrict yourself to a single language, it will probably always be irritating for some people in some problem domains. The \"performance\" goals of Dash may help make it better suited as a backend, but the next Javascript standard proposal are also doing quite well in this regard.\nSee Brendan Eich comments about the evolution of JS and some tangent shots at Dash/Dart on his blog . See also the discussion on Hacker News , with numerous comments from Brendan.\nSome quotation of the leaked memo that I found particularly LtU-relevant.\nDash is designed with three perspectives in mind:\n- Performance [..]\n- Developer Usability -- Dash is designed to keep the dynamic,\neasy-to-get-started, no-compile nature of Javascript that has made the web platform the clear winner for hobbyist developers.\n- Ability to be Tooled -- Dash is designed to be more easily tooled (e.g. with optional types) for large-scale projects that require code-comprehension features such as refactoring and finding callsites. Dash, however, does not require tooling to be effective--small-scale developers may still be satisfied with a text editor.\nDash is also designed to be securable, where that ability does not seriously conflict with the three main goals.\n(Where security conflict with performances, performances come first? Is this the right priority choice for \"lingua franca of web development\"?)\nDash will be designed so that a large subset of it can be compiled to target legacy Javascript platforms so teams that commit to using Dash do not have to seriously limit their reach.\nQ: How will Dash interoperate with the huge body of existing JavaScript (JQuery, Analytics, etc)?\nA: Moving to a new language will be a very large undertaking. The specifics of how inter-operation with current Javascript would work is still an open question.\nHow will we get Harmony related changes into Chrome?\nVery carefully ;-). V8 is carefully tuned for speed with the current\nJavascript standard rather than flexibility--this makes it very difficult to make experimental changes. We are considering pre-processors and a number of other options, but ultimately the precise solution is still an open question.\nI had somehow never thought of this. Being interested in language and their implementations, I was always happy to see something more exciting as an AST-walking interpreter coming in web browsers, and people interested again in old research in programming languages (Smalltalk, Self..).\nBut the large investement in subtle (and brittle) technology around javascript performances has also made the language harder to change. This may have a net effect in the future years, especially when the hype and marketing around JS performances fall down and the costs of the large engineering teams become harder to justify.\nQ: What about Go?\nA: Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years. Dash is focused on client (and eventually Front-end server development). The needs there are different (flexibility vs. stability) and therefore a different programming language is warranted.\nWe will strongly encourage Google developers start off targeting Chrome-only whenever possible as this gives us the best end user experience. However, for some apps this will not make sense, so we are building a compiler for Dash that targets Javascript (ES3).\nBy gasche at Thu, 2011-09-15 15:17 | login or register to post comments\nOpen development\nI've been greatly confused by the echoing of objections over Google's closed language design/development phase. Perhaps the sharper minds and cooler heads over here can enlighten me. (Also, stop this fast if it is too offtopic or too religious. There's plenty to discuss on the topic of web-language-stack improvement.)\nI can't see how \"open design\" is in any way a requirement for programming languages, whether they're aimed for the \"web stack\" or not. Every industrial-grade language used anywhere in the web implementation stack (C++, Java, PHP, HTML, Python ...) started out as a closed design, sometimes even with a closed implementation, and then gained varying amounts of openness over varying lengths of time. Even JavaScript had a closed design phase, though it standardized early (I think a year into its life). Even then, Netscape had a jumpstart on other browser vendors in implementation.\nIt has been rather a tradition of successful language designs to come from small, focused groups. Languages hailing from committee (most famously ALGOL68 and Ada) have a track record of baroqueness and poor adoption, ironically or not. If I put together a nice language for my own use, especially in the context of my employer, can I expect such a harsh reaction if I eventually open it up? This would seem to be a negative influence on the language community, both users and designers.\nBy Chad Wellington at Thu, 2011-09-15 17:25 | login or register to post comments\nClosed design\nI don't believe gasche was objecting to closed design/development. He only notes his position is quite speculative because he lacks access to details.\nI'm all for closed language design, so long as the language is open after release. It seems to me that 'open design' - or design by committee - is a recipe for complexity, with a lot of local optimizations and agendas.\nBy dmbarbour at Thu, 2011-09-15 18:12 | login or register to post comments\nI'd go further...\nI'd make a stronger statement. Design by committee has a bad track record, sure, but so does any language that's designed in public, by whatever means.\nI think languages are best born in darkness. Languages which are introduced to the world too soon (before having a half-decent implementation, stable syntax and semantics and some modicum of design cohesion and sensibility) tend to be laughed out of existence, ignored, or meander off into endless design revisions before getting anywhere. Not universally true, but more often than not...\nBy Matt Hellige at Fri, 2011-09-16 03:41 | login or register to post comments\n\"closed\" versus \"open\"\nThank for your clarification; indeed, \"too closed to say\" only meant that we can't say much before we have more technical details.\nI would like to highlight that there are compromise between starting a secret language design project that stays underwater for more than a year, with participation of known researchers, and a \"design by committee\" approach where everyone reasonable is invited in actively participating in the design.\nSo I think \"closed\" versus \"open\" is a bad dichotomy in this case. I would rather speak of \"secret\" versus \"public\".\nThe most common thing, is my view, is a small group of people designing a language while discussing/publishing what they're doing. For example, the Fortress team discusses what they are doing on a blog . That's also the norm for most research teams in academic settings.\nI can think of lot of reasons for people not to talk outside their group about the language they're designing. Strategic choices (create a surprise effect), fear of releasing too early and being flamed by critics, etc. They're certainly justified in some cases and I say there is a moral obligation for language design to be open. I'm just saying I found it a bit strange in this precise situation.\nBy gasche at Fri, 2011-09-16 18:30 | login or register to post comments\nCurious generalisation\nYou're implying that Ada is more baroque than C++ in your post, really??\nIMHO the early tool cost is the main reason why Ada failed and C++ won, which has nothing to do with design by commity or not.\nBy renox at Fri, 2011-09-16 08:54 | login or register to post comments\nIndeed, I was being overly\nIndeed, I was being overly broad with my brush-strokes there. I've also marveled at the complaints of complexity against, e.g., ALGOL 68 when it's so much simpler than C++.\nInstead, I should have said something like \"immediate\" or \"incremental\" complexity of the specifications. This complexity has both psychological and material consequences. Materially, designing new features in an implementation vacuum leads to hare-brained leaps (external templates in C++ being a recent example). Psychologically, a spec that is unimplemented and divorced from current practice plays out as \"too complicated\". I understand this effect to have harmed both Ada and ALGOL68 adoption-- thus why I mentioned them.\nAs languages age, changes by popular demand and committee bargaining bring in exactly that baroque complexity so derided in initial specs (C++ and COBOL being the standard candles of this process). By picking up the complexity piecewise from practice, rather than pushing it onto practitioners, the complexity thus seems more \"natural\". It's the standard frog-boiling paradigm.\nBy Chad Wellington at Fri, 2011-09-16 19:01 | login or register to post comments\nI'd argue that, to a very large extent, C++ is the poster child for design by committee. The vast bulk of the C++ language, including pretty much everything that people consider baroque, was added by the ANSI standards committee.\nBy Brian Hurt at Fri, 2011-09-23 21:20 | login or register to post comments\nHow about this suggestion:\nHow about this suggestion: It is not about the number of people involved, but about the number of conflicting interests.\nCorollary: As languages gain more widespread use, they are pushed to become more baroque. It is then that a strong hand at the helm is necessary, but also when the pressure is on to move the language into the hands to standardization bodies.\nBy Ehud Lamm at Fri, 2011-09-23 22:59 | login or register to post comments\nDictatorships\nSeems like there is a benevolent dictator behind most successful languages. Even C++ was initially standardized from a language designed by mostly one person (Stroustrup). You need one voice to shape the language's feel and keep the design consistent.\nThe initial language design is very important since if the language is successful, it probably have to evolve via committee.\nBy Sean McDirmid at Sat, 2011-09-24 00:00 | login or register to post comments\nSuppose we want to test this\nSuppose we want to test this empirically.

I don't think you'll find enlightenment in just the numbers, you'll have to draw more on non-objective experience.\nRegardless, most established popular languages must evolve by committee, which is where success and failure are more evident.\nBy Sean McDirmid at Sat, 2011-09-24 02:03 | login or register to post comments\nOP>> Google plans to improve JavaScript, while also creating a competitor to JavaScript\nCW> I've been greatly confused by the echoing of objections over over Google's closed language design/development phase\nI didn't have a problem with it when MS had the same strategy with Java/J#, etc., but certainly there were plenty of objections.\nBy Michael Robin at Thu, 2011-09-15 17:50 | login or register to post comments\nAlex Russell responded in a blog post here.\nGoogle is big, can do many things at once, and often isn\u2019t of one mind. What we do agree on is that we\u2019re trying to make things better the best we know how. Anyone who watches Google long enough should anticipate that we often have different ideas about what that means. For my part, then, consider me and my team to be committed JS partisans for as long as we think we can make a difference.\nAfter I read that post, some of the concerns that people had based on the original memo seem overblown. But a lot will depend on how Google treats JS going forward.\nI thought Brendan's comment that Googlers have a \"better is better\" bias was pretty spot-on; if he's right that \"worse is better\" wins, then it's a foregone conclusion that Dart will remain a niche language. Even if Dart doesn't take over, though, it may still achieve its goals (just like Chrome has achieved its goals by influencing the development of other browsers).\nBy Mitch Skinner at Thu, 2011-09-15 20:16 | login or register to post comments\nI thought Brendan's comment that Googlers have a \"better is better\" bias was pretty spot-on; if he's right that \"worse is better\" wins, then it's a foregone conclusion that Dart will remain a niche language.\nUnless Dart, like Go, is actually \"worse\"... ;)\nSome things are a victim of their own success.

Regardless of the level of publicness the optimal design process should have.

I'm just not willing to discuss what other people have told me in confidence. What I meant about the \"ground being fertile\" is that the idea that Google can and should be investing in new languages is gaining traction. There is a large feeling of needing better tools. We use a lot of DSLs internally and have for a long time.\nPersonally I don't think languages with open design processes are particularly all that well off. If anything, the open nature of the debate means that all features tend to regress toward the mean, resulting in a bland, squishy bag of everyone's favorite features, none of which work together well. The only bold things that survive are those truly horrible hacks put in by some lone prima dona grandfathered into the project whom nobody has the guts to confront.\nHow much can a single language breakthrough influence a whole language? In one of those design-by-committee languages that inevitably seem to come of \"open\" design processes--not a whole lot.\nAs for corporate loyalty, I didn't inherit that gene. But I have been trying to develop a level of self-awareness regarding which things my opinion can influence.\nI of course didn't mean you!\nI of course didn't mean you!

Some living examples, or examples in living memory, would be good.\nAda does not count, from what I knew (ROLM self-hosted Ada compiler hacker in my grad student summer intern days -- I miss the 80s ;-).\nCommittees take over once the designed language is more or less done and actually used enough to generate standardization effort.\nDesigning in the open but without a committee, with a moderated mailing list, is not design by committee, and not a huge hardship in my experience.\n/be\nDuring my first year of grad\nDuring my first year of grad school, my adviser gave us a fascinating doc on the design of Modula-3. It was in the form of meeting minutes on how various committee members (researchers from SRC?) were debating various design decisions.

Has anyone else seen this before?\nBy Sean McDirmid at Wed, 2011-09-21 23:20 | login or register to post comments\nYeah, I think I've seen it.\nYeah, I think I've seen it. If it's the same document as I seem to remember, it was (only somewhat) tongue-in-cheek, no? With some aliases for the various committee members? Though I think one could work out which aliases went with which member, if you knew enough about the context.\nI seem to recall it was in an appendix of one of the books on Modula-3.\nJavaScript just needs to evolve...\nGiven that Gilad Bracha and Lars Bak are the designers of Dart and its VM, it could be that Dart will indeed be novel and compelling. So, from a language perspective, great. Go Gilad and Lars!\nStill, back on Earth, I vote for a better JavaScript - a modern JavaScript, a repaired JavaScript - not something net new to replace it, if that's in fact Google's goal. Why would browser makers take on a new VM? Because Google thinks it's the right thing to do? What is this, the 90s?\nAt any rate, I look forward to seeing what Gilad, Lars et al come up with and deliver. I'm a big fan of these engineers.\nC\nI'm not following this project too closely, but I do follow where Gilad ends up. Sorry to Kasper for the lack of due credit.\nC\nback on Earth, I vote for a better JavaScript - a modern JavaScript, a repaired JavaScript\nMarkM, Google, and others are working on that, too. This is not an either/or prospect.\nWhy would browser makers take on a new VM? Because Google thinks it's the right thing to do?\nNah, they'd do it because people will start writing websites using Dart (and the Dart-to-JS compiler where necessary), because it's fun to jump onto a new bandwagon, and because - no matter your opinion - there are a lot of people that do not believe that JavaScript will be fixed by evolutionary means.\nEvolving JavaScript in a good direction is hard , precisely because it is standardized and subject to a wide variety of interests in committee. Brendan Eich speaks of 'filling a complexity bucket'; might as well be talking about How the Camel Got His Hump.\nI'm not sure Dart will be a better web assembly language than JavaScript, but I expect/hope it will be a better substrate for building a better web assembly language - what with two capability security guys (MarkM, Gilad Bracha) who have done a lot of work on distributed programming heading it.\nBy dmbarbour at Tue, 2011-09-20 18:02 | login or register to post comments\nClue: Mark M. not working on Dart\nMark's name is on the memo but he didn't write it, and Gilad joined big G only this spring. The memo looks like a committee product, with fragile/breaking consensus and bogus (iOS wins cuz of Obj-C? I lulled) substitute rationales.\nGoogle is not serving both open-web and proprietary-plan-B masters well, so much as doing whatever individuals with high rank want. The real doers from Google on Ecma TC39 are fewer than the long list of names cited on the memo. Now consider how much better TC39 could have made ES6, what roads we missed, if we had Dash-informed input before next month -- say 1.5 years ago.\nWeb standards are hard, JS is no exception. If Dart becomes one, it'll face the same hardships. But it can't get there from here by being too complex and too closed. That's how it looks right now, and it can't very well help be otherwise with two-year incubation in the dark.\nGoogle's stealth-mode development of V8 guaranteed Apple's JavaScriptCore had to compete and make its own way. This is a permanent fork in WebKit, with an awkwardly shared DOM embedding API. These delayed-open decisions have real costs.\n\"Better\" by itself has nothing to do with winning adoption on the Web. \"Closer\", \"fewer moving parts\", and \"good enough\" (great counts if possible) matter more. See Collin Jackson's excellent USENIX Security keynote .\n/be\nWhen seeking revolutionary\nWhen seeking revolutionary improvements, society as a whole can accept a low batting average. Even if Dart isn't successful, I consider the work on it - that a large group is taking the appropriate risks, despite expenditure - to be a good thing.\nAn advantage of delayed-open is that there is (a) more time to simplify the design (it is much more difficult to remove features than to add them), (b) more time to judge whether the design makes any real improvements, and (c) much less commitment to a project that they might later decide to cut. Mitigating risk is important, and I do not begrudge them for it.\nAs to your 'dash-informed input', I doubt you'd achieve anything differently with it. It isn't as though the JS community is short on ideas. The problem is that risking a mature standard with new ideas is ridiculous, and trying to change the 'foundational' ideas of an established language is counter-productive (even if it would result in a better/closer/simpler model).\nBy dmbarbour at Wed, 2011-09-21 18:07 | login or register to post comments\nThe Rust language seems to\nThe Rust disclaimer (\"This is a very preliminary work in progress. No supported releases yet nor defined release schedule / plans. Caveat emptor. It will crash. It will change syntax and semantics. It will eat your laundry. Use at your own risk. Etc.\") seems like a reasonable guard against anyone over-investing in a work in progress. Incubating something that is to become a standard is hard, for sure, but it's matter of weighing letting others benefit from seeing the development path v. the additional burdens of open development. Sometimes all it takes is a couple big scary looking banners to keep from getting burdened down, and sure, sometimes it takes a lot more.\nOf the three advantages you list from delayed-open, which do and which do not apply to the developed-in-public Rust language?\nBy rektide at Wed, 2011-09-21 20:42 | login or register to post comments\nSecond reply (first was orphaned to top level)\nThose advantages are not exclusive to delayed-open. Every one of the three you assert can be gained with early-open, in my experience.\nMozilla does early-open (lately: Rust, B2G) and we put appropriate warnings up. More to the point, for JS evolution we prototype only what has been proposed in Ecma TC39 and either has already made it to harmony:proposals , or has achieved strong strawman status, with good odds of being promoted (but in need of prototyping to make the case).\nI've argued on hacker news at length that doing delayed-open will not make a new de-facto standard without a lot more market power to win adoption and force competitors to adopt or reverse-engineer. That market power is >50% share, more like 80% from what happened in the '90s. Google doesn't have that and won't get it soon enough even on the most optimistic assumptions.\nGoogle was going for wow-effect and (I surmise) trying not to rattle any cages or draw fire early. That's a fine choice to make if the goal is to push Dart as proprietary (open-washed or not). For a proposed web standards, it's backwards.\n/be\nExcitement factor\nI imagine Rust will remove its warnings, some day, and nobody will notice because they stopped looking. I don't know much about marketing, though, so I could easily be wrong, but there might be some benefits to dangling a tantalizing project without immediately sharing it.\nWhether delayed open or early open, I think producing a 'new de-facto standard' has the same problems with adoption. It is not clear to me that time of opening is a significant factor.\nPersonally, I would not want to be constrained by promises to a community, nor even by my previous efforts while trying to find a programming model that can truly advance state-of-the-art for open distributed systems. Standardization is useful when it is time for a language to sit still and support settlers.\nWould Google discuss Dash/Dart at all, were it not for the leaked memo?\nBy dmbarbour at Wed, 2011-09-21 21:33 | login or register to post comments\nTry working with competitors in a standards group\nI'm sure Rust will do fine whether you keep looking or not :-|. Seriously, that's a silly argument. People who lose interest because an early-open project does not give them a free lunch are generally not going to contribute, and they can be recovered later through more traditional outbound marketing.\nBut this is not an issue for Rust. Rust is not for the web -- it doesn't need interoperable implementations based on a detailed spec (not yet, anyway), or early Looky-Lou users who leave for want of a finished product.\nI think producing a 'new de-facto standard' has the same problems with adoption. It is not clear to me that time of opening is a significant factor.\nYou don't surprise other browser implementors with late-open and market-power moves if you want to standardize something in the existing standards bodies and market share structure.\nMaybe that's not the goal, though the leaked memo did talk about standardization. Talk is cheap, but actions have consequences. What your \"Excitement factor\" lede suggests is that Google is fine going the market-power de-facto route alone.\nThat's anti-social in the standards bodies and anti-open-web. It could work, but I doubt it. It won't lead to any kind of predictable standardization.\n/be\nStandards are for clients, not competitors\nI don't see the early history of JavaScript as any different. You wrote up a language in a couple weeks, with minimal external input, then a big company pushed it in a de-facto market power play, and you only 'standardized' it later.\nI think this is okay when you did it, and I think it's okay if Google tries the same thing. (I even think building a whole new, mostly incompatible web is okay. It's certainly my own plan, since I think stateful DOM is a huge historical mistake.) But perhaps this is due to my perception of browsers as competitive application platforms (similar to different OS's, but with a focus on distributed apps).\nStandardizing is something that can wait until after demonstration. And the main reason for standardization is NOT to support your competitors, but rather to support your clients, who wish to provide user-generated content and extensions and who can't be having their target languages and APIs change too much underfoot, and who are assured by the standardization.\nGoogle can provide a Dart-to-JS compiler. Such is really for clients, who wish to retain the 'reach' of JavaScript. But it is sufficient to initially support the competition - to avoid being 'evil'.\nBy dmbarbour at Thu, 2011-09-22 00:33 | login or register to post comments\nlearned nothing and forgotten everything...\n... unlike the Bourbons.\nStandards are for competitors and clients, not just for clients. Competitors want interoperation so they can compete on quality of implementation, not be locked out. That's why Microsoft wanted JS standardized and threw a big brain at it in 1997.\nI don't see the early history of JavaScript as any different.\nThis isn't about me, and I never said it was. Netscape had 80% market power and pushed a bunch of stuff, not all good -- better than what would have been pushed by Microsoft, IMHO, but who knows? VB lost to JS, that much is clear.\nThe point is not that Netscape did it, so it's ok. The point is that Google cannot pull off such a power move because it lacks market share.\nI think it's okay if Google tries the same thing.\nNo, because the market is different now.\nGoogle doesn't have 80% market share, not even close. So it's not ok, while the balance of browser market players are trying to collaborate on interoperable specs, for Google to spring such fragmentation grenades, because Google will fragment the web if these anti-open gambits (see the Hacker News thread for a more complete list -- it's not just Dart) succeed.\nApple and Microsoft doing the same would not increase interoperation, quite the reverse. Don't assume they won't try their own (I joked Apple's would be sleeker, so \"Flechette\", and someone at CapitolJS beat me to the Microsoft name: \"Javelin\" -- bigger is better), or that they'll simply roll over and implement Dart -- that's not going to happen without Google taking something like 80% of the market overnight.\nGoogle can provide a Dart-to-JS compiler.\nThat would, as the hacker news thread covered, result in substandard performance in browsers that do not support Dart with a native VM. New number types, remember?\nYour argument keeps shifting. First it was a \"closed design\" vs. \"design by committee\" false dilemma. Then MarkM was, according to you, working on Dart (he wasn't and isn't). Then it was revolutionary risk being good for society, and early-open bad for language designers. I replied and you moved on. Are we having fun yet?\nI claim there is a social good in developing interoperable web standards. Yes, you can try to write such standards later, after having used market power to create a de-facto standard as Netscape did with JS. That's not necessarily good or bad, but it *won't work* without that market power. And Google does not have that power now.\nThe leaked memo (this thread's topic) shows a two-faced and anti-open-web strategy, about which I've already heard negative reactions from competing browser vendors who are active in the standards bodies. This is a problem for Google. Their launch will go ahead as if they are kings of the world, but the chance to land Dart in a standards body, or better compiled-to-Dart support in JS standards, was passed over for this false glory.\n/be\nI'm not sure it's the absolute market share that matters, so much as the positioning. Android, for example, will likely be another Dart client.\nFurther, Dart will - by nature - need to compete in terms of quality rather than reach.\nGoogle will fragment the web if these anti-open gambits (see the Hacker News thread for a more complete list -- it's not just Dart) succeed.\nThe web won't fragment, though it might fracture a little. We'll still have some 'lowest common denominator' glue holding everything together.\nThat would, as the hacker news thread covered, result in substandard performance in browsers that do not support Dart with a native VM. New number types, remember?\nYes. That's the point. Having substandard performance is important if you want to provide technological pressure to actually implement Dart. And, if the authors of Dart truly feel a switch would improve society, it is reasonable to provide pressures to that end - social, market, technological.\nYour argument keeps shifting.\nThat's not quite accurate, though I understand how you could gain that impression. My argument keeps growing.\nMarkM's absence from Dart doesn't entirely Dash my hopes for a capability secure distributed language design, since Bracha is still involved and has done related design work for Newspeak.\nI agree that we can 'share' our designs early without turning it into design-by-committee. But I never actually made a design-by-committee argument. I think you have confused a position about why evolving JS is difficult with a separate point about avoiding commitment and risk for an immature language design.\nThe arguments about Rust seem to expose a misunderstanding about the nature of risk. If you walk through an unknown minefield and don't get hurt, you did not \"avoid the risk\", you only avoided the consequences. Putting up an \"I'll eat your laundry\" banner may have mitigated Rust's risk a little, but Rust is still at risk of forking and other situations by anyone who decides it's good enough and begins using it.\nThe risks for Google with Dart are not the same as the risks for Mozilla with Rust. They have every right to mitigate their risks however they feel is necessary. This includes reputation and commitment risks.\nWith regards to your arguments about 'adoption' and market power, those don't really concern me. I consider fracturing the web an acceptable risk, perhaps even an inevitable stage in the long run - like breaking a twisted bone so we can set it correctly.\nthere is a social good in developing interoperable web standards\nI think so as well, but I'm not convinced that 'backwards compatible' needs to be part of that, except insofar as a technology transition strategy is important to achieve adoption.\nthe chance to land Dart in a standards body, or better compiled-to-Dart support in JS standards, was passed over for this false glory.\nI have no doubt that Dart, if Google remains committed to it, will eventually land in a standards body. But it won't happen before Dart is more mature.\nBy dmbarbour at Thu, 2011-09-22 02:47 | login or register to post comments\nI'm not sure it's the absolute market share that matters, so much as the positioning. Android, for example, will likely be another Dart client.\nWho knows? Android already has to carry Dalvik, which chews memory and cycles.\nThe web won't fragment, though it might fracture a little. We'll still have some 'lowest common denominator' glue holding everything together.\nWhy are you quibbling about \"fragment\" vs. \"fracture\"? The \"lowest common denominator\" may be so low that people choose their silos and the Web becomes like AOL.\nI doubt this will happen but many worry about it -- including those writing in the leaked memo who used fear of iOS eclipsing the Web to rationalize doing Dart and therefore not doing nearly as much as they could for JS.\nAnd that's the concern: Google breaking current covenants required for healthy functioning of standards bodies, in order to keep evolving the Web with multi-vendor-implemented, interoperable specs.\nHaving substandard performance is important if you want to provide technological pressure to actually implement Dart.\nThat's considered dirty pool by competitors trying to cooperate in standards bodies.\nAlso, it may fail. If Dart-to-JS lowers new number type intensive code to slow JS using ints-in-doubles and even arrays (bignum emulations), the results may be *worse* than a carefully hand-coded pure-JS version of the web app.\nWill non-Chrome users of gmail then do what Google wishes: either switch to Chrome or put pressure on their browser's vendor to support Dart natively; or will such users find competing webmail services that work better by using JS to full effect, including the latest JS VM optimizations and Harmony prototype and even standard (ES6 is coming) features?\nIt's an open question, but secondary to the main point: Google is breaking bad in standards bodies and this is already harming open-web standards work.\nMy argument keeps growing.\nNo, shifting. New and different assertions or unbacked claims or hopes, no justification for rebutted old ones. But it's fine with me!\nBracha joined Google in June. Dart has been going for ~2 years. It's really an Aarhus thing.\nI've confused nothing about your arguments. You wrote \"I'm all for closed language design, so long as the language is open after release. It seems to me that 'open design' - or design by committee - is a recipe for complexity, with a lot of local optimizations and agendas.\" That pair of sentences clearly set up two alternatives (the \"or\" interjection before \"is a recipe\" does not make a third alternative). Furthermore, the context was Dart design, not JS.\nDart could have been developed in the open, just as V8 could have been (and was mooted to be briefly, to me, in 2006). Google chose otherwise, and not because early-open inevitably results in \"complexity\" or \"design by committee\".\nThe risks for Google with Dart are not the same as the risks for Mozilla with Rust.\nThat's true, but way to miss the big picture. Who cares about risks to Google's or Mozilla's reputation? The bigger risk is to the Web from fragmentation, to the standards bodies falling apart with competitive gaming and proprietary market power moves.\nRust is not a proposed web content language. It cannot fragment the Web. It is nothing like Dart as a \"JS replacement.\"\nYour breaking a bone to untwist it analogy would be better if there were coordinated effort by multiple vendors.\nBut there is such effort: Ecma TC39 introduced ES5 strict mode, and we are building Harmony on it. It's not backward-compatible. It requires opt-in. But it does not require a new VM, separate GC and consequent cycle collector, etc. It requires very few runtime tests, almost all early error compile-time checks.\nGoogle completely bypassed this standards process and the opportunity it affords to break JS a bit better, to untwist it differently. All while open-washing and waving web-standards flags, often in Chrome-only marketing clothing.\nThat stinks, frankly, and it is breaking relationships in standards bodies. And you ought to care about that, since if the standards bodies become badly dysfunctional again, we will have only market power games -- and not only by Google but by Apple, Microsoft, and probably Facebook.\nbut I'm not convinced that 'backwards compatible' needs to be part of that,\nThat's a straw man. Pay attention to web evolution. Contrary to some HTML5 claims, it does involve compatibility breaks.\nWe can move forward, but not with surprise-ware proprietary moves by minority-share vendors. That's unlikely to do more than make a bigger mess that does not result in removing badly twisted old limbs after new ones have successfully grown or been grafted onto the Web body, by cooperating vendors working in standards bodies.\nI have no doubt that Dart, if Google remains committed to it, will eventually land in a standards body.\nWe are still waiting for WebM, SPDY, Pepper2 (not the first one that bounced off the plugin-futures group). Your faith is touching, but if you mean that once Google conquers the world, they'll get rubber stamps from a captured standards body, who cares?\nMeanwhile, last year, right now, and probably next year the way things are trending, Google is playing proprietary market-power games with Chrome extensions that are nowhere near ready to standardize (no spec), or to be implemented by other vendors other than by using Google-controlled source code (and lots of it).\n/be\nThe \"lowest common\nThe \"lowest common denominator\" may be so low that people choose their silos and the Web becomes like AOL. I doubt this will happen but many worry about it\nThere is no reason to worry about it. Service providers are interested in maintaining their reach with minimal effort, and browser providers are interested in maintaining a competitive edge which means supporting a broad range of services.\nThere is no inherently stable market model that will partition the web. Modulo use of force (such as patent trolling) there will always be adapters at a 'good enough' abstraction/security/performance level.\nThe advantage of a unified web model is only the extent to which we gain some cross-cutting benefits from it - global optimizations, pervasive security, fine-grained mashups, greater reusability, lower education overheads, simpler failure modes, common resilience and recovery models, improved productivity.\nSo the fear shouldn't be of isolation, only of inefficacy.\nIf Dart-to-JS lowers new number type intensive code to slow JS using ints-in-doubles and even arrays (bignum emulations), the results may be *worse* than a carefully hand-coded pure-JS version of the web app.\nI've been working under the assumption that a Dart-to-JS compiler will usually perform worse than carefully hand-coded JS. The possibility that it might occasionally perform better hadn't really crossed my mind. If the opposite is true, that might be a mild extra incentive to use Dart, though I expect you can find better languages for a JS target than Dart.\nWill non-Chrome users of gmail then do what Google wishes\nThat's an unlikely scenario. Gmail might eventually serve Dart to Chrome users, but will likely continue to serve dedicated JavaScript to the user-agents that need it.\nEither way, gmail is nowhere near numerically intensive. I doubt users would be able to distinguish performance. The reason for Dart is, I hypothesize, targeted more towards those WebGL canvas and in-browser sound-generation applications we'll be seeing more of in the future.\nYou wrote \"I'm all for closed language design, so long as the language is open after release. It seems to me that 'open design' - or design by committee - is a recipe for complexity, with a lot of local optimizations and agendas.\"\nI presented no such argument in this thread. And I do grant gashe's point about public/secret design being a separate axis one might consider.\nWho cares about risks to Google's or Mozilla's reputation?\nI suspect that would be Google and Mozilla, respectively.\nEcma TC39 introduced ES5 strict mode, and we are building Harmony on it. It's not backward-compatible.\nI am also interested in seeing what happens with harmony.\nThe bigger risk is to the Web from fragmentation, to the standards bodies falling apart with competitive gaming and proprietary market power moves. [...] And you ought to care about that, since if the standards bodies become badly dysfunctional again, we will have only market power games -- and not only by Google but by Apple, Microsoft, and probably Facebook.\nEven during those power struggles, we'll still have HTML4 or 5, and ongoing innovations in PL, and the vast majority of the Internet and Web will keep working, and life will go on with nary an interruption for most people, most purposes.\nPower struggles between titans will occur primarily at technology's bleeding edge. I understand that you're a bit more sensitive to these issues because you are essentially working on the bleeding edge; it's easy for you to get hurt or trampled underfoot. But, based on your exaggerated claims, I think your position biases you.\nWe are still waiting for WebM, SPDY, Pepper2 (not the first one that bounced off the plugin-futures group).\nSo? These are less than six years old. Why bother standardizing yet?\nBy dmbarbour at Thu, 2011-09-22 23:06 | login or register to post comments\nSo the fear shouldn't be of isolation, only of inefficacy.\nWe agree.\nthough I expect you can find better languages for a JS target than Dart.\nWhatever, the point is Google (per the leaked memo) would use Dart in their web apps and thereby try to drive other browsers to adopt the native VM. You wrote \"Having substandard performance is important if you want to provide technological pressure to actually implement Dart.\" We were exchanging interpretations of, and justifications for or objections to, Google's strategy per the leaked memo.\nDevelopers using the Closure Compiler, Dart, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, etc. and targeting JS is not by itself fragmenting. Lots of server-siloed languages. Compiling some to JS does not fragment the space of web content languages that browsers must interoperably implement. Shipping a native Dart VM in Chrome, then pushing Dart performance in Chrome vs. other browsers as you justified with \"important\", could fragment.\nThat \"could\" is enough to create discord in standards bodies. That's the proximate concern. If it all ends well, we'll all laugh. I don't think this is likely right now.\nThat's an unlikely scenario.\nDid you even read the leaked memo? It explicitly advises native-Dart-VM-in-Chrome and Chrome-first Dart web app programming, with the Dart-to-JS compiler as fallback.\nWe've profiled gmail. It has amazing deep inheritance hierarchies. It has non-trivial int vs. double optimization opportunities. Everything adds up. 'twasn't the last cookie I ate that made me fat.\nI suspect that would be Google and Mozilla, respectively.\nOk, that's just trollish. I obviously care about Mozilla's rep, but that wasn't the point and you know it. In context, I was pointing you to the big-picture difference: Rust is not a web content language, whereas Dart is explicitly aimed at being a JS replacement. You dodge the point with a digressive one-liner. That looks like more shifty non-arguing.\nit's easy for you to get hurt or trampled underfoot\nSpare me the patroniziing personalization. What's getting trampled, and it's a real social good (you granted), is interoperable web standards evolution.\nWe can try proprietary power moves. I lived through it in the 90s. It led to some wins and many losses for developers and users. Compared to the relatively harmonious work on HTML5 and JS lately, it was much worse. Why are you pooh-poohing this point?\nSo? These are less than six years old. Why bother standardizing yet?\nYou're clearly not developing for the web. All the successful sites use standards, de-facto and de-jure, some still not in final form, that are much newer than six years. Especially on mobile devices (see the CSS extensions that Apple originated and worked to standardize). All successful web developers know and rely on much newer standards than six years.\nApple, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, and even Google pay people to do significant work on evolving standards that are less than three years old. Waiting six years is likely to standardize something that is falling out of use, while missing the newer emerging standards in urgent need of de-jure codification.\n/be\nDid you even read the leaked\nDid you even read the leaked memo? It explicitly advises native-Dart-VM-in-Chrome and Chrome-first Dart web app programming, with the Dart-to-JS compiler as fallback.\nSound advice for a new project, perhaps, but must be weighed against existing use of JavaScript libraries and server-side JS generation. Despite what is said in the memo, it would be silly to imagine that gmail will transition quickly.\nOk, that's just trollish.\nIt seemed an appropriate response to your facetious 'who cares' comment and hysterical hand-waving about the end of the web as you know it.\nRust is not a web content language, whereas Dart is explicitly aimed at being a JS replacement.\nI have already acknowledged that the situations are different. You should not generalize from your claims about development of Rust to similar claims about Dart. If you feel it isn't applicable, then why did you mention Rust in the first place? (because rektide mentioned it as well?)\nWhat's getting trampled, and it's a real social good (you granted), is interoperable web standards evolution.\nAh, what I said is that there are advantages to a unified web. This is not the same as agreeing we should be interoperable at all points in our evolution, nor even that evolution is the right way forward.\nI lived through it in the 90s. It led to some wins and many losses for developers and users. Compared to the relatively harmonious work on HTML5 and JS lately, it was much worse. Why are you pooh-poohing this point?\nIf you want a personal reason, it is because I have developed a programming model that inverts quite a few modern web concepts in order for some massive improvements in orchestration and composition in-the-large. While I can and plan to integrate the modern web using JavaScript frameworks and AJAX, I also plan to design browsers and a new UI model (or extensions to existing browsers) for this alternative web.\nSo, I have my own biases. It would be quite hypocritical of me to object to Google's decision to ignore the chains of existing standards while pursuing something newer and greater.\nAll the successful sites use standards, de-facto and de-jure\nAh, yes. But it would be dishonest to say that that Pepper2 and WebM and the like are not de-facto standards. So that couldn't be what you're complaining about.\nWhen I say 'why bother standardizing yet', I certainly mean taking it to a committee with a formal approval process and veto powers, especially while the APIs are still maturing.\nWaiting six years is likely to standardize something that is falling out of use, while missing the newer emerging standards in urgent need of de-jure codification.\nI am quite suspicious of standards with an iteration cycle more agile than most acquisition projects. Release early and release often does not seem to be the right approach here. The only reason to take it to committee that often is to have the committee design it.\nBy dmbarbour at Fri, 2011-09-23 00:19 | login or register to post comments\nThis will be brief\nPepper2 is not a standard (\"Something, such as a practice or a product, that is widely recognized or employed...\") at all. It's a steaming pile of Chrome-only, chromium.org-hosted C++ interface and implementation code. You do not seem to know what \"standard\", de-facto or otherwise, means.\nWebM is better, it has an evolving spec and two or more independent implementations. It can claim to be a de-facto standard.\nAs for your \"I am quite suspicious\" of new and fast-cycling standards, let's be concrete. CSS rounded corners: something to wait seven years, or only six, to standardize? In the mean time, to hell with interop, let each browser reverse-engineer?\n/be\nRFCs and Proposals\nThere is no dichotomy between 'standardizing CSS' and 'each browser reverse-engineering'. You can draft RFCs and proposals, and let people implement those, for years before standardizing.\nPPAPI is open source, and was designed with intent for cross-browser standardization. Anyone who wishes can make a second implementation. In the mean time, standards are for clients - PPAPI still provides cross-plugin standards to support portability.\nBy dmbarbour at Fri, 2011-09-23 18:50 | login or register to post comments\nRFCs are standards. I'm not talking about those that make it to internet-draft status. In the old days, RFC status, combined with actual implementations interoperating on the Internet, was enough.\nSame goes for drafts actively being edited in the CSS WG.\nIf your \"six year\" remark was only about some final, ultimate promotion to de-jure status (e.g., w3c REC), six years is still too long, but that's not the issue. The issue is lack of any spec by which independent, interoperable implementations can be -- and have been, before the standard is blessed -- built.\nPPAPI is open source\nNice try. Open source does not make a spec. If open-washed as Google tends to do with delayed-open, zero governance, contributors all employees, it is not really open.\nPepper is not a standard, it's a codebase. I cited the definition of \"standard\" for you. Have the good grace to stop abusing that word!\n/be\nOpen source does not make a\nOpen source does not make a spec.\nI agree, but I never suggested otherwise. What I said is that PPAPI is open source and was designed with intent for cross-browser standardization. An API is a spec. PPAPI is an API. Not all APIs are intended to be standards, but PPAPI was designed with that intention.\nSure, it is accompanied by an implementation, but that is not the point. The fact that the API is open, and designed for wide use, are the relevant aspects.\nI would say that Google's done its fair part in lifting this to a de-facto standard. Creating 'independent, interoperable implementations' is up to independent groups. It isn't as though they have any obligations to coordinate with a group that has expressed \"no interest\" in it.\nBy dmbarbour at Fri, 2011-09-23 20:22 | login or register to post comments\nAPI != normative semantics\nThis is getting absurd. As LtU readers well know, C++ cannot express all, much, or even any of the mandatory (normative in spec terms) semantics of the API's implementation.\nI know some of the Googlers involved in the PPAPI. Asserting that PPAPI was designed with the intention of being cross-browser-standardized based on your divine afflatus does not cut it. They never did the work to engage with other browser vendors, and check (by other vendors implementing, interacting, and having a say in the final API) whether different engines such as Trident, Gecko, and even WebKit in Safari can implement the large API-set interoperably.\nThe PPAPI sits directly atop chromium.org and webkit.org implementation code, which has unknown semantics. Reverse-engineering this pile of code is not feasible for any other vendor. Using it adds redundant bloat and coherence bugs, also no-go -- assuming competitors can even use open source in the first place, and are willing to take large Google-dominated source bases.\nI've updated my reply to add the last paragraph, because I am not sure how much large-scale software engineering you've done -- specifically API compatibility on top of unrelated codebases that interoperate using high-level content languages, but do not have much if any commonality in their native and OS-dependent C++ implementations.\nSaying PPAPI is cross-browser when this is undemonstrated, or asserting intent as if that matters, doesn't mean a thing.\n/be\nAPIs come with\nAPIs come with documentation. OpenGL standard, for example, is basically an API with documentation. I grant that the formality of an API can be weaker than you might desire, but I think that's an argument about quality or formality of a specification rather than its definition.\nI did not say PPAPI is (present tense) cross browser, nor even that it will be. I assert intent based on what I've read of PPAPI at wikipedia, its website, and a few blog articles over the years. No 'divine afflatus' needed. I think you're mischaracterizing PPAPI in any case.\nAnyhow, this argument really isn't about PPAPI.\nYou feel that Google has not made a sufficiently strong effort towards standardization of X for many values of X. I recognize your opinion, but I set a much lower bar for the associated obligations of any individual or organization.\nBy dmbarbour at Sat, 2011-09-24 00:19 | login or register to post comments\nIn the mean time, standards are for clients - PPAPI still provides cross-plugin standards to support portability.\nThis is simply false.\nFirst, standards (see the definition) on the Web and among browsers cover general notions of interoperating peers. They include both \"client\" standards (web developer and user facing), e.g. JS, HTML, CSS, the DOM; and plugin/browser standards, signficantly (since 2004) NPRuntime and NPAPI.\nSecond, asserting that PPAPI provides cross-plugin \"standards\" (there you go again -- PPAPI is not a standard) to support portability among Chrome for Mac, Chrome for Windows, and Chrome for Linux, simply says that Google Chrome is a program ported to several OSes. It does not say PPAPI is a standard, never mind a cross-browser standard.\nPPAPI is not a standard. Not even close. It's more like Google's ActiveX -- \"ActiveG\".\nI have no doubt you'll keep replying till doomsday, but since you've once again abused \"standard\", I'm done. No point arguing if we don't agree on definitions.\n/be\nPeers\nStandardization efforts are only justified to the extent they support your clients - i.e. if clients would avoid or abandon you if you lacked standardization, or join you based on your support for standards. There is no obligation to help one's competitors, so the only reason to pursue cooperation with 'peers' is if it mitigates risk, reduces costs, or improves quality for yourself or your clients.\nThus, standardization and standards are never 'for' peers, even though the standards themselves might cover notions of interop between peers.\nsimply says that Google Chrome is a program ported to several OSes\nIt is possible to write Chrome plugins that only work on one OS. So this is not a trivial issue.\nNo point arguing if we don't agree on definitions.\nWe also don't agree on principles or priorities, but I can agree that there's not much point in our further arguing.\nBy dmbarbour at Sat, 2011-09-24 00:25 | login or register to post comments\nI can agree that there's not much point in our further arguing.\nThank Crom.\nYou've almost single-handedle ruined LtU for me and a bunch of people I know.

Your posts are typically logical and well thought out (and correct in context), but sometimes it's OK to be wrong(if in fact that's the case here. There can be absolute correctness in one side of a debate, dismissing all retorts, but not always).\nI'd say it's nearly impossible to argue successfully with Mr. Eich in the arena of standards and open PL design... He's right that Google presents an image and history of openness, but they are fighting to preserve relevance in an increasingly JS-oriented world, like all of us (V8 isn't enough - or is it? JS is the language of the web today) and they are doing this behind closed doors. That's part of the political issue at play here.\nThe crux of the political argument here (right or wrong) is that hiding the development of a new web programming language is counter-intuitive/counter-productive since the web is open by design.\nTC39 have their work cut out for them. Would be nice to see more energy supplied by the big players like Google in that realm as that's where the market is driving us - let's not forget about the users of JS...\nStill, it will be interesting to see what Dart actually is and how it enables more capabilities and efficiencies (and productive tooling) for large scale web development. JS is almost there and all browsers support it, millions of developers are proficient in it, etc. Theory can't beat reach. At this point, Dart is theoretical until we see something realized in practice. Would be nice if more than one player could help shape the new, but the old will get better and it's open and standardized nature is very good for developers, browser makers and of course consumers.\nC\nYup.\nWould Google discuss Dash/Dart at all, were it not for the leaked memo?\nYes, Lars was listed as the keynote speaker at GOTO for several months, and the description of the keynote was filled in to mention Dart a few days before the memo came to the world's attention.\nMy guess is that the press surrounding that announcement was what tickled someone's memory of the leaked document.\nBy munificent at Thu, 2011-09-22 01:12 | login or register to post comments\n"}], [{"score": 556.26855, "uuid": "ebc757d2-c72c-5ad7-9e79-ded79b47a6ce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1309wb-45-14887", "target_hostname": "www.danavan.net", "target_uri": "http://www.danavan.net/weblog/archives/cat_technology.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Dana VanDen Heuvel: <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "I, for one, am seriously tired of <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> persistent begging for me to upgrade to Pro when I launch their player.

Very cool in its own right, but what was just as much fun for me was being able to build a website around the baby's birth, email everyone in several cities about the birth mere hours after Baby Berge was born, and do it all from a free Wi-Fi hotspot at Stone Creek Coffee in Milwaukee.\nThere's a story in the San Jose Mercury News about the demise of paid hotspots. Which, if you look around at everyone offering free wireless to attract customers, it's no wonder that the hot spots are going cold. There were several of us at Stone Creek with out wireless cards intact, and no fewer than 5 last night at Kavarna last night that were sitting on their *free* wireless connection (free, less the obligatory purchase you make because you feel like you should).\nIn my opinion, wireless is going to be just another service that gets tacked on to the expenses like water, trash disposal, a cleaning service, and the people that come to service the coffee machines and such. For the paltry $50- 100/month that it costs to keep this, and the low maintenance required, and the mediocre publicity and WOM/Buzz it offers to bring new customers through the door, I can't see why more businesses aren't adopting Wi-Fi (well, I'm sure there are several, such as hotspot squatters who take up real-estate for several hours in your coffee house for a mere $2.00 cup of coffee).\nThere's a good chance public WiFi will ultimately be free to consumers, with the costs paid by retailers who want to attract more clientele or by on-screen advertising.\nI don't know how this will turn out. But it's clear the market for public WiFi hotspots is evolving in ways no one anticipated two or three years ago, and many pioneers in the hotspot business will become involuntary heroes who sacrifice themselves to show others what not to do.\nPosted by Dana VanDen Heuvel at | TrackBack\nMay 28, 2004\nIntel IT Manager Game\nThis is too cool!\nThe Intel\u00ae IT Manager Game tests your entire skill set - people management, resource allocation, strategic analysis and planning.

We're constantly asked about the security of our software, and frankly, we've put every effort we can into making the end software secure and stable. Unfortunately, this is not the case with a lot of software makers on the market. Software is a tough business and one that's ever-evolving. There are greater minds than mine on this subject, for sure, but it's up to the software companies, both small and large, to reset the expectations that the public has on how usable, secure, stable, and fun (yes, fun) we can make our products. Peoples lives are surrounded by software, and it's critical that we realize that fact and develop our wares in such a way that we improve the user's experience with our tools and improve their quality of work-life through the value that our software adds.\n...Some interesting dialog from the interview...\nS: Do you mean the end-user software?\nJS: Yes. I mean basically every computer connected to the Internet. Put another way, you should not depend on the network to provide protection for your computer.\nS: What about the firewalls and network security software?\nJS: The firewall was never an integral part of the Internet architecture. Firewalls developed because end-host software wasn\u2019t secure. A lot of software, particularly on PCs, was designed in the days before networks. It was designed to run on personal computer hardware that was not very sophisticated when the PC first appeared. So, putting protections into end user software is difficult. Then add to that various marketing pressures\u2026for years security was simply not a priority. When you went to vendors, Microsoft and others, and said, \u201cYou should be putting some time and effort into making sure the software is not buggy as all-get-out,\u201d the answer was, \u201cWell, we promised we\u2019d ship by Friday, and you know, this is Internet time. We\u2019ve got to get this stuff out there\u2014nobody cares about security anyway.\u201d\nAnd so, with that kind of history, firewalls got developed because quite frankly, the network managers were told to \u201cdo something,\u201d and that\u2019s the kind of thing you can do.

It's human nature, I suppose, to refer to the known when describing the unknown. In the past few weeks, this has been happening with regard to two new tools I've been testing and writing about - Onfolio and Scopeware Vision.\nBoth of these products have been described as alternatives to OneNote. In my estimation, this is way off the mark. In fact, I think a much more compelling argument can be made that both Onfolio, a research gathering and publishing tool which I've written about here, and Scopeware Vision, which I'm preparing a review about for you, are excellent companions to OneNote in a productive synergy of information management tools.\nWhen products \"blur the lines\" like all three of these applications do, a lot of people try to define the new idea by a process of reduction. That is, they focus on one aspect of what the tol can do that overlaps with what they're familiar with rather than evaluating the new tool on its own merits.

Market researcher Gartner says the PC market in Western Europe declined 19% in the second quarter of 2011, although how much of that decline can be attributed to the slow economic climate is unclear. The only major manufacturer to show growth in that period was Apple \u2013 just 0.5%. No prizes for guessing which product sold the most.\nThere have been 25 million iPads shipped worldwide since its launch early last year, and it is in the vanguard of a quantum change in personal computing. Information and analysis provider IHS forecasts that shipments of internet-enabled consumer electronics devices will exceed those of PCs by 2013 (those figures include TV sets and game consoles). By 2015, IHS predicts, more than 780 million of these devices will be shipping per year, compared to 479 million PCs. They\u2019ll be the prime method of internet access at home, while at work or on the move, the tablet will hold sway.\nBut support for the tablet as the future of computing is far from unanimous. The judges for Greentree\u2019s GAME ON competition ( www.greentreegameon.com ) are all major users of technology, but offered varying views about the iPad. Most of them have one, but only two use it as their primary computer. Some cite compatibility with Windows applications and ease of typing, while others think it\u2019s still to become a true business tool and are concerned about letting them into secure business networks.\nSteve Ranger, Editor of UK computing news site Silicon.com, is more concerned about the implications for computing development if it\u2019s going to be dominated by consumer-oriented devices that are locked down to perform specific functions using pre-loaded applications. Innovations, he argues, came through programmable computers. Users became inventors, and Ranger fears losing that. \u201cThe risk is that instead of participating in a computing revolution we will end up passive consumers of it,\u201d he says.\nFor now, however, the iPad is the product all the computer makers want to beat. Some have already fallen by the wayside. HP recently quit the tablets and mobiles business, and its TouchPad \u2013 which was marketed as an iPad killer \u2013 is now being heavily discounted by retailers. Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola hints that it has plans for developing Android devices where software and hardware are integrated. Microsoft says its next operating system, Windows 8, will scale from small touchscreen devices to more conventional PCs.\nRanger says what Apple\u2019s rivals have to develop are devices that are cheaper through focusing on useful applications rather than flash bells & whistles, are able to connect easily with other systems (iPad doesn\u2019t have USB or SD) and support popular software like Flash. They have to be user-friendly, especially for non-techies, and they need a support system at least as good as, if not better than, Apple Store and Genius Bars.\nGiven proper development and marketing, a viable iPad alternative that businesses will embrace is possible. Apple, however, remains the sexiest product and has a head start. Best of luck, developers.\n"}, {"score": 551.30566, "uuid": "eb9380fd-c16b-55c8-bea7-94a5c4234220", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1710wb-98-25107", "target_hostname": "www.technologyreview.com", "target_uri": "http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/38690/page1/", "page_rank": 1.1731126e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Amazon&#x27;s Fire: A Cloud-Powered Contender - <em>Technology</em> Review", "snippet": "During the presentation, Bezos stood in front of an image of <em>Apple&#x27;s</em> white USB cord, <em>which</em> is used to synchronize the data on an iPhone, iPad, <em>or</em> iPod with a user&#x27;s computer.

Needless to say, public health is not exactly my area of expertise, but I was asked to focus more on how the internet and mobile devices are being used so that the graduate students attending could begin to think about how technological progress affects their work.\nThe event was organized by Mellanye Lackey , who had attended my talk last year on the mobile web at UNC's Wilson Library. She initially wanted me to repeat that presentation, but after we spoke we agreed that some tweaking was in order. So, if you're familiar with the mobile web presentation, there's some review here (especially in the case-against-apps section) but plenty of new stuff.\nI began with the slide above (you can see the entire deck here ) and asked the group if they could guess what the image was\u0097hoping that most would assume that it was something scientific, like a microscopic biological photograph of some kind. That way, when I revealed that it was actually a typically glib marketing stock photograph, it would be a nice ice breaker. That sort of worked. The crowd of enthusiastic phone-owners is, unfortunately, typical. Not, of course, in that this is the sort of thing that real human beings do\u0097congregate and go nuts over owning a phone\u0097but that this is the sort of reality that clueless marketers want to portray. Unfortunately, that tends to radically skew the kinds of discussion around technological innovation toward consumerism rather than deeper issues like how technologies are used and shape human behavior. I began there because I wanted to skew the conversation back the other way. There will be a momentary interlude of marketer-friendly stats, though only to emphasize the already intuitively understood explosion of mobile technology. (In other words, unnecessary eye candy.)\nSo let's start with the internet. The internet, after all, is the foundational technology on which almost everything we do today rests. It's also the only technology that I'm really qualified to discuss in any official capacity. (Of course, there is no internet-official credential other than using it, so I am not alone in this distinction.) But to take a step way back, it's worth considering that we use the internet in three contexts:\nThe Web \u0097 interacting with information formatted mostly by HTML and CSS and displayed on our desktop and laptop computers\nMobile Devices \u0097 interacting with information processed by mobile applications and displayed on our smartphones and tablets\nSurfaces and Objects \u0097 expanding the sources and recipients of information to include, well, surfaces and objects (more on this later, but for the impatient, I'm basically talking about \"the internet of things.\")\nI will come back to the web, but I want to start with mobile devices. In fact, I'm going to focus mostly on this category. To start, it doesn't hurt to ask what, exactly, are mobile devices? It's not just a more complex phone. Today's mobile devices\u0097I'm thinking mostly of smartphones and tablets\u0097are the first successful synthesis of three previously distinct devices that have been deeply embedded into our culture for quite a long time: They collapse the telephone, television and personal computer into one object small enough to fit into your pocket. In fact, because it is so easily carried, it has become one of our most desired, valued, and trusted objects. I'd love to see data on this, but in the absence of it, I'd bet that the average smartphone owner holds it directly in their hand for a shockingly long number of hours each day\u0097either in use or anticipation of use\u0097and I bet there is a substantial subset that are never outside of arm's reach of their smartphones, even when sleeping. Each of the three previously distinct devices once received our undivided attention, but must now share it. The stats below tell this story: The smartphone is one of the most popular products of all time\u0097powerful enough to be almost universally desired, cheap enough to be owned by a substantial global population\u0097and it has quickly ingratiated itself to almost every aspect of our day to day lives.\nAside from texting and phone calls\u0097the communication piece\u0097our entertainment and productivity use of mobile devices depends largely on applications. Even though mobile devices have web browsers, the majority of mobile users prefer apps. In fact, Jakob Nielsen's recently published a study showing that apps perform better than mobile-optimized websites . This is for a pretty obvious reason: Apps are developed specifically for the platform, whereas websites \"optimized\" for mobile pull double duty. In the case of monetized content, apps make financial transactions much simpler than websites, since they're able to leverage the app store's one-click payment functionality. Nielsen points out that the economics will continue to move in an unfavorable direction as far as apps are concerned, making development far too expensive if an app needs to be sold in the major mobile marketplaces (iOS, Android, Windows). To make matters worse, iOS alone has forked (phone/tablet), as has Android (KindleFire/everything else). This is a nightmare for developers. Nielsen says he doesn't know when to expect a strategic shift away from apps and back to the web, but in the absence of a calendar, I'd say stick with the web now. Why? Well, let me summarize my case in three brief points\n1. Economic Oligarchy\nThere are currently only two major mobile app marketplaces, Apple's and Google's (though Windows and Amazon will begin to change that). As of January, an estimated 400,000 apps were available in the Android marketplace, and 10 billion downloads had been made since its inception ( source ). As of February, Apple had over 500,000 apps available and reported 18 billion downloads to date ( source ). These are enormous inventories. However, over half of Android's market consists of free applications, keeping its overall revenue far under Apple's. With only 28% of its inventory consisting of free apps, Apple is raking it in big time. In December, the value of Apple's app store was estimated at $7.08 billion.\nThe average price of a mobile app in the Apple marketplace is now $3.64 (up from $1.65 last year). Apple gets 70% of each sale. With those numbers, you'd have to either be extraordinarily prolific or create an extraordinarily popular app to make any real money. Apple, on the other hand, only has to keep the shop open. This sort of situation doesn't exactly facilitate innovation. Any developer hoping to succeed will probably tend toward emulating what's already popular, whereas the next big thing is probably more likely to come from outside, where fewer controls exist to stifle creativity.\n2. Inefficient Development\nI think Jakob Nielsen said it better than I would have (or have before): Developing a decent app and making it as widely available as possible is only going to get more expensive . If each platform didn't have its own proprietary system with unique technical requirements and approval processes, developers could focus on building something great once. Instead, they now have to focus on doing it anywhere from two to five times, depending upon how much exposure they want. This alone is a good enough reason to stick with the web, in my opinion.\n3. Non-Indexable Content\nAside from the economics, this is actually my biggest complaint against apps\u0097they're not searchable. Unlike the web, which uses uniform resource locator character strings (URLs), there is no protocol for locating information contained within an app. Above is a great example: On the left is an article as it appears in WIRED's iPad app. It sure looks pretty, and to be fair, there are some nice ways to navigate through the issue's content. But there's no way to search for it, nor is there any specific way that I can point another person to it or \"bookmark\" it for myself to come back to later. If I wanted to share this article with a friend, there's no real way for me to do that. On the right is the same article on WIRED.com. With the URL at the top, I can easily come back to it or point others there. Also, I can get the same article, though with ads, at no charge, whereas the iPad version costs several dollars an issue. So why would I pay that? I'll just leave the question hanging.\nApps have taken off despite being immediately commoditized, completely unregulated, and inefficiently organized for content.\nThe web, of course, offers counterpoints. First and foremost, not all information is product. If you're going to sell content\u0097like books, movies, TV shows, music, etc.\u0097the app store works great. You give your payment info once, and then just about every bit of entertainment you could ever want is one click away. But that's entertainment. There's a ton of information that needs to be communicated, discoverable, and free. This is why academics, journalists, and civil servants are becoming more and more critical of \"Big Content\" and strong advocates of the web (recall the SOPA snafu). With web standards, continued development of HTML and CSS, as well as new device-agnostic approaches to development, the good old world wide web is still the best venue for the dissemination of information through the internet.\nGreat. So why is this relevant to public health practitioners?\nLet's start by going back to our smartphones. Aside from all this app stuff, think about what most phones can do today\u0097not in terms of software, but hardware. With two cameras, a microphone, and GPS, smartphones are an amazing data-gathering and tracking device. Remember those scenes in old spy movies, where someone has been bugged and show up on a screen somewhere as a moving red dot over a map? Now, imagine 4 billion bugs in 4 billion pockets, sending back information about each person's movements, and what they see and hear. Imagine what can be known about people, both individually and en masse, with the data that these tiny computers gather (assuming we don't find ways to lie to our devices ). Of course, a reasonable question is can we trust ourselves to use this information for good. More on that later.\nIf you've seen the recent Soderbergh film, Contagion , you'll see how leveraging this technology could do much more than just find new ways to capture our attention with advertising. If you haven't, the film tells the story of a fast-spreading virus and the CDC's effort to track down patient zero, understand how the virus formed, and create a vaccine\u0097all before it's too late. The degree to which this film\u0097as far as its depiction of the CDC and public health practitioners in general\u0097corresponds to reality or indulges in fantasy is not something I can fully discern. But, the technology Contagion's characters use to follow the trail of the virus\u0097aggregating and analyzing surveillance video and data from patients' mobile devices including call logs, text messages, and images\u0097is within reach. My interpretation is that the film consciously utilizes a language of realism to depict something that, though a fantasy today, will be a reality soon. It's a statement of intent\u0097just like much of our science fiction is\u0097to pursue that reality.\nAfter watching this film, it occurred to me that another very recent attribute of mobile devices is the soft-AI of the automated personal assistant programs Siri and Cluzee. They're inching toward the kind of parallel computing that any Star Trek fan has been anticipating for years: the ability to speak commands directly to a computer able to interpret the command and execute it immediately. With applications like Siri, people can at least now use mobile devices more safely\u0097not depending upon touch and line-of-sight interactions. After all, it doesn't appear that we're going to get people to stop using their phones while driving, so our next best bet is to get them to stop touching and looking at them. A bit more long-term, a program like Siri could conceivably be embedded throughout a home in order to replace medical alert services of the I've-fallen-and-can't-get-up variety.\nMeanwhile, other technological developments will begin to extend our computing experiences beyond traditional screens. That brings us back to the surfaces and objects incantation of the internet.\nThere are probably going to be two stages to this transition. First, a literal extension, which will transform a variety of surfaces into screens. We first saw this several years ago with one of Microsoft's many flops, it's Microsoft Surface tech , otherwise known as the big-ass table. More recently, Corning has been dreaming up a glassy future appropriately called \"A Day Made of Glass\" in which we'll spend almost every moment of the day moving information around from screen to screen ( Part 1 , Part 2 ). Not exactly a future I'm looking forward to, but there is an interesting sequence in Part 2 (starting at 3:07) depicting how Corning's specialty anti-microbial scratch and chemical resistant glass could be used to distribute computing devices in health care facilities. It get's a bit farfetched in surgery, where the doctor gets all Minority Report before projecting a hologram of a patient's brain over his head, but the ideas aren't bad. If you're going to get more computing devices in hospitals, you've got to figure out how to do it without spreading bacteria and making people sicker. Or, get patients to do it themselves remotely , but that's another issue entirely.\nThe second stage will be more figurative\u0097an unseen result of a distributed world sensor layer that gathers vast sets of data generated by our comings and goings, pushing the boundaries of interaction far beyond the visual and quasi-tactile. IBM has been working on this for years and has created a beautiful film, THINK , demonstrating their vision. In the image above I'm showing how it might look if people, transportation devices, roads, sanitation and electrical systems were all part of an internet-connected system. I explained this in a piece I wrote recently for HOWInteractive.com on the future of interactive design . I'll just pull from there rather than re-write it:\nThe good news is that we\u0092re making amazing progress with awareness technology\u0097and it\u0092s not all dystopic surveillance and Skynet. Much of it has been based upon the use of radio-frequency identification, or RFID, a technology that can be minuscule and embedded into objects so software can \u0093see\u0094 where those objects are and \u0093feel\u0094 how they\u0092re being used. This kind of monitoring and analysis could help us design better systems of all kinds\u0097from \u0093smart\u0094 buildings to more efficient roads, transit systems, electrical grids, and much more. The possibilities are very exciting.\nBut it\u0092s not about building a techno-utopia. For me, a world with more machines is not necessarily a better world. The reality is the problems we face\u0097the crumbling infrastructure, a dwindling supply of natural resources, pollution\u0097have outscaled our cognitive capacity. We\u0092re smart enough to recognize them, and even to propose legitimate solutions to some of them. But we\u0092re not fast enough to get to them all before the damage is too great, and we\u0092re not able to see how they\u0092re interconnected to avoid proposing a solution that might nip one issue in the bud but make another worse. There\u0092s an urgency here that\u0092s just as significant a motivator as exploring a new technology. So, if there\u0092s any hope of a world with a healthy balance of the natural and the technological, we\u0092re going to need to increase the ubiquity of the machine in the short-term. Sure, it\u0092s daunting, but what could be more inspiring than working for a better world?\nWithout edges, everything is vulnerable.\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, I imagine that after taking in all of this information, anyone might feel pretty nervous. After all, I'm describing a world in which much more data about you is available than ever before, and to more people than ever before. For example, plenty of companies today are selling single-sign on systems to hospitals that offer significant value in terms of procedural efficiency gains. If a doctor can sign in system-wide once using a biometric of some kind (fingerprint or retinal scan, for example), she might save a significant amount of time in the aggregate\u0097time she can instead spend treating patients. But this also means that a third party now has access to a significant amount of the hospital's data. With enough customers, a third party single-sign on software company could be vulnerable to hackers, putting a tremendous amount of patient data at risk. For this, there are solutions, of course\u0097things like firewalls and encryption. But the point is that as the complexity of our data collection and analysis practices grows, the need for security and privacy measures compounds. No system will ever be 100% secure.\nAdditionally, there are legal compliance issues to navigate that pertain to patient information confidentiality and security requirements for technological systems that interact with that information. Instead of developers being expected to gain expertise in things like HIPAA compliance (familiarity, yes; expertise, no) those involved in healthcare of any kind should grow in their understanding of technological issues. Each side needs to bring awareness and a point of view to the table and cooperate in order to ensure the best result. I only mention this because I've observed the opposite.\nBut that's not really where the discomfort ends, unfortunately. IBM noted in their THINK exhibit that traffic pattern analysis was not only beneficial to improving city planning, but in developing predictive algorithmic engines for driver behavior. In other words, research is beginning to show that what you do behind the wheel can be predicted. And you thought you were in control, did you?! With a worldwide sensor layer like the one I described, we can only imagine the insights that will be gained by analyzing the resulting data. The benefits of constructing this layer, in terms of solving those big, worldwide problems, may be well worth the privacy and individuality sacrifices, but we need to make that decision intentionally. It's worth pointing out that in Contagion, every bit of information the CDC was able to analyze was gathered as a result of the characters' willing forfeiture of privacy\u0097by using cellphones, the internet, being in public places, and using public transportation. Just like we do. We are already building this sensor layer. What is likely to make us uncomfortable even just in anticipation of a broader system like the one I described is the notion that our patterns could be so easily predicted, as IBM expects. This will call in to question not only our individuality, but our agency.\nThis kind of philosophical question is beyond the scope of this post, but I want to leave it with you to think over. Technology is also like a mirror, and if it begins to reflect back to us something that we don't recognize, we must determine why and what, if anything, we can do about it.

I believe it can.\nA report published in 2006 by the U.K. Government\u2019s Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology concluded that:\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) can help developing countries tackle a wide range of health, social and economic problems. By improving access to information and by enabling communication, ICT can play a role in reaching Millennium Development Goals such as the elimination of extreme poverty, combating serious disease, and achieving universal primary education and gender equality\nAnd a new report issued this year by the United Nations says that \u201cICT offers the promise of fundamentally changing the lives of much of the world\u2019s population. ICT affects many of the processes of business and government, how individuals live, work and interact, and the quality of the natural and built environment.\u201d\nFrom 2006 through 2010, I was fortunate to travel and work with microfinance organizations based in Central and South America, various parts of Africa, the Middle East, former Soviet republics, Afghanistan and India. During that period, I served as CIO for a global microfinance organization, FINCA International, learning firsthand the technology problems \u2014 and also the benefits \u2014 of making loans to developing nations.\nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) and the nations they serve clearly face economic and political problems, as well as corruption, lack of infrastructure (e.g., passable roads, electricity) and last, but not least, ICT. Specifically, the four most critical ICT-related challenges for MFIs in developing countries are:\nUnreliable electricity\nLack of access to good, experienced IT resources\nLack of access to robust and scalable core banking software\nSome people will correctly note that in the last couple of years, Africa and India have seen steady improvements in telecommunications capability and that cell phones have proliferated. From only 16 million subscribers in 2000, Africa now boasts 500 million cell phone subscribers in 2010, according to telecommunications firm Ericsson . At the same time, however, by the end of 2010, the percentage of Internet users in Africa had reached only 9.6 percent, far behind both the world average (30%) and the developing country average (21%).)\nOverall, there are still too many countries where the rate of change has been painfully slow, and completing simple tasks can be very time consuming. I believe that it would be economically and politically beneficial if telecommunications vendors could help improve Internet connectivity whether by using Wi-Max, general packet radio service (GPRS), satellite or other technologies. In the meantime, MFIs perform a valuable service in providing those at the bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) a means to stand on their own two feet.\nThe Technology Landscape\nMFIs, however, usually have minuscule technology budgets and a typical in-country environment may feature:\nTwo or three PCs that are several years old, plus printers, etc., at branch offices of microfinance organizations\nA LAN (local area network) is common at the headquarters (HQ) office, usually with no authentication capability; a LAN is not normally found in a branch office.\nInternet connectivity at HQ locations, but not in branch offices.\nHQ locations normally have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) because street power is unreliable, but most branches do not.\nMoreover, access to good, experienced IT staff is a huge challenge. Most organizations try to have, one knowledgeable IT person at the HQ location who can fix PCs and has a basic knowledge of networking. This challenge is somewhat reduced if the HQ is located in the country\u2019s capital city. But usually, working knowledge of LANs, Active Directory, firewalls or SQL is rare, as is good support from IT vendors. If available, the cost may also be prohibitive.\nStrengthening Software Models\nFor all of these reasons, most small- to midsize MFIs use homegrown financial-lending software or programs provided by a small \u201cmom and pop\u201d software factory. This approach works when the organization is small and has limited needs, but as the finance organization grows and demands increase for added functionality and support, the software struggles to scale up, and support suffers.\nAs CIO at FINCA International, I experienced the technology challenges faced by our operations in 21 countries. These included a lack of experienced staff and robust, scalable core banking software. I found that these problems also affected other MFIs, large and small.\nSince leaving FINCA, my mission has been to bring affordable access to robust and scalable core banking software \u2014 for the microfinance sector \u2014 to nations in Latin\u00a0 America, Africa and Asia. That\u2019s why I helped form MicroPlanet Technologies Inc. , a nonprofit organization that aims to address the technology-related challenges faced by MFIs globally.\nWe aim to improve the MFIs\u2019 operational capabilities, enable growth through stronger controls, improve portfolio quality, and raise bottom-line impact by increasing both return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). We focus on the midsize to large MFIs, and we market a hybrid Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. This service addresses the quirks of operating in an environment with unreliable Internet connectivity by using an off-site server, which enables the MFI to continue to operate even when connectivity to the hosted environment is down.\nOur first client, Friendship Bridge , an MFI in Guatemala, now runs our SaaS solution from a hosted site in Denver, Colo. To support MFI clients in AfricaAsia, Data Center infrastructure will need to be hosted in the cloud through either London or Frankfurt to ensure favorable response times.\u00a0 and\nMicroPlanet Technologies has partnered with banking software provider Infrasoft Technologies for its core software platform, which is used both by regulated and nonregulated MFIs. With this platform, MFIs can focus their resources on growing and scaling their operations, and our company shoulders the burden of managing and servicing their technology needs.\nProviding cloud-based software solutions is just one small step in addressing the huge needs of developing nations and those of the MFIs. However, I believe it is an important catalyst that will help to spur these MFIs to scale, grow and extend their reach, ultimately benefiting more poor people around the world.\nMicrofinance in itself is not a panacea for poverty, but when coupled with other efforts that help improve health and provide better access to clean drinking water, education and agriculture, it can make a huge difference.\nJiten Patel, Co-Founder, MicroPlanet Technologies Inc.\nJiten has spent many years in financial services and technology, including deep experience in the microfinance sector. He is now bringing a cloud-based SaaS offering to MFIs in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, as well as technology and operations consulting globally.\nPrior to MicroPlanet, he was Chief Information Officer of FINCA International, a global microfinance organization operating in 21 countries. At FINCA, Jiten was successful in reorganizing the global IT infrastructure for local ownership of critical technology while simultaneously ensuring increased global efficiencies. Before that, he was CIO for a U.S.-based consumer finance subsidiary of Banco Popular, where he and his team helpt it grow its portfolio from $2 billion to $10 billion in four years. Jiten earned a degree in mathematics from the University of Liverpool, U.K.\nAre You Intrigued?\nInterested in learning more or helping the cause? I welcome assistance from my peers in ICT. This could range from offering staff time to work on a project (no better way to gain experience in doing more with less!); offering excess capacity or other resources such as data center facilities or Internet connectivity; donating fully depreciated hardware or software, or access to training facilities and courses.

Soon after, it's coming to other cities .)\nCourtesy of PhD Productions\nIt's hardly surprising that Losing Control was written and directed by someone who earned a Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard Medical School. (That Valerie Weiss did so while simultaneously serving as filmmaker-in-residence at the university's Dudley Film Program is all kinds of surprising.)\nThis being a romantic comedy, the plot of Losing Control is paper-thin, and there were times when the film felt a little less than Hollywood perfect. But for me, that only added to its charm. Maybe it was the little touches that drew me in. In one scene, the protagonist is forced to move her experiments to her kitchen, where she uses a salad spinner as a centrifuge. Yes, I know that a salad spinner couldn't possibly have any utility as a centrifuge -- the point is that the film devotes any screen time to centrifugation at all.\nCourtesy of PhD Productions\nLosing Control was obviously shot in a real lab. This leads to hijinks that would be staples of funny movies if only more than about one percent of the population had ever been inside a research facility. For example, the old \"when all else fails and you have a date in 10 minutes, wash off in the emergency shower\" gag.\nCourtesy of PhD Productions\nLosing Control doesn't dwell on the protagonist's research. In fact, it's full of people dismissing or misapprehending the fairly straightforward problem she's working on. Which should ring true for anyone in a technical field who has ever tried to explain what it is you do. And the plot? It's about how love isn't amenable to the tools of science. Awwww.

I'm quite pleased about that as to-date he has shown little interest in how software is created. I got to meet his teacher at the high school's Back-to-School night, and asked her what she would be covering. They're starting off with some \"database\" stuff using MS Access, and then, surprisingly, moving into C++, before moving into the realm of drag-n-drop programming with Visual Basic.\nI'm really quite pleased about the C++ aspect. I question whether or not it is a good first language, but Travis should learn some good foundational skills working with it.\nA while back I was reading Geek Dad and he posted an entry about a newish language called Processing I took a look at it because he wrote a about how it can be used to create computer art. One of Travis's interests is graphic design, so I passed the link on to him. I also sent him the link to my own Conway's Life program.\nSaturday I took some time to make sure there were a recent versions of Python and wxPython installed, along with Cody Precord's very capable Editra text editor (written using Python + wxPython).\nTravis sat down with me at the family iMac and I walked him through running life.py, and loading it into Editra. It wasn't long before he was digging through the code and making some minor changes, \"how do I change the colours?\" \"what happens if I change the grid size?\" \"Look at what I did mom!\"\nWe talked about classes, and the meaning of \"self\" in python code, and briefly touched on some of the wxPython. Feeling I'd tapped out the depth of that avenue of conversation as I didn't want to get too deep into programming concepts yet, I walked him through downloading Processing, installing it and running it for the first time. We then did some pair-programming as he worked through the very unique Processing \"Hello World\" tutorial.\nThen it was time to look at some of the sample code, and then more and more questions came and we started learning this new language together, experimenting with time delays, and programmatically changing the colours of lines that were drawn. Processing while based on Java, provides almost instant feedback (no compile step), and you get to see the results of your labour immediately. I've never been a fan of Java, but Processing makes tinkering with code, so enjoyable, I will be more than happy to spend many more hours \"sketching\" with Travis.\nDefined tags for this entry: family , programming\nWednesday, September 17. 2008\nWhy Unit Testing Matters\nI've been working on Rollem my D&D character generator for a while. When I write I have to prevent myself from editing because once I start editing, I never finish writing and I'd dearly love to finish something someday. When I write code, I have discovered I have the same problem I re-factor, and re-factor and re-factor and never finish the project.\nOne of the problems with re-factoring is how do you know if the re-factor is correct?\nMy current refactor is completely and utterly divorcing the Model from the GUI code. They only interact via messages passed with PubSub. It's been tough as I try and re-mold my though processes to fit what is a new paradigm for me. This has entailed some significant code changes and many things are broken right this instant. They are broken to the point where I am sometimes despairing of ever making them work right. However, I do have one thing working in my favour. I have unit tests for my code. Those unit tests provide a wonderful to-do list for me in digging out of the hole I have created. They prevent me from throwing in the towel and starting over from scratch. They tell me when my re-factors work so I can move on to the next test failure and fix it.\nI don't know how those of you who kick and scream and fight and claw about how unit testing will increase your work load manage to accomplish anything! How do you know when your code is correct? I certainly know that without the road map my tests provide I'd be incredibly discouraged and frustrated.\nDefined tags for this entry: oop , python , unittest\nMonday, September 8. 2008\nI have PocketMac.\nI hate PocketMac.\nIt sorta kinda works most of the time, but it requires me plugging in a USB cable--I don't know why, both my BlackBerry and my PowerBook support Bluetooth--and sometimes it gets all messed up and duplicates events, but like I said it sorta kinda works, but since it only sorta kinda works I often didn't sync it, it was just to frustrating. That frustration led to me not always remembering things I was supposed to remember, and that is bad.\nI wasn't really looking for a solution, Rim had acquired PocketMac, and I was hopeful that they might eventually bring out a version of the product that worked the way it should. That hope, so far has been in vain.\nFirst I started using GMail, then after several years of doing that I started using GReader, and with both those products working so well for me, I decided the time had come to try GCal. I messed around with it a bit and, as usual was impressed by how good a job Google had done creating a web app, but I didn't do much more than mess around a bit until I discovered that Google had created a syncing tool for the BlackBerry . Then things began to change.\nThe previous link will let you download Google Sync over the air, directly to your BlackBerry, once you have it installed, you can log in too GCal using your Google credentials and perform your first sync. By default Google Sync will resync every two hours or whenever you make a change on your BlackBerry. There are a couple of things you need to know. Google Sync will not sync events created prior to its installation. It will only sync new events. This seems to be a bit of an oversight, but that's the way it works. The other thing to note is that sync has frozen up on me at least once. I don't know why. It just stalled and it took me rebooting my BlackBerry to get it moving again.\nAfter getting things working between GCal and BlackBerry I tackled getting things working between GCal and iCal. I found this reference at Google which will help you decide whether to setup a CalDav link between GCal and iCal or not.\nNow that everything is configured, I can make changes on my BlackBerry and have them appear on my PowerBook as well as on the web at GCal. I'm sure I'll discover problems, but it works far better than PocketMac ever has.\nDefined tags for this entry: apple , blackberry , technology\nFriday, August 29. 2008\nOpen Media Library\nMy friend, co-worker and Dungeon Master, Transluscent has been working on a plugin for Vista Media Center called Open Media Library This is an open source effort that allows users to have great control over playing and managing their media libraries using Vista Media Center and Media Center Extenders (such as the XBox 360).\nWhile I don't own a Windows machine, I have been watching the team's work, and think their interface is one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time.\nIf you have an interest in such things go download one of their builds (they are releasing nightlies) and join in the discussion on their forums .\nDefined tags for this entry: mediacenter , movies , oml , technology , windows , xbox360\nThursday, August 28. 2008\nLast.fm Widget Plugins for Serendipity\nI don't make near as much use of Last.fm as I could, but I run iScrobbler on my PowerBook, and love their widgets, particularly the music quilts and the recently played ones.\nI wanted to get them on this blog, but I'm horrible with CSS so couldn't see wedging them onto the page that way.

Seven years ago when first learning about unit tests in my day job (coding in perl with a home grown test framework). I decided to experiment with them in python. Starting with the built in unit test framework, I quickly found that I didn't like it. It didn't work the way I thought it should work and for me, made testing more difficult than it should be.

The subject is \u201corganizational judgment,\u201d or how organizations can build ongoing capabilities for better decision making. One approach to reaching that goal is to broaden participation in decision processes. The storage and software company EMC, and the consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, provide two great examples of transformation in that regard.\nWhile EMC\u2019s corporate strategy was very broad-based, it used social media tools to change corporate culture and build consensus. P&G, meanwhile, took an IT-driven approach from the start. In fact, if you\u2019re an IT leader, it\u2019s important to realize that a big part of your job is improving organizational judgment. You can do it through greater participation in decision processes, through data and analytics, or even automated decision-making applications.\nMoving From Control to a Collaboration Culture\nEMC traditionally had a hierarchical, \u201ccommand and control\u201d culture. However, that culture began to change over time with a variety of acquisitions and geographical expansion. By 2007, the company had changed enough so that executives decided to implement a social media platform. Called EMC|One, it began as a controllable, manageable environment that would enable a more participative \u201c2.0 culture\u201d for the company. The journey is described in a blog by EMC\u2019s VP and Global Marketing CTO, Chuck Hollis, here .\nInitially, the online discussions on the EMC|One platform involved hobbies more than business. But in mid-2008, the company\u2019s financial position, like that of many companies in its industry, began to worsen, and EVP and CFO David Goulden established a \u201ccost transformation\u201d project to reduce costs and maintain profitability. One of the initial policy changes involved vacations and because some employees found that change unclear or confusing, they used EMC|One as a vehicle for discussion and clarification. The cost transformation team found these discussions useful in implementing the new policy.\nShortly thereafter, Michelle Lavoie, a middle manager in EMC\u2019s services business, posted a message on EMC|One encouraging\u00a0 their employees to offer cost-reduction suggestions of their own. She also suggested some ideas herself. That discussion took off, with more than 26,000 views and 364 responses \u2014 and new ones were still coming in 18 months later.\nWhen EMC executives announced a pay cut in April 2009, the full impact of the social platform became clear. As Lavoie commented:\nWhen the 5% pay cut was announced, along with the addition of five days of paid vacation for the year, a lot of people understood that they made a difference, and that the discussions were being heard. The pay cut was difficult for some people, but we were proud and happy to do it because we\u2019d been discussing it all along.\nGoulden, EMC\u2019s CFO, commenting on the overall value of EMC|One in the cost reduction initiative, said:\nUltimately, we distilled about 200 different ideas from employees on EMC|One. ... It\u2019s clear that the feeling of participation and morale issues were the most important contribution from EMC|One. People had a sense of being part of the process, as opposed to receiving memos about it.\nLavoie now has a new job as manager of EMC|One, and EMC has a new, more participative culture that is sure to yield better decisions in the future.\nSpheres of Business Intelligence and Analytics at P&G\nProcter & Gamble is another organization using IT to improve its organizational judgment, but in a different way. It is using business intelligence and analytics to speed up the process of data-based decisions. The company\u2019s IT group \u2014 known more appropriately as Information and Decision Solutions (IDS) \u2014 has created a series of Business Spheres, specially designed\nrooms for making decisions based on visual information displays. IDS has rolled out more than 40 of these spheres around the world, and they are transforming how P&G leaders monitor and manage the business.\nBesides making technology in general a top priority at the company, P&G takes decision making very seriously and describes its IDS as\na key business enabler that advances technology tools, strategic development, collaboration, and decision making.\u201d The Business Spheres clearly demonstrates this emphasis.\nAs these examples illustrate, IT isn\u2019t the only resource an organization needs to create the capability for better decisions over time, but it\u2019s a pretty important one. And if you\u2019re not using your IT to create better judgment, your organization isn\u2019t making the kind of decisions that it should.\nTom Davenport is the President's Distinguished Professor of IT and Management at Babson College and Research Director of the International Institute for Analytics.\nWant to read a sample chapter of the new book?

Is it really an important key to the future success of my real estate business? Maybe you\u2019ve heard other agents complain that their website just doesn\u2019t produce any results. Mine didn\u2019t either, that\u2019s because most websites leave out one super important feature of a successful online marketing plan, the strategy itself! (No I\u2019m not a real estate website salesman) In fact, being online is crucial to your business success if you are plan on staying in business for the long-term. The problem is most people know nothing about successful internet marketing.\nReal quick note: Before starting any online strategy, you must know that there are two different but equally as important parts to a successful online plan.\nSEO. Search Engine Optimization. On page and off page.\nOnline Marketing. The touchy-feelies, call to action, etc.\nIn short, SEO gets you in front of the prospect and online marketing determines if the prospect likes you or not.\nWe must revamp our real estate marketing plan to include the internet, especially with all the new technology and opportunities available to us online. You know as well as I that we really don\u2019t have the option to \u201copt out\u201d of this one. The internet is here to stay and our ways of doing business certainly have, and will continue changing as the Web continues to grow and becomes even more the \u201cprimary\u201d way people transact and exchange information.\nThe question is have you noticed? If you answered no, you might be one of the few brokers left who are still convinced that this \u201cinternet\u201d thing-a-ma-jigy will just go away\u2026someday, if you wish hard enough.\nOn the other hand, though, you may have conceded to the fact that you do need a solid web-based real estate marketing plan but you don\u2019t know where to start. You don\u2019t want to get suckered into a \u201cguru program\u201d and spend a bunch of money only to find yourself with the same terrible results that your old canned website produced. Again, a website is not adequate in itself to produce any measurable results and is not internet marketing or SEO. I break down the differences of online marketing and SEO in another article.\nWhen it comes to online technology and internet strategies do you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of the movie, The Matrix, where everything seems to be a bunch of meaningless green letters and symbols just floating across the screen? (it makes sense if you\u2019ve actually seen the movie) My point is you feel lost. If you do, its important to understand that you don\u2019t need to know any of that techie stuff to learn to do what I and other successful real estate agents do to succeed online. You might be encouraged to know that many brokers who start learning the techniques I\u2019m talking about are anything but tech-savvy. Some are even strangers to browsing and email.\nNow, I don\u2019t consider myself a super wiz kid or anything when it comes to technology either, but when it comes to SEO and online marketing\u2026that I can do. So you might be thinking to yourself; okay Mr. Smartypants, why don\u2019t you just tell us how to do everything you do so we all can have an effective online marketing strategy too\u2026right now? I\u2019d love to, but truthfully, it takes more hands on than just reading one simple article to learn how to put the pieces together and work. Instead, I think I\u2019ll start with some of the things that you don\u2019t need to understand to kick- start your new agent success plan.\nYou don\u2019t need to:\nUnderstand the Google and other search engine algorithms.\nYou don\u2019t need to know how to write computer language.\nYou don\u2019t need to consider yourself a pro at the internet.\nYou don\u2019t need to be \u201ctech\u201d savvy. Some students are even new to email and browsing!\nYou don\u2019t need to pay a guru for their help. They usually charge you too much anyway.\nKnowing the need and understanding the benefits and success potential you could have with a solid internet marketing plan, you just need to decide how you are going to learn the nuts and bolts, strategy, techniques, needed to take your business success to the next level. Because I wanted to collapse time frames and get moving quickly, I chose to hire a private mentor to coach to train me. Or, you can read books, research web articles and spend the next year or two trying to figure it out.\nThere are many different techniques you could learn to attack the market online, but my suggestion is to learn 3 or 4 to start. That way, you won\u2019t get exhausted, overwhelmed, and give up. I believe it is very important to start like I did:\nGet a mentor or training system\nLearn a few powerful and proven techniques and master them quickly.\nGet an auto-responder system (like AWeber)\nStart seeing results in 6-8 weeks with diligence.\nWhat kind of results? Well, what is our goal with any marketing plan? Leads, or better yet, FREE inbound buyer and seller leads! This is the reward for any well thought out and targeted marketing plan, whether it\u2019s offline or online. The main purpose of an internet strategy is to create a system for free inbound leads where prospects contact you for your real estate services. I\u2019d say this is a much better (and rewarding) plan than spending hundreds of dollars on postcards, mailers, and print advertising where you get one (hopeful) bang for your buck, then it\u2019s over. As a matter of fact, the techniques I use are free, and once I create an internet sales funnel (or pipeline), it keeps working for me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! I don\u2019t know about you, but if I can find massive success online through free techniques, I\u2019m all in.\nHere are some of my favorite internet marketing techniques:\nBlogs and share blogs\nArticle marketing\nSocial media\nYou see, that doesn\u2019t sound too hard right? The key is to master the methods, techniques, and strategies that will boost you in the search engine results and not risk identifying your content as spam. This is where search engine optimization (SEO) comes into play. This is also why I recommend reading my article about SEO and Internet Marketing.\nOnline IT Degree Via Distance Education\nAdvances in technology have changed how people and businesses interact with the outside world.

Border and geography are no more an issue in the online world because everyone from anywhere can meet together at a place called the internet. The enhancement of online technology shortens the distance between people all around the world and at the same time it creates new form of online learning opportunities.\nIt does not like the old day when people only learned at physical schools that had fixed schedules. With the enhancement of online technology, education can be done online. Online education has been introduced for decades. In the earlier stage of introduction, online education has faced a lot of technology limitation that slowed its growth, but following the enhancement of online technology for broadband internet connection, it has taken a big step to grow as one of the preferred education options for students to pursue their degrees.\nOnline technology also makes possible for learning and working to be done simultaneous, instead of asynchronously. In the old day, working individuals who were thinking of earning a career related degree had to quit their job or taking unpaid leave if they want to study full-time. Or, they need to scarify their family time to take the evening classes on a related degree program. Both options need you to scarify either your current job or your family time. But, online education enables you to perform both work and study at the same time. With a proper time management, you can keep your current job and carrying out family obligations while getting a degree online. Online technology has created a new learning opportunity for working individuals, encouraging more and more adult learners who have entered workplaces for years to go back to school and learning at virtual world from anywhere and at any time.\nIn the old day, you might have to go to library or bookstores to find references for knowledge when you need it.

With online technology, full-time moms now can learn new knowledge and improve themselves with the necessary knowledge to stay at the edge of the modern world. They can even learn how to earn an income online with home-based businesses and generate an income stream to support their family.\nSummary\nOnline technology has changed the way we learn. It offers new learning opportunities that can be reached easily and in a convenient way from anywhere and at any time.\nBenefits of Online Technology on the Human Resource Department\nThe advent of the online technology has made the entire process of recruitment of the employees both challenging and easy on part of the human resource group. There are now online job boards, recruitment websites available in the internet which altogether can help the managers and the other member of the group to perform the function quite effectively and efficiently.

Now he's published a huge (6-page) piece on Xbox 360 defects at Venture Beat, which, he writes: \"I view ... as the last chapter for my book on the making of the Xbox 360, The Xbox 360 Uncloaked: The Real Story Behind Microsoft's Next-Generation Video Game Console .\"\nIn some respects it could be considered a post mortem. Since the body is still very much alive, however, it's a painful one for Microsoft. He writes:\nI asked Microsoft to confirm or deny 35 different facts contained in this story. Instead, I received a formal statement from a Microsoft spokesperson, saying the company had already acknowledged an \"unacceptable number of repairs\" to Xbox 360 consoles and responded to the hardware failures with a free replacement program. The statement also said, \"This topic has already been covered extensively in the media. This new story repeats old information, and contains rumors and innuendo from anonymous sources, attempting to create a new sensational angle, and is highly irresponsible.\"\nI don't think this story is sensational. I have tried to verify the facts over several years.\nOn the more optimistic side, Takahashi notes that the latest motherboard, Jasper,\nhas both a 65nm IBM microprocessor as well as a 65nm graphics chip from AMD. The improved graphics chip may finally run at acceptable thermal limits. But it's very late in coming, compared to the rest of the chip industry, in part because Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the chip contract manufacturer making the graphics chips, was slow to shift to 65nm factories. Late or not, Jasper is what enabled Microsoft to cut its prices this week.\nNext year, or maybe in 2010, there's Valhalla. \"That board will have a single chip that combines both the graphics chip and microprocessor on a single device. This is the kind of technical tour de force that Sony achieved with the chips for the PlayStation 2, a move that allowed the company to significantly reduce manufacturing costs.\"\nUltimately, of course, the Xbox 360 has been too successful for Microsoft to be able to junk it, the way it junked the Xbox. It has to keep the show on the road in order to hold on to the advances it has made in the development and sale of console games, and the success of the Xbox Live service.\n"}, {"score": 529.466, "uuid": "5e13ad7e-7c4b-5cb5-8a5e-f665e7a5aedb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-97-04242", "target_hostname": "blogs.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/12/23-week/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Week beginning December 23, 2007 | <em>Technology</em> | Guardian Unlimited", "snippet": "The star performer for the year was <em>Google&#x27;s</em> personalized start page service iGoogle <em>which</em> increased traffic in the 12 months to November by 267.64%.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tech Weekly podcast looks ahead to 2008\nCharles Arthur / Podcasts 11:39pm\nWhich will win the HD wars, Blu-ray or HD DVD, and what will be the deciding factor?

Apple iPad 2 vs. Motorola Xoom vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab\nWhich Tablet Works Best? Apple iPad 2 vs. Motorola Xoom vs. Samsung Galaxy Tab\nThe Apple iPad 2 has arrived, and the big question is, how does it stack up against the competition? To provide an answer, I've been testing the iPad 2 next to the Motorola Xoom and the Samsung Galaxy Tab.\nHere are my thoughts about which models perform best on ten crucial criteria.\nWhich Tablet Is Easiest to Hold?\nHands-down, the 7-inch Galaxy Tab gets the nod here. Yes, it's chunky (0.5 inch thick, with boxy sides); but at a weight of 0.8 pound, it's significantly lighter than the iPad 2 (1.3 pounds).\nThat said, the 9.7-inch iPad 2 is the way to go if you want a tablet with a bigger screen. It's much easier to hold than its predecessor, thanks to its tapered sides, thinner design, and lighter weight (the original iPad tipped the scales at 1.5 pounds). The Motorola Xoom, at 1.6 pounds and with a thickness of 0.5 inch, is leaden by comparison.\nWeight and thickness matter more than you might think--and not just because most people like to hold a book or magazine in one hand to read it. It's important to realize that when you use the tablet without a surface, you are essentially holding it one-handed, because you have to use your other hand to operate the tablet.\nWhich Tablet Has the Best Screen?\nHere, the iPad 2 gets the win. Images on its display looked evenly and accurately saturated and balanced. I wish that text looked significantly sharper--I prefer precise text with no jaggies, the way it appears on an iPhone 4--but the iPad 2 still beats the competitors in its category.\nThe rival tablets have different shortcomings. I liked the sharpness of the Galaxy Tab's 1024-by-600-pixel display, but not the tendency of its 7-inch LCD to produce oversaturated colors. The Tab is a pleasure to look at otherwise, and it finishes a close second to the iPad overall, but don't expect a high level of color accuracy from it.\nThe Xoom has a 1024-by-800-pixel display, but its text rendering was inconsistent, with several fonts showing unexpected choppiness (I especially got this impression in the Web browser, and in the Google Books app). More worrisomely, colors appeared to be off (the image at left shows the Xoom's duller colors, as compared with the Tab's oversaturated colors). Since the Xoom is the only Android 3.0 tablet to appear so far, I can't say whether these failings are due to the way Honeycomb handles rendering or whether they reflect problems with the Xoom's display.\nWhich Tablet Has the Best Keyboard?\nI suspect that the best keyboard for a tablet has yet to be produced. I liked some of what I saw with the HP TouchPad, which includes multiple keyboard sizes and a number row built in to the main keyboard.\nIn the tussle between the iPad 2's keyboard and the Xoom's, however, I give the nod to iOS and the iPad 2. Its keyboard did a better job of keeping up with my touch-typist fingers, whereas the Xoom lagged whenever I input data at full speed. I liked the Xoom's larger button sizes and its inclusion of a Tab key, but the input lag drove me bonkers. The Galaxy Tab's keyboard is unremarkable by comparison: Like an Android keyboard on a giant phone, it's small and cramped in comparison to the bigger tablets' keyboards, and it lacks the speed to keep up with touch-typing.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Data Transfers?\nThe Galaxy Tab (now) and the Xoom (soon) have the edge here. Because they are Android-based tablets, your PC will recognizes them as mass storage devices when they are connected via USB. As a result, you can drag and drop files onto your tablet without converting them to a different format and without using special software. True, the tablet will take a moment to recognize the new images in the library, for example; but this approach is preferable to Apple's locked-down universe, which requires you to use iTunes, the least satisfying, least capable, least flexible file management tool out there today. Both the Galaxy Tab and the Xoom have MicroSD card slots, though you must enable the Xoom's through a software upgrade. The resulting expansion potential is lacking in the iPad 1 and the iPad 2.\nWhich Tablet Provides the Best Notifications?\nOf the models I looked at, notifications were best on Android 3.0 Honeycomb devices. The Honeycomb interface puts its notifications bar at the bottom right, where it unobtrusively informs you of new e-mail messages, new OS or software updates (for example, Pulse reader notifies you when new content is available), and completed downloads. New messages pop up there and then disappear. Tapping on the bar expands the notifications so that you can view them all. The same notifications bar shows time, connection status, and battery life; and you get more details plus one-tap access to settings when you tap to expand the bar.\nApple's iPad feels archaic by comparison. It provides notifications via a pop-up window that interrupts and disrupts your other activities. If you don't touch your device and you receive multiple notifications at once, iOS will collect them into a single window for you to view when you return. But if you get one for AIM (for example), dismiss it, and then get another one for AIM, it will pop up over whatever your current activity is each time, requiring you to take action in order to return to your activity. On the other hand, you get no notifications of new e-mail messages: To get those you must go to your e-mail app.\nThe Galaxy Tab runs Android 2.2, which delivers notifications in the \"classic\" Android style--a pull-down bar at the top of the screen--but they're far less elegant and usable than the notifications in Android 3.0.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Multimedia?\nThe answer depends, in part, on your shopping habits and on how you use your tablet. Android 3.0 on the Xoom is a terrific multimedia combination: HD movies look great in the widescreen aspect ratio, you get Flash support for online video, and Google's redesigned music player is very appealing. On the other hand, Android 3.0 lacks a dedicated video player, so your videos get meshed into the Image Gallery.\nApple's iPad requires iTunes syncing--a drawback considering the albatross that iTunes has become on the whole. But it's fairly good for organizing and keeping track of your media, and if the files are in a supported format, you can add your own videos to the iTunes library. If you have an iPod or iPhone, and you shop at iTunes, the iPad is a no-brainer for its seamless integration with the iTunes Store. At the moment, Google lacks anything comparable, though I can imagine Google deciding to sell music (Google Music is already a reoccurring rumor) and videos through its Market.\nThe Galaxy Tab uses Samsung's Media Hub to make music and video purchases, and to play them back. But Media Hub purchases are usable only with Samsung Media Hub devices, including Samsung mobile phones and televisions. Media Hub's selection is growing, but it's nowhere close to iTunes in depth.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Organizing Your Stuff?\nNo currently available tablet makes managing your files easy. But the Xoom is the best bet right now. You don't get direct access to files and folders on the device, as you do in Microsoft Windows, but plenty of third-party apps will let you access files that are aboard the tablet (and when enabled, aboard the MicroSD card) in a standard folder view. You can download content from the Web browser, like a .zip file. And in the Google image gallery, you can view image info, crop it, and share it via Bluetooth. Meanwhile, organizing apps into home screens is simple, thanks to a split-screen approach that lets you select an app and drag it to your home screen of choice--all on the device.\nOrganizing apps on the iPad is tiresome, and you can forget accessing files stored on the device in order to reorganize, rename them, or do something with them. Apple has locked down the file system.\nThe Galaxy Tab lacks Android 3.0's niceties for organizing apps, but it does offer various options for sharing files. The Galaxy Tab also shows you image information, and it lets you crop an image. An accompanying app called My Files lets you view a file/folder directory of your content; but this simple app is incapable of renaming or moving files.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Web Browsing?\nThe clear advantage in Web browsing goes to the Xoom. The Xoom's tabbed interface makes navigating through a multitude of Web pages remarkably easy. I also liked the visual bookmarks and appreciated the support for Adobe Flash Player 10.2.\nThe iPad 2 and the Galaxy Tab are both stuck in the dark ages of Web browsing. Both tablets permit you to access only one page at a time, so you must exit one page before you browse to another. In addition, both models limit the number of windows you can have open at a time.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Gaming?\nApple's iPad 2 enjoys the clear advantage here. Today, Apple's iOS has a bigger selection and a bigger commitment from content makers than Android does, though more Android 3.0 games should become available as the year progresses. Millions of people use iPads already, and third-party benchmarks indicate that the new A5 chip has more graphics muscle than Nvidia's Tegra 2, which is found in the Xoom and in all announced Honeycomb tablets to date.\nThe Xoom has considerable potential for games, but first more Honeycomb-optimized apps must be developed first. Only then will it be possible to gauge how synthetic benchmark readings of the iPad's graphics capabilities stack up in the real world to its rivals'. As for the Galaxy Tab's prospects for gaming, let's just say that the future of Android gaming won't happen in Android 2.2 on a 7-inch tablet.\nWhich Tablet Is Best for Reading?\nAll of the major booksellers have apps available across mobile operating systems--except for Apple's iBooks, which (as you'd expect) is available only on iOS. All three offer flexibility in your choice of reading platform and shopping site; but in my opinion, none of these tablets is especially good for reading. I recommend instead the only tablet that isn't technically a tablet: Barnes & Noble's NookColor. Though NookColor runs Android 2.1, it lacks Google services and can't freely download or sideload apps. B&N remains the only company that has managed to combine very smooth text with an LCD screen that has very little glare.\nOf the three true tablets, the Galaxy Tab has the edge because of its smaller size and sharper text quality. Apple's iPad 2 comes in second. Its larger screen makes it a good choice for viewing digital magazines or magazine apps, and it's good for viewing larger-print text. In addition, you have plenty of choice with regard to reading apps and bookstores, including Apple's iBooks and competitors such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble (that could change, however, once Apple begins enforcing its crackdown on in-app purchase options). Whichever model you choose, I recommend playing with the font choices in your chosen e-reader app, as some fonts render more smoothly than others.\nDitto for the Xoom: Font rendering could be an issue, as some text fonts look sharper than others. Today, the best reading app available for Xoom is Google Books, but its display options are limited (only three font sizes?) and using it entails committing to buying your books through Google's Market bookstore. Still, you do get a few font choices, and some of them render better than others. Honeycomb-optimized versions of Amazon's Kindle app and B&N's Nook app should arrive soon.\n"}, {"score": 525.5976, "uuid": "dd7e67ac-04f7-5caa-a423-7cf2ecc17027", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0715wb-78-19916", "target_hostname": "www.tompeters.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tompeters.com/dispatches/technology/", "page_rank": 2.2037487e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Technology</em> archive | tompeters!", "snippet": "<em>Or</em> should I say, <em>better</em> yet by far, re-inventing LEARNING &amp; LIVING: &quot;In Blackburn, four-year-olds are making podcasts.", "explanation": null, "document": "But it's also neither of those things.\nIt's actually stunning.\nHeadline, right column, page 1, Wall Street Journal , 27 November 2006: \"Seeking an Edge, Big Investors Turn to Network of Informants.

Years ago, we started to see people walking through airports talking on cellphones with headsets. In order not to seem like wierdos talking to themselves, these folks would routinely hold the headset microphone to their mouths, so you could clearly see that they were on the phone.\nThen people dropped their hands from their headsets, assuming you'd know they were on the phone because of the cord dangling from their ear. After a while, the introduction of the bluetooth headset took away that cord, but by then nobody was self-conscious anymore, and it became commonplace to see people walking through airline terminals talking without shame to an unseen companion.\nBut now, at least for men, social norms have relaxed to a new level. Many times in the past year I've walked into an airport men's room and seen a lone man standing at a bank of urinals, actively engaged in a hands-free conversation with someone hundreds of miles away, presumably with a hidden bluetooth headset in his ear. These people inevitably speak in extra loud voices, as people speaking on cell phones in public often do. So, it's hard not to hear about the latest deal they're trying to close, or the new investment idea they're discussing.\nI guess the call of the greenback makes it difficult to wait two minutes to make the call. After all, cash is king. But, I personally refuse to take part in this latest cultural development.

And while I'm not going to try to review all of the speakers, I might blog occasionally about those I thought were particularly powerful. Also, you can go here to check out what other bloggers are saying about the conference.\nIn a section of the conference called \"Big Fixes\" Cameron Sinclair, a Scottish architect spoke about Architecture for Humanity , a non-profit organization he founded that promotes architecture and design solutions to humanitarian crises around the world. Powerful speaker, and unlike a number of the speakers before him, he had really good slides. But we don't have access to them. One thing I'm going to suggest is that speakers' slides be made available to the audience. (Hey! That's what we do here at tp.com, right?) The current project he spoke about is the Siyathemba Soccer Club project.\nThe challenge is to create the \"perfect pitch,\" a soccer field/outreach center for the youth of Somkhele, South Africa, who are three times more likely to become HIV positive than youth in other parts of the world. The field will be home to the area's first girls' football league.\nTalk about passion.

Years ago, we started to see people walking through airports talking on cellphones with headsets. In order not to seem like wierdos talking to themselves, these folks would routinely hold the headset microphone to their mouths, so you could clearly see that they were on the phone.\nThen people dropped their hands from their headsets, assuming you'd know they were on the phone because of the cord dangling from their ear. After a while, the introduction of the bluetooth headset took away that cord, but by then nobody was self-conscious anymore, and it became commonplace to see people walking through airline terminals talking without shame to an unseen companion.\nBut now, at least for men, social norms have relaxed to a new level. Many times in the past year I've walked into an airport men's room and seen a lone man standing at a bank of urinals, actively engaged in a hands-free conversation with someone hundreds of miles away, presumably with a hidden bluetooth headset in his ear. These people inevitably speak in extra loud voices, as people speaking on cell phones in public often do. So, it's hard not to hear about the latest deal they're trying to close, or the new investment idea they're discussing.\nI guess the call of the greenback makes it difficult to wait two minutes to make the call. After all, cash is king. But, I personally refuse to take part in this latest cultural development. And, I'll hang up on anyone who calls me if I hear the sounds of the airport bathroom in the background.\nSteve Yastrow posted this on 11/23 | Permalink | Comments (29)\nNaivet\u00e9!\nHate to make this post because it betrays both my wholesale ignorance and stupendous innocence.

More specifically, since the release of iOS 5, as that brought us over the air operating system updates.\nWith over the air updates, Apple issues delta patches \u2014 which makes the actual file size far smaller than what we had to deal with previously in iOS. With delta patches, instead of releasing 800MB+ updates, you get a far more palatable couple hundred megabytes on average \u2014 even smaller when the only code that changes is stuff relating to security holes. These updates save so much bandwidth, and this is due in part to the fact that only the code that has changed gets updated \u2014 not the entire thing.\nUnfortunately, these lovely delta patches only apply to the operating system itself, and not Apple\u2019s or even third party apps \u2014 not yet that is. I imagine this must be high up on Apple\u2019s list, perhaps even so for 2012 (one can hope).\nMost of the apps in the App Store that are a pain to update and install are games. As iOS devices like the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch evolve, we are seeing exponentially large increases in graphics processing power. With increased GPU power, developers gravitate towards iOS as a platform because they can leverage the incredibly powerful and complex rendering pipelines and instruction sets. With complex GPUs, developers will make equally complex games. The complexity can already be seen in many games such as: Doom Resurrection, Infinity Blade and now Infinity Blade 2. These kinds of games are packing hugely complex character models, with equally complex backgrounds \u2014 all needing to be rendered in real-time, and smoothly I might add.\nThe aforementioned games are just a few gems, and certainly the majority of games in the App Store are not nearly as complex as these. A natural byproduct of increasingly detailed game worlds means these apps are not getting any smaller \u2014 quite the opposite actually. Some of these games are weighing in at 1GB or larger. This may not seem that large by today\u2019s modern standards, what with traditional desktop Mac games that are in excess of 8GBs conservatively, but in the mobile space, 1GB or more of space dedicated to just a single app is positively massive. Remember, most modern smartphones ship with 16GB of storage space. This actually isn\u2019t a lot of space if you plan on having a decent sized music library \u2014 if you plan on putting music on the device, well then you need to make sure you have ample space for all of your apps.\nIt\u2019s not every day that one has to update apps though. When you do, it\u2019s typically not a big deal, as the majority of ones that you have installed are far smaller than 100MB. The problem starts when you have several apps installed exceeding that file size like Infinity Blade, or any of the Myst games. At present it seems like a minor inconvenience to wait for your app to update \u2014 one would hope you\u2019re doing so over WiFi \u2014 but as we see more and more robust apps of varying categories, people are going to be come less patient.\nWhen you have to update an app, you shouldn\u2019t need to have to re-download the entire 1GB file, only to have it replace what is currently on the device. This is where delta updates come in handy, and this is why allowing third party developers to deliver much smaller code is so crucial to the users sanity.\nPerhaps this problem that we have right now is isolated to mostly games, but that will quickly change. Just look at what traditional publications are doing with magazines. Perhaps some magazines that are available in Newsstand are cobbled together with ungainly PDFs, thus only exacerbating the current problem. What if the market calls for adding richer audio and video content to these publications? Apple needs to fix this sooner rather than later.\nMonday, December 19, 2011 at 11:58 PM\nSunday\n"}], [{"score": 516.5748, "uuid": "db69c887-4464-5f83-9141-b76b39a1873a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-78-10507", "target_hostname": "www.insidehighered.com", "target_uri": "http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/29/search", "page_rank": 1.2544605e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Searching For <em>Better</em> Research Habits | Inside Higher Ed", "snippet": "For the latest <em>technology</em> news from Inside Higher Ed, follow IHEtech on Twitter.", "explanation": null, "document": "Searching For Better Research Habits\nSeptember 29, 2010 - 3:00am\nSteve Kolowich\nNEW YORK CITY -- Should colleges teach students how to be better Googlers?\nEducators who see the popular search engine as antithetical to good research might cringe at the thought of endorsing it to students. But they might not cringe nearly as hard as did attendees of the 2010 Ithaka Sustainable Scholarship Conference when Andrew Asher showed them what happens when students do not learn how to use Google properly.\n\u201cStudents do not have adequate information literacy skills when they come to college, and this goes for even high-achieving students,\u201d said Asher, the lead research anthropologist at the Enthographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries ( ERIAL ) Project, which recently studied the search habits of more than 600 Illinois students spanning a range of institutions and demographic groups.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re not getting adequate training as they\u2019re going through the curriculum,\u201d he said.\nAsher moved swiftly through a few slides featuring excerpts from interviews with students, each eliciting both chuckles and gasps from the audience of librarians and technologists. \u201cI\u2019m just trusting Google to know what are the good resources,\u201d responded one sophomore biology student.\n\u201cOf all the students that I interviewed, not a single one of them could give an adequate conceptual definition of how Google returns results,\u201d said Asher. Not even those \u201cwho should know better,\u201d like computer science students. The word \u201cmagic\u201d came up a lot, he noted.\nAsher pulled quotes from other students evidencing how the expectations and ignorances bred by habitual, unthinking use of Google had affected how students use other search engines, such as those built into the scholarly archive JSTOR. The students in the ERIAL sample seemed oblivious to the logic of search or how to generate or parse search results with much patience or intelligence. \u201cI just throw up whatever I want into the search box and hope it comes up,\u201d a junior nursing major told the researchers. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s just like Google, so I use it like Google.\u201d\nThis Google effect does not bode well for students who manage to make it as far as a scholarly database, said Asher. \u201cStudent overuse of simple search leads to problems of having too much information or not enough information \u2026 both stemming from a lack of sufficient conceptual understanding of how information is organized,\u201d he said. Those libraries that have tried to teach good search principles have failed, he continued, because they have spent \u201ctoo much time trying to teach tools and not enough time trying to teach concepts.\u201d It would be more useful for librarians to focus training sessions on how to \"critically think through how to construct a strategy for finding information about a topic that is unknown to you,\" Asher said in a follow-up e-mail to Inside Higher Ed.\nAsher\u2019s presentation came near the end of a long day that had kicked off with a talk by Daniel M. Russell, a senior research scientist for search quality and user happiness at Google, who also hinted at the need for better user education. Russell spent much of his time talking about all the cool scholarly things Google has available in its vast databases -- a facsimile of Stravinsky\u2019s score from Sacre de Printemps, a 3-D model of the Notre Dame Cathedral, unemployment data for Santa Clara County over the last 20 years -- before lamenting the fact that most students would have no clue how to find them.\n\u201cOne of the things we have to do is not teach the little twiddlybits about search,\u201d said Russell. Technical knowledge of Google\u2019s search interface -- and JSTOR\u2019s, for that matter -- becomes obsolete, because the interfaces are constantly changing. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to teach them algorithms, I don\u2019t want to teach them ranking, I don\u2019t want to teach them what\u2019s in the index and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to teach them what\u2019s possible.\u201d In other words: If students do not know what is out there to find, they cannot search for it effectively.\nThat is where librarians come in, said Russell. Scholarly searching is not an intuitive skill, like foraging, he said; students cannot learn well by imitating peers. \u201cWe need to do a better job,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked with these undergraduates. This is, in theory, the Google generation. But a lot of searchers in libraries and universities do the dumbest things you can possibly imagine. And so have you. It\u2019s not part of the curriculum.\u201d\nBut as the conference wound down and the participants reflected on the question of search education, some challenged the idea that search education was possible -- or worth the investment.\nPeggy Seiden, the college librarian at Swarthmore College, recalled a comment an economics professor there had made during a recent focus group: \u201cOur students graduate from Swarthmore, and they go on to be incredibly successful,\u201d Seiden quoted her colleague as saying. \u201cThey may not have had very much in terms of good research instruction. They might not be the best researchers in the world. But they are successful. So the question is, what is the end we\u2019re trying to get to?\u201d\nLisa Rose-Wiles, a science librarian at Seton Hall University, said it is na\u00efve to think that by teaching students how to use search more responsibly, librarians and professors can prevent students from cutting corners. Of course librarians think cobbling together a good-enough paper with the first three full-text papers that turn up in a simple search is bad, but for students \u2014 particularly those aspiring to nonacademic careers \u2014 it might make perfect sense. \u201cThere\u2019s no real way to convince students that that behavior doesn\u2019t pay, especially when they\u2019re trying to juggle six courses and a job and a whole life and all the rest,\u201d Rose-Wiles said. \"So unless we can demonstrate some measurable payoff to searching, students aren\u2019t going to do it.\u201d\nLuke Swindler, coordinator of general collections for the university library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the notion of making \u201cbetter searchers\u201d of Google-generation students reminded him of what a German pol had once said of communism: \u201cThe problem with the theory and practice of communism,\u201d Swindler paraphrased, \u201cis that it just needs better citizens.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change the citizens,\u201d he said.\nIf academics are going to improve student research in the age of simple search, said Casper Grathwohl, vice president at Oxford University Press, they will probably have to do so the same way Google changes the behavior of its users: by using better interfaces and more sophisticated indexing methods to nudge them, incrementally, toward competence.\nAs Grathwohl put it, \u201cMaking \u2018good enough\u2019 better.\u201d\nFor the latest technology news from Inside Higher Ed, follow IHEtech on Twitter .\n"}, {"score": 516.35236, "uuid": "f0e017f7-f379-58a8-9928-b7d48ebe2925", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1313wb-15-17335", "target_hostname": "www.swayaminfotech.com", "target_uri": "http://www.swayaminfotech.com/blog/2011/10/iphone-vs-android-showdown-which-phone-is-best-for-power-users/", "page_rank": 1.2088308e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Android Showdown: <em>Which</em> Phone Is Best for Power Users?", "snippet": "For <em>better</em> <em>or</em> worse (usually worse), these qualities often end up at odds with one another in the current smartphone market, but they make up the measuring stick against <em>which</em> we\u2019re evaluating these devices.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted under Android Development , iPhone iOS iPad iAd iPod iTouch on Thursday, 13 October, 2011 by jayesh\nThe newest iPhone comes out in two weeks; the Android OS continues to deploy on better and better hardware; and both operating systems roll out exciting new features and innovations with each release. So which deserves your hard-earned cash?\nA Starting Point\nYou can evaluate iPhone and Android devices from countless angles,[1] so rather than pretend that we\u2019ve got the One True Comparison, it only seems appropriate to highlight that we\u2019re not necessarily your average user. For more specifics on how we judge these devices, read this footnote.\nFor our purposes, we\u2019re measuring each phone OS against 20 features we care about most, declaring a winner (or a tie) for each category, and adding it all up. The extent to which our measurements match up with what you most care about may vary, but we suspect that many of you share similar values when it comes to your smartphone.\nNote: The table below indicates the device we think \u201cwins\u201d each category. A happy Android means we think Android is better in that category; an Apple means iPhone outperforms Android; categories with both an Android and Apple are ties.\nEase of Use; Winner: iPhone\nAndroid has come a long way in a short time, but from an ease-of-use perspective, the iPhone wins out. You can pick up any iPhone and quickly, easily understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s got one main button on the front of the device, and everything you do consists of tapping app icons from the home screen. Android devices have several buttons on the front of the device that perform a variety of functions, and once you unlock the screen (and depending on which Android device you have), you\u2019re confronted with many different possible home screens and ways of doing things from those home screens.\nOpenness; Winner: Android\nWe really like that the Android operating system is open source, but what\u2019s more important to most end users is openness in terms of what you can run on these devices. The operating systems themselves are clearly important, but one thing\u2019s abundantly clear: the applications make the phone. And while Google has yet to get in hot water for rejecting apps based on anti-competitive fear or censorship, Apple has. A lot.\nBattery Life; Winner: iPhone\nApple has taken battery life extremely seriously in their careful development of the iPhone, and it\u2019s shown. While Android devices get a kitchen-sink\u2019s worth of features that you may consider to be a fair tradeoff for battery life, there\u2019s little question that the iPhone\u2019s battery life outlasts that of most Android devices. Battery performance definitely varies from Android handset to Android handset (the recently released EVO is taking big hits for its poor battery performance), but the iPhone\u2019s battery performance\u2014particularly the new iPhone\u2019s performance\u2014generally outlasts Android\u2019s.\nMultitasking; Tie\nIt\u2019s a big deal that the iPhone is finally getting some multitasking support in iOS4, and while it\u2019s still not as true of multitasking as Android users enjoy, the tradeoff in terms off battery life improvements is important enough that, overall, we\u2019d consider multitasking to be a wash.\nSoftware Keyboard; Winner: iPhone\nIf you talk to anyone who\u2019s used both the iPhone and Android with some frequency, the general consensus is that the iPhone\u2019s software keyboard is a good deal better than Android\u2019s default keyboard. That\u2019s unfortunate for Android users, but the consolation is that you can install any custom keyboard as your default keyboard on Android, and we\u2019ve seen some solid keyboard alternatives. Still, the advantage, if only by virtue of being better out of the box, goes to the iPhone.\nSystem-Wide Search; Tie\nApple\u2019s implementation of Spotlight on the iPhone searches contacts, media, email, applications, notes, and calendar. Android searches most of that (but notably not email), but also integrates with auto-suggest web searches; it also lets other applications plug into it, so the more supported apps you install, the more robust the universal search becomes.\nNotification system; Winner: Android\nThis may seem like a silly thing to care too much about, but the iPhone\u2019s modal notification system is particularly user un-friendly, especially for a device as friendly as the iPhone. You have to act on a notification, and you can only see one notification at a time before the next one dismisses the previous one entirely. Android\u2019s brilliant pull-down window shade notification tray, on the other hand, is a beautiful thing that could make any iPhone owner jealous.\nVoice-to-Text; Winner: Android\nNearly every text field on an Android device can be filled with a few words from your mouth, and it works surprisingly well. You can respond to emails by voice, send long text messages by voice while you\u2019re walking around Target, respond to your editor\u2019s IMs while you\u2019re at a graduation ceremony, and so on, as long as you\u2019re comfortable talking to your phone (it is a phone, so you should be). Apart from voice-to-text in third party apps, iOS doesn\u2019t support voice-to-text at all.\nSyncing; Winner: Android\niPhones can be incredible standalone devices, but they\u2019re surprisingly old-fashioned when it comes to syncing, requiring users to plug into their computers and connect to iTunes to do all sorts of syncing and activating that could be more conveniently done wirelessly. Android phones support pretty great over-the-air syncing with your Google account, so much so that if you were to lose your previous Android phone, simply entering your Google account into a new one can get you up and running with a usable phone in a jiffy.\nNon-Google Sync; Winner: iPhone\nAndroid\u2019s great at syncing seamlessly with Google\u2019s servers, but it\u2019s not so keen on syncing with other popular sources of data\u2014like, say, Outlook, Address Book, or iTunes. If you\u2019re a heavy user of any of those applications, the iPhone is the easiest option.\nTethering; Winner: Android\nThe cost of tethering on Android devices varies depending on the provider, but so far the Android tethering situation is better off than what AT&T is offering on the iPhone. In the States, AT&T will charge you $20/month just for the privilege of tethering your iPhone\u2019s data connection to a computer\u2014despite the fact that you\u2019re already paying for a metered data plan. The situation isn\u2019t necessarily much better across the Android-sphere (Sprint is also planning to charge for tethering on the EVO, for example), but currently most Android carriers are sticking with \u201cunlimited\u201d plans, versus AT&T/iPhone\u2019s 2GB limit. It\u2019s still a close race on this point, but Android edges ahead with the ability to turn your handset into a Wi-Fi hotspot that can deliver wireless to you and seven of your closest friends.\nRelease and Update Consistency; Winner: iPhone\nThese days, your mobile OS is just as important (if not more) than mobile hardware, and Apple has set the consumer expectation to expect that their device will receive new feature updates even if it isn\u2019t the latest phone. To that end, it\u2019s extremely easy to keep track of what\u2019s going on in the iPhone ecosystem. Apple releases one new phone a year, and one major update each year. When an update rolls out, every phone receives the update at the same time (unless it\u2019s particularly old; the original iPhone won\u2019t upgrade to iOS4, for example). In contrast, Android runs on a lot of different devices, and when Google pushes out a new update, there\u2019s no telling when or if it\u2019s going to make its way to your phone. In the future Google is planning to change to yearly Android updates similar to iPhone OS updates, which will likely help this situation, but in the meantime, it\u2019s a source of frustration for Android users.\nApps; Tie\nA lot of people may disagree on this assessment, given that Apple\u2019s App Store has around four times the number of applications the Android Market does, but there\u2019s also a lot of crap in the App Store, and at this point, most popular, mission-critical applications have been developed for both the iPhone and Android. What\u2019s more, some potentially very popular applications end up locked out of the App Store for, if we\u2019re being generous, arbitrary reasons. At the end of the day, it may be a big deal that your must-have application X is missing from the Android Market/App Store, and those may end up to be dealbreakers for you, but overall we\u2019d call them pretty even.\nWeb browsing; Tie\nThe iPhone\u2019s Mobile Safari browser, while not without its faults, is a very nice, very usable mobile browser. Android\u2019s browser, while not as smooth an operator as Safari, supports (or can support) Flash. The extent to which that matters to you may vary, but it\u2019s big enough that we\u2019re considering it a tie.\nGaming; Winner: iPhone\nWe\u2019re frugal productivity nerds at Lifehacker, so we don\u2019t really care all that much about gaming. And while the number of solid gaming options available in the Android Market continue to grow, it\u2019s still not on par with what\u2019s available for the iPhone.\nMusic Player; Winner: iPhone\nAndroid may do a lot of things well, but one arena where its users regularly voice complaint is with its default media player. Where the iPhone comes with a very solid iPod app, most Android users quickly go looking for alternative players. Google is hyping over-the-internet streaming of all your music from your desktop computer eventually, but until we see something great there, the iPhone still wins out.\nFree Turn-by-Turn Navigation; Winner: Android\nAfter the Google Voice debacle from last year, it\u2019s looking less and less likely that Google will ever develop another new app for the iPhone. Unfortunately, that means that extremely cool applications like Google Maps Navigation, Google\u2019s free turn-by-turn GPS application, will never make it to the iPhone, and so far there isn\u2019t anything as good for the iPhone that\u2019s also free. The iPhone does have its share of solid for-a-price GPS utilities in the App Store (and some decent inexpensive-to-free options), but Maps Navigation is built into Android and outshines the iPhone\u2019s free alternatives.\nIntegration with Google Apps; Winner: Android\nIf you rely on Google tools like Gmail, Google Contacts, Google Calendar, and the like, Android just does it better. The iPhone\u2019s still no slouch, and can sync over-the-air with Contacts, Calendar, and even does Gmail push for instant new message notifications, but if you\u2019re a serious Google or even just Gmail user, the iPhone doesn\u2019t stack up to Android.\nGoogle Voice; Winner: Android\nIt may seem absurd to make this a separate point of comparison from Google Apps, but Voice is a very phone-centric app with potentially huge influence over how you use your phone. Apple had the option to approve a Google Voice app for the iPhone and completely blew it. And since we really love Google Voice, it only makes Android look that much more attractive.\nCustomizable; Winner: Android\nYou may be able to add a wallpaper to your iPhone desktop when iOS4 rolls out, but beyond that, there\u2019s not much you can do to tweak your iPhone to exactly how you like it\u2014without jailbreaking, that is. In comparison, Android devices are Mr. Potato Heads of customizability.\nOverall Score: Android: 13; iPhone: 11\nClearly our scorecard is extremely subjective, so take this evaluation with a grain of salt, and consider how important the features we listed (and maybe those we didn\u2019t list) are to you and come up with your own assessment. If your priorities are similar to ours, you\u2019re likely looking at an Android for your next purchase. Frankly, it feels a little like a draw overall. (My ideal would be Android running on the iPhone 4, which is actually possible, eventually.)\nIn fact, in our recent poll on the subject, 66 percent of Lifehacker readers said they prefer Android; 30 percent prefer the iPhone, and 4 percent preferred neither. Whichever end of the spectrum you fall on, we\u2019d love to hear more about what\u2019s driving your decision in the comments.\nWhy just Android and iPhone? The iPhone and Android operating systems are not the only mobile OSes on the block, but they\u2019re what we\u2019re focusing on in this post. It\u2019s cool if you\u2019re really into Windows Mobile/Phone 7 or webOS. For the purpose of this post, we\u2019re focusing on what we consider to be the most popular options among our readers.\nHow we judge: We consider ourselves power users who care about things like openness, user control, and customizability; we also care about ease of use, high quality design, and quality hardware. For better or worse (usually worse), these qualities often end up at odds with one another in the current smartphone market, but they make up the measuring stick against which we\u2019re evaluating these devices.\nIt\u2019s also probably worth noting that, Android OS and hardware aside, we\u2019re big fans of several of Google\u2019s services, and so some of those play an important role in some of the categories above. It may not seem fair to Apple and the iPhone to do so, but in most instances (like Google Voice), Apple had the opportunity to accept Google-focused applications to the App Store.\nFinally, the state of Android devices can be somewhat confusing because they\u2019re released by different carriers and on lots of different hardware. We tried to strike a balance between acknowledging faults on some of the worst incarnations of Android hardware while also keeping in mind the best. To the extent that older iPhones aren\u2019t up to snuff compared to the new iPhone, we\u2019ve done the same thing in discussing the iPhone.\n"}, {"score": 516.24554, "uuid": "211dadbc-e0fd-5fe9-9848-22ab77925fa2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900tw-62-00466", "target_hostname": "www.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/25/google-drive-dropbox-cloud-computing?CMP=twt_gu", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Google Drive goes up against Dropbox | <em>Technology</em> | guardian.co.uk", "snippet": "<em>or</em> other changes we make so that your content works <em>better</em> with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly <em>perform</em>, publicly display and distribute such content.", "explanation": null, "document": "Google Drive goes up against Dropbox\nCloud computing service launched that stores documents, photos, videos and other digital content on Google's servers\nComments (\u2026)\nGoogle Drive stores personal documents, photos, videos and a wide range of other digital content on Google's computers Photograph: Martin Keene/PA\nGoogle is hoping to build the world's largest digital filing cabinet in the latest attempt to deepen people's dependence on its services.\nThe internet search leader began its pursuit of the audacious goal with the much-anticipated debut of Google Drive, a product that stores personal documents, photos, videos and a wide range of other digital content on Google's computers.\nBy keeping files in massive data centres, users will be able to call up the information on their smartphones , tablet computers , laptops and just about any other internet-connected device.

More specifically, since the release of iOS 5, as that brought us over the air operating system updates.\nWith over the air updates, Apple issues delta patches \u2014 which makes the actual file size far smaller than what we had to deal with previously in iOS. With delta patches, instead of releasing 800MB+ updates, you get a far more palatable couple hundred megabytes on average \u2014 even smaller when the only code that changes is stuff relating to security holes. These updates save so much bandwidth, and this is due in part to the fact that only the code that has changed gets updated \u2014 not the entire thing.\nUnfortunately, these lovely delta patches only apply to the operating system itself, and not Apple\u2019s or even third party apps \u2014 not yet that is. I imagine this must be high up on Apple\u2019s list, perhaps even so for 2012 (one can hope).\nMost of the apps in the App Store that are a pain to update and install are games. As iOS devices like the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch evolve, we are seeing exponentially large increases in graphics processing power. With increased GPU power, developers gravitate towards iOS as a platform because they can leverage the incredibly powerful and complex rendering pipelines and instruction sets. With complex GPUs, developers will make equally complex games. The complexity can already be seen in many games such as: Doom Resurrection, Infinity Blade and now Infinity Blade 2. These kinds of games are packing hugely complex character models, with equally complex backgrounds \u2014 all needing to be rendered in real-time, and smoothly I might add.\nThe aforementioned games are just a few gems, and certainly the majority of games in the App Store are not nearly as complex as these. A natural byproduct of increasingly detailed game worlds means these apps are not getting any smaller \u2014 quite the opposite actually. Some of these games are weighing in at 1GB or larger. This may not seem that large by today\u2019s modern standards, what with traditional desktop Mac games that are in excess of 8GBs conservatively, but in the mobile space, 1GB or more of space dedicated to just a single app is positively massive. Remember, most modern smartphones ship with 16GB of storage space. This actually isn\u2019t a lot of space if you plan on having a decent sized music library \u2014 if you plan on putting music on the device, well then you need to make sure you have ample space for all of your apps.\nIt\u2019s not every day that one has to update apps though. When you do, it\u2019s typically not a big deal, as the majority of ones that you have installed are far smaller than 100MB. The problem starts when you have several apps installed exceeding that file size like Infinity Blade, or any of the Myst games. At present it seems like a minor inconvenience to wait for your app to update \u2014 one would hope you\u2019re doing so over WiFi \u2014 but as we see more and more robust apps of varying categories, people are going to be come less patient.\nWhen you have to update an app, you shouldn\u2019t need to have to re-download the entire 1GB file, only to have it replace what is currently on the device. This is where delta updates come in handy, and this is why allowing third party developers to deliver much smaller code is so crucial to the users sanity.\nPerhaps this problem that we have right now is isolated to mostly games, but that will quickly change. Just look at what traditional publications are doing with magazines. Perhaps some magazines that are available in Newsstand are cobbled together with ungainly PDFs, thus only exacerbating the current problem. What if the market calls for adding richer audio and video content to these publications? Apple needs to fix this sooner rather than later.\nMonday, December 19, 2011 at 11:58 PM\nSunday\n"}, {"score": 516.01404, "uuid": "02c090f2-3566-53f2-b9c9-257e281dc26c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1716wb-55-18288", "target_hostname": "zerodistraction.com", "target_uri": "http://zerodistraction.com/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=8175693&registeredAuthorId=1162795&currentPage=6", "page_rank": 1.1885042e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Zero Distraction - Intersecting Culture and <em>Technology</em>", "snippet": "It\u2019s plain as day that <em>Google\u2019s</em> mobile devision has a huge stake in this <em>technology</em>, and probably will for the foreseeable future.

No, I\u2019m not talking about Marvel and DC\u2019s ongoing struggle with transitioning to digital. Growing up through the 80s, I became a lover and loyal fan of comics. I never took part in the flame wars many of my friends loved to engage in \u2014 that being the inevitable argument of who\u2019s better, Marvel or DC? There is no good answer, and there never was in my opinion (I still believe this). You just happen to like characters who you happen to like you know? For me, I tended to read DC more, but that was not because I happened to believe their publication was superior in any way \u2014 no, it was mainly that I preferred some of DC\u2019s characters. Still, I frequently purchased many different titles from both of these two giants during the 80s, and even 90s.\nSo what about the 2000s? Well, during the early 2000s, my comic book reading increasingly slowed, as I became busy with things. Or so I thought! Surely, one could scrap together a few hours a week to head to their local comic book shop and pick up some of their favourite titles, eager to get home as fast as possible to start reading. Well here\u2019s the problem: I slowly started to remember what annoyed me about the comic book industry when I first started reading them as a kid. Titles, there\u2019s just too damn many of them! This I believe is a huge problem for many people, and not just to readers who are new to comics, although they are particularly affected by this. The glut of unnecessary titles needs to stop.\nI felt that I could scrutinize DC\u2019s current new52 lineup under a very particular lens \u2014 that of Apple computer. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, he knew right away how he would save the company, who at the time was on the brink of bankruptcy. There\u2019s a particular story of how Steve Jobs entered a board room and immediately started drawing on the white board what he though should be Apple\u2019s ideal product lineup (at the time they ventured into printers and other non-typical Apple products. What Steve drew that day was a drastically minimalistic lineup of products. Everyone knows Steve loved minimalistic design, which of course he took to great painstaking lengths \u2014 much to the indignation of some of his engineers. Anyone who knows Apple and Steve knows that he didn\u2019t like to be minimal for the sake of being minimal. There was always a purpose, and he knew very well that doing simple was in many ways harder than doing complex. So what does Apple have to do with the comic book industry? Well, as someone who is now getting back into comics again, I have to tell you, the glut of titles is dizzying!

No, I\u2019m not talking about Marvel and DC\u2019s ongoing struggle with transitioning to digital. Growing up through the 80s, I became a lover and loyal fan of comics. I never took part in the flame wars many of my friends loved to engage in \u2014 that being the inevitable argument of who\u2019s better, Marvel or DC? There is no good answer, and there never was in my opinion (I still believe this). You just happen to like characters who you happen to like you know? For me, I tended to read DC more, but that was not because I happened to believe their publication was superior in any way \u2014 no, it was mainly that I preferred some of DC\u2019s characters. Still, I frequently purchased many different titles from both of these two giants during the 80s, and even 90s.\nSo what about the 2000s? Well, during the early 2000s, my comic book reading increasingly slowed, as I became busy with things. Or so I thought! Surely, one could scrap together a few hours a week to head to their local comic book shop and pick up some of their favourite titles, eager to get home as fast as possible to start reading. Well here\u2019s the problem: I slowly started to remember what annoyed me about the comic book industry when I first started reading them as a kid. Titles, there\u2019s just too damn many of them! This I believe is a huge problem for many people, and not just to readers who are new to comics, although they are particularly affected by this. The glut of unnecessary titles needs to stop.\nI felt that I could scrutinize DC\u2019s current new52 lineup under a very particular lens \u2014 that of Apple computer. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, he knew right away how he would save the company, who at the time was on the brink of bankruptcy. There\u2019s a particular story of how Steve Jobs entered a board room and immediately started drawing on the white board what he though should be Apple\u2019s ideal product lineup (at the time they ventured into printers and other non-typical Apple products. What Steve drew that day was a drastically minimalistic lineup of products. Everyone knows Steve loved minimalistic design, which of course he took to great painstaking lengths \u2014 much to the indignation of some of his engineers. Anyone who knows Apple and Steve knows that he didn\u2019t like to be minimal for the sake of being minimal. There was always a purpose, and he knew very well that doing simple was in many ways harder than doing complex. So what does Apple have to do with the comic book industry?

Depends who you ask.\nBy John K. Waters\n06/01/10\nFew computing devices have sparked the burning gizmo lust ignited by the iPad. Apple\u2019s latest entry into the tablet PC market didn\u2019t generate much heat when it was first unveiled in January, but by April 3, the day of the official release, feverish customers were mobbing Apple stores. The company claims to have sold 300,000 iPads by midnight on that first day, and that more than a million apps and 250,000 e-books were downloaded to those devices. Apple says it delivered more than 500,000 iPads before the end of the first week. Demand in the US has been so great that the company postponed its European launch.\nMixed in with this nationwide hot-tech-toy fervor is the cooler consideration of the iPad as an educational tool. This device and the competing PCs set to follow it into the marketplace represent a new student-computing platform that K-12 school districts have already begun to explore in pilot programs.\nIt\u2019s still early, but as educators begin weighing the pros and cons of the iPad, predictions that the device would make a three-way race out of what had been a head-to-head competition between netbooks and laptops for the increasingly discriminating wallets of K-12 are proving to be premature. It\u2019s beginning to seem that schools are more likely to be determining how this touchable form factor complements, instead of displaces, other keyboard-bound devices in their overall student-computing strategy.\nFilling a Niche\nThe tablet computer isn\u2019t really new, of course. Bill Gates introduced Microsoft\u2019s Windows Tablet PC Edition software at the annual Comdex technology trade show in Las Vegas nine years ago. Most of the leading laptop manufacturers have been offering devices designed to allow users to write on a screen with a stylus for years.\nGates predicted that the tablet wouldbecome the most popular PC type within five years of his Vegas announcement.But the tablet devices developed in the ensuing years, with their rotatable, evenremovable touchscreens, were expensive and never managed to fulfill Gates\u2019 expectation. Few have found much success beyond niche markets.\nBut Apple got so many things right with the iPad that the device effectively redefines the category. It\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s the first of a new generation, though it certainly won\u2019t be the last. Next-gen competitors have already been released, and more are coming (see \u201cTop 5 iPad Challengers,\u201d page 44).\nTale of the Tape: How do the iPad, netbook, and laptop measure up?\nTale of the Tape: How do the iPad, netbook, and laptop measure up? Click here to see a comparison .\nMore importantly, unlike its predecessors, the iPad was born into a thriving software ecosystem, established largely by its smaller touchscreen siblings: the iPod Touch and the iPhone. About 1,000 new iPad-specific apps were available in the App Store on the day of the device\u2019s launch, and software developers have been rushing to add more ever since. It\u2019s the volume and vibrancy of these tools that is pulling in K-12 users.\n\u201cThe apps that are coming out for the iPad are so innovative and different from what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Julie Bohnenkamp, director of technology for Center Grove Community School Corporation in Greenwood, IN, which is launching an iPad pilot program this year. \u201cAnd they\u2019re so easily accessible once they\u2019re downloaded. They\u2019re just there for the students.\u201d\nCenter Grove, a district that serves more than 7,500 students in one high school, one middle school, and six elementary schools, is starting with 15 iPads this summer in a pilot program with English as a New Language (ENL) students. The plan is to launch a larger program in the fall.\n\u201cThat group of students provides a small target audience,\u201d Bohnenkamp says, \u201cwhich allows us to analyze effectiveness and develop best practices. And it\u2019s also the perfect tool for that particular group, because we can easily customize the iPad to the different languages our students come to us with. And we can enable accessibility features that turn text to speech.\u201d\nCenter Grove is starting out with free downloadable applications such as Tao TranslateIt, originally created for the iPhone but adapted to the iPad. It provides one-click translations of text from one language to another. Another free appBohnenkamp favors is Notes \u2019n\u2019 More, which allows students (and teachers) to use their iPads to generate to-do lists, notes, voice memos, pictures, and videos, and then collect the disparate file types into folders.\nBut as fond as she is of the iPad, Bohnenkamp, who also works with a netbook and a laptop, recognizes its limitations and doesn\u2019t expect it to drive full-featured computers from the schools, but rather to augment them.\n\u201cThe iPad is a wonderful device, but it can\u2019t do everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll pick the iPad every time for portability, research, and small projects. But when I want to work on a large project, I\u2019ll choose a laptop over the iPad, at least in its current configuration. Students are going to need access to both.\u201d\nLikewise, Ted Brodheim, CIO of the New York City Department of Education, sees iPads and other tablet PCs sharing the computing load in his schools, not taking it all on. \u201cNetbooks and laptops continue to have a role in our environment,\u201d Brodheim says. \u201cThe release of the iPad fills a gap rather than replaces particular classes of devices.\u201d\nNew York City provides its students with a range of devices, depending on the need. \u201cRather than outfit every student with a device that can be used for every possible situation,\u201d Brodheim explains, \u201cwe provide a variety of devices that can be chosen for a specific purpose.\u201d\nContent creation, for example, is done on higher-end desktops and laptops; collaboration and research are performed on midrange desktops and laptops; browsing and editing are jobs for netbooks; and consuming media and providing \u201csimple responses\u201d call for interactive whiteboards and tablets. Brodheim sees the iPad fitting primarily into that latter niche as a content consumer.\n\u201cThese types of devices provide a very cost-effective way to deliver digital content and tap interactive software and websites,\u201d Brodheim says, \u201cwhich engages studentsin learning.\u201d\nThat\u2019s precisely the vision Lisa Hogan, technology integrator for Maine SchoolAdministrative District 75 in Topsham, ME, has of the iPad\u2019s role in K-12. She views it as \u201ca fabulous consumer tool, versus a creation/production tool.\n\u201cCurrently one of our elementary schools is building web pages of book reviews,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cThese student reviews\u2014film, text, animation\u2014are intended to get kids excited about reading and sharing books. The kids are using Macbooks to produce the reviews, but the librarian is thinking of ordering two iPads for students to use to watch the online book reviews or to read online books. I can envision three or four kids with an iPad in the corner of the library, watching student-created book reviews and then heading off to the shelves to find the books.\u201d\nWindows vs. Mac\nDistrict 75\u2019s elementary school teachers and secondary students all use Macbooks, which makes iPads a more natural, even automatic fit. But in Windows environments like the School District of the Chathams in New Jersey, they\u2019re a tougher sell.\n\u201cFor schools and districts already on the Mac platform, it\u2019s a much easier decision to go with an iPad,\u201d says John Abdelmalak, the Chathams\u2019 director of technology. \u201cBut I have to say that for districts running Windows, that\u2019s probably not the case.\u201d\nThe Chathams serves 3,700 students in three lower (K-3) elementary schools, one upper (4-5) elementary school, one middle school, and one high school. In January, the district equipped two classrooms in its upper elementary school with six Dell Latitude 2100 educational netbooks apiece, and has since been approved to populate all of its K-3 classrooms with an additional 354 of the Dells in the fall.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t interested in the iPad, because we wanted devices that would allow us to leverage our existing software, which is Windows-based,\u201d Abdelmalak says. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot of money in the Windows platform, and we wanted devices that would run the software we\u2019ve already paid for.\u201d\nAbdelmalak says that the netbooks have been a big hit in his district, and even a Windows-based tablet PC probably won\u2019t impact his district\u2019s netbook initiative.\n\u201cThe feedback on the netbooks has been amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe students and teachers love them. Now all the other teachers want them. The devices have touchscreens, which the students love, so they\u2019re getting some of that tablet functionality. We have Smart Boards in nearly all of our rooms, and we have the Smart Board software on their netbooks. They use the touchscreen and have their own little Smart Boards. This will be hard to beat.\u201d\nHard, but not impossible, he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for better solutions. If a really great Windows-based tablet comes on the market, we\u2019ll look at it, for sure. But for now, our netbook strategy is really working for us.\u201d\nThe Dell Latitude 2100s have made a convert out of Shawn Nutting, director of technology and buildings and facilities at Trussville City Schools in Trussville, AL, who admits to growing up in a Mac-only household. Nutting is delighted with the netbooks.\nTop 5 iPad Challengers\nJulie Bohnenkamp, director of technology for Center Grove Community School Corporation in Greenwood, IN, which will pilot an iPad program this summer, concedes that tablet PCs running other operating systems could perform as well as an iPad, but she doubts that the new devices will be able to match the app ecosystem the iPad was born into. Until that happens she\u2019ll stay on the Apple side of the fence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the hardware, which is gorgeous,\u201d Bohnenkamp says. \u201cIt\u2019s all these apps that are coming with all this interactivity and resources. Will the libraries of apps for these other devices be as extensive? They would have to be to make a change worthwhile.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll know soon, as manufacturers of competing tablets are gunning for the iPad. Here are five of the most formidable challengers.\nFusion Garage Joojoo (thejoojoo.com): Formerly known as the CrunchPad, the device runs the Ubuntu Linux operating system and features a 12.1-inch multitouch display. It comes with a built-in still/video camera and support for Adobe Flash and Java apps, and includes both WiFi and Bluetooth. The apps are all web-based, so you have to be online to run them. Priced at $499 for 4-GB models. Began shipping in late March.\nHP Slate/Hurricane (hp.com): HP generated a lot of prerelease buzz with its Windows 7-based Slate. The company debuted the device in March with few details, but after the arrival of the iPad, HP seemed to back away from it. Then, in late April, HP acquired Palm, and talk was that the company would develop a new tablet based on WebOS, the operating system behind Palm\u2019s line of smartphones. Reportedly dubbed \u201cHurricane,\u201d the device could hit the market as soon as the third quarter of this year, but HP isn\u2019t saying.\nDell Mini 5 (dell.com): Dell is tight-lipped about the due date (expect June), but word is that the Mini 5 will run on Google\u2019s Android operating system and come with multitouch displays and the ability to make phone calls (3G). Code-named \u201cStreak,\u201d it reportedly will be offered in 7- and 10-inch models. A built-in camera is also expected, as are voice-recognition software, WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, and some Amazon book, video, and music software. No pricing has been announced.\nLenovo IdeaPad U1 (lenovo.com): A hybrid notebook billed as two devices in one. It looks like a standard notebook computer, but the multitouch screen detaches from the keyboard to become a 3G tablet. In notebook mode the U1 runs Windows 7; as a tablet it runs its own Skylight Linux. It comes with an 11.6-inch display, WiFi, a webcam, and a media card reader, and weighs in at 3.8 pounds with the screen and keyboard attached, 1.6 pounds as a tablet. The unofficial but often-cited price is $999. Expect a summer release.\nMicrosoft Courier (microsoft.com): Microsoft\u2019s long-promised tablet is now set for an early 2011 release. It is expected to come with a folding dual screen that\u2019s pen- and touch-controlled and will probably run the same operating system that powers Microsoft\u2019s Zune HD media player and Windows Phone 7 Series. Handwriting-recognition software will be included. No pricing at this time.\n\u201cNine-hour battery life!\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting to something that\u2019s viable for classroom use, because you don\u2019t have to keep recharging it.\u201d\nTrussville has no plans to make iPads part of the district\u2019s official inventory of supported machines, but Nutting acknowledges that several teachers and a few students are using them. \u201cThe iPad is just now showing up at our schools,\u201d he says, \u201cand we allow students and teachers to have them. But Apple does not play well with our network management and security software.\u201d\nNutting does see tablets having a rolein schools, but not for text-intensive projects. \u201cI see plenty of applications and value for schools in the iPad,\u201d he says, \u201cbut would I want to sit down and write my thousand-word English paper on one? I think I\u2019d scream. Of course, I\u2019m not a digital native who can text at 80 words a minute, so who knows.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t so enthralled by the price, either. Nutting says iPads are just too expensive for many budget-strapped K-12 districts. Currently, the basic iPad with no WiFi and only 16 GB of storage retails for $499; the Dell Latitude 2100 netbooks for the education market are available for as little as $329.\nPlus, Nutting points out that the App Store model isn\u2019t as transformative as some are saying. \u201cThe apps from the App Store are very cool,\u201d he says, \u201cand there are thousands of them. But a Windows-based netbook can run millions of applications.\u201d\nThat earns a shrug from Bohnenkamp, who argues that students don\u2019t need millions of apps. But they do need an engaging computing environment, and if there\u2019s one distinguishing feature that could give schools a reason to choose iPads over netbooks, it\u2019s that the device, with its gleaming touchscreen, is a wonder to look at and use. That blessed wow factor, the thought goes, could turn students on to doing their schoolwork.\n\u201cThe iPad vs. netbook debate is still going on in my head,\u201d Bohnenkamp says. \u201cI\u2019m still weighing the pros and cons. And it\u2019s true that the netbooks can look just as good or better on paper, but the [iPad\u2019s] computing experience is different. It\u2019s better. And I think it might make a difference in student engagement. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\niPad vs. Netbooks\nApple CEO Steve Jobs probably deserves most of the credit for firing up the iPad vs. netbook debate. During the iPad launch event in January, he let go with this broadside: \u201cNetbooks aren\u2019t better than anything. They\u2019re just cheap laptops.\u201d\nIs that so?\nThe iPad isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first tablet. Remember the ill-fated, pen-computing-based Newton MessagePad? It was introduced in August 1993 and discontinued only seven months later.\nTheir attractive prices notwithstanding, netbooks do represent a compromise that has drawn some criticism. The keyboards are cramped, the screens are small, and their performance lags. On the other hand, they tend to have great battery life and weigh just a couple of pounds.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a big netbook proponent in the past, but the iPad has changed some of my thinking about them,\u201d says Kathy Schrock, director of technology at Nauset Public Schools in Orleans, MA. \u201cHaving had three different models of netbooks over the past few years, I\u2019ve seen both the pros\u2014size, battery life, and cost\u2014and the cons\u2014size, processor, and video capabilities\u2014and realize that the portability, power, and hundreds of apps available for the iPad can easily replace the netbook in schools. It can also move technology use to the next level by providing a simple-to-use, long-battery-life, instant-on-instant-off device that provides access to information, online tools, and much more.\u201d\nBut Schrock also feels that iPads won\u2019t be able to cut it on their own in K-12 classrooms. They will work only in environments that also include access to robust desktop or laptop machines, she says.\n\u201cDo students need a full laptop or desktop with a scanner, midi keyboard, FireWire port, camcorders, digital camera, video and audio production software, and a large monitor all the time?\u201d Schrock asks. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they do. But as schools look to the iPad or other tablets as viable 1-to-1 options, they must remember to populate the school with pods of the powerful tools students will need for their final productions.\u201d\nElizabeth Knittle, technology integration specialist at the Barnstable Public SchoolDistrict in Hyannis, MA, says that she was never a fan of the netbook for personal use, but she argues that it\u2019s a great classroomdevice and that the iPad doesn\u2019t really surpass it in performing the basics.\n\u201cNetbooks are very good if you want to do research and use basic productivity applications,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you want to create rich media content, you need to move to a desktop or laptop. I think you could say the same thing about an iPad.\u201d\nAnd yet, Barnstable is currently awaiting the arrival of 10 iPads. Knittle says they are an alternative that the district doesn\u2019t want to ignore. \u201cWe want to determine if they have a place in our classrooms,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something you can\u2019t really decide until you try them out.\u201d\nThe district plans to work with students and teachers to test-drive the iPad\u2019s educational applications and e-books, and explore the ways the device might be used in classrooms. Knittle says the district is especially interested in how it might work in special education environments. But she makes sure to add that if tablets are adopted by the district, they will only be part of the tech mix.\n\u201cWe already use iPods and netbook carts and full laptop carts,\u201d she says. \u201cEach serves a different purpose. This is really about finding the right tool for the right job.\u201d\nLINKS\n"}], [{"score": 504.19397, "uuid": "58fe42e3-0848-5c72-a367-3e3003c50bab", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0917wb-23-19952", "target_hostname": "kunal.kundaje.net", "target_uri": "http://kunal.kundaje.net/2005_01_01_archives.php?show_id=pl110496209362302967", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "e-piphany: <em>Technology</em>, life, miscellany", "snippet": "I really like the &quot;Simulated Run&quot; feature <em>which</em> basically simulates the backup&#x2F;sync procedure so that you can see <em>which</em> files will be transferred <em>which</em> way when you actually <em>perform</em> the operation.", "explanation": null, "document": "Channel9 demos Avalon 3D...\nI watched this video almost immediately after it was posted last evening, and I wanted to blog about it, but it was time for dinner (after which I ended up watching four back-to-back episodes of \"Who's Line Is It Anyway\" on Comedy Central). Anyway, that's beside the point. :P\nDaniel [Lehenbauer] is a software design engineer on the Avalon team and he's responsible for the 3D features of Avalon.\nHere he gives us a demo of Avalon 3D. Really cool stuff. Originally designed to only run on the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, Avalon is now supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. In fact, the demo here is done on XP.\nBear in mind that this video is intended to be viewed from a developer's standpoint, so if all you're expecting is fancy graphics and eye-candy, this is not for you. With that said, I highly recommend watching it if you're interested in seeing what XAML is like, and how convenient it makes things. If you like what you see, head over to Daniel's blog for more info.\nUpdate: Read the comments for an interesting short discussion. :)\nposted at 1:54:00 PM\n[ Hide comments ]\nconvenient? More eyestrain if you ask me. <xml> code is not the easiest to read if you have lines and lines of code, AND it is all nested.\nNow, that is not to say that the new technology is actually pretty cool, a lot of new things can be done with it. What MS wants it to be used for is online stores. And if that happens, then it will cause all other OS's to be without those websites that are going to use it exclusively.\nSo far i think XAML and Avalon are a lot of hype over something that is not going to turn out as good as it looks.\nX-Istence, 01.06.2005, 5:33 pm\nThink of it this way - is it easier to write a webpage using XHTML, or is it easier to code a complete GUI for an application using the languages/frameworks/APIs that are available today?\nXAML is a lot like creating a webpage in the sense that it has similar syntax and the same tree-structure model. Obviously, it's not meant to be a language for writing complete applications (which is why C# or VB.NET come into the picture), but it makes UI design so much easier that you don't need a hardcore C++/C# programmer to do it anymore. This is a big advantage, especially when you're working on a large-scale application in big teams.\nBesides, the tree-structure paradigm of XML (which is just beautiful, in my opinion) makes perfect sense for something like this where each UI element is a child or parent of another (for example, a button is the child of the form or window).\nWill it turn out as good as it seems/looks? Who knows? It's too early in the development process to make any judgements. I'm hoping we'll see more applications and demos at WinHEC and PDC 2005 in April and September this year. :)\nKunal, 01.06.2005, 6:48 pm\nLets hope that bills presentation does not crash then :P\nPersonally i find that if you are going to intermangle XAML with VB.net and or C# you ahve the same sort of mess going on as was with the origional VB and the making forms, and buttons, and then having some piece of code act upon it. Yet now we don't even get help with a graphical way to drag and drop elements.\nAnd you never needed a hardcore C++ or C# developer to create a GUI on windows, it could all be done using graphical interfaces that Microsoft has provided, and writing the code would be like writing VB code, just open the properties for that form, and write it.\nX-Istence, 01.07.2005, 3:21 am\nYou're kidding yourself, X. Open up VS.NET, and create a simple Windows Forms application that just displays a button with the text \"Hello World\" on a form. Compare the code to this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<Window>\n<Button>Hello World</Button>\n</Window>\nThen come back and tell me which is simpler and cleaner. And this is just for a simple Hello World example. Think about a more complex UI - something involving several different objects, gradients, 3D elements, animation. If you don't find XAML code simpler than what's available currently, you're sadly in the minority.\nNot only that, the tree-structure of the XAML code just makes so much sense, as I mentioned before. The Button tags nested within the Window tags clearly show you the parent-child relationship. Get a nice IDE with syntax highlighting, and you have some amazingly readable code.\nAnd what makes you think you don't get a drag-and-drop way of doing things? Not only will there be tools to generate XAML code, but if you watched the video, you'll notice they mention even being able to import files generated by other 3D applications. Again, the very structure of XML itself makes it much easier to write UI design tools that can generate code as compared to writing tools that have to generate syntactically and sematically correct C#/WinForms code, for example. Using tools to parse code becomes hell of a lot easier too. Basically, you have all the advantages that XML enjoys today propagating to XAML too.\nIntermingling XAML with C#/VB.NET code doesn't cause a \"mess\" if it's done correctly. It's the same principle as XHTML and CSS - separation of the presentation layer from the core working of the application, like event handlers etc. You can write (or generate, if you will) a XAML file that defines the entire UI, and have a separate code-behind file containing the C# code that performs all the nitty-gritty stuff. So the UI design team just needs to bother about the XAML source files and nothing else when updates and modifications need to be made. This sort of separation, believe it or not, is GOOD.\nIn any case, I think I brought up most of the key points in this comment. I'd rather not spend more time trying to argue, or convince you about the merits of the new approach if you don't already see them. There are people who will be happy and those who won't. You can't please everyone. There are people who swear by Perl, others who absolutely hate it for its cryptic syntax. All I know from looking around the web is that a large majority of professional Windows devs are pretty excited by Avalon and XAML (the response at PDC 2003 was a testament to that).\nKunal, 01.07.2005, 4:22 pm\nI don't disagree with the example, but in the winforms example i can immmediatly specify the height of the window, the height and width of the button, for the XML i have to add other tags that specify that.\nAnd if you are seperating XAML from C# like XHTML with CSS today, you would have problems as well, sometimes i want to do things using CSS that just can not be done as it does not have intimate knowledge of the XHTML, in which case JavaScript is used to get the desired effect. (Like pinstripping the rows of a table, not using PHP as another middleman).\nIf they could iron out those things, then yes indeed it would be a way better system, but currently i can see problems with it, and the way it works.\nI agree that seperation of code and presentation layer is a good thing, but that can be accomplished the same way with a properly written OOP application in Java, C++ or C#.\nI see a lot of good points to the \"new\" approach, but i also see the negative points to it. Just like XHTML + CSS does not do what it could do, or can't do because of the fact that the two are seperated, which is where more \"glue\" comes in, JavaScript.\nX-Istence, 01.08.2005, 7:21 am\nNo X, you don't need new tags to specify height and width. There are tag attributes called Width and Height (just like the width and height attribs of the <img> tag in XHTML).\nSure, there can be problems with XAML, just like every other programming language in the world (none of which are perfect, and have been constantly evolving). We have to bear in mind that Avalon/XAML haven't even hit 1.0 yet (check out Chris Anderson's blog). There are bound to be quirks and problems at this stage, and there will probably be problems even after 1.0 is released which will be fixed in a subsequent 2.0 release and so on. We just have to give it a fair chance.\nDo I think XAML is the greatest thing in the world? No.\nDo I think it has no negative points? Of course not.\nDo I think it's exciting? Most definitely. :)\nKunal, 01.08.2005, 1:28 pm\nThat is what i meant.\nX-Istence, 01.09.2005, 10:07 am\nHello.

Get inside your own head. Be like Buddha.\n3) Introverts, sometimes you need to show people \"what's inside your suitcase\".

It's only recently we've forgotten.\n\"There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas,\" she says. Sshhh, Susan! That's the TED model you're dissing there.....\nAre you an introvert? Quick quiz here .\nBut basically, extroverts take energy from other people and social situations. And introverts don't. They need quiet.\nThis is Rauch on the differences:\nDo you know someone who needs hours alone every day? Who loves quiet conversations about feelings or ideas, and can give a dynamite presentation to a big audience, but seems awkward in groups and maladroit at small talk? Who has to be dragged to parties and then needs the rest of the day to recuperate? Who growls or scowls or grunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are just trying to be nice?\nIf you answered yes to these questions, chances are that you have an introvert on your hands\u2014and that you aren't caring for him properly\n12.34pm:\nIt's a bit of a topic of the moment. Back in 2003, Jonathan Rauch wrote an article for The Atlantic magazine called \"How to Care for your Introvert\" which has had an amazing afterlife. The most read Atlantic article ever.\nCain's thesis expands on this. She believes that the world is structured to favour extroverts. Schools, workplaces are biassed against introverts. And yet, some of the greatest leaders in history, and innovators in every field, are introverts.\n12.32pm:\nNot only that, interestingly, Quiet was an instant bestseller. This is a book that was waiting to be written. A former corporate lawyer, she says she made \"self-negating\" choices. Which is what introverts do, she says. And \"is the world's loss\".\nA third to a half of the world's population are introverts. But nobody bothers to listen them.\nCain calls for \"a quiet revolution\".\nIntroversion is different from being shy. That's about fear of social judgement. Whereas introverts just don't need or thrive on external stimulation.\n"}]]}
