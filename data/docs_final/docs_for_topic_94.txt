It looks great so the kid's love it from the start and will enjoy pulling it along themselves. And when they get tired they can jump on and have a ride! The Trunki suitcase is lightweight and durable and that's what you need when traveling with children. Plus the fun characters and colors will bring admiring comments from other travelers.\nThere are slightly different products available in the UK from the US and Canada range which is distributed by Melissa & Doug, but we should all be able to find a Trunki suitcase our children will fall in love with.\nSpecification\nAll Trunki suitcases are made from strong, hard plastic. It is seriously tough as we've dropped it down stairs (not on purpose) and there are no marks. I've not put it to the test, but as the case can hold over 50kg (100lbs) you could possibly get two children riding on one case.\nDimensions: 46 x 20.5 x 31cm (18\" x 8\" x 12\")\nIt's hand luggage approved so no need to check in at the airport. This has been a huge help as I've packed mine and my daughter's things for the plane in her Trunki and I could then pull her along for the long 'walk' to the Gate. Actually, be aware that Trunki suitcases are supposed to be hand luggage and not checked in so pack it accordingly.\nWeight: 1.7kg (Approx: 3.8 lbs)\nLight enough for young children to pull along themselves. If they run with the case and turn quickly it may fall over but I don't see that as a fault as I'm sure it would happen with all cases. It is perfectly stable as a ride-on toy as the four wheels are even and robust.\nCapacity: 18 l. (4 gallons)\nAge Range: 3-6 years approx.\nI've seen 18 month old toddlers riding on their own Trunki and know of 8 year olds who no longer ride on theirs but use it for storing toys and pack it for sleepovers. Trunki suitcases are well-made so you should have it for many years so don't be too concerned about the age range as your child will find plenty of uses for their case.\n\u00a9 Laura Porter, licensed to About.com, Inc.\nColors: There are lots of colors and characters in the range and more specials arrive each year so every child should be able to find the right one for them.\nMore Than Just The Airport\nI agree with the reviewer on the About.com Kid's Fashion site who suggests all kids should have a least one good sized bag for air travel, car trips and for sleepovers.\nI've used the Trunki suitcase for more than just the airport and it's been pulled along the street in many countries with my daughter riding along.\nWe've been to the shops on it \u2013 and I didn't have to carry the groceries back afterwards! (I didn't buy eggs or leak-able items, obviously, but it was great for the heavy stuff like tins or for bread so it wasn't squashed in my shopping bag.)\nEven going to the library, we've taken the Trunki so my daughter's 15 hardback books could be inside and she could ride along.\nI know lots of families who use the Trunki for weekends away for the kids and my daughter uses hers for moving toys around the house.\nWhen we went on a two week road trip, she was allowed to pack as many toys as she could fit in her Trunki and I didn't hear any complaints as she had most of her favorite things with her for our time away.\nFeatures\nThere are two clasps that can be 'locked' with the simple key attached to the strap handle. I have never had the clasps come undone while going along, whether locked or not, so I do think this is very secure. You will probably need to help your child to open the case but that's a good thing as you don't want them emptying the contents around the airport.\nThere's an elastic 'teddy bear seat belt' to hold everything in place on one side.\nThe soft rubber seal ensures everything stays in plus no nipped fingers when closing.\nOnce closed, the case has hard 'horns' for children to hold on to when they ride and there's a molded saddle shape so the rider doesn't slide about. Even young children can move themselves along quite easily.\nThere's a detachable strap with a loop handle for either clipping on at one end for pulling the case, or clipping on at both ends and to carry on your shoulder. I've never had the strap unclip itself either when being pulled along or carried.\nThere are also short handles so you can grab the case quickly when needed.\nNo outside pockets: I know some reviewers, such as on the About.com Baby Products site , would like to see an outside pocket on the case but I prefer it without as I know the contents would get lost easily and it may make the case uncomfortable to ride or unstable.\nThere's an ID label on the strap handle which is worth filling in as you see plenty of these cases at airports these days so you don't want any confusion if kids start playing together.\nAbout Trunki\nRob Law had the idea for the ride-on suitcase back in 1996 and took it to the BBC TV show, Dragon's Den , where entrepreneurs try to convince business experts that they have a good idea. Surprisingly, Trunki was turned down for financial backing but we can all be grateful Rob realized he had a good product. He has been back on the show and the Trunki suitcase is now widely recognized as 'the one that got away'. Find out more about the company .\nLess Frustration\n\u00a9 Laura Porter, licensed to About.com, Inc.\nKids like having some control over their lives and holiday time can be tough as their routines are lost and they can seem more difficult but often just want to have some responsibility for their life too.\nThere is a reason a Trunki case is top of this list of Airline Luggage for Children . The small pull-along cases seem like a good idea when your child is at home but you know the kids will get bored and you'll be left carrying it at some point \u2013 and those handles are not long enough for an adult, are they?\nThe clever Trunki designers realized children are happier when they can play with a friend, and a Trunki case is a character so is a great companion for your little one while away from home. It's a ride-on toy to play on while you're in queues or waiting at airports or stations. And when they get tired \u2013 and they will (especially when just off the plane) \u2013 you can pull your child along while they are seated which means you know where they are and they haven't left their case anywhere. It also makes it fun for the child so complaining levels should be reduced. Yes, you may spend some time pulling them along but I've found it leads to a lot less frustration for everyone than trying to carry a toddler and all the holiday bags.\nConclusion\nBoth my daughter and I have been thrilled with her Trunki suitcase and I know as she gets older we will continue to use it around the house and for visiting friends and family. Thankfully it is a high quality case and I know we will have it for many years. I only wish they made one for adults so I could join in the fun!\nDisclosure: Review samples were provided by the manufacturer.

But it is a confusing mess as far as I am concerned. We are overloaded with information, and yet we do not know if we know enough, or if what I know is good because there are so many contradicting sources/info out there. For the average person (not the utral smart ones) the digital age is pushing them away because perhaps what they are looking for is JUST ONE TRUSTED SOURCE? like it used to be around our dinner table from our parents? from our elders around the water well?\nJust some of my observations. I will attempt to write more if I think others are interested in my crazy thinking. This is after all a mighty sophisticated thinking place. And what I have here is only everyday observations of my simple life and happenings around me.\nCindy\nPart I\nHello Helen and Jacques,\nI will attempt to give a high level of my own observations. By the way I am no way close to 'teaching' the thinking of Buddha and Confucius. Their teaching influenced my behaviour and thought processes because I grew up in that environment, and of course I was Chinese educated. Western thinking influenced me greatly during the 2nd phase of my life, and I think right now (3rd and last phase)I am merging and comparing the ever so confusing east/west medley of my life.\nWhen Olaf and myself were searching a name for our website, I remember I just could not get these images out of my mind: women carrying babies, old-men and women talking and exchanging ideas and stories. And young kids and adults sitting listening intently. And all these around a well. That's why we called our website - The VillageWell.\nThe situation you mentioned in Kenya, Helen, is no different from my own childhood. We did not have television, radio, internet to distract us. My grandmother, mother and uncles were our ONLY souce of entertainment and knowledge. We depended on them. We respected their wisdom because we cannot find it anywhere else.\nFast forward to present day family life. The digital age. 9 years old in Japan is using lap-top to do their homework. They retrieved info from the internet. They no longer need their parents. They have sources out there that replaces there parents. There is not much to hold the family together.\nFast forward to present day office life. We are given a desk-top to do our job. We become generalist rather than specialist. An engineer has to do the job of a secretary of creating powerpoint, excel datasheet, faxing, typing etc. Where do we have time left to do a 'quality' engineering job?\nFast forward to present day organization life. Was it Xeros that came up with the new age lift-style of 'water-cooler' thing? What are we trying to reproduce here? The Village Well concepts. BUT, there is a great difference here. We do not need to 'drink' knowledge from this water-cooler concepts. The PC on our desk never leave us alone, never stop tempting us to go back to 'IT' for information. Therefore will it work? For a while perhaps. And soon everyone is locking ourselves back in our room again. Because sharing knowledge is not something we can artificially reproduce. Sharing has to have more ingredients add to it to make it happened.\nFast foward to present day EU policies. Since my returned I saw programmes for Youth Forum, Young trainers, Young researchers. I do not see programme for the aged and the dying? What happened here? Forgotten species? Where is programme to link the young and the old? Why the silos? Why the division? Why making a very large segment of the population feel unwanted? (By the way I am one of them) Why not creating the picture of The VillageWell...bringing the old, the young, the babies, the family together?\nContinue .......\nKenyan appreciation of wisdom\nHi Jacques.\nThat is a good question. When I think of my early days in East Africa - the old people were revered because of the wisdom they had acquired and in a largely illiterate society, they were the tribe's history book.\nAs education spread, wisdom was no longer quite so highly esteemed out there in the cities, but in the rural areas it was still respected. This was really evident when you consider President Jomo Kenyatta's title - Mzee - meaning old and wise.\nHere in Europe I get the feeling that wisdom is not appreciated at all, it's the quick fix that counts. The question should surely generate lots of discussion\nWhat about a possible link between KM and wisdom?\nCindy,\nIt is interesting to see that quote of Confucius in your text. What you offer us is knowledge: something to be learnt. And learning means reflection, which is the noblest way to wisdom. It seems we should make use of your teaching. But what is the current attitude to wisdom these days? Is it a value to be considered in our digital society?\nWhat do H-SIG readers think?\nJacques\nJacques SOUILLOT , 03-Feb-04 @ 22:54PM\nWould complexity be more complex than expected?\nWhat has come to my mind after a few days (weeks), in relation to Cindy's reflections, is that KM is far from being linear. Everybody would have told me so before, of course, but who had underlined the transient nature of our knowledge, crazes, competencies.\nCould it be that \"anything\" has more dimensions than we ordinarily think or even imagine, even in our wildest dreams? This would add a significant number of questions to our apprehension of KM approaches.\nDoes it give you the creeps, or do you feel stimulated?\nJacques\nVitaly Titov , 27-Jan-04 @ 09:42AM\nOpened Suitcases of World Individuals\n\u0093\u0085as humans, we should be like a suitcases\u0085\u0094 with necessary and impracticable things or fancies. It may be closed, ajar (halfopened) and opened suitcases.\nBut all told Individuals with multicultural diversity have the right to view, thought, act, write, speech, paint, build and use any another sign systems for communications. Anybody Individual is the part of a national community with unique language sign system. From this viewpoint we often look at Individual Suitcase as a huge valise with value-true of a national culture.\nAt beginning of human civilization the Latin notion \u0093cultura\u0094 was used as the language sign of a ability to cultivate a dirt. Eventually this term became the common sense of abilities, practices, knowledge, sciences, arts etc.\nFor communications between Individuals is needed language sign system. I think that any Suitcase saves sounds and movies as an universal sign system that don\u0092t call a translation. We can understand music sounds and film movies more quickly than long non figurative text or gorgeous speech.\nI think that in multi-language network info-surge we should be noble, easy for understanding and ready to language compromise as an opened suitcases with knowledge treasury.\nMy King is Russian language, any foreign language is for my as ladies and gentlemen, Neutral Sign System Esperanto is my trump card, that opens to me World Individuals because it is an opened Suitcases.\nFor example many value true about China I find in journal \u0093El popola Cxinio\u0094 , that also reads Ragnar Baldursson - Iceland Diplomat en China .\nCindy Lemcke-Hoong , 26-Jan-04 @ 14:29PM\nIs not how much to contribute, but what you can contribute\nHi Helen,\nSorry for my late response. Time constrains plus I wanted more time to reflect.\nPayment. Yes. We all want payment/reward in some sort. We all need some materials comfort. Perfectly normal. How much materials comfort each must have is relative. So is knowledge. So is recognition of our standings in the society. These are the things that make us feel secure in this life. These are \u0091external things\u0092 we cannot take along. So why are we acquiring them? Can we do with less of them? Will I be less intelligent if I share what I know with someone else? These are the questions each of us will have to answer according to our needs. Therefore you are no different than me. Or anybody else.\nBut can we survive with a lot less? And by giving something away we always end up with something new. Take the case of knowledge sharing. If I do not talk to anyone but just hold on to what I know. I will forever keeping to the same level of what I know (of course in between I pick up more knowledge from readings, from reasoning mentally etc.). And the \u0091new reasoning\u0092 that I manage to produce will be strictly my own point of view. Very limited and stale. What if I meet with 5 persons who share the same interests (same knowledge inclinations)? Talking and hashing together, new ideas, new knowledge emerges. But this will carry the weight of 6 different views. What I am saying here is nothing new. But making people do more of it is the under-lining key element of the teaching of Buddha\u0085what do you want/need to keep in your \u0091suitcases\u0092?\nYou wrote: \u0093Only the very saintly, otherworldly people contribute purely for the sake of betterment of others\u0085\u0094 I DO NOT agree with you at all!\nContributions do not have to be significant. And the impact does not have to be great. The contributor should feel comfortable with what he/she can afford. The point here is what can I give up (contribute)?

I want to change the world, one necklace at a time! Walking down the street my fingers twitch as I have the urge to add sparkle, a statement cuff, some long pearls, chunky resin beads in just the right shade. I think jewellery is very powerful, the oldest pair of jeans and jumper can be transformed with a simple necklace. It has the power to lift an outfit from the ordinary to the sublime. So after years of just feeding my jewellery habit, I decided to make a break and formed Dot Com Jewellery. I have a number of fabulous jewellery brands, that seem to be expanding every week including: Suzie Blue- An amazingly vast range of beautiful fashion jewelery handmade in Bali with fabulous pieces actually designed by Suzie herself!

Hannah fell to the floor in a heap as her arms and legs flailed everywhere.\nAnnoyance surged through my veins as I viewed this spectacle. Red splotches began to appear on her wet, sticky face as Hannah\u2019s tiny fists pounded the floor simultaneously with her stomping feet. How long could she keep this up? I didn\u2019t want to find out.\nWith a quick, fluid motion, I thrust a cookie into the undeserving child\u2019s hands. \u201cJust one,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.\nShe was up and bouncing away with a gleeful grin as the sandy blonde hair clung to her tear-stained cheeks.\n\u201cSpoiled brat,\u201d I muttered, returning to the mess on the stove that was supposed to be dinner.\nThe edge of the pan was crusted with dried Ragu sauce that I had somehow single-handedly managed to ruin. The noodles lay in a massive, soggy clump at the base of the next pan. How does anyone mess up spaghetti?\n\u201cGood girl. You eat that up,\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice cooed from the other room.\n\u201cHannah, what are you doing?\u201d I peeked over to see her feeding the entire plate of cookies to their dog, Jezebel. Drool seeped from Jezebel\u2019s gigantic jowls as she devoured the entire contents of the dish.\n\u201cHannah! Stop! You know you are not supposed to do that!\u201d\n\u201cBut Jezi likes it.\u201d She looked almost innocent with her wide angelic blue eyes gazing up at me as if she were doing nothing wrong.\n\u201cYes I know she does, but you will make her sick.\u201d I could just picture the effect that this would have on the old dog\u2019s stomach. Jezebel stared up at me with clouded, half-seeing eyes.\nThe dog was ancient. Patches of black fur were missing all over her enormous body, leaving what was left in little scattered tufts. Her ears drooped with the rest of her bagging face. She looked like a pile of wrinkled laundry. My sister, Mabel, should have put the dog out of her misery years ago, but Hannah was too attached to it.\nHannah\u2019s hands draped about the dog\u2019s neck in a possessive grip. I realized my effort was futile and turned back towards the disastrous kitchen. I had my work cut out for me.\nThe next few hours ticked by with a rapid pace. After some serious coaxing, Hannah had relented and gone to bed, and I was enjoying the peaceful, quiet atmosphere of her absence. I leaned back in the wooden chair cradling a soft, plush pillow in my lap. I massaged my temples in an effort to sooth my nerves.\n\u201cThree more days,\u201d I chanted to myself. \u201cThree more days and you can leave this awful city and go home.\u201d My mind rejoiced happily at the thought of my sister and her husband returning from their vacation.\nTraffic buzzed outside and there was the sound of sirens going off in the distance. Crime was a constant companion in the Big Apple. My senses seemed heightened, and I felt a prickle of unease move across my spine.\nI surveyed the floral print wallpaper with the matching cr\u00e8me colored curtains and lampshades that created a yellow haze about the room. My eyes started to flutter as I felt the sweet release of sleep come to consume me.\nThat is what I needed\u2026 Sleep. I needed to sleep away the tension of the past few weeks. Drown out the bustling noise of the city and pretend that I was back home with nothing but the sound of crickets outside and the wind whistling through the trees. A sentimental smile spread across my face as I thought of the clear blue sky that was not misted over with a layer of smog. A place where time seemed to slow down, and people were not always in a hurry to get somewhere.\nA resonating thud echoed about the room dragging me out of my day-dream.\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Startled, I shot up to see what was the matter. Jezebel lay in the center of the cold, tile floor; her long bony legs splayed out from under her. Fear welled up in the pit of my stomach doing tiny somersaults. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be dead,\u201d I begged.\nThe stench lingering over the animal made my slender nose wrinkle in disgust. A pool of vomit dripped out of the slack mouth, and the milky eyes stared up at me without blinking. A few quick jabs of my big toe in the dog\u2019s stiff side confirmed any suspicions: Jezebel was dead.\nI raced to the phone, and with rapid speed began to dial Mabel\u2019s cell phone. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d I chanted, waiting anxiously for her to answer.\n\u201cUh\u2026 hello.\u201d The sound of salsa music floated in from the background, muffling Mabel\u2019s soft voice.\n\u201cMabe, it\u2019s Jess.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Jess! What\u2019s up?\u201d Her tone had an edge of concern in it. \u201cIs everything alright? It\u2019s kinda late. Hannah okay?\u201d\n\u201cHannah\u2019s fine, she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d I waved a hand over my face to fan out the smell hovering in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s Jezebel. I think she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no! You sure?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d I retorted in an irritated huff. The music seemed to get even louder as Mabel drew in a long, deep breath. The obvious solution was that the dog had to be taken care of. I tried to scribble down most of the directions she gave to the nearest veterinary clinic that would dispose of the body. It was hard to understand her over roar of the background.\n\u201cOh and Jess,\u201d Mabel said with an air of sadness. \u201cYou know how much Hannah love Jezebel; I would appreciate it if you could do this with out her knowing. I would like to break it to her myself when we got back.\u201d\nAll I could do was agree with the terms and conditions. I began to rake my brain for any possible solutions for concealing the large dog. My thin fingers slid through my tangled curls as I tried to think. What could be large enough to hide a Great Dane?\nMy eyes fell upon a red, tattered suitcase lying in the back corner of a crowded closet. A thin layer of dust coated the surface, as I tugged on the worn, black strap.\n\u201cThis could work,\u201d I mumbled to myself.\nThere was a steady stream of cars on the road as I darted in and out of the swarms of office workers congregating on the sidewalk. It was early morning, and a combination of pink and yellow outlined the edges of the buildings. The concrete was crowded with moving bodies trying to walk to work. The distinct smell of exhaust smoke wafted through the air as lines of traffic bustled about the street.\nMy arm was tired and the muscles were screaming for release from lugging around the suitcase containing the body of Jezebel. Somehow I had managed to contort her large frame to fit inside the bag. The knuckles on my hand began to turn white and lose feeling. It had only been two blocks and I was already exhausted. I would have to break down and hail a taxi, something that I was not accustomed to doing.\nThe sooner I got to the clinic and back, the better. Mrs. Griffith, the sixty-year-old neighbor, was not overly thrilled to look after Hannah while I was out. Her shriveled face furrowed into a deep frown, making the crows feet around her caked-on blue eye-shadowed lids deepen and crack. An unlit cigarette hung loosely in her thin, pursed lips as she unwillingly consented, rolling those over-done blue eyes of hers. I gave her specific instructions to tell Hannah that I was taking Jezebel for a \u201ccheck-up,\u201d and that Mabel would be picking Jezebel up when they got back. That should buy some time before they had to break the news to Hannah.\nI stepped to the side of the curb, glancing around to find the familiar sight of the yellow taxi cabs. With a hesitant pause, I raised my fragile hand and waved gingerly when one came into sight. The cab veered to the left, and the driver ignored me completely.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not very good at that,\u201d a deep luring voice said behind me.\nI turned around to see a tall man standing behind me. His dark hair was combed to the side and his coal-black suit was clean and pressed. A wide, crooked smile radiated across his attractive face, and the teeth behind his plump lips glowed with a luminescent light.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked stupidly, transfixed by his presence.\n\u201cI said you\u2019re doing it wrong. You have to be more assertive.\u201d His large hand shot up with a hard, brisk wave, and with in a matter of seconds a cab appeared magically. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll share this one with ya,\u201d he said with a polite nod towards the cab door, indicating that I should get in.\n\u201cUm, thank you,\u201d I stammered back, apprehensive about sharing a ride with a complete stranger. A shiver began to tease the hair on the back of my neck. His smile seemed genuine enough, so I pushed the little pangs of doubt away, and headed towards the cab.\n\u201cWhere you headin\u2019 to?\u201d he asked indifferently.\nMy mind went blank for a second. \u201c Uh\u2026 DeLancey Street.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want him to know where I was really going. Besides, the vet clinic was just down the street, I could walk a little ways.\nHis smile widened in excitement. \u201cWell, what a coincidence, I just happen to be going there myself.\u201d\nFor a moment that struck me as odd, but I shrugged it off. It could happen, couldn\u2019t it?\nThe driver popped the trunk, and I lifted the heavy suitcase into it, relieved to be able to put it down. The man\u2019s gaze shifted from me to the suitcase, then back again. A flicker passed over his eyes that I couldn\u2019t quite place. I just prayed that he wouldn\u2019t ask me what the content of the bag was.\nMy hands gripped the grimy trunk handle and I pulled it down hard to make sure it latched. When I heard the click, I turned towards the man holding the door open for me. He\u2019s a gentleman, I thought to myself in awe.\n\u201cHere you go.\u201d He held onto my arm with a firm grip to steady me as I got into the cab. I slid over towards the window, and he followed in behind me.\n\u201cI should introduce myself.\u201d His charismatic expression enchanted me. \u201cI\u2019m Guy Cohen.\u201d\n\u201cJess.\u201d I sputtered out, feeling a blush creep over my cheeks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d His comment made me flush even more. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you, Jess?\u201d That wasn\u2019t really a question.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I answered in a meek voice.\n\u201cI could tell,\u201d Guy said with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re much too timid.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d He made it sound like a character flaw.\n\u201cI can tell that you haven\u2019t had much experience being in the city, thought I might help you out.\u201d Guy faltered for a second then regained his composure. \u201cSo what brings you to the Big Apple?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m watching my niece while my sister and her husband are out of town.\u201d The anxious feeling began to gnaw at my insides. The cab driver\u2019s greasy eyes flickered to the review mirror. A worn-out pine tree air freshener swayed with the movement of the car. Sweat was rolling down his thick neck as his head inclined towards our conversation.\n\u201cYou doin\u2019 a little shopping today?\u201d Guy asked casually, his body turning towards mine in an inviting manner. I thought about the dead dog in the trunk and the wheels of my mind tried to come up with a logical lie.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said louder than I intended to, adverting my eyes from his calculating gaze. I was never good at lying. There had to be department stores that were opening about this time, so the lie had to be somewhat believable.\n\u201cYeah, there are some good shops down DeLancey Street\u2026 If you don\u2019t mind spending the extra money.\u201d Guy\u2019s tone was nonchalant as his body swiveled closer to mine. I could feel the heat rising off his skin, and color flooded my already crimson cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t mind.\u201d My fingers wrapped themselves around the door handle as I scooted closer to the window. \u201cI like shopping.\u201d I shuddered at the sound of that stupid response.\nGuy gave a low rumble of a chuckle that seemed to vibrate in his muscular chest. He bent his head closer towards my retreating frame. \u201cI thought you would. Most women do.\u201d A roar of laughter ripped through his lush lips.\nHis smile did not seem as charming and alluring as it once had been. His grin looked like razor sharp teeth poking out of a menacing snarl. The snarl of a predator about to devour his prey.\nAn unconvincing laugh forced its way to my mouth. Blood pumped with an iron force through the throbbing veins, and my heart took on the rapid speed of a jackhammer ready to pound its way out of my chest. I drew in a couple of shallow breaths of musty air. The cab seemed more confining now. The intermingling smell of mildew and perspiration and Guy\u2019s exotic cologne was playing havoc with my unsettled stomach.\nThe driver pulled the car over towards the curb with an abrupt stop. His ruffled brows knitted together and his watery lips hung open under his matted beard. I reached in my pocket to pull out a crumpled wad of money. v\u201cI got it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Guy handed the driver a crisp twenty dollar bill. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d\nThe driver grunted in response. I wondered where Guy had gotten the money from. I didn\u2019t see him pull out a wallet or dig through his suit pockets. Maybe I was seeing things.\nThe door opened with a hesitant nudge, and my feet fell to the pavement. More people seemed to file out on the side walks, dodging each other. The cold, harsh buildings loomed before me. Guy was already at the open trunk removing the old suitcase.\n\u201cThis is pretty heavy. Seems like you already have quite a load!\u201d His strong features strained under the weight of the lumpy bag. He dropped the bag to my feet with a deafening crack.\n\u201cWell, thank you for the ride,\u201d I tried to say with a polite smile as I bent over to grab the ragged strap.\nThere was a sharp snap against my face. My head twisted backwards in a disoriented fit. The sidewalk scraped against my body as I plummeted towards the dirt-covered ground. Blood began to swell around my eye and sting with intense pain. There was a distinct hand print on my face where the contact had happened.\nMy head seemed distended from the rest of my body as I tried to raise it from the foul sidewalk. Guy Cohen\u2019s fleeing figure looped through the cluster of people walking on by, his hands clutching the red suitcase. vI forced myself up to a sitting position; objects were blurred and faded into one another. People were stepping over me in disgust as I tried to regain my senses. With all the strength that I could gather, my reluctant body heaved itself to a stance. My hand grasped the inside of my empty pocket, where my money should have been.\n\u201cBastard!\u201d I slurred with anger.\nOne foot moving in front of the other, I slowly propelled myself forward. I would walk the rest of the way back. A bruise started to form around my eye, and a grimace covered my face in a mask of agony.\nI pictured Guy greedily opening the tattered case, thinking that he had pulled a fast one on an unsuspecting victim. His eyes would gleam with the anticipation of the amazing find he had. He would tear away at the zipper with groping fingers, and then stop. His face would fall in torturous disbelief as he beheld the lifeless dog with its hefty body twisted in the confined parcel.\nA slow, little smile tugged at the corners of my mouth. My steps picked up speed, and a laugh of retribution soared out of my lips. A light breeze caressed my inflamed face, and a single thought crossed my mind.\nServes him right.\n"}, {"score": 1071.4457, "uuid": "2fccf482-3cd9-5eb5-985d-218f70c596d4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0715wb-08-16318", "target_hostname": "sketch.stuorg.iastate.edu", "target_uri": "http://sketch.stuorg.iastate.edu/archives2/spring-2009/the-red-suitcase", "page_rank": 1.8900426e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "The Red <em>Suitcase</em> \u2014 Sketch", "snippet": "The driver popped the trunk, and I lifted the heavy <em>suitcase</em> into it, relieved to be able to put it down.

I didn\u2019t want to find out.\nWith a quick, fluid motion, I thrust a cookie into the undeserving child\u2019s hands. \u201cJust one,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.\nShe was up and bouncing away with a gleeful grin as the sandy blonde hair clung to her tear-stained cheeks.\n\u201cSpoiled brat,\u201d I muttered, returning to the mess on the stove that was supposed to be dinner.\nThe edge of the pan was crusted with dried Ragu sauce that I had somehow single-handedly managed to ruin. The noodles lay in a massive, soggy clump at the base of the next pan. How does anyone mess up spaghetti?\n\u201cGood girl. You eat that up,\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice cooed from the other room.\n\u201cHannah, what are you doing?\u201d I peeked over to see her feeding the entire plate of cookies to their dog, Jezebel. Drool seeped from Jezebel\u2019s gigantic jowls as she devoured the entire contents of the dish.\n\u201cHannah! Stop! You know you are not supposed to do that!\u201d\n\u201cBut Jezi likes it.\u201d She looked almost innocent with her wide angelic blue eyes gazing up at me as if she were doing nothing wrong.\n\u201cYes I know she does, but you will make her sick.\u201d I could just picture the effect that this would have on the old dog\u2019s stomach. Jezebel stared up at me with clouded, half-seeing eyes.\nThe dog was ancient. Patches of black fur were missing all over her enormous body, leaving what was left in little scattered tufts. Her ears drooped with the rest of her bagging face. She looked like a pile of wrinkled laundry. My sister, Mabel, should have put the dog out of her misery years ago, but Hannah was too attached to it.\nHannah\u2019s hands draped about the dog\u2019s neck in a possessive grip. I realized my effort was futile and turned back towards the disastrous kitchen. I had my work cut out for me.\nThe next few hours ticked by with a rapid pace. After some serious coaxing, Hannah had relented and gone to bed, and I was enjoying the peaceful, quiet atmosphere of her absence. I leaned back in the wooden chair cradling a soft, plush pillow in my lap. I massaged my temples in an effort to sooth my nerves.\n\u201cThree more days,\u201d I chanted to myself. \u201cThree more days and you can leave this awful city and go home.\u201d My mind rejoiced happily at the thought of my sister and her husband returning from their vacation.\nTraffic buzzed outside and there was the sound of sirens going off in the distance. Crime was a constant companion in the Big Apple. My senses seemed heightened, and I felt a prickle of unease move across my spine.\nI surveyed the floral print wallpaper with the matching cr\u00e8me colored curtains and lampshades that created a yellow haze about the room. My eyes started to flutter as I felt the sweet release of sleep come to consume me.\nThat is what I needed\u2026 Sleep. I needed to sleep away the tension of the past few weeks. Drown out the bustling noise of the city and pretend that I was back home with nothing but the sound of crickets outside and the wind whistling through the trees. A sentimental smile spread across my face as I thought of the clear blue sky that was not misted over with a layer of smog. A place where time seemed to slow down, and people were not always in a hurry to get somewhere.\nA resonating thud echoed about the room dragging me out of my day-dream.\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Startled, I shot up to see what was the matter. Jezebel lay in the center of the cold, tile floor; her long bony legs splayed out from under her. Fear welled up in the pit of my stomach doing tiny somersaults. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be dead,\u201d I begged.\nThe stench lingering over the animal made my slender nose wrinkle in disgust. A pool of vomit dripped out of the slack mouth, and the milky eyes stared up at me without blinking. A few quick jabs of my big toe in the dog\u2019s stiff side confirmed any suspicions: Jezebel was dead.\nI raced to the phone, and with rapid speed began to dial Mabel\u2019s cell phone. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d I chanted, waiting anxiously for her to answer.\n\u201cUh\u2026 hello.\u201d The sound of salsa music floated in from the background, muffling Mabel\u2019s soft voice.\n\u201cMabe, it\u2019s Jess.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Jess! What\u2019s up?\u201d Her tone had an edge of concern in it. \u201cIs everything alright? It\u2019s kinda late. Hannah okay?\u201d\n\u201cHannah\u2019s fine, she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d I waved a hand over my face to fan out the smell hovering in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s Jezebel. I think she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no! You sure?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d I retorted in an irritated huff. The music seemed to get even louder as Mabel drew in a long, deep breath. The obvious solution was that the dog had to be taken care of. I tried to scribble down most of the directions she gave to the nearest veterinary clinic that would dispose of the body. It was hard to understand her over roar of the background.\n\u201cOh and Jess,\u201d Mabel said with an air of sadness. \u201cYou know how much Hannah love Jezebel; I would appreciate it if you could do this with out her knowing. I would like to break it to her myself when we got back.\u201d\nAll I could do was agree with the terms and conditions. I began to rake my brain for any possible solutions for concealing the large dog. My thin fingers slid through my tangled curls as I tried to think. What could be large enough to hide a Great Dane?\nMy eyes fell upon a red, tattered suitcase lying in the back corner of a crowded closet. A thin layer of dust coated the surface, as I tugged on the worn, black strap.\n\u201cThis could work,\u201d I mumbled to myself.\nThere was a steady stream of cars on the road as I darted in and out of the swarms of office workers congregating on the sidewalk. It was early morning, and a combination of pink and yellow outlined the edges of the buildings. The concrete was crowded with moving bodies trying to walk to work. The distinct smell of exhaust smoke wafted through the air as lines of traffic bustled about the street.\nMy arm was tired and the muscles were screaming for release from lugging around the suitcase containing the body of Jezebel. Somehow I had managed to contort her large frame to fit inside the bag. The knuckles on my hand began to turn white and lose feeling. It had only been two blocks and I was already exhausted. I would have to break down and hail a taxi, something that I was not accustomed to doing.\nThe sooner I got to the clinic and back, the better. Mrs. Griffith, the sixty-year-old neighbor, was not overly thrilled to look after Hannah while I was out. Her shriveled face furrowed into a deep frown, making the crows feet around her caked-on blue eye-shadowed lids deepen and crack. An unlit cigarette hung loosely in her thin, pursed lips as she unwillingly consented, rolling those over-done blue eyes of hers. I gave her specific instructions to tell Hannah that I was taking Jezebel for a \u201ccheck-up,\u201d and that Mabel would be picking Jezebel up when they got back. That should buy some time before they had to break the news to Hannah.\nI stepped to the side of the curb, glancing around to find the familiar sight of the yellow taxi cabs. With a hesitant pause, I raised my fragile hand and waved gingerly when one came into sight. The cab veered to the left, and the driver ignored me completely.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not very good at that,\u201d a deep luring voice said behind me.\nI turned around to see a tall man standing behind me. His dark hair was combed to the side and his coal-black suit was clean and pressed. A wide, crooked smile radiated across his attractive face, and the teeth behind his plump lips glowed with a luminescent light.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked stupidly, transfixed by his presence.\n\u201cI said you\u2019re doing it wrong. You have to be more assertive.\u201d His large hand shot up with a hard, brisk wave, and with in a matter of seconds a cab appeared magically. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll share this one with ya,\u201d he said with a polite nod towards the cab door, indicating that I should get in.\n\u201cUm, thank you,\u201d I stammered back, apprehensive about sharing a ride with a complete stranger. A shiver began to tease the hair on the back of my neck. His smile seemed genuine enough, so I pushed the little pangs of doubt away, and headed towards the cab.\n\u201cWhere you headin\u2019 to?\u201d he asked indifferently.\nMy mind went blank for a second. \u201c Uh\u2026 DeLancey Street.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t want him to know where I was really going. Besides, the vet clinic was just down the street, I could walk a little ways.\nHis smile widened in excitement. \u201cWell, what a coincidence, I just happen to be going there myself.\u201d\nFor a moment that struck me as odd, but I shrugged it off. It could happen, couldn\u2019t it?\nThe driver popped the trunk, and I lifted the heavy suitcase into it, relieved to be able to put it down. The man\u2019s gaze shifted from me to the suitcase, then back again. A flicker passed over his eyes that I couldn\u2019t quite place. I just prayed that he wouldn\u2019t ask me what the content of the bag was.\nMy hands gripped the grimy trunk handle and I pulled it down hard to make sure it latched. When I heard the click, I turned towards the man holding the door open for me. He\u2019s a gentleman, I thought to myself in awe.\n\u201cHere you go.\u201d He held onto my arm with a firm grip to steady me as I got into the cab. I slid over towards the window, and he followed in behind me.\n\u201cI should introduce myself.\u201d His charismatic expression enchanted me. \u201cI\u2019m Guy Cohen.\u201d\n\u201cJess.\u201d I sputtered out, feeling a blush creep over my cheeks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d His comment made me flush even more. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you, Jess?\u201d That wasn\u2019t really a question.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I answered in a meek voice.\n\u201cI could tell,\u201d Guy said with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re much too timid.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d He made it sound like a character flaw.\n\u201cI can tell that you haven\u2019t had much experience being in the city, thought I might help you out.\u201d Guy faltered for a second then regained his composure. \u201cSo what brings you to the Big Apple?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m watching my niece while my sister and her husband are out of town.\u201d The anxious feeling began to gnaw at my insides. The cab driver\u2019s greasy eyes flickered to the review mirror. A worn-out pine tree air freshener swayed with the movement of the car. Sweat was rolling down his thick neck as his head inclined towards our conversation.\n\u201cYou doin\u2019 a little shopping today?\u201d Guy asked casually, his body turning towards mine in an inviting manner. I thought about the dead dog in the trunk and the wheels of my mind tried to come up with a logical lie.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said louder than I intended to, adverting my eyes from his calculating gaze. I was never good at lying. There had to be department stores that were opening about this time, so the lie had to be somewhat believable.\n\u201cYeah, there are some good shops down DeLancey Street\u2026 If you don\u2019t mind spending the extra money.\u201d Guy\u2019s tone was nonchalant as his body swiveled closer to mine. I could feel the heat rising off his skin, and color flooded my already crimson cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t mind.\u201d My fingers wrapped themselves around the door handle as I scooted closer to the window. \u201cI like shopping.\u201d I shuddered at the sound of that stupid response.\nGuy gave a low rumble of a chuckle that seemed to vibrate in his muscular chest. He bent his head closer towards my retreating frame. \u201cI thought you would. Most women do.\u201d A roar of laughter ripped through his lush lips.\nHis smile did not seem as charming and alluring as it once had been. His grin looked like razor sharp teeth poking out of a menacing snarl. The snarl of a predator about to devour his prey.\nAn unconvincing laugh forced its way to my mouth. Blood pumped with an iron force through the throbbing veins, and my heart took on the rapid speed of a jackhammer ready to pound its way out of my chest. I drew in a couple of shallow breaths of musty air. The cab seemed more confining now. The intermingling smell of mildew and perspiration and Guy\u2019s exotic cologne was playing havoc with my unsettled stomach.\nThe driver pulled the car over towards the curb with an abrupt stop. His ruffled brows knitted together and his watery lips hung open under his matted beard. I reached in my pocket to pull out a crumpled wad of money. v\u201cI got it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Guy handed the driver a crisp twenty dollar bill. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d\nThe driver grunted in response. I wondered where Guy had gotten the money from. I didn\u2019t see him pull out a wallet or dig through his suit pockets. Maybe I was seeing things.\nThe door opened with a hesitant nudge, and my feet fell to the pavement. More people seemed to file out on the side walks, dodging each other. The cold, harsh buildings loomed before me. Guy was already at the open trunk removing the old suitcase.\n\u201cThis is pretty heavy. Seems like you already have quite a load!\u201d His strong features strained under the weight of the lumpy bag. He dropped the bag to my feet with a deafening crack.\n\u201cWell, thank you for the ride,\u201d I tried to say with a polite smile as I bent over to grab the ragged strap.\nThere was a sharp snap against my face. My head twisted backwards in a disoriented fit. The sidewalk scraped against my body as I plummeted towards the dirt-covered ground. Blood began to swell around my eye and sting with intense pain. There was a distinct hand print on my face where the contact had happened.\nMy head seemed distended from the rest of my body as I tried to raise it from the foul sidewalk. Guy Cohen\u2019s fleeing figure looped through the cluster of people walking on by, his hands clutching the red suitcase. vI forced myself up to a sitting position; objects were blurred and faded into one another. People were stepping over me in disgust as I tried to regain my senses. With all the strength that I could gather, my reluctant body heaved itself to a stance. My hand grasped the inside of my empty pocket, where my money should have been.\n\u201cBastard!\u201d I slurred with anger.\nOne foot moving in front of the other, I slowly propelled myself forward. I would walk the rest of the way back. A bruise started to form around my eye, and a grimace covered my face in a mask of agony.\nI pictured Guy greedily opening the tattered case, thinking that he had pulled a fast one on an unsuspecting victim. His eyes would gleam with the anticipation of the amazing find he had. He would tear away at the zipper with groping fingers, and then stop. His face would fall in torturous disbelief as he beheld the lifeless dog with its hefty body twisted in the confined parcel.\nA slow, little smile tugged at the corners of my mouth. My steps picked up speed, and a laugh of retribution soared out of my lips. A light breeze caressed my inflamed face, and a single thought crossed my mind.\nServes him right.\n"}, {"score": 1042.7748, "uuid": "d8173c21-2df3-5831-953e-f014cb7168de", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-56-17164", "target_hostname": "www.thetraveleditor.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thetraveleditor.com/article/4792/Product_Reviews_Samsonite_B_Lite_Spinner_55_Soft_Suitcase.html", "page_rank": 1.3325113e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Samsonite B-Lite Spinner 55 - <em>Soft</em> <em>Suitcase</em> \u00bb Product Reviews - from The", "snippet": "Samsonite, who have incredibly been in business for 100 years, say this is their lightest-ever <em>soft</em>-sided <em>suitcase</em>.

They always pulled by someone a Mafiosi and look like they're probably stuffed with wads of bank notes.\nSo when this arrived for test I tore in to the packaging, unzipped it but sadly there were no bundles of money inside. Instead I found one of the best quality bits of luggage I've yet tested here. This oozes quality. I kicked it around the office and stood on it. Not a dent. I can't break this bag. No wonder there's a five-year guarantee.\nSamsonite, who have incredibly been in business for 100 years, say this is their lightest-ever soft-sided suitcase. And it does seem very light. They say 2.4kg but that sounds like a heavy thing, this feels like not very much.\nYet it's not only sturdy but it's well featured: there's a hard polypropylene frame to the bag keeping the soft sides in a box shape and allowing the aluminium telescopic handles to extend firmly to turn it into a wheely bag. The spoked wheels on the bottom are sturdy plastic things built into moulded corners and they seem to turn very easily in all directions. It's an easy bag to manoeuvre.\nI laughed at hearing that Samsonite test the B-Lite by filling it with stuff then pulling it along - for 35 kms! I wonder whether they've got a machine to test it or if some poor bloke had to walk round the car park 10,000 times pulling it along.\nThe B-Lite comes in four sizes, my one was in the middle of the range, costing \u00a3129. They are available in black, blue or \u2018champagne'. Mine measured a carry-on friendly 37.5x55x20.5 cms and they tell me it can hold 38 litres of stuff.\nInside there's one big and one small zipped mesh pocket, a loose drawstring bag, a criss-cross of luggage straps and it's all in matching light blue satiny fabric. There's one big zipped outside pocket too. There is a top and a side handle integrated into the polyester fabric of the case itself.\nThe only bad bit was the free combination padlock supplied. I couldn't get it to work. It was only plastic and I probably broke it when I was kicking the case around.\nThere's even a mysterious zip in the lining that is very fiddly to open and simply reveals the hard carcase behind the satin. Maybe it's for hiding stuff from customs... or just keeping dirty socks.\nAverage customer rating\n"}, {"score": 1024.8307, "uuid": "40442c27-4b6b-5e5f-a863-3ff55ab72d43", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-39-19089", "target_hostname": "www.tripp.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.tripp.co.uk/new/73-vibrant-lightweight-suitcases", "page_rank": 1.5516516e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Vibrant, lightweight <em>suitcases</em> - Tripp Ltd", "snippet": "o Up to 70% off 2 wheel lightweight <em>suitcase</em> &amp; bag collection o Up to 55% off deconstructed &amp; distinctive lightweight luggage View our special offers and promotions... more info Tripp Glide lite 2W is a comprehensive collection of travel cases, ideal for your break wherever you go <em>or</em> for every day use", "explanation": null, "document": "\u00bb More...\nVibrant, lightweight suitcases\nTripp Glide lite 2W is a comprehensive collection of travel cases, ideal for your break wherever you go or for every day use.\nTripp Glide lite 2W is the perfect accompaniment to the other luggage in the Tripp\u00a0Glite lite range or as a cool casual collection in its own right.

Answering the growing need for professional Windows-based font management, Extensis has updated its award-winning Suitcase product adding both new functionality and Microsoft Vista compatibility.\n\u201cAs creative professionals and designers increasingly utilize the Windows platform, professional-level font management has become a necessity for them,\u201d said Halstead York, Extensis product marketing manager. \u201cExtensis recognizes that whether working alone or in a workgroup, creative professionals need powerful and intuitive font management for their creative workflow.\u201d\n\u201cWe have significantly upgraded the functionality of Suitcase for Windows to offer automatic font activation and deactivation in InDesignCS2, Illustrator CS2 and QuarkXPress 7, a first for the Windows platform,\u201d said York. \u201cDesign and layout professionals juggle hundreds, even thousands of fonts at a time, and Suitcase for Windows is the best way to compare them side-by-side, group them logically, activate and deactivate them, and resolve font conflicts.\u201d\nSuitcase for Windows is the only font manager for Windows with Font Sense\u2122-powered auto-activation plug-ins for key professional layout and illustration applications including Adobe InDesign CS2 and QuarkXPress 7. Font Sense is a proprietary Extensis technology that allows Suitcase to match and automatically activate the exact versions of fonts used in a document, including EPS or PDF file fonts.\nWindows users expect font managers to require manual font activation or to keep all fonts in the Windows/Fonts folder, whether or not they are using a font management utility. Suitcase for Windows with Font Sense\u2122 allows users to automatically activate the right font in key design applications without making compromises. Accidentally using a different version of the same font, or activating a font with the same name but different glyphs could be costly for a creative professional. Suitcase for Windows is the only font manager, which prevents this situation and ensures hassle-free font management. Font Sense\u2122 is available in all Suitcase for Windows plug-ins and allows true font identification within QuarkXPress 7, InDesign CS2, and Illustrator CS2.\nSuitcase for Windows Client for Suitcase Server X1 connects seamlessly with Suitcase Server X1 to ensure consistent font use among workgroup members. Suitcase Server supports both the Windows and Macintosh Suitcase clients, making it an ideal font management solution for both Windows-only and cross-platform workgroups.\nIn addition, Suitcase for Windows users will receive a free copy of Morrison SoftDesign\u2019s Font Doctor for built-in corrupt font detection and repair.\nAbout Suitcase for Windows\nSuitcase for Windows provides industrial-strength font management for desktop and workgroup users running Windows. It features intelligent auto-activation plug-ins (powered by Font Sense\u2122) for popular layout applications and a secure and structured font repository-Font Vault-that eliminates unnecessary duplicates and provides easy access to a user\u2019s font library.\u201d\nPricing and Availability\nEnglish, French and German versions of Suitcase for Windows will be available by download from the Extensis website in February 2007. Suitcase for Windows estimated street price is $99.95US/?59.00/\u20ac79.00. Suitcase for Windows Client for Suitcase Server X1, with an included one-year maintenance agreement can be purchased for an estimated street price of $154.95US/?87.00/\u20ac121.00, with volume license discounts available. In addition, upgrades to Suitcase for Windows are available for an estimated street price of $49.95US for single-user and $79.95US for Suitcase for Windows Client for Suitcase Server X1.\nSystem Requirements\nSuitcase for Windows will support Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista and requires a Pentium 3 or greater, 30 MB of hard disk space and 256 MB of System RAM.\nAbout Extensis\nExtensis is a software solutions company that allows creative workgroups and professionals to streamline their workflow and secure their brand by efficiently and effectively managing their creative assets and fonts. Extensis\u2019 award-winning client/server and desktop products are used by hundreds of Fortune 5000 companies and include Suitcase, Suitcase Fusion, and Font Reserve for font management and Portfolio for creative assets management.

She smiles, a little mischievously.\nThe salmiakki is sour and salty and tastes like the most intense licorice ever. The flavor\u2019s not really unpleasant until I get to the center, where a cache of powder completely overwhelms my taste buds. I\u2019m all for trying new sweets, but my brain is having a hard time categorizing this with butterscotch disks and Jolly Ranchers.\n\u201cSometimes I buy the powder and just stick my finger in,\u201d she says, then tells me that I tried the least intense type (other varieties from this brand, Tyrkisk Peber, include Hot & Sour and Bonfire). I probably should have listened when she told me that Finns don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth. This is my first foray into the world of Finnish cuisine, and it\u2019s already proving to be an eye-opener.\nNext, possibly as a reward for braving the salmiakki, Karoliina has promised to teach me how to make pulla, a traditional Finnish dessert bread, in her kitchen in North Seattle.\nKaroliina moved from Helsinki to Seattle three years ago to be a Visiting Lecturer of Finnish at the University of Washington. \u201cWhen you\u2019re away from home, things that represent home become more important to you,\u201d she says, and in her case, it was the food.\nShe wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Finnish cuisine when she lived there (apparently, the concept of pasta as an easy dinner is universal), but has since started making traditional recipes and integrates Finnish cuisine into her lectures frequently. One of her students\u2019 favorite things to make is pulla.\nThe key to pulla is the cardamom\u2014Finns don\u2019t use the fine powder that\u2019s common here, but choose from different grades of ground seeds depending on what they\u2019re making. (The coarser grinds are generally used to impart flavor for baking; the finer grinds are used for cooking. In either case, look for whole pods of white cardamom or whole seeds, which you can grind at home.)\nThe resulting dough is yeast-based, flecked with cardamom, sweetened with vanilla sugar (granulated sugar with bits of vanilla bean thrown in) and is light and airy. The dough is only the base; from here, there are countless variations on pulla. Today we are making simple filled buns.\nKaroliina expertly kneads the dough a few times and then starts to form rolls. She indents each with a drinking glass and puts a dollop of a quark-based mixture on top of each. Quark, a soft, mild yogurt-cheese with the texture of sour cream, is used frequently in Finnish cooking but is also catching on stateside as a substitute for ricotta. I was surprised to see the brand she used was local, from Appel Farms in Ferndale\u2014it\u2019s available at the bigger QFCs, farmers\u2019 markets and gourmet stores like Whole Foods and PCC.\nIn two, she substitutes a mixture of blueberries, sugar and potato starch for the quark to showcase another traditional preparation. The rolls all now look like bready Danishes. She adds a few previously frozen blueberries from Carnation Farms to the top of each with a flourish (though she holds one up, suspiciously. \u201cThis is the size of a grape in my eyes,\u201d she says, worrying that it will explode in the oven).\nShe then brushes the top with an egg mixture and puts it in to bake. As the pulla is baking, Karoliina and I flip through a Finnish cookbook and she shows me recipes for all the different ways that you can use the dough: braided, rolled into cinnamon rolls, molded into elaborate holiday breads with names like Bishop\u2019s Wig and Sister\u2019s Nose. You can layer it with whipped cream, jam or marzipan. At Christmas, you can color it with saffron and add raisins to it.\nWe also come across images of other Finnish meals, like carrot and rutabaga casserole, beet salad and macaroni casserole made with hamburger meat, onions and noodles. Karoliina explains that the climate of the Northwest is very similar to Finland\u2019s\u2014though, obviously, we\u2019re warmer in the winter\u2014and many of the seasonal fruits and vegetables, like blueberries and rhubarb, are the same.\nShe tells me that a favorite pastime of Finns is berry picking, because of laws that make it legal to pick everywhere. They pick blueberries, lingonberries, currants and cloudberries, which grow in marshes and look like salmonberries. Karoliina defrosts a slice of the dark rye bread she brings back from Finland \u201cby the suitcase\u201d and spreads cloudberry jam on it. I\u2019ve never tried it, but there\u2019s a familiar sweetness to it, almost like apricot. There\u2019s a crunch to it as well from the seeds, which are about the size of a grape seed.\nI ask about Finnish activities in Seattle, and Karoliina tells me that there\u2019s a very active community, usually eclipsed by the larger groups of Norwegians and Swedes. She\u2019s very involved with the Finlandia Foundation, which organizes movie showings on the fourth Wednesday of every mouth at the Swedish Cultural Center in Ballard. There are folk dancing groups, a chorus and a Finnish Lutheran Church. The Nordic Heritage museum often hosts concerts.\nFinns have been in the Northwest since the turn of the 20th century\u2014they came to work in the forest industry and many settled on the peninsula, in places like Aberdeen and Astoria, but many came to the city.\nSoon, the pulla is ready, and all conversation comes to a halt when it\u2019s taken out of the oven. It smells delicious, fragrant with cardamom, and though some of the berries did explode, it looks fantastic.\nWe eat the rolls accompanied by a big glass of milk\u2014Karoliina\u2019s insistence on a Finnish tradition. They are chewy, not particularly sweet but extremely flavorful because of the cardamom\u2014which is perfectly complemented by the blueberries and the quark.\nIt\u2019s a rainy, grey, Seattle kind of day outside, but the warm buns are a perfect antidote; I can understand how they might help one get through a cold, dark winter. I might hesitate before trying salmiakki again, but pulla transcends cultures to become a classic.\nFor our pulla recipe, click here .\nFor whole seeds and pods of cardamom: World Spice\nFor vanilla sugar, salmiakki: Scandinavian Specialties\nFor rye bread and Karoliina-approved licorice:\nContinental Store\nSeattle, WA 98105\n206.523.0606\nEating and drinking is all in a day's work for Anna Roth.

With that in mind, we recently journeyed to the nearby outdoor supplies store determined to find ourselves some backpacks for our upcoming travels.\nAfter spending nearly an hour browsing and trying on the different sizes and types of packs available, a revelation suddenly hit us.\nDo we even need backpacks?\nWe went home and did some serious thinking, quickly\u00a0realizing\u00a0that the answer to our question was a strong and resounding no!\nDespite all the great reasons provided by our Facebook fans as to why backpacks were a better option for them than suitcases, the reasons they provided just didn\u2019t match the requirements for our journey. So when we do depart for Hawaii in under 3 months time, we\u2019ll be wheeling a pair of suitcases behind us.\nAmy's pink suitcase will see more action on our RTW!\nWe\u2019re aware that the whole backpack vs. suitcase debate has been done to death but we still thought it would be worthwhile sharing our reasons for choosing a suitcase instead of a backpack, particularly as it is going against what many of our readers believe.\nA suitcase is easier to pack/unpack\nAlthough we\u2019re traveling as slowly as we can, having easy access to our luggage is important. Not having to rummage through an entire backpack to find what we\u2019re looking for is a big advantage for us!\nWe\u2019re not planning on walking extensively with our luggage\nOur current plans don\u2019t involve hiking (or walking extensively in urban areas for that matter!) with all of our material possessions on us. The plan when arriving in a new city is to drop off our luggage and then go exploring. This obviously plays a big part in our decision to choose a suitcase over a backpack.\nThe destination\nOur first destination had a big impact on our decision. Because we\u2019re starting in the USA, we\u2019re confident that the roads and sidewalks in America can handle our suitcases with wheels. Rough terrain such as gravel roads or cobblestone footpaths will surely be a rarity. Plus, we\u2019re more likely to look like tourists in America if we\u2019re walking around with backpacks than we would with suitcases (at least that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking).\nEasier to handle/no physical\u00a0exertion\nThe last thing we want is for Amy to fall on her back and not be able to get up again, looking just like a turtle! That\u2019s a strong possibility if we\u2019re carrying around backpacks (it\u2019s happened to a friend of ours!) \u2013 so being able to wheel around our luggage is the favorable option until we have a greater need to travel with backpacks.\nWe can always change our mind!\nWhen we do decide where to go after North America, then we can re-assess our options and decide whether to make the switch to backpacks for the next leg of our journey. Perhaps all we need is a visit to REI and we\u2019ll be converted? But that\u2019s a decision for another day.\nWe do understand that there are downsides to taking a suitcase with wheels. There may be occasions where we need to carry our suitcases up stairs but we definitely see this as the exception and not the norm.\u00a0Regardless, I think we\u2019ve made the right decision\u2026 do you?\nDo you travel with a backpack or a suitcase? Share your reasons in the comments and tell us whether you think we\u2019ve made the right decision.\n"}], [{"score": 799.6683, "uuid": "3fd189c6-1814-5623-bf99-df9337adb8b1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0304wb-42-15286", "target_hostname": "www.stephenfry.com", "target_uri": "http://www.stephenfry.com/2008/10/18/a-suitcase-of-cables/", "page_rank": 1.1913049e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "A <em>suitcase</em> of cables \u00ab The New Adventures of Stephen Fry", "snippet": "You wont need a <em>suitcase</em> <em>or</em> a passport I will look after you.

One minute of winding makes for 45 minutes of play, that\u2019s the promise: a big British bargain. The same site has a Freeloader solar charger for \u00a324.95 that will help with juicing up all my gadgets when I\u2019m too hot and knackered to crank.\nI shall also take my iPhone 3G, without which I\u2019m pretty much an empty vessel these days, but I will bring along a collection of sim cards, too, and my unlocked first generation iPhone, which can run on any network, in case there\u2019s a signal that the official iPhone can\u2019t receive. Because they\u2019re so colourful, pretty and neat, I will also pack one of the new iPod Nanos: they combine the old Nano clickwheel and anodised metal finish with a new-style accelerometer, so you can shake it to shuffle songs and turn it sideways to watch music and flick through album covers.\nAs for reading, well, I have a Sony eReader, a Kindle and an Iliad, all dedicated electronic book readers, but the fact is, the iPhone has already proved itself (according to Forbes Magazine) the most popular ebook reader on the market. Nearly half a million people have downloaded the free Stanza application for iPhone (from the iTunes store). Via Stanza files, just about all the classics in prose and poetry can be easily downloaded and read clearly and easily on screen. You can transfer Kindle and pdf files from your desktop, too, so a vast quantity of books and newspapers is available. Electronic books are made (as the name suggests) of electrons, which weigh nothing; whatever one\u2019s view of the feel and qualities of a proper book, when travelling, zero ounces of electron is better than the heavy molecular mass that makes up the real thing.\nFor photography I shall take the Canon 1000D I reviewed the other week, enraging loyal Pentax and Nikon users, for which I apologise: if Canon didn\u2019t exist, I\u2019d be a perfectly happy Nikon/Pentax/Minolta user.

Think what you might wear to a girls\u2019 luncheon. This floral print dress by Shoshanna is great because it\u2019s a step up on the dressiness scale, but still light enough to keep you from drowning in your own sweat as you walk from house to house. As for shoes, while you want to wear a heel, keep it sensible. You\u2019ll still be walking and standing just as much as you did on the previous days, so a wedge is a good option.\nDay 4: Pref Night: Cocktail attire.\nMost girls are going to end up wearing LBDs.

Jan, 2012 by Natalie in Entrepreneurs , Inspiration & Motivation\nTwitter, Facebook and Google + are all awash with questions like `What\u2019s your word of the year for 2012\u2018.\nHere I was thinking I was original, as I posted the question on my Facebook page and got some excellent responses. Then I saw it almost everywhere else and read answers like:\n\u201cMotivation, Flourish, Balance, Success, Persistence, Growth, Authenticity, Believe, Confidence, Passion, Exposure, Direction, Pure, Achieve, Fresh, Discipline, Inspiration and Delegate\u201d\nI don\u2019t know about you, but since the age of ten I\u2019ve come up with a word to signify how I want to play out my year. I\u2019ve gone and told everybody about it and then asked them theirs. It seems nothing\u2019s changed, as I asked this question around the New Year\u2019s eve table of dear friends, and most had not thought about the question at all.\nIf I had probed further (and I would have had the countdown to New Year\u2019s not begun and I\u2019d not been distracted by more champagne), I\u2019m sure I would have found several did not have a plan of action for 2012, an idea of what they really wanted, or even an idea of what they didn\u2019t want.\nI would like to sit with them again on the eve of 2013 and see whether their year worked out better than mine, for not having an idea of what they wanted. Theory and reality on the subject matter leads me to believe that it won\u2019t be. You need purpose to live your life fully and you need to live each day with purpose to have a full life.\nKnowing what you want out of life and aiming towards it daily will ensure you get it. At the very least your life is richer for having dreamed and desired more from it.\nSince I started my blog 2010 was initially the year of Zen - I\u2019m not sure that year fully abided by my word \u2013 or more likely I didn\u2019t as it actually became the year of hustle! But I was more cogniscent of being present and slowing down my frantic pace.\n2011 was the year of freedom. I did manage to achieve a fair amount of that with many excellent results as summed up in my 2011 Annual Review - \u00a0I promise you it\u2019s not like others\u2026.\nThis is me on Karamea Beach setting the intention for the TSE community\nMy theme for 2012 came to me part way through last year. I\u2019m determined that this year will be spectacular \u2013 I mean is there any other way to live your life?\nSteve Jobs didn\u2019t think so otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have regularly been quoted as talking about the fact that we will all die. He wasn\u2019t reminding himself of this fact to be morbid or depressed, he used this as the trigger to live a full life each and every single day!\n2012 Is The Year of Fierce Focus\nYes I went with two words. Just to be different. Actually just to highlight the importance of focus this year. Last year, by all accounts, I achieved a lot. But I also lost out many times, I believe, due to not being focused enough. So I need to get fierce about it.\nIf you look at every single successful entrepreneur or creative, they are 100% unabashedly in love with what they do. They live and breathe it. It\u2019s all they think about day and night. As a result they are consumed by it and, 99% of the time become the master of their craft or business vision.\nThat\u2019s because of their laser like focus on what they do.\nI can safely say I do not YET have that ability. I have had it in the past, like when I focused on becoming a body sculpting champion and getting an 8 pack of abs. That single experience blew me away for reasons I explain here in Four Business Lessons Learned As A Body Sculpting Champion .\nI have used this power in several smaller successful ventures, events or activities through my life with fantastic results. So why oh why do I not apply this daily?\nBecause it\u2019s hard work dammit. It takes guts, sacrifices, fortitude, persistence and dogged determination. Do I sound like Winston Churchill here?\nMy Mission In 2012: \u00a0I am focusing on living my true values of creating freedom in business and adventure in life.\nI am doing this because then I can truly ensure I\u2019m inspiring you to do the same. \u00a0So this requires me to cut out some of the activities in 2011 that took up a lot of my time and energy and didn\u2019t propel me or my business forward (but did teach me a lot).\nI am not superwoman. I cannot do everything and do it extraordinarily well. If I focus on a few very important goals and desires I want to achieve this year then I will be far likelier to achieve them.\nI would like to ask you to do the same \u2013 particularly if, year after year, you make the same old promises to yourself at New Year and continue to break your promise.\n\u201cAny goal worthy of forming a life around will likely involve a determined focus. To keep the\u00a0focus, turn the goal into a series of manageable actions as you go along, with stepping stones of accomplishment you can enjoy along the way.\u201d ~ Chris Guillebeau\nIn order to adapt to fierce focus and implement it immediately I\u2019ve dramatically reduced my goals for 2012. I used to focus on 8 areas of my life and create 1-2 goals for each including health, giving, financial, relationships, business and personal.\nI\u2019ve decided this is the path to overwhelm and failure.\nThe Suitcase Entrepreneur Word Cloud for 2012\nMy 2012 Legacy Objectives\nRather than focus on just setting goals and achieving them, I think it\u2019s far more important to focus on living a fulfilling life that impacts others, and on leaving a legacy to impact 10,000 entrepreneurs by 2014 to create their own freedom based business and adventure-filled life.\nSo here are my fiercely focused Legacy Objectives (aka goals) for 2012 that will help me to step closer to my legacy:\nWrite my Suitcase Entrepreneur book proposal before March 1st \u00a0and get a book contract\nBike 6,445km in Africa from March 12th and raise $10K for \u00a0Women Win\nMove to Europe for summer and become fluent in German\nAchieve a 6 figure launch of WE Mastermind, creating more women-owned businesses\nGrow my business and social media coaching client base by 30%\nSo what\u2019s your word in 2012?\n"}, {"score": 724.9171, "uuid": "1a237151-f624-5d66-a15d-64c76f495ed4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0304wb-45-30380", "target_hostname": "www.tripp.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.tripp.co.uk/new/68-lightweight-soft-case-bag-collection", "page_rank": 1.1724427e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Bright lightweight <em>soft</em> case collection - Tripp Ltd", "snippet": "Click here to view the Tripp Express Rainforest collection <em>or</em> here for all Tripp products.

Annual Performance Reviews Simplified!\nHard Rock Customer Service Crumbles\nIn an economic time when a customer is your most valuable asset, bad customer service is like a cancer.\u00a0 If a manager at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Atlantic City is representative of the health of that business, then that restaurant's prognosis is terminal. (But thanks to the intervention of the assistant manager Todd following my post on Hard Rock's Facebook Wall , it looks like the restaurant might be on road to customer service recovery. More on that in a future post. )\nDuring our dinner this past Saturday, my wife's purse was stolen...or at least that's what one restaurant guest attempted to do. Thanks to a very observant and quick thinking young man at the next table, my wife's purse was retrieved intact.\nThe tables were very close together.\u00a0 A middle age couple apparently squeezed between the tables.\u00a0 We didn't think anything about it because customers and wait staff were doing it all the time. But the would-be thief managed to kick the purse out into a clear spot where she could bend over to pick it up.\u00a0\u00a0 Fortunately the young man at the next table observed the woman carrying two purses.\u00a0 He bent over and asked my wife if she had had a purse on the floor.\u00a0 When she noticed it was missing, the young man in his late 30s or early 40s ran after the woman.\u00a0 My wife followed and I followed her.\nOur friends at the table notified the waitress, who in turn notified the manager.\u00a0 The manager supposedly called security and police but neither ever showed up.\u00a0 After a short run down the boardwalk, we confronted the woman who acted like she didn't know she was carrying this second purse.\u00a0 Of course, my wife's purse looked like a suitcase compared to the other one she was holding so an innocent mistake wasn't likely.\u00a0 She handed the purse back with all the contents intact but still no police or security.\u00a0 She and her friend took off and we returned to the restaurant.\nNever did security or the police or the manager ever come to our table to follow-up or apologize for the inconvenience.\u00a0 Worse, no one from the restaurant even thanked the young man.\u00a0\u00a0 We notified the waitress that we wanted to pick up the couple's check.\u00a0 She seemed surprised we would offer to do that.\u00a0 I'll notch it up to youth and lack of experience in these matters, but one might think that a staff with good customer service skills and training might report that to the manager and suggest the restaurant might want to do something for their customer \"hero.\"\u00a0 But no, they just ignored it.\nFollowing the return of the purse, we resumed our dinner and for the next 45 minutes waited for security or the manager to visit.\u00a0 Nothing, nada, not a peep.\u00a0 Before leaving the restaurant, we asked to speak with the manager. She told us that \"we handled the situation well and thought we wanted to keep it private.\"\u00a0 Yea, right.\u00a0 When we told her that we paid for the guests' dinner who chased down the thief, she told us, \"she would have offered to pay for their drinks, but not their dinner.\"\u00a0 Of course, she did neither and didn't bother to reimburse us either.\nIn the next post early next week, I'll highlight a few of the lessons a business like Hard Rock Cafe can learn from our customer service experience.\nWorkforce Trends\nA recent post on the Term Life Insurance Blog provided a nice graphic citing that 1 in 31 Americans (10 million) worked 60+ hours a week last year. That's 200 more hours per person worked compared to 1970.\nGood Customer Service Skills Are No Accident\nCaring about a customer is an expression of an internal value more than reading a script.

Answering the growing need for professional Windows-based font management, Extensis has updated its award-winning Suitcase product adding both new functionality and compatibility for Windows Vista.\n\u201cWindows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system create a platform for next generation user experiences, and we are excited to see the industry come together like never before around these products,\u201d said Rob Bernard, general manager of the Worldwide ISV Group at Microsoft. \u201cBy working closely with industry partners such as Extensis, we are able to give creative professionals worldwide an experience that is easier, safer, and more productive whether they are at work or on the go.\u201d\nSuitcase for Windows is the only font manager for Windows with Font Sense\u2122-powered auto-activation plug-ins for key professional layout and illustration applications including Adobe InDesign CS2, Illustrator CS2 and QuarkXPress 7.

It says the U.S. project is aimed at gathering information about Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran and Syria, and providing \"soft\" help to subversive and opposition groups.\n\u201cAccessing information is the main and most important method used by the enemies of the establishment,\" it writes. \"This issue is of such importance that the enemies of the Islamic republic are ready, in order to access the information\u00a0 they need, to abuse information and help the spread of false information that is in line with their aims, to invest heavily in this area, and carry out costly projects.\"\nIranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi has also reacted to the \"Internet in a Suitcase\" project, saying the Islamic republic has ways for countering it, without providing details.\nSpeaking in Tehran on June 29 , Moslehi said that since the \"sedition\" -- the mass protests that followed Iran's disputed June 2009 presidential vote -- the United States, the intelligence services of U.S. allies, and other countries in the region have made \"heavy investments\" in cyberspace.\n\"[U.S. President Barack] Obama admitted several times, in Congress and elsewhere, that the cyberwars he has carried out against us have not succeeded. He has admitted defeat. We had foreseen in advance the steps they are taking in cyberspace \u2013 for example, the 'Internet in a Suitcase' that they have hyped so much -- and we have ways to counter it,\" Moslehi said in an interview with Iranian state television.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry has also warned about the effort and says it could lead to a backlash against the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said on June 14 that Internet-savvy Muslims in the region could strike back against the United States.\n-- Golnaz Esfandiari\n"}, {"score": 677.04144, "uuid": "134a3b8d-23e2-5d00-987e-157f32648dce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-58-26115", "target_hostname": "millerwelds.com", "target_uri": "http://millerwelds.com/resources/articles/FCAW-structural-steel-apex-steel", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Miller - <em>SuitCase</em>\u2122 X-TREME\u2122 12VS Wire Feeder Improves Flux Cored Welding", "snippet": "We run them pretty <em>hard</em> for welding with 5&#x2F;64th wire.\u201d To run larger, \u201c<em>hard</em> to ignite\u201d wires, Miller incorporated a \u201c<em>Soft</em> Start\u201d feature.

Unfortunately, competitive portable feeders and Miller\u2019s earlier models of voltage-sensing feeders lacked the higher output and duty cycle requirements to compete with sled-style feeders.\u00a0 The design of these feeders also left room for reliability and serviceability improvements.\nThe 35-lb. weight (empty) of this portable suitcase wire feeder allows this Apex Steel Ironworker to quickly move along the decking on floor 9 of Lincoln Center. Sled-style feeders do not move as easily.\nExtreme Redesign\nWhen designing an \u201cX-TREME\u201d model feeder, Miller first sought to understand the market needs, soliciting feedback from the Ironworkers, small and larger contractors and companies such as Pacific Welding Supply/Tec Welding Sales. Their key requirements were:\nMore output to run larger wires\nEasier to service and maintain\nSuperior durability and reliability\nAt the heart of the SuitCase X-TREME 12VS is a contactor rated for an output of a 450-amps at 60 percent duty cycle (a contactor is an electrical relay used to control the flow of power. Used for safety reasons, it keeps the gun \u201celectrically cold\u201d until the gun trigger is pressed, yet keeps the feeder powered up).\n\u201cOur job is to make sure clients have equipment that allows them to be competitive in their markets,\u201d explained John Powers, outside sales representative for Pacific Welding Supplies/Tec Welding Sales. \u201cApex Steel needed to be able to run large diameter E70T-6 and E71T-8 wire. The Suitcase X-TREME 12VS leveled the playing field. Now they can remain productive and competitive on their welding costs.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to use reliable, portable equipment like the SuitCase X-TREME 12VS feeder,\u201d says Kevin Koester, Apex Steel founder and president. \u201cGood time management makes or breaks a steel erector.\u201d\nKoester adds, \u201cOn the Lincoln Square project, we paired the X-TREME feeders with Miller\u2019s gas drives (the Trailblazer 275 engine-driven welding generator). They peak out at about 300 amps, which is a lot of power for a small gas drive. We run them pretty hard for welding with 5/64th wire.\u201d\nTo run larger, \u201chard to ignite\u201d wires, Miller incorporated a \u201cSoft Start\u201d feature. Standard run-in speed is 50 percent of the wire feed speed while welding. The Soft Start function, controlled by an easily accessible switch, slows run-in speed to 20 percent of welding speed. Soft Start gives the arc more time to become established and prevents the wire from stubbing into the weldment, a common problem with larger wires.\nEasy to Service\n\"Improved performance\u201d means something entirely different to a service technician like Todd Hildebrand from Pacific Welding Supplies/Tec Welding Sales. While the SuitCase feeder is tough, job site accidents do happen.\n\u201cIf we have to replace something like a damaged case\u2014and we did, because one customer melted one\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes and one tool, a 5/16-in. nut runner,\u201d says Hildebrand. \u201cThe SuitCase X-TREME is great from a servicing standpoint. Its chassis design\u2014where all internal components lift out on a chassis\u2014means we can replace the case in a quarter hour. With some of the competition\u2019s feeders, a case change is a half-day job.\u201d\nEase-of-service is important because Pacific Welding Supplies/Tec Welding Sales runs a very thorough service check on all equipment when it comes in off of rent, as well as before it goes out again.\nService checks on wire feeders include inspecting common wear items like drive rolls, gun cables and liners, as well as weld test and load test them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fire up feeders and welders to make sure they work in the customer\u2019s application,\u201d says Hildebrand. \u201cWhen our equipment hits their site, it\u2019s ready to weld without failure. Contractors generally don\u2019t shop on price alone. To them, prompt service, trust and reliable equipment means much more.\u201d\nThe Trailblazer 275 welding generator provides 275 amps of flux cored welding output and fits into compact spaces, such as this hallway on the Lincoln Center project, At right is Robert Mecham, Apex Steel, Ironworkers Local 86 and John Powers, outside sales representative, Pacific Welding Supply/Tec Welding Sales.\nThe Ironworker Test\nConfident in the performance and capability of the SuitCase X-TREME 12VS\u2014especially because they helped design it\u2014Pacific Welding Supplies/Tec Welding Sales first introduced Koester and his lead man to the feeder at their Auburn facility.\n\u201cWe had them weld at 425 amps, and their lights just went off. They had never seen such power from a regular production-model feeder,\u201d says Powers. \u201cApex Steel was ready to weld with the X-TREME because it put them on a level playing field with their competition.\u201d\nHowever, Apex Steel can only remain competitive if equipment functions reliably.\n\u201cA construction environment is inherently tough on equipment, and Ironworkers aren\u2019t exactly known for being gentle,\u201d says Koester.\nThe SuitCase X-TREME features a rugged polypropylene case, which the military uses to protect computers and other electronic equipment. Not only can the case withstand normal construction use, it can even withstand being run over by a one-ton pick-up truck (a test that literally crushes competitive portable feeders and sled-style feeders).\n\u201cSlide rails\u201d along one side of the case allow the feeder to be dragged by the gun or power cable without damaging the case or causing dirt to pile up on control panel (while dragging a feeder by the gun or cable is not a recommended practice, it happens).\nInside the feeder\u2019s case, the main circuit board is trayed and potted with a highly resilient epoxy, and all of the connectors are coated with electrical grease. This makes the feeder as impervious as possible to water, corrosion, metal shavings, dust and other elements that commonly cause failures in other feeders.\n\u201cThe SuitCase X-TREME 12VS could fall off a truck and roll into a water-filled ditch. As long as it didn\u2019t sit there too long,\u201d says Powers, \u201cyou could pull it out and it would work just fine.\u201d Powers isn\u2019t about to risk recommending mediocre equipment because he is extremely aware of how important uptime is to Apex Steel.\n\u201cTime is a huge factor. That\u2019s where a steel erector can make it or break it as a company,\u201d says Koester. \u201cIf welding equipment breaks down, that can cause another remobilization of tools, manpower and work preparation at a new location. On a job like this, the labor costs alone are about $85 to $90 per man, per hour. That\u2019s why we need to use reliable equipment like the SuitCase X-TREME.

Y\nou\u2019re Dan Connors, the editor of Catholic Digest!\u201d I smiled and shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Ted,\u201d he said. \"So\nyou put this whole trip together for us.\u201d\nNo, I replied, much smarter and far more experienced people than I had arranged this Catholic Digest pilgrimage to Fatima. I was along as a fellow pilgrim to pray with and spend time with some Catholic Digest readers.\nTed was full of questions about the trip and about Catholic Digest, and we stood in the aisle of that jumbo jet and talked for over two hours. He told me about his work, and his wife, Mary, and their life together, and what had drawn them to respond to the Catholic Digest ad for this pilgrimage. I told him how I had come to Catholic Digest, what I had done before, and how this was my first trip to Fatima \u2014 as it was for him and Mary.\nTalking to Ted made the flight go faster, and Ted and Mary and I spent a lot of time together over the next week. We talked together, ate together, laughed together, and prayed together. Their love for the Blessed Mother was very strong, and I smiled happily at their excitement and humility when they were chosen to lead a decade of the Rosary\nat the evening procession at the shrine. Over that week I grew to know them, like them, and love them.\nI have, however, not yet grown to love their luggage, which increases with every visit. The last few years\n,\nwe\u2019ve walked to a restaurant near the train station because my car was too full of bags to carry us anywhere. Last year my small station wagon was so full that I had to squeeze in around the suitcases to drive it to a parking place. So when Ted joked about 14,000 suitcases, I feared the worst.\nI mentioned this to Bret Thomas, our CEO, on the\nmorning of Ted and Mary\u2019s arrival, and he generously offered to provide his car for luggage storage. \u201cJust give me a call,\u201d he said.\nRelieved to have a backup, I drove down to the station and was lucky to get a parking space near the platform. I heard the train horn blow in the distance and hurried to the tracks, wondering at which end of the train they might be riding. I was about to head in what would have been the wrong direction when I spied our stationmaster wheeling a large, empty luggage cart the other way. \u201cHi,\u201d I said as I fell into step beside him.\n\u201cThis cart must be for my friends.\u201d\nThe stationmaster had no time for pleasantries. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the guy\u2019s been in the military! Hasn\u2019t he ever heard of packing light?\u201d\nI said nothing else, and stepped back as the train arrived. The door slid open\n,\nand the conductor asked the crowd waiting to board to step back, please. Then a suitcase came shooting out of the train door. \u201cHey!\u201d cried Ted from behind the next bag.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Dan Connors! Hello\n,\nDan Connors!\u201d\nIt was my five seconds of celebrity. Everybody waiting to board turned to look at me, wondering who Dan Connors was and why his presence was being announced from inside the train. Their wonderment soon turned to annoyance, however, as another suitcase and then another kept sliding onto the platform. Suitcases, tote bags, they just kept coming.\u00a0 And people began turning to look at me. Evidently, Dan Connors has a great deal of luggage and likes to delay people trying to get on the train!\nI smiled meekly. I\u2019m just here to meet them, I wanted to say, but thought it best just to step back a bit.\nAfter several more bags, Mary came out pushing a baby stroller. She hugged me and then hurried back to help Ted and the stationmaster load the baggage cart. Wanting to stay as far from the bags as possible, I looked down at the beautiful 2-year-old who looked up at me. \u201cHello, Mister Dan!\u201d she said in a sweet, soft voice. And then as the train pulled away\n,\nshe waved to it and said, \u201cBye-bye\n,\nWho cares about suitcases? I stooped\nand smiled at Anna Maria.\n\u201cHello, Anna Maria, welcome to New London,\" I said.\nI asked her how her train ride had been. She smiled. \u201cBye-bye, choo-choo!\u201d she repeated.\nA few feet away, the stationmaster had finally managed to get most of the luggage on the dangerously overloaded cart and was trying to wheel it down the ramp, but it crashed into the railing and got stuck. Ted, Mary, and I started running relays from the stuck cart over to my car, while Anna Maria sat slightly to the side supervising the operation. With the back seats down, the storage space in my car seemed huge, but bag after bag filled it almost to the top. The front passenger seat and floor were next, and then the driver\u2019s seat, with a briefcase and bag on the floor in front of the brake pedal. That was the end of it. The door just managed to close. Relieved, I called Bret and cancelled the backup, and then I escorted my friends up the hill toward the diner.\nFor the next three hours I had no thoughts or anxiety about luggage. I was back with my friends talking about our families, our jobs, our world, our faith. Mary told me of caring for Ted\u2019s mom, the banking industry she used to work in, and their trips here and there. Ted told me how he\u2019s gotten so serious about practicing piano that he actually has his first gig coming up. But this year much of our conversation revolved around their new daughter, Anna Maria. Every year during their visit, Ted and Mary had expressed their dream, hope, and prayer to adopt a child. They worried about being seen as a bit too old, but were content to leave that in God\u2019s hands. They are a loving couple with a lot of love to share, and I too prayed that their dream might come true.\nAnd then, in the past year came the call, and a quickly arranged flight to China, where they met and fell in love with their little girl. Like many girls in China, Anna Maria had had a difficult life before Ted and Mary. She had been found abandoned on the streets at birth, and survived a hard life in an orphanage until her adoption. Ted and Mary feel lucky that their baby girl survived to be born at all, and doubly lucky and blessed to have their daughter. Proud parents, they showed me photos of Anna Maria\u2019s baptism and spoke hopefully of how her health and personality have both blossomed since her time in the orphanage. For her part, Anna Maria spent her lunch eating small pieces of turkey, quietly practicing her pronunciation of \u201cno\u201d \u2014 the number-one word in the two-year-old\u2019s official lexicon \u2014 and taking photos with my cell phone, which she commandeered immediately and seemed to master very quickly. She also found her way into my phone contact list and kept trying to call people, while I spent my time trying to talk with Ted and Mary while continuously hitting the \u201cend call\u201d button.\nThe time came to head back to the station. We took a few things out of the car so that I could drive it up to an illegal parking spot even closer to the tracks. As I watched for police, we ran our relay unloading bag after bag while Anna Maria, tired from her photography work, gently settled down in her stroller for a nap.\nWith all the bags up on the platform, we waited for the train, spending a last few cherished moments together. A conductor getting on in New London walked up to the luggage pile, looked at it in disbelief, and said, \u201cHow many of you are you getting on?\u201d\n\"Just the two of them and the baby,\u201d I replied.\nTed and Mary smiled at the conductor, who was still gazing at the bags. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a two-bag limit per person.\u201d\n\u201cOh\nis there?\u201d said Ted, acting genuinely surprised.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re not flying,\u201d said the conductor.\u00a0 \"They\n\u2019d charge you a fortune for all this.\u201d Ted, who loves trains and would take them anywhere, admitted that was true.\nAs the conductor walked away, Mary said, \u201cWe should pack lighter next year.\u201d\n\u201cMy love,\u201d said Ted gently and penitently, \u201cisn\u2019t that what we said last year?\u201d\nThe train pulled in. The door that opened was not the one where we had placed the bags. I jumped into action, running bags to the door where Ted grabbed them and tossed them on the train. I ran back for more, and then more and then more. We got them on, the baffled conductor shook his head one last time, and as the train began to move, I heard Ted\u2019s loud voice call out, \u201cBye\n,\nDan Connors! See you next year\n,\nDan Connors!\u201d I stood wheezing on the platform and raised my hand to wave goodbye.\nAs I walked back to my car, I realized that despite my luggage anxieties and feeling that I hauled enough of it to qualify for a Teamster\u2019s card, I had taken great delight in their visit and in the joy they shared with me. Exhausted as I was, I was very sorry to see them go. I realized what a boost they had given to my outlook and my faith. They take such exuberant joy in living life \u2014 whether it involves praying for a daughter or over-packing for a week away. Their faith is strong and simple, but not na\u00efve. They\u2019ve both had more than their share of suffering and putting things on hold to care for others. But they feel God guiding their lives, and they express their gratitude to God with almost every breath.\nThe world is full of Teds and Marys and Anna Marias. Their annual visit reminded me to pay more attention to the people like them who surround me every day, and who remind me, in little ways,\nthat faith and love and caring for one another are always more important than the two-bag limits we often see around us.\nI\u2019m looking forward to their visit next year \u2014 even if I have to rent a truck.\nWho are the people in your life who refresh your outlook and bolster your faith? Please write and tell me. I\u2019d love to hear from you.\n-Dan\nEditorial Director Dan Connors\nDan is currently Editorial Director at Bayard, Inc.

The message was so full of her lively spirit that I found myself wanting to do more than just delete it, so I printed it out and posted it on the refrigerator. It\u0092ll be safe there until it gets greasy and/or crumply, at which point I\u0092ll probably feel foolish for having kept it, and will throw it away.\nIt started me thinking, however, about how ephemeral our email contacts are, especially those family messages that tend to be short and to the point. When our ancestors sat down to write letters, they didn\u0092t just communicate for the present: they created tangible witness to history.\nThis thought was occasioned by a bundle of letters I found in my mother\u0092s things after her death. They were neatly folded and tied with an old tape measure, the letters a real treasure trove dating to the mid-1800\u0092s. At that time Wisconsin was a pretty raw, new state. The letters are from and to my great grandparents, Charles Sheffield Kelsey and Lucretia Parsons Bacon Kelsey, and were saved by relatives who passed them along to the Kelsey children, who gave them to my mother, and thence to me.\nThe letters give a vivid glimpse into how different a woman\u0092s life was, in the mid-nineteenth century, but they are also testimony to the universality of human relations. For instance, here are some bits of letters written by Lucretia and others. The first comes after a visit to her parent\u0092s house in Perry, NY, before they started west: (the bold-face parenthetical remarks are mine)\nRochester, 6/21/1852:\nWe were safe at home a short time after we left Bergen. Winfield (9 mos. old) enjoyed the ride on the cars much better than the first one although it was so warm he got a little out of patience. I found the house looking as well as could be expected, all things considered, although I was persuaded that I had been out of it plenty long enough. And furthermore, when I tried to work, I found that the baby had been to Grandpa\u0092s long enough. He squalled all the time he wasn\u0092t held and part of the time he was ... But he is getting considerably over it now.\nIn 1853, they left for Wisconsin. By then, they had another son, Otto, b. 11/11/1852.\nRacine, Wisc. 9/3/1853:\nOur household affairs are so much in a heap that I won\u0092t describe them. I believe we prosper in this strange land as well as could be expected. I thought when we landed I was not very tired, but in a week I found out that I was...I suppose it is not yet time to send hair (as in a lock of baby hair) as you have seen the children\u0092s heads so lately... They improve, however strangely. Otto has got one corner of an upper tooth in sight. He hides behind every old string or paper he can find, besides getting awful wrathy at me for working so much, etc. etc. (I remember my own youngest, 9 months old in 1970, when we, too moved: He cried every afternoon from 4 to 7, for three or four months!)\n(Lucretia to her parents)\nRacine, Oct. 2, 1853\n... Winfield is recovering from an attack of the croup. He feels pretty well most of the time but coughs some yet. He routed us and set us to work and after the doctor in a hurry Friday morning, but was better in a few hours. Otto has been rather out of order nearly ever since we have been here. I presume it is nothing more than teething. But with the two, I do an enormous amount of work...\n(to her sister, Ann)\nRacine, Jan 29, 1854\nFor the last month I have looked daily for some news from the sick and well folks of Perry, and if I could be sure where the fault was I think I should gratify myself by being quite wrathy. But in these days of Eire wars, and the other mail detentions, you stand a better chance than you otherwise would... (and ending the letter): If you haven\u0092t written when you get this, sit down immediately and answer it or you will catch it. I don\u0092t know how, but I can vent my spite somehow, but just now I shall try my skill at going to bed and to sleep just as all the rest are doing.\n"}, {"score": 613.22144, "uuid": "0da5491f-5f12-51de-9f32-1f92fbf9bea1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-35-13806", "target_hostname": "www.tripp.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.tripp.co.uk/offers/52-up-to-65-off-soft-vibrant-print-cases-bags", "page_rank": 1.3506539e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Up to 65% off <em>soft</em>, vibrant print cases &amp; bags - Tripp Ltd", "snippet": "o Up to 70% off 2 wheel lightweight <em>suitcase</em> &amp; bag collection o Up to 45% off great value <em>hard</em> 2 wheel <em>suitcases</em> View our special offers and promotions... more info * \u00bb Up to 70% off 2 wheel lightweight <em>suitcase</em> &amp; bag collection * \u00bb Up to 45% off great value <em>hard</em> 2 wheel <em>suitcases</em> Save up to 65% on Tripp", "explanation": null, "document": "\u00bb More...\nUp to 65% off soft, vibrant print cases & bags\nSave up to 65% on Tripp Express Rain Forest , this collection has an eye catching design which is sure to make you feel like you are on vacation.

Today our steeds and needs have changed, and our bags have grown appropriately. We like our stuff more than ever, and we like to take as much of it along as possible when we are on our motorcycles. We've got the necessities: rain suit, wrenches, flat fix and duct tape. We've got our essentials: clothing, toiletries, comely shoes and helmet-hair-hiding hat. We've got our basics: camera, film, binoculars, cell phone, palm-top computer, global positioning receiver...\nEven the most conservative packer can find fodder enough to fill a set of saddlebags when heading out for more than a day ride, and you've got lots of choices. You can spend the big bucks on custom hard bags, which look nice, but if you have a pack attack or carry a passenger you may wish for something a little more pliable. They'll also get banged up if your bike gets a little tipsy, whereas soft bags will actually cushion the fall somewhat. The soft side leaves you with a choice of leather, wannabe leather and synthetic fabric luggage.\nCowhide is the fashionable choice, and if it's been properly treated and maintained it can stand up fairly well to most weather, though it probably won't protect your gear from it. However, if you're simply a fan of leather for its practical and natural properties, you'll be hard-pressed to find any motorcycle saddlebags that aren't laden with doo-dads (like conchos and fringe) or that use functional closures (like quality zippers and fasteners). Leather bags are going to be pricey, too. Enter the looks-like-leather set. One would guess that's why this breed of bag exists, solely as a price option to the real thing. That may be viable, but you lose that real-leather smell.\nMost soft saddlebags can be...\nread full caption\nMost soft saddlebags can be removed in seconds and reinstalled almost as fast, once they are adjusted to fit your motorcycle.\nSo let's take a look at the most functional and best-selling approach to motorcycle luggage: the synthetic textiles. Most of the luggage in this category is constructed of some form of nylon, most often Cordura. Nylon, depending on its thread thickness, or denier, offers superior strength, elasticity and durability over animal hide. And, when it's coated with something like polyurethane, it becomes virtually watertight.\nWhen shopping the man-made materials market, here are a few clues. The number preceding denier applies to the thickness of the thread used. The thicker the thread the more tensile strength you'll get. Ballistic nylon, for example, is a 1050-denier nylon and one of the toughest on the market. A weave in the high numbers is going to be stiffer, so your bags will hold their shape and be more durable. However, a 250-denier will offer great compactibility and a lighter weight, which is ideal for expandable bags. And obviously we're talking about breaking baubles here, not bones, so if you take a spill the thickness may not be fundamental. For rain protection the saddlebag's sealant and closure design are the primary protection factors.\nSaddlebag supports keep saddlebags...\nread full caption\nSaddlebag supports keep saddlebags out of your motorcycle's wheels and brakes and keep them from rubbing the paint. This one is from Cobra ( www.CobraUSA.com ),which supplies them for many cruiser models.\nAlso, keep in mind that any weight of nylon will melt when exposed to heat. All the bags in this guide offer some degree of adjustment to keep them away from the exhaust system. Most use some sort of cinching system over the seat to raise or lower the height at which the ride, and a few include step adjustments on the bags themselves for fine-tuning. You'll also see the occasional exhaust guard, which gives you no excuse for letting your bags dangle on the pipes. Even if you don't lose your underpants on the interstate, you'll end up with a mess on your tail pipe. And more importantly, low-riding bags tend to creep into the fender well, at the minimum interfering with suspension travel, if not causing a major spill when they catch in the rear wheel.\nWe strongly recommend that, if your cruiser doesn't already have them, you should add some aftermarket saddlebag stays designed specifically for your model. These inexpensive, easy to install accessories will keep your bags looking tidy on the bike and might help you avoid disaster.\nLastly, take a good look at the bag's mounting system. Although the dozen we've featured here are all of the throw-over variety, each has a unique anchoring system. For example, some secure fore and aft, which is best from a safety standpoint. Others will offer conveniences like receiving mechanisms that can be left on the bike for effortless removal and reapplication. Such details will look mighty important if you find yourself picking up your dirty ditties along the roadside or untying knots in a freezing downpour.\nEditor's note: Since this evaluation was completed in 1998, many of the saddlebags have evolved or been replaced. At least one of the companies has apparently left the market. We are preparing a similar guide for the December 2003 issue of Motorcycle Cruiser (on sale on November).\nChase Harper European Tour Saddlebags $190\n12Hx14.5Lx8W -- 33.25 qt. ea.-- 2 anchor pts/bag -- 2 ext. pockets ea.\nThese extra-large capacity bags are able to retain an enormous amount of gear. The main compartment alone will hold up to 23.75 quarts (imagine one full-face helmet and a half-dozen rainsuits). The large side pockets, at seven and one-half quarts, will hold sizable extras like winter gloves or an electric vest. Overall, each bag encloses roughly 33.25 quarts, including a small removable pocket (two quarts) for your valuables. The bags are made from mid-weight Cordura, and are sealed on the inside for water-tightness. Attachments to the bike include nylon-strap loops for the rear footpegs, or a frame tube with quick-release action so they can be left on the bike. Another strap clips around the tail. Chase Harper incorporates hard plastic into the bottom and upswept front of this bag for stability and protection. They also provide removable plastic exhaust guards. Further niceties include: a soft nylon backing to protect against scuffing; dual-zippered, top-opening access; rain flaps and double nylon handles joined by wraparound leather for easy carrying -- all for around $190.\nDry Bag Saddlebags $167\n10Hx15.3Lx8W -- 22.5 qt. ea. -- 2 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nThere's nothing normal about these bags offered by Riderwearhouse. This catalog is known for its eccentric yet extremely efficient offerings. So if you dare to be different, the Dry Bags will undoubtedly live up to their name. After all, they are made from a pliable non-porous plastic and lined with Cordura, which rolls closed like a paper sack and secures by looping and locking the double-duty carrying strap beneath the bags. If that sounds ticklish, wait until you install the hard plastic \"bag stiffeners.\" If Ikea sold soft luggage, this would be it. The directions are universal language illustrations and even come with their own ingenious little tool. Attachment is made around the rear and at the footpegs using quick-release buckles on nylon straps. These bags are expandable, thanks to their unusual roll-down top closure, and feature a hard plastic backing that faces soft foam to the bike. Available through mail order for $167.\nEclipse Dodge Slant Cruiser Bags $219\n12Hx16Lx6.3W -- 18 qt. ea. -- 2 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nIt's true the Dodge bags use both real leather (for straps and trim) and imitation leather (top flap), but since the bulk of their construction is comprised of nylon they are included in this comparison. The leather and chrome-endowed styling is merely a facade for these highly functional, compact bags. Under the fold-over flap waits a dual-zippered Cordura flap, which seals at the end with a hook-and-loop fastener. The bags offer a rigid inner support panel toward the bike and softer support panels on each end. Nylon lines the bags, and a secret stash pocket is incorporated under the top flap. A soft tricot mesh is used on the outer bag facing the bike as well as under the wide seat yoke. This system looks good but requires undue fiddling to adjust and make the bags even. Also a bit different than the others, Dodge bags require that your bike have saddlebag support frames for proper attachment via straps on the bag's inner sides. If you're looking for a functional bag that's undeniably cruiseresque, the Dodge Slants, at $219, may be for you.\nHondaline Saddlebags $167\n11.5Hx14Lx 7.5W -- 20.3 qt. ea. -- 2 anchor pts/bag -- no ext pockets\nThis simple design of nylon, foam panels and PVC lining appears to offer 100 percent water protection. The top opens wide like a paper bag, then seals using a full-length swatch of hook-and-loop fastening material, finally folding over to secure with dual, adjustable quick-release clips. Two hints that they are made by a motorcycle manufacturer are the huge, hard-to-remove warning labels in each bag and a chunky-looking red reflector on their upper rear corner. It's such an odd choice, it makes you wonder if Honda simply had some leftover reflectors from a previous bike model. Luckily, the reflectors detach with a flick of a screwdriver and could be replaced with something more sedate, like a swatch of Scotchlite. The bags attach to the bike using a nylon strip around the rear pegs, which tightens by pulling a nylon cord up through the bag's backing and secures at the desired tautness using a Fastex lock. We wondered how secure this would be and were informed by Honda that it's good to go, and they've never heard of a single problem. The overall clean design of these bags is easy to appreciate. They're also easy to pack and carry, making them a good buy.\nMotoline Duo Saddlebags $99\n13Hx15.5Lx6-11W -- 35.2 qt. ea. -- 4 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nHere's a set of bags offering extreme expandability for a small price. They can go from a slim six inches in width to a maximum of 11 inches; so shopping for small furniture along the way is no longer a problem. Both of these lightweight nylon bags have an inner bag that closes with a drawstring to, perhaps, separate your dirty duds or isolate your rain-saturated gear. The wide yoke across the rear seat is backed by hook-and-loop fastening material for height adjustment. The bags secure to the bike using a wraparound rear nylon strap, and straps to the rear footpeg area. Additional nylon straps encompass the entire bag, adjusting to accommodate varying load dimensions and closing with heavy-duty, quick-release buckles. These straps could also be laced through saddlebag supports for additional security. Other features include a firm support panel in the bag's inner wall and reflective tape facing the road. For a mere $99, these bags are available in black or black/red.\nOSI Deluxe Nylon Saddlebags $145\n12Hx16Lx7W -- 30.5 qt. ea. -- 4 anchor pts./bag -- 2 ext. pocket ea.\nThese large Cordura bags are loaded with functional features. They open at the top with a three-sided zipper covered with thick, shoebox-style rain flaps. There's one large (six quarts) external pocket and a removable pocket in front (two quarts). Each zipper has a nylon tab for easier pull-action when you're wearing gloves. The large, main compartments of the bags are lined with nylon and incorporate stiff plastic from back to upswept front, with flexible foam support in the side walls. There are four detachable anchor points, making these bags one of the more efficient models as far as safety and convenience are concerned. A Scotchlite strip wraps around three sides of the bags and rugged Cordura handles allow for easy transport. For $145, these deluxe saddlebags come in black, or purple and black.\nRev-Pack Deluxe Saddle Packs $155\n11.5Hx13Lx8W -- 15 qt. ea. -- 2 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nJim and Robin Reveley's bags have come a long way since the days they were stitched in a barn as a side job to running a motorcycle campground -- The Songdog Ranch -- in New Cuyama, California. Great thought was obviously put into the design and detail of their Saddle Packs and the result is a clean and classic look. They're constructed of heavy urethane-coated Cordura and lined with sealed nylon. Foam placed in between the two plies adds insulation and stability. A large, stiffened front flap draws tightly over a gateframe (hinged) inner opening to make packing effortless. It's a truly unique design that works well. The front rain flap secures using quick-release mechanisms on adjustable straps. The bags are adjustable up or down by means of the harness system that runs over the rear seat, and can be tightened and/or threaded through different rings on the saddlebag backs. Deluxe Rev-Packs attach to the bike using removable quick-release tabs. They are available in black for $155, or in 17 other colors for 10 percent more. For another few bucks foam shields are also available, with the receiving end of hook-and-loop fasteners already on the bags.\nRKA Standard Saddlebags $175\n12Hx15Lx8W -- 22.5 qt. ea -- 6 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nBy far the most tailored looking of the 12 bag sets featured here, the RKA Standards also have one of the largest capacities at 22.5 quarts. (RKA offers a larger and smaller version of this popular design, as well as custom colors and graphics.) The mounting system is unusual and perhaps the most solid of the bunch. Dual straps tighten down across the seat by mounting to the seat's lip and tightening with hook-and-loop closures. Next, connection straps snap to those semi-permanent straps. These secondary straps connect to the bags via quick-release buckles, so the bags can simply be unclipped for single removal or unsnapped for dual removal while the vital straps stay in place. This system is backed by easy-lock strap attachments to the rear pegs and an around-the-fender strap, as well. RKA bags zip open suitcase-style and feature adjustable retaining straps inside. Synthetic sheepskin is the only thing that touches your bike's finish. The going price of the standard bags in black is $175.\nRoadgear Jumbo Expedition Bags $220\n12Hx18Lx10W -- 40.8 qt ea. -- 2 anchor pts./bag -- 4 ext. pockets ea.\nAnd they are jumbo. Each of these bags will hold a whopping 40.8 quarts. That's enough room for five or six leather jackets, or say a small microwave oven. The three outer pockets will expand to nearly double their capacity when filled, thanks to expanding panels designed into the 1000-denier Cordura Plus fabric. (Roadgear suggests the forward-most pockets be used as dedicated rain cover holders.) The bags attach using removable nylon-loop straps to the rear footpegs and a quick-release nylon tail strap. Jumbo bags are adjustable to sit lower, flush with the passenger seat or raised two inches above it by threading the two hook-and-loop top harness straps through different D-rings on the upper inside panel of the bags. There are dual handholds on either side of the wide, double-zippered top flap for easy transport off the bike. All main pockets feature large, solid pull tabs on the two-way zippers for easy manipulation. These extra-large capacity saddlebags are ideal for a serious journey or travel with a passenger. Available in black, black and gray, or black and red. The Jumbos retail for a suggested price of $220.\nTeknic Saddlebags $100\n13Hx15Lx5-10W -- 35.2 qt. ea -- 4 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nThese 420-denier nylon, PVC-coated bags share an uncanny resemblance to the Motoport Duo bags. They are designed for immense loads when expanded to their maximum depth of 10 inches, holding approximately 35.2 quarts apiece. This is literally enough space for two full-face helmets. Inside of each nylon-lined bag is an independent, drawstring-closing, stuff sack for separating items. A wide hook-and-loop yoke over the seat joins the two saddlebags, and a four-point quick-release system secures them to the bike. An additional common strap is provided for carrying the bag over your shoulder. Closure is achieved via a wraparound zipper and two adjustable quick-release straps per bag. A spiral-type zipper system releases additional inches of cargo space. Other goodies include padded carrying handles and a reflective logo. Available in black, suggested retail $100.\nTour Master SB-34 $140\n12Hx15Lx6.5W -- 27.8 qt. ea. -- 4 anchor pts./bag -- 3 ext. pockets ea.\nCompact and versatile, the Tour Master bags offer 23.25 quarts of cargo space in their top-loading, dual-zippered main compartment and four and one-half quarts in an expandable outer pocket. There's an additional mesh pocket positioned piggyback on the side pouch. Included in the $140 suggested retail are Neoprene protection pads and rain covers. These Tour Master bags are made of heavy nylon, shaped with internal support panels and lined with soft tricot. Connection to the bike is achieved via removable loop straps with quick-release fasteners. Additional features include: removable support panels which line the upswept bottom and sides; hook-and-loop fastened nylon wraps for the dual carrying handles; and large zipper tabs -- including a cross-tie strip -- to make opening the main flap a cinch.\nWolfman Slash Saddlebags $129\n11Hx14Lx5.5W -- 16 qt. ea. -- 4 anchor pts./bag -- no ext. pockets\nThese bags have gained many improvements since our evaluation appeared in the April '97 issue. Instead of the thin nylon straps over the seat, Wolfman is now using a wide yoke secured with hook-and-loop material. The top-loading bags secure with zippers beneath large, shoebox-style, Cordura flaps. The flaps keep the weather out and cinch shut using quick-release clips on adjustable straps. Construction is of thick, weather-treated Cordura supported throughout by flexible plastic panels. Fleece cloth covers the portion of the bag which may come in contact with paint or chrome. The anchoring system consists of four adjustable clip-style straps fixed to the bags. If you're looking for compact saddlebags for toting things around town, the Slash set sells for around $129.\nRESOURCES\n"}, {"score": 597.3365, "uuid": "7cb828ee-7d2f-5cf9-8b03-9a8e6097ce1b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1614wb-51-22014", "target_hostname": "www.halfords.com", "target_uri": "http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_productId_729223_langId_-1_categoryId_236256", "page_rank": 1.1719515e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Halfords | BikeHut <em>Hard</em> Case Single Pannier", "snippet": "The BikeHut <em>Hard</em> Case Single Pannier has a rigid panel for extra content protection.", "explanation": null, "document": "Reserve online and collect in-store in only an hour\nFREE\nStandard delivery within 4 working days\nFREE\nOrder by 6pm for delivery tomorrow (Monday to Friday)\n\u00a35.99\nChoose your delivery Monday to Friday\n\u00a35.99\nOrder by 6pm Friday for delivery on Saturday\n\u00a39.99\nCollect In-Store\nIf the product you are looking at is in stock in your chosen store you can reserve it online and it will be ready to collect in only 1 hour.

Another question is where is the press?", "explanation": null, "document": "December 21, 2006\nActs Of War?\nIt would seem that the term \"porous borders\" when describing America's national boundaries, is a profound understatement .\nGun-toting members of the Mexican military are crossing regularly into U.S. territory, where they are partnering with drug cartels and criminal gangs to protect sophisticated smuggling operations, according to Texas sheriffs and lawmakers.\nHmmm. Given that our Democrat politicians and the MSM pounded the blame on President Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld for the misconduct of a few soldiers at Abu Graibh, they will prove beyond any shadow of a doubt their shameless hypocrisy if they don't give equal time to the president and military whip of Mexico, though I won't hold my breath -- even though these are, technically, invasions of our sovereign soil by the active duty military of a foreign country, things done against America seem to be \"okay\" with the left, it's only when the U.S. defends itself or attacks its enemies that they seem to have a problem.\nHowever, I digress.\nOn one occasion early this year, deputies in pursuit of suspected drug dealers encountered \"heavily armed soldiers in a Humvee,\" while trying to apprehend individuals driving \"load vehicles\" for drug shipments, Hudspeth Sheriff Arvin West told a congressional hearing subsequently.\nAlthough some of the narcotics were seized, the deputies were forced to suspend their pursuit once the Mexican soldiers intervened, according to West's testimony.\nSheriffs in neighboring parts of Texas are also familiar with the techniques used to protect drug shipments in Hudspeth.\nAccording to Sheriff Leo Samaniego of El Paso County, Mexican soldiers perform \"flanking maneuvers,\" forcing deputies into defensive positions.\n\"They are very involved in safeguarding these drug shipments,\" he said of the Mexican troops.\nSamaniego said he was in contact with farmers in the area who reported witnessing such incidents regularly.\nIt's bad enough that Mexicans are able to sneak across the border to violate our immigration policies, but armed troops in military vehicles? Making forays into our country across that same border, to interdict our own law enforcement people in the pursuit of their duties?\nWhile I acknowledge that there's little chance of a full scale invasion of the U.S. by Mexico, what is distressing is that our southern border is so ill secured that this could be happening not as isolated incidents, but on a routine basis. If Mexican troops can do this, consider how many satan worshippers Muslims could sneak in, loaded down with weaponry, over a period of days or weeks, to perpetrate one or more terrorism operations.\nPosted by Seth at December 21, 2006 10:27 AM\n"}, {"score": 593.9307, "uuid": "9084d03e-dd2c-54fa-8908-5eebca4ca131", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1713wb-82-21820", "target_hostname": "www.tripp.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.tripp.co.uk/offers/71-up-to-55-off-maisie-moo-soft-trendy-flower-print-cases-bags", "page_rank": 1.1940535e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Up to 55% off Maisie Moo <em>soft</em>, trendy flower print cases &amp; bags - Tripp", "snippet": "o Up to 75% off 2 wheel lightweight <em>suitcase</em> &amp; bag collection o Up to 60% off deconstructed, distinctive lightweight and durable luggage. o Up to 40% off great value <em>hard</em> 2 wheel <em>suitcases</em> View our special offers and promotions... more info Save up to 55% on the amazing Maisie Moo Flower Web collection", "explanation": null, "document": "Save up to 55% on the amazing Maisie Moo Flower Web collection.\nExplore the wild side of travel with this effortlessly cool, colourful & fun collection.
